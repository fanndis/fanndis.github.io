'''South Carolina''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-South Carolina.ogg|ˌ|k|ær|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|n|ə}}) is a state in the Southeastern [[United States]] and the easternmost of the [[Deep South]]. It is bordered to the north by [[North Carolina]], to the southeast by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the southwest by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] across the [[Savannah River]]. 

South Carolina became the eighth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] on May 23, 1788. It also became the first state to vote in favor of secession from the [[United States|Union]] on December 20, 1860. After the [[American Civil War]], it was readmitted into the United States on June 25, 1868.

South Carolina is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|40th most extensive]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|23rd most populous U.S. state]]. In 2019 its GDP was $249.9&nbsp;billion. South Carolina is composed of [[List of counties in South Carolina|46 counties]]. The capital is [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] with a population of 133,451 in 2018;<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/columbiacitysouthcarolina/PST045218 |title=QuickFacts: Columbia city, South Carolina |access-date=November 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611105511/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/columbiacitysouthcarolina/PST045218 |archive-date=June 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> while its largest city is [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] with a 2018 population of 136,208.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/charlestoncitysouthcarolina/PST045218 |title=QuickFacts: Charleston city, South Carolina |access-date=November 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331042617/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/charlestoncitysouthcarolina/PST045218 |archive-date=March 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Upstate South Carolina|Greenville–Anderson–Mauldin]] metropolitan area is the largest in the state, with a 2018 population estimate of 906,626.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/pickenscountysouthcarolina,laurenscountysouthcarolina,andersoncountysouthcarolina,greenvillecountysouthcarolina/PST045218 |title=QuickFacts: Pickens County, South Carolina; Laurens County, South Carolina; Anderson County, South Carolina; Greenville County, South Carolina |access-date=November 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106233847/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/pickenscountysouthcarolina,laurenscountysouthcarolina,andersoncountysouthcarolina,greenvillecountysouthcarolina/PST045218 |archive-date=November 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

South Carolina is named in honor of King [[Charles I of England]], who first formed the English colony, with ''Carolus'' being Latin for "Charles".<ref>{{cite book|last=N. C.

==Geography==

=== Regions ===
The state can be divided into three natural geographic areas which then can be subdivided into five distinct cultural regions. The natural environment is divided from east to west by the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], and the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. Culturally, the coastal plain is split into the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and the [[Pee Dee]] region. While, the upper [[Piedmont, South Carolina|Piedmont]] region is referred to as the Piedmont and the lower Piedmont region is referred to as the Midlands. The area surrounding the Blue Ridge Mountains is known as the [[Upstate South Carolina|Upstate]].<ref name="netstate">{{cite web|title=The Geography of South Carolina|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/sc_geography.htm|accessdate=17 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307115338/http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/sc_geography.htm|archive-date=March 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Atlantic Coastal Plain makes up two-thirds of the state. Its eastern border is the [[Sea Islands]], a chain of tidal and [[barrier islands]]. The border between the lowcountry and the upcountry is defined by the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]], which marks the limit of navigable rivers.

===Atlantic Coastal Plain===

{{main|South Carolina Lowcountry}}

The Atlantic Coastal Plain consists of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present. The terrain is relatively flat and the soil is composed predominantly of sand, silt, and clay. Areas with better drainage make excellent farmland, though some land is swampy. An unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of low-relief topographic depressions named [[Carolina bay]]s. The bays tend to be oval, lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation. The eastern portion of the coastal plain contains many [[salt marsh]]es and [[estuary|estuaries]], as well as natural ports such as [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the [[Middle Atlantic coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]].<ref name="ecoregions">{{cite journal|author1=Olson, D. M |author2=E. Dinerstein |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933–938 |url=http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |display-authors=etal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014034322/http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |archivedate=October 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The Sandhills or Carolina Sandhills is a {{convert|10–35|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide region within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, along the inland margin of this province. The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago. Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures and stronger winds.<ref>Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs, K.M., 2016, "The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States": Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286; www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research</ref>

===Piedmont===

Much of Piedmont consists of Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks, and the landscape has relatively low relief. Due to the changing economics of farming, much of the land is now reforested in [[loblolly pine]] for the lumber industry. These forests are part of the [[Southeastern mixed forests]] ecoregion.<ref name = "ecoregions"/> At the southeastern edge of Piedmont is the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], where rivers drop to the coastal plain. The fall line was an important early source of water power. Mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities, including the capital, [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line, providing a trade route for mill towns.

The northwestern part of Piedmont is also known as the Foothills. The [[South Carolina Highway 11|Cherokee Parkway]] is a scenic driving route through this area. This is where [[Table Rock State Park (South Carolina)|Table Rock State Park]] is located.

===Blue Ridge===

The Blue Ridge consists primarily of Precambrian metamorphic rocks, and the landscape has relatively high relief. The Blue Ridge Region contains an [[escarpment]] of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] that continues into [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]]. [[Sassafras Mountain]], South Carolina's highest point at {{convert|3560|ft|m}}, is in this area.<ref name="usgs">{{cite web|date=April 29, 2005 |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=U.S Geological Survey |accessdate=November 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116113632/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |archivedate=January 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Also in this area is [[Caesars Head State Park]].

===Earthquakes===
{{main|List of earthquakes in South Carolina}}
The Charleston area, along the central coastline of the state, demonstrates the greatest frequency of earthquakes in South Carolina. South Carolina averages 10–15 earthquakes a year below magnitude{{nbsp}}3 (FEMA). The [[1886 Charleston earthquake|Charleston earthquake of 1886]] was the largest quake ever to hit the eastern United States. The 7.0–7.3 magnitude earthquake killed 60 people and destroyed much of the city.<ref>Abridged from ''Seismicity of the United States, 1568–1989 (Revised)'', by Carl W. Stover and Jerry L. Coffman, U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1527, United States Government Printing Office, Washington: 1993.</ref> Faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them. Many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries.

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of South Carolina}} well south carolina is humid
South Carolina has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), although high-elevation areas in the Upstate area have fewer subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline. In the summer, South Carolina is hot and humid, with daytime temperatures averaging between {{convert|86|-|93|F|C}} in most of the state and overnight lows averaging {{convert|70|-|75|F|C}} on the coast and from {{convert|66|-|73|F|C}} inland. Winter temperatures are much less uniform in South Carolina.[[File:SCprecipitation.gif|thumb|left|A map of the average annual [[precipitation]] in South Carolina]]Coastal areas of the state have very mild winters, with high temperatures approaching an average of {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and overnight lows around 40&nbsp;°F (5–8&nbsp;°C). Inland, the average January overnight low is around {{convert|32|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in Columbia and temperatures well below freezing in the Upstate. While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state, the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer, while inland, the spring and autumn transitions tend to be the wettest periods and winter the driest season, with November being the driest month. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|113|F|C}} in [[Johnston, South Carolina|Johnston]] and Columbia on June 29, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-19|F|C}} at [[Caesars Head]] on January 21, 1985.

Snowfall in South Carolina is minimal in the lower elevation areas south and east of Columbia. It is not uncommon for areas along the southernmost coast to not receive measurable snowfall for several years. In the Piedmont and Foothills, especially along and north of Interstate 85, measurable snowfall occurs one to three times in most years. Annual average total amounts range from 2 to 6 inches. The Blue Ridge Escarpment receives the most average total measurable snowfall; amounts range from 7 to 12 inches.

South Carolina is also prone to [[tropical cyclone]]s and [[tornado]]es. Two of the strongest hurricanes to strike South Carolina in recent history were [[Hurricane Hazel]] (1954) and [[Hurricane Hugo]] (1989).
====Hurricanes and tropical cyclones====

[[File:Hurricane Hugo 1989 sept 21 1844Z.jpg|thumb|Category 4 Hurricane Hugo in 1989]]

The state is occasionally affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s. This is an annual concern during hurricane season, which lasts from June{{nbsp}}1 to November 30. The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October, during the [[Cape Verde hurricane]] season. Memorable [[hurricane]]s to hit South Carolina include [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] (1954), [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]] (2018), and [[Hurricane Hugo|Hugo]] (1989), all [[Category 4 hurricane]]s.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif NOAA National Climatic Data Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=October 16, 2011 }}. Retrieved on October 24, 2006.</ref>

South Carolina averages around 50 days of [[thunderstorm]] activity a year. This is less than some of the states further south, and it is slightly less vulnerable to [[tornado]]es than the states which border on the Gulf of Mexico. Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina, and the state averages around 14 tornadoes annually. [[Hail]] is common with many of the thunderstorms in the state, as there is often a marked contrast in temperature of warmer ground conditions compared to the cold air aloft.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes"/>

South Carolina's [[State governments of the United States|state government]] consists of the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. Also relevant are the state constitution, law enforcement agencies, federal representation, state finances, and state taxes.

South Carolina has historically had a weak executive branch and a strong legislature. Before 1865, governors in South Carolina were appointed by the General Assembly, and held the title "President of State". The 1865 Constitution changed this process, requiring a popular election. Local governments were also weak. But, the 1867 Constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]], extended democratization by establishing [[home rule]] for counties, which were established from the formerly designated districts of the state.

The 1895 state constitution overturned this, reducing the role of counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature; essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the General Assembly through the legislative delegation for each county.<ref name="governance"/> They are geographically comprehensive; all areas of the state are included in counties. As each county had one state senator, that position was particularly powerful. This status continued until 1973, when the state constitution was amended to provide for [[home rule]] for the counties. During this time the state had changed, with increasing urbanization, but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts.<ref name="Tyler 1998 p. 222">Tyler (1998), "The South Carolina Governance Project", p. 222</ref>

The federal court case, ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), "established the one-man, one-vote
concept for electoral representation at the state level. Legislators were now supposed to represent
more or less equal numbers of people."<ref name="Tyler 1998 p. 222"/> Residents of urban areas had been found to be markedly underrepresented in the legislature under the county-based system. Reapportionment made obvious the need for other changes to county structure, leading to the legislature passing the constitutional amendment. The Home Rule Act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties. With urbanization, their governments have become increasingly important in the state.<ref name="Tyler 1998 p. 222"/>

Several changes to the state constitution have affected the office of the governor and the cabinet. In 1926 the governor's term was extended from two to four years; in 1982 the governor was allowed to run for a second succeeding term. In 1993, the state passed an amendment requiring a limited cabinet (all of whom must be popularly elected).

As of January 2, 2016, there were 2,948,772 registered voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scvotes.org/cgi-bin/scsec/96vr?countykey=ALL&D1=ALL |title=South Carolina Voter Registration Demographics |publisher=South Carolina State Election Commission |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302041436/http://www.scvotes.org/cgi-bin/scsec/96vr?countykey=ALL&D1=ALL |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scvotes.org/statistics/voter_registration |title=Voter Registration ('By County and Precinct') |publisher=South Carolina State Election Commission |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304171428/http://scvotes.org/statistics/voter_registration |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of South Carolina}}

===Precolonial period===

There is evidence of human activity in the area about 40,000 years ago. At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end of the [[Pre-Columbian era]] around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the [[Cherokee]], and the [[Catawba people|Catawba]], and the total population being up to 20,000.<ref name=leifermann>{{cite book|last1=Liefermann|first1=Henry|last2=Horan|first2=Eric|title=South Carolina|date=2000|publisher=Compass American Guides|location=Oakland, CA|isbn=978-0-679-00509-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/compassamericang00henr/page/13 13–47, 252–254]|edition=3rd|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/compassamericang00henr/page/13}}</ref>

Up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] background. Along the [[Savannah River]] were the [[Apalachee]], [[Yuchi]], and the [[Yamasee]]. Further west were the Cherokee, and along the [[Catawba River]], the Catawba. These tribes were village-dwellers, relying on agriculture as their primary food source.<ref name="leifermann" /> The Cherokee lived in [[wattle and daub]] houses made with wood and clay, roofed with wood or [[Thatching|thatched]] grass.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reference.com/history/type-dwellings-did-cherokee-indians-live-a45ad525016b2b?qo=contentSimilarQuestions|title=What type of dwellings did the Cherokee Indians live in?|newspaper=Reference|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212163851/https://www.reference.com/history/type-dwellings-did-cherokee-indians-live-a45ad525016b2b?qo=contentSimilarQuestions|archive-date=February 12, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

About a dozen separate small tribes summered on the coast harvesting oysters and fish, and cultivating corn, peas and beans. Travelling inland as much as {{convert|50|mi|km}} mostly by canoe, they wintered on the coastal plain, hunting deer and gathering nuts and fruit. The names of these tribes survive in place names like [[Edisto Island, South Carolina|Edisto Island]], [[Kiawah Island, South Carolina|Kiawah Island]], and the [[Ashepoo River]].<ref name="leifermann" />

===Exploration===

The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. From June 24 to July 14, 1521, they explored the land around [[Winyah Bay]]. On October 8, 1526, they founded [[San Miguel de Gualdape]], near present-day [[Georgetown, South Carolina]]. It was the first European settlement in what is now [[Contiguous United States|mainland USA]]. Established with five hundred settlers, it was abandoned eight months later by one hundred and fifty survivors. In 1540, [[Hernando de Soto]] explored the region and the main town of [[Cofitachequi]], where he captured the queen of the [[Muscogee|Maskoki]] (Muscogee) and the [[Cherokee|Chelaque]] (Cherokee) who had welcomed him.
[[File:Floride francaise Pierre du Val.jpg|thumb|Later map of [[French Florida]]]]

In 1562 French [[Huguenot]]s established a settlement at what is now the [[Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site|Charlesfort-Santa Elena]] archaeological site on [[Parris Island, South Carolina|Parris Island]]. Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. The garrison lacked supplies, however, and the soldiers (as in the [[France Antarctique]]) soon ran away. The French returned two years later but settled in present-day Florida rather than South Carolina.<ref name="leifermann" />

===Colonization===

{{Main|Province of Carolina|Province of South Carolina}}
[[File:Wpdms carolina colony grant.png|thumb|The Carolina Colony grants of 1663 and 1665]]

Sixty years later, in 1629, King of England [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] established the [[Province of Carolina]], an area covering what is now South and [[North Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Tennessee]]. In 1663, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted the land to eight [[Lords Proprietors]] in return for their financial and political assistance in [[Restoration (1660)|restoring]] him to the throne in 1660.<ref>{{cite book|first=Danforth|last=Prince|title=Frommer's The Carolinas and Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43yVaZoByecC|date=10 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-03341-8|page=11|access-date=September 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427112527/https://books.google.com/books?id=43yVaZoByecC|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], one of the Lord Proprietors, planned the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]] and wrote the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]], which laid the basis for the future colony.<ref>Wilson, Thomas D.

Chapter 1.</ref> His [[utopia]] was inspired by [[John Locke]], an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of Liberalism".

The Carolina slave trade, which included both trading and direct raids by colonists,<ref name=Ethridge2010>{{cite book|last=Ethridge|first=R.|year=2010|title=From Chicaza to Chickasaw: The European Invasion and the Transformation of the Mississippian World, 1540-1715|location=United States|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn= 9780807899335}}</ref>{{rp|109}} was the largest among the British colonies in North America.<ref name=Ethridge2010/>{{rp|65}} Between 1670 and 1715, between 24,000 and 51,000 captive [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were exported from South Carolina — more than the number of Africans imported to the colonies of the future United States during the same period.<ref name="gallay">{{cite book|last=Gallay|first=Alan|author-link=Alan Gallay|year=2002|title=The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South 1670–1717|location=New York|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10193-7|page=299}}</ref><ref name=Ethridge2010/>{{rp|237}} Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to other U.S. colonies.<ref name="gallay" /> The historian [[Alan Gallay]] says, "the trade in Indian slaves was at the center of the English empire's development in the American South. The trade in Indian slaves was the most important factor affecting the South in the period 1670 to 1715".<ref name="gallay"/>

In the 1670s, English planters from [[Barbados]] established themselves near what is now Charleston. Settlers from all over Europe built rice plantations in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry]], east of the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]]. Plantation labor was done by African slaves who formed the majority of the population by 1720.<ref name="sc-lib">{{cite web|title=South Carolina Information: History and Culture|url=http://statelibrary.sc.libguides.com/sc-information/history-culture|website=SC State Library|accessdate=12 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213090530/http://statelibrary.sc.libguides.com/sc-information/history-culture|archive-date=February 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Another cash crop was the [[Indigofera|indigo plant]], a plant source of blue dye, developed by [[Eliza Lucas]].

Meanwhile, [[Upstate South Carolina]], west of the Fall Line, was settled by small farmers and traders, who displaced Native American tribes westward. Colonists overthrew the proprietors' rule, seeking more direct representation. In 1719, the colony was officially made a [[crown colony]]. In 1729, North Carolina was split off into a separate colony.

South Carolina prospered from the fertility of the lowcountry and the harbors, such as at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. It allowed religious toleration, encouraging settlement, and trade in deerskin, lumber, and beef thrived. Rice cultivation was developed on a large scale.

By the second half of the 1700s, South Carolina was one of the richest of the [[Thirteen Colonies]].<ref name="sc-lib"/>

===The American Revolution===

{{Main|South Carolina in the American Revolution|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War}}

On March 26, 1776, the colony adopted the [[Constitution of South Carolina]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/sc01.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Constitution of South Carolina – March 26, 1776 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date=June 30, 1906 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117080717/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/sc01.asp |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> electing [[John Rutledge]] as the state's first president.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), about a third of combat action took place in South Carolina,<ref name=gordon>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=John W.|title=South Carolina and the American Revolution : a battlefield history|date=2007|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia|isbn=978-1570036613|edition=Paperback}}</ref> more than in any other state.<ref name="sc-lib"/> Inhabitants of the state endured being invaded by British forces and an ongoing civil war between loyalists and partisans that devastated the backcountry.<ref name=gordon/> It is estimated 25,000 slaves (30% of those in South Carolina) fled, migrated or died during the war.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p.73</ref>

===Antebellum===

{{Main|Antebellum South Carolina}}
[[File:Millford Plantation HABS color 2.jpg|thumb|[[Millford Plantation]] (1839–41), an example of [[Greek Revival architecture]]]]

America's first census in 1790 put the state's population at nearly 250,000. By the 1800 census, the population had increased 38 per cent to nearly 340,000 of which 146,000 were slaves. At that time South Carolina had the largest population of Jews in the 16 United States, mostly based in Savannah and Charleston,<ref name=har>[http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/01/a-portion-of-the-people.html Nell Porter Brown, "A 'portion of the People'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904052526/https://harvardmagazine.com/2003/01/a-portion-of-the-people.html |date=September 4, 2018 }}", ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', January–February 2003</ref> the latter being the country's fifth largest city.<ref>{{cite web|title=POP Culture: 1800|url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts/1800_fast_facts.html|website=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=14 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009050257/https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts/1800_fast_facts.html|archive-date=October 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the Antebellum period (before the Civil War) the state's economy and population grew. Cotton became an important crop after the invention of the [[cotton gin]]. While nominally democratic, from 1790 until 1865, wealthy landowners were in control of South Carolina. For example, a man was not eligible to sit in the State House of Representatives unless he possessed an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 Negroes, or at least 150 pounds sterling, diminishing the electorate. Further, the state maintained indirect [[Unites States electoral college|election of electors]] by the [[South Carolina state legislature|state legislature]] until 1868, the last state to do so. Voters thus did not participate in presidential elections, other than through state-wide elections.<ref>{{cite web|title=South Carolina Constitution of 1790|url=http://www.carolana.com/SC/Documents/sc_constitution_1790.html|accessdate=14 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214181241/http://www.carolana.com/SC/Documents/sc_constitution_1790.html|archive-date=February 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], the new state capital was founded in the center of the state, and the State Legislature first met there in 1790. The town grew after it was connected to Charleston by the [[Santee Canal]] in 1800, one of the first canals in the United States.

As dissatisfaction with the federal government grew, in the 1820s [[John C. Calhoun]] became a leading proponent of [[states' rights]], [[limited government]], [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification of the U.S. Constitution]], and [[free trade]]. In 1832, the [[Ordinance of Nullification]] declared federal tariff laws unconstitutional and not to be enforced in the state, leading to the [[Nullification Crisis]]. The federal [[Force Bill]] was enacted to use whatever military force necessary to enforce federal law in the state, bringing South Carolina back into line.

In the [[1860 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 1860]], voting was sharply divided, with the south voting for the [[Southern Democrats]] and the north for [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Lincoln was anti-slavery, did not acknowledge the right to [[Secession in the United States|secession]], and would not yield federal property in Southern states. Southern secessionists believed Lincoln's election meant long-term doom for their slavery-based agrarian economy and social system.<ref>[[Avery Craven]], [http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-growth-of-southern-nationalism-1848-1861/ ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism, 1848–1861''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525205452/http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-growth-of-southern-nationalism-1848-1861/ |date=May 25, 2017 }}, 1953. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-0006-6}}, p. 391, 394, 396.</ref>

Lincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860. The state House of Representatives three days later passed the "Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President a Hostile Act",<ref>{{cite web|title=Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President a Hostile Act, 9 November 1860|url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/ttrove/ResolutiontocalltheelectionofAbrahamLincolnaHostileActNovember1860.html|website=Teaching American History in South Carolina|accessdate=14 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301220726/http://www.teachingushistory.org/tTrove/ResolutiontocalltheelectionofAbrahamLincolnaHostileActNovember1860.html|archive-date=March 1, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and within weeks South Carolina became the first state to [[Secession in the United States|secede]].<ref name="sc-lib"/>

===Civil War 1861–1865===

On April 12, 1861, Confederate (southern) batteries began shelling the Union (northern) [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston Harbor, and the [[American Civil War]] began. In November of that year the Union attacked [[Port Royal Sound]] and soon occupied [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort County]] and the neighboring [[Sea Islands]]. For the rest of the war this area served as a Union base and staging point for other operations. Whites abandoned their plantations,<ref name="palm-hist"/> leaving behind about ten thousand slaves. Several Northern charities partnered with the federal government to help these people run the cotton farms themselves under the [[Port Royal Experiment]]. Workers were paid by the pound harvested and thus became the first former slaves freed by the Union forces to earn wages.<ref name="vcu">{{cite web|title=The Port Royal Experiment (1862–1865)|url=http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/port-royal-experiment/|website=Virginia Commonwealth University|accessdate=15 February 2017|date=2014-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215124037/http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/port-royal-experiment/|archive-date=February 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the end of the war in early 1865, the troops of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] marched across the state devastating plantations and most of Columbia.

===Reconstruction 1865–1877===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}

After the war, South Carolina was restored to the United States during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Under presidential Reconstruction (1865–66), [[freedmen]] (former slaves) were given limited rights. Under Radical reconstruction (1867–1877), a Republican coalition of freedmen, [[carpetbaggers]] and [[scalawag]]s was in control, supported by Union Army forces. They established public education, welfare institutions, and [[home rule]] for counties, expanding democracy.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In ''[[Texas vs. White]]'' (1869), the Supreme Court ruled the ordinances of secession (including that of South Carolina) were invalid, and thus those states had never left the Union. However, South Carolina did not regain representation in Congress until that date.

Until the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], South Carolina's legislature, not the voters, chose the state's electors for the presidential election. South Carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner. On October 19, 1871, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] suspended [[habeas corpus]] in nine South Carolina counties under the authority of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]].<ref name="McFeely pp. 367-374">McFeely (1981), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 367–374</ref> Led by Grant's Attorney General [[Amos T. Akerman]], hundreds of Klansmen were arrested while 2,000 Klansmen fled the state.<ref name="McFeely pp. 367-374"/> This was done to suppress Klan violence against African-American and white voters in the South.<ref name="McFeely pp. 367-374"/> In the mid to late 1870s, white Democrats used paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] to intimidate and terrorize black voters. They regained political control of the state under conservative white "[[Redeemers]]" and pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]]. In 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the [[Compromise of 1877]] that ended Reconstruction.

===Populist and agrarian movements===

The state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the Populist and Agrarian movements of the 1890s. A Republican-Populist biracial coalition took power away from White Democrats temporarily. To prevent that from happening again, Democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 which effectively [[Disfranchisement#United States|disenfranchised]] almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency, and [[literacy test]]s that dramatically reduced the voter rolls. By 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls, although they constituted a majority of the state's population.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H.

The 1895 constitution overturned local representative government, reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government, effectively ruled by the General Assembly, through the legislative delegations for each county. As each county had one state senator, that person had considerable power. The counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975.<ref name="governance">[http://www.charlestoncounty.org/MAP/FinalReport/pages219-238.pdf Charlie B.

Governor [[Ben Tillman|"Pitchfork Ben Tillman"]], a Populist, led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites, although he controlled Democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers. During the constitutional convention in 1895, he supported another man's proposal that the state adopt a [[one-drop rule]], as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known African ancestry.

Some members of the convention realized prominent white families with some African ancestry could be affected by such legislation. In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal (which was dropped), George Dionysius Tillman said in opposition:
<blockquote>If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in [[Aiken County, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[Barnwell County, South Carolina|Barnwell]], [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton]], and [[Orangeburg County, South Carolina|Orangeburg]] will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of{{nbsp}}... colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.<ref>"All Niggers, More or Less!"

The state postponed such a one-drop law for years. Virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924, forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white.

Early in the 20th century, South Carolina developed a thriving textile industry. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century; and created tourism industries. During the early part of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs, opportunities and relative freedom in U.S. cities outside the former Confederate states. In total from 1910 to 1970, 6.5&nbsp;million blacks left the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. By 1930 South Carolina had a white majority<ref name="info">[http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/us/south-carolina-history.html "South Carolina: The Decline of Agriculture and the Rise of Jim Crowism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210220713/http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/us/south-carolina-history.html |date=December 10, 2014 }}, infoplease (''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia''), 2012</ref> for the first time since 1708.

South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] (1920) giving women the right to vote. The South Carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on July 1, 1969.
