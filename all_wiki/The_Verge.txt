== Controversy ==
In September 2018, ''The Verge'' published the article "How to Build a Custom PC for Editing, Gaming or Coding" and uploaded a video to [[YouTube]] entitled "How we Built a $2000 Custom Gaming PC", which was criticized for containing errors on almost every step presented by the video's reporter, Stefan Etienne,<ref name="Ars" /> including but not limited to: [[Power supply unit (computer)|PSU]] being installed in the wrong direction, hammering the I/O shield to the case, and saying that LEDs are the main reason to buy [[RAM]]. After initially disabling comments, ''The Verge'' removed the video, though reuploads exist.

In February 2019, lawyers from ''The Verge''{{'}}s parent company [[Vox Media]] filed a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] takedown notice, requesting YouTube remove videos critical of ''The Verge''{{'}}s video, alleging copyright infringement. YouTube took down two of the videos, uploaded by YouTube channels BitWit and ReviewTechUSA, while applying a copyright "strike" to these two channels.<ref name="Ars" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Verge-issues-copyright-claims-against-multiple-YouTube-videos-criticizing-its-infamous-PC-build-video.407746.0.html |title=The Verge issues copyright claims against multiple YouTube videos criticizing its infamous PC build video |last=Medley |first=Sam |date=February 15, 2019 |publisher=Notebookcheck |access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> YouTube reinstated the two videos and retracted the copyright "strikes" after a request from Verge editor Nilay Patel, although Patel acknowledged that he agreed with the legal argument that led to their removal.<ref name="nilaypatel">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/15/18226105/a-note-about-youtube-copyright-strikes-from-vox-media |title=A note about YouTube copyright strikes from Vox Media  |last=Patel |first=Nilay |date=February 15, 2019 |website=[[The Verge]] |access-date=2020-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Knight |first1=Shawn |title=Vox Media targets YouTuber that parodied The Verge's terrible PC build video|publisher=TechSpot |date=February 14, 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/78757-vox-media-targets-youtuber-parodied-verge-terrible-pc.html |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref> 

Timothy B. Lee of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' described this controversy as an example of the [[Streisand effect]], saying that while law regarding [[fair use]] is unclear regarding this type of situation, "the one legal precedent ... suggests ... that this kind of video is solidly within the bounds of copyright's fair use doctrine."<ref name="Ars">{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/02/the-verge-briefly-censored-youtubers-who-mocked-its-bad-pc-building-advice/ |title=Vox lawyers briefly censored YouTubers who mocked ''The Verge's'' bad PC build advice |last=Lee |first=Timothy B. |date=February 20, 2019 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>
