Hammond was appointed [[Secretary of State for Transport]] following the formation of the coalition government on 12 May 2010, a position he held until 14 October 2011.

On 28 September 2011, the government initiated a consultation on plans to raise the [[Road speed limits in the United Kingdom|speed limit]] on [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorways]] from 70&nbsp;mph to 80&nbsp;mph, with a view to introducing the new limit in 2013.<ref name=bbc-20110930>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15123169 |title=80mph motorway speed limit plan criticised |work=BBC News |date=30 September 2011 |access-date=15 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421030932/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15123169 |archive-date=21 April 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/29/speed-limit-raised-80mph|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Allegra|last=Stratton|title=Government plans to raise speed limit to 80mph|date=29 September 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818170407/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/29/speed-limit-raised-80mph|archive-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> However, following criticism, including that modelling predicted a 20+% increase in motorway deaths and would alienate women voters, the plans were dropped by his successor.<ref name=guardian-20111225>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/25/80mph-speed-limit-increase-deaths |title=80mph speed limit 'would increase deaths by 20%' |first=Peter |last=Walker |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 December 2011 |access-date=13 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826020237/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/25/80mph-speed-limit-increase-deaths |archive-date=26 August 2016 }}</ref><ref name=telegraph-20130622>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/10136108/Ministers-abandon-plans-for-80mph-motorway-speed-limit.html |title=Ministers abandon plans for 80mph motorway speed limit |first=Alice |last=Philipson |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=22 June 2013 |access-date=15 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920110848/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/10136108/Ministers-abandon-plans-for-80mph-motorway-speed-limit.html |archive-date=20 September 2016 }}</ref>

In January 2012, the Ministry of Defence cut 4,200 jobs in a second round of armed forces redundancies. The Army would see up to 2,900 job cuts, including 400 Gurkhas, while the RAF would lose up to 1,000 members and the Royal Navy up to 300.{{Update inline|date=July 2016}} The job losses would account for some of the cuts under the defence review – intended to help plug the £38&nbsp;billion hole in the defence budget. Hammond said the Government had "no choice but to reduce the size of the armed forces – while reconfiguring them to ensure they remain agile, adaptable and effective".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16588436|work=BBC News|title=MoD announces details of 4,200 job cuts|date=17 January 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729181107/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16588436|archive-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>

The £38&nbsp;billion "black hole" in  Ministry of Defence finances had been "dealt with" and the department's "hand to mouth existence would come to an end", Hammond stated in February 2012. Ministers had even found £2.1&nbsp;billion to be allocated to several major spending projects to be introduced in the coming weeks. The money was to come from a combination of cuts over the previous two years, bargaining with industry suppliers and a one per cent increase in the equipment budget.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9086975/MoD-balances-books-first-time-in-four-decades-Defence-Secretary-to-announce.html |title=MoD balances books first time in four decades, Defence Secretary to announce |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403194521/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9086975/MoD-balances-books-first-time-in-four-decades-Defence-Secretary-to-announce.html |archive-date=3 April 2016 }}</ref>

In February 2012, Hammond said that the [[Falkland Islands]] did not face a "current credible military threat" from Argentina. He added that Britain had "no desire or intention to increase the heat" surrounding their sovereignty. Speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] he said "despite media speculation to the contrary, there has been no recent change to force levels", adding "there is no evidence of any current credible military threat to the security of the Falkland Islands and therefore no current plan for significant changes to force deployments."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9094677/Argentina-does-not-pose-threat-to-Falklands-says-Philip-Hammond.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Robert |last=Winnett |title=Argentina does not pose threat to Falklands, says Philip Hammond |date=21 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804151400/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9094677/Argentina-does-not-pose-threat-to-Falklands-says-Philip-Hammond.html |archive-date=4 August 2016 }}</ref>

In August 2012, Hammond cut senior positions within the "top-heavy" military by a quarter. Around 26 civilian and military head office posts would go and a new senior structure would come in from April 2013. The move was expected to save the Ministry of Defence around £3.8&nbsp;million a year. Hammond said one in four posts from the ranks of [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]], [[brigadier]], [[air commodore]] and above would go.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19312384|work=BBC News|title=Military's 'top-heavy' command to be cut by a quarter|date=19 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205160039/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19312384|archive-date=5 December 2015}}</ref>

Four weeks before the London [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 2012]], the security company [[G4S]] could not provide the number of security staff it had originally undertaken to deploy for the games.

On 15 July 2014, Hammond was appointed [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign
and Commonwealth Secretary]]. Newspapers highlighted his "[[Eurosceptic]]" credentials, and his confidence that Britain could "get a deal" on reforming the European Union. He said that he would vote in a putative referendum for a [[British exit from the European Union]] unless there were changes in the relationship,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10969136/Philip-Hammond-I-am-serious-about-reforming-EU.html |title=Philip Hammond: I am serious about reforming EU |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808045627/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10969136/Philip-Hammond-I-am-serious-about-reforming-EU.html |archive-date=8 August 2016 }}</ref> but following David Cameron's renegotiation, he supported the [[Remain campaign]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35616946 |title=EU vote: Where the cabinet and other MPs stand |work=BBC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003020914/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35616946 |archive-date=3 October 2017 }}</ref>

In August 2014, Hammond said he was surprised at the sudden resignation of [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi]], who wrote of "great unease" under his leadership of the Foreign office.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11014260/How-Baroness-Warsis-resignation-letter-lifts-a-lid-on-frustrations-in-the-Coalition.html |title=How Baroness Warsi's resignation letter lifts a lid on frustrations in the Coalition |last1=Hope |first1=Christopher |date=5 August 2014 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |access-date=5 August 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805182949/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11014260/How-Baroness-Warsis-resignation-letter-lifts-a-lid-on-frustrations-in-the-Coalition.html |archive-date=5 August 2014 }}</ref>

In October 2015, Justice Secretary [[Michael Gove]] cancelled a £5.9&nbsp;million contract to provide services for prisons in the [[Saudi Arabia]], saying "the British government should not be assisting a regime that uses beheadings, stoning, crucifixions and lashings as forms of punishment." Foreign Secretary Hammond accused Gove of "naivety".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/13/saudi-prisons-contract-gove-and-hammond-clash-over-deal |title= Saudi prisons contract: Gove and Hammond clash over deal |newspaper= The Guardian |location= London |date= 13 October 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160401072641/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/13/saudi-prisons-contract-gove-and-hammond-clash-over-deal |archive-date= 1 April 2016 }}</ref>

In November 2015, Hammond was criticised for accepting a watch worth £1,950 from a Saudi businessman called Sheikh Marei Mubarak Mahfouz bin Mahfouz. The watch was given as a gift after the unveiling of a statue of [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of [[Magna Carta]]. Ministers are not allowed to accept gifts worth more than £140 but Hammond claims he was advised that the event was a constituency one, not a ministerial one, and therefore the rules for ministers did not apply to him on that day. Labour MP [[John Mann (British politician)|John Mann]] was among those who criticised Hammond. "What on earth was he doing?" Mann asked, "No MP should be accepting watches worth nearly £2,000 as a gift. He should now give it to charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/National/article1639048.ece|title=Saudi gift row engulfs minister|first=Jon|last=Ungoed-Thomas|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207112928/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/National/article1639048.ece|archive-date=7 February 2017 }}</ref>"

Hammond had backed Remain in the [[Brexit referendum]], but confirmed he would support the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, saying  "No ifs, no buts, no second referendums.

Following the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Hammond suggested that he may ease up on [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] in the coming autumn budget. Hammond said, “Obviously we are not deaf. We heard a message last week in the general election and we need to look at how we deal with the challenges we face in the economy. I understand that people are weary after years of hard work to rebuild the economy after the great crash of 2008–09, but we have to live within our means. (...) We have never said we won’t raise some taxes.”<ref name="auto"/>

In June 2017 speech, Hammond said that a Brexit deal that puts jobs and prosperity first is the only way the UK will be able to deliver the strong growth that will enable it finally to escape from the long years of austerity, the chancellor has said. In his strongest call yet for a managed approach, Hammond said a comprehensive trade agreement, a transitional deal after the 2019 deadline for the end of talks, and a commitment to keep borders open should form a three-point Brexit plan for Britain. There would be “audible sighs of relief”, he said, if the talks that ended with a business-friendly agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/chancellor-philip-hammond-brexit-deal-jobs-prosperity-first |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 July 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707050717/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/chancellor-philip-hammond-brexit-deal-jobs-prosperity-first |archive-date=7 July 2017 }}</ref>

In November 2017, Hammond said in an interview on ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', whilst talking about possible unemployment that comes with driver-less vehicles, AI and robots, that the development of personal computers meant that there was no longer any need for shorthand typists. He then asked in reference to his previous comment: "Where are all these unemployed people? There are no unemployed people." This was immediately noticed by the media, as there are roughly 1.42 million unemployed with more underemployed. This led to accusations that Hammond is out of touch with reality.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/19/there-are-no-unemployed-in-uk-says-philip-hammond-tv-gaffe There are no unemployed in UK, says Hammond in TV gaffe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119122632/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/19/there-are-no-unemployed-in-uk-says-philip-hammond-tv-gaffe |date=19 November 2017 }} ''[[The Observer]]''.</ref> Later in the same programme, he clarified his remarks, and again on ''[[Peston on Sunday]]'', acknowledging on both occasions the real number of unemployed people in the UK.

On 22 November 2017, he presented his second budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-2017-documents|title=Autumn Budget 2017: documents – GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=23 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123010230/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-2017-documents|archive-date=23 November 2017}}</ref>
In January 2018, senior [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs mounted pressure on [[Theresa May]] to sack him as Chancellor following his recent comments about [[Brexit]], which were deemed too [[europhile|europhilic]] in nature.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/01/28/theresa-may-faces-mounting-calls-sack-philip-hammond-amid-tory/|title=Theresa May's 'tortoise' leadership openly criticised by Tory MPs on all sides of her party|first=Steven|last=Swinford|date=28 January 2018|access-date=28 January 2018|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

In 2019 Hammond responded to the report by the UN's rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. The report argued that 14 million people in the UK live in poverty and 1.5 million are destitute. It claimed the government's policies were "punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous". Hammond said he "rejects the idea that there are vast numbers of people facing dire poverty in this country. I don’t accept the UN rapporteur’s report at all. I think that’s a nonsense. Look around you; that’s not what we see in this country."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/03/philip-hammond-accused-of-being-blind-to-scale-of-uk-poverty]</ref>

In July 2019, with the expectation that [[Boris Johnson]] would become Prime Minister, Hammond asserted that he would work to avoid an immediate exit from the EU.<ref>Boffey, Daniel, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/philip-hammond-signals-he-could-vote-to-bring-down-boris-johnson-no-deal-brexit?CMP=GTUS_email Philip Hammond signals he could vote to bring down Boris Johnson]'', The Guardian, Friday, 19 July 2019</ref> In an interview on ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'' he said he planned to tender his resignation to [[Theresa May]] on 24 July immediately after [[Prime Minister's Questions]] but before May stood down. He stated that should he be part of the Johnson Cabinet he would be required to support a no-deal Brexit, not something he "could never sign up to".<ref name=":0" /> He submitted his resignation to May stating that her successor "must be free to choose a Chancellor who is fully aligned with his policy position".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PhilipHammondUK/status/1154006191468666881|title=I have just handed in my resignation to @theresa_may.

== Conservative Backbencher and Independent ==
In August 2019, Hammond, and a number of other Conservative MPs including former Cabinet ministers [[Rory Stewart]] and [[David Gauke]], wrote a letter to the Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]], accusing him of "ruining" any chance of a new deal with European Union by setting "the bar on his red lines so high".<ref name="Red Lines">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/13/no-deal-brexit-would-be-a-betrayal-says-philip-hammond|publisher=Guardian|author=Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot|date=13 August 2019|access-date=17 August 2019|title=No-deal Brexit would be a betrayal, says Philip Hammond}}</ref> According to ''[[The Times]]'', Hammond and several other remain supporters aimed at an extension to [[Withdrawal from the European Union|Article 50]] with EU leaders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/philip-hammonds-remainers-to-plot-brexit-delay-with-eu-leaders-bbsp85c7x|title=Philip Hammond's Remainers to plot Brexit delay with EU leaders|last=Kate&nbsp;Devlin|first=Steven Swinford|date=23 August 2019|work=The Times|access-date=24 August 2019|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

On 3 September 2019, Hammond led 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/03/commons-showdown-looms-in-battle-over-no-deal-brexit-live?page=with:block-5d6ed2f58f0845a5dab7cc88#block-5d6ed2f58f0845a5dab7cc88, MPs back move to allow bill to block no-deal Brexit by majority of 27</ref> The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition against a Conservative motion, which subsequently failed.

Hammond did not contest the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], as he would be a "direct challenge" to the Conservative party.<ref name=BBC5Nov2019/> If he or the other rebel MPs had decided to run for re-election, the party would have blocked their selection as Conservative candidates.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> Hammond later suggested that "the Conservative Party has been taken over by unelected advisors, entryists and usurpers who are trying to turn it from a broad church into an extreme right-wing faction", and that "it is not the party I joined."<ref>Philip Hammond.

==Later career==
[[Boris Johnson]] nominated Hammond for a peerage in February 2020, along with [[Kenneth Clarke]], who also had the Conservative whip removed. According to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', a cabinet minister criticised the decision to award Hammond a seat in the House of Lords, saying he "tried to bring down the government".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/06/cabinet-backlash-philip-hammond-peerage-minister-says-tried/|title=Cabinet backlash over Philip Hammond peerage as minister says he 'tried to bring down the government'|work=The Telegraph|last=Mikhailova|first=Anna|date=6 February 2020|access-date=1 August 2020}}</ref>

On 13 July 2020, according to documents from the [[Advisory Committee on Business Appointments]], which oversees business appointments for former ministers, Hammond would be taking up a paid, part-time role as an advisor to Saudi Arabia's [[Ministry of Finance (Saudi Arabia)|Minister of Finance]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=13 July 2020|title=Revealed: Philip Hammond becomes Saudi advisor|work=The Spectator|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/philip-hammond-becomes-saudi-advisor|access-date=1 August 2020}}</ref>

Hammond was created '''Baron Hammond of Runnymede''', ''of Runnymede in the County of Surrey'', by Letters Patent dated 30 September 2020.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28398|date=2 October 2020|page=1610|city=e}}</ref>

==Political positions==

===2008 financial crisis===
In May 2012, Hammond said that banks were not solely responsible for [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|the 2008 financial crisis]] as "they had to lend to someone". Hammond said that people who took out loans were "consenting adults", who in some cases were now seeking to blame others for their actions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9244414/Families-must-accept-share-of-blame-for-Britains-woes.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=James|last=Kirkup|title=Families must accept share of blame for Britain's woes|date=3 May 2012|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717193954/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9244414/Families-must-accept-share-of-blame-for-Britains-woes.html|archive-date=17 July 2016}}</ref>

===Same-sex marriage===
In May 2012, Hammond said [[same-sex marriage]] is "too controversial".<ref name='pinknews'>{{cite web |title=Exclusive: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond links incest with same-sex marriage |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/01/28/exclusive-defence-secretary-philip-hammond-links-incest-with-same-sex-marriage/ |website=Pink News |access-date=19 February 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219122951/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/01/28/exclusive-defence-secretary-philip-hammond-links-incest-with-same-sex-marriage/ |archive-date=19 February 2015 |date=28 January 2013 }}</ref> In January 2013 during a visit to [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], he bracketed the tabled legislation, which was passed afterwards, alongside socially unacceptable relationships, at the upper scale of which he stated was the criminal offence of [[incest]]. Asked by ''[[PinkNews]]'' to clarify his remarks, Hammond wrote by email: "The discussion ranged very widely and was not limited to same sex relationships".<ref name='pinknews'/>

In May 2013, Hammond abstained as one of four Cabinet Ministers not to vote in favour of same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wigmore |first=Tim |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/05/philip-hammond-taken-task-over-anti-gay-rights-record |title=Philip Hammond taken to task over anti-gay rights record |work=New Statesman |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=8 September 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517183419/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/05/philip-hammond-taken-task-over-anti-gay-rights-record |archive-date=17 May 2015 }}</ref> Hammond was openly critical of the then Prime Minister David Cameron's approach to the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] and said in November 2013 that he was "shocked" by the speed with which it was pushed through and that it was "damaging" to the Conservative Party.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10435540/Legalising-same-sex-marriage-was-damaging-for-Tories-Philip-Hammond-says.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Steven | last=Swinford | title=Legalising same-sex marriage was 'damaging' for Tories, Philip Hammond says | date=8 November 2013 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925123035/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10435540/Legalising-same-sex-marriage-was-damaging-for-Tories-Philip-Hammond-says.html | archive-date=25 September 2015 }}</ref>
