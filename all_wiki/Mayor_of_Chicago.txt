The '''mayor of Chicago''' is the [[Chief executive officer|chief executive]] of city [[Government of Chicago|government]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the [[List of United States cities by population|third-largest city]] in the [[United States]]. The mayor is responsible for the administration and management of various city departments, submits proposals and recommendations to the [[Chicago City Council]], is active in the enforcement of the city's ordinances, submits the city's annual budget and appoints city officers, department commissioners or directors, and members of city boards and commissions. 

During sessions of the city council, the mayor serves as the presiding officer. The mayor is not allowed to vote on issues except in certain instances, most notably where the vote taken on a matter before the body results in a tie.

The office of mayor was created when Chicago became a city in 1837.

==Appointment powers==
The mayor appoints the commissioner of the [[Chicago Fire Department]] and superintendent of the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He or she also appoints the heads of other departments,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-announces-key-hires-for-her-new-administration-some-rahm-emanuel-appointees-will-stay/ar-AABHV2Y |title=Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announces key hires for her new administration, some Rahm Emanuel appointees will stay |last=Pratt |first=Gregory |date=May 22, 2018 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2019-05-22 |via=MSN}}</ref> the largest of which are the Water Management Department (formed by the consolidation of the former Water Department and Sewer Department under [[Richard M. Daley]]), and the Streets & Sanitation Department. He or she also appoints members to the boards of several [[Special_district_(United_States)|special-purpose governmental bodies]] including the [[Chicago Park District]], [[Chicago Public Library]], [[Chicago Housing Authority]], [[Chicago Transit Authority]], and the [[Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority]]. Under [[Richard M. Daley]], the [[Illinois General Assembly|Illinois legislature]] granted the mayor power to appoint the governing board and chief executive officer of the [[Chicago Public Schools]] and subordinated the district to the mayor; the district had long been an independent unit of government.

The [[Chicago City Clerk]] and [[City Treasurer of Chicago]] are elected separately, as are the 50 aldermen who form the city council. The mayor is empowered, however, to fill vacancies in any of these 52 elected offices by appointment. In turn, the city council elects one of its own to fill a mayoral vacancy.

==Election and succession==
{{see main|Mayoral elections in Chicago}}

The mayor of Chicago is elected by popular vote every four years, on the last Tuesday in February. A run-off election, in the event that no candidate garners more than fifty percent of the vote, is held on the first Tuesday in April. The election is held on a [[nonpartisan|non-partisan]] basis. Chicago is the largest city in the United States not to [[term limit|limit the term]] of service for its mayor.

In accordance with Illinois law,<ref>{{cite web |title=65 ILCS 20/21-5.1 |url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/006500200K21-5.1.htm |website=www.ilga.gov |publisher=Government of Illinois |access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="clerkabout">{{cite web |title=About City Government & the Chicago City Council |url=https://www.chicityclerk.com/city-council-news-central/council-agenda |website=City Clerk of Chicago |access-date=1 March 2020 |language=en |date=21 September 2015}}</ref> the city council elects a vice mayor who serves as interim mayor in the event of a vacancy in the office of the mayor or the inability of the mayor to serve due to illness or injury, until the city council elects one of its members [[acting (law)|acting]] mayor or until the mayoral term expires.<ref name="clerkabout"/> As of May 2019, the current vice mayor is [[Tom Tunney]].<ref name=tunneyvice1>{{Cite web |url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2019/5/17/18629590/lori-lightfoot-chicago-city-council-committee-leadership |title=Lightfoot shakes up the City Council |last=Spielman |first=Fran |date=2019-05-17 |website=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=2019-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522095056/https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2019/5/17/18629590/lori-lightfoot-chicago-city-council-committee-leadership |archive-date=2019-05-22 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, if a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor with more than 28 months remaining in the mayoral term and at least 130 days before the next general municipal election, then a special election must be held to choose a new mayor to serve out the remainder of the term at that general municipal election; if a vacancy occurs with fewer than 28 months remaining in the mayoral term or fewer than 130 days before the next general municipal election, then the acting mayor serves as mayor until the mayoral term expires.

The order-of succession involving the vice mayor was made concrete following disputes that arose in the aftermath of the [[death in office]] of [[Richard J. Daley]], and was subsequently implemented following the death in office of [[Harold Washington]], which saw Vice Mayor [[David Orr]] become acting mayor.<ref name="wilsonfrost">{{cite web |last1=Pratt |first1=Gregory |title=Wilson Frost remembered: ‘He should’ve been Chicago’s first black mayor’ |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-death-wilson-frost-20180506-story.html |website=chicagotribune.com |publisher=Chicago Tribune |access-date=1 March 2020 |date=7 May 2018}}</ref> Prior to this, the city had vague succession laws which indicated that the president pro tempore of the City Council would succeed as mayor.

[[Mayoral elections in Chicago#City Council-appointed mayors|Six instances]] have seen the City Council appoint either an acting mayor, acting mayor pro tempore, or interim mayor.

In the absence of the mayor during meetings of the city council, the president pro tempore of the city council, who is a member of and elected by the city council, acts as presiding officer. Unlike the mayor, the president pro tempore can vote on all legislative matters. If neither the mayor nor pro tempore can preside, the vice mayor presides.<ref name=krebs>{{cite web |last1=Krebs |first1=Timothy B. |title=MONEY AND MACHINE POLITICS An Analysis of Corporate and Labor Contributions in Chicago City Council Elections |url=https://pols.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/273/2018/10/p_moneyandmachinepolitics.pdf |access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>

==History==
The first mayor was [[William Butler Ogden]]. 45 men and two women ([[Jane Byrne]], 1979&ndash;1983, [[Lori Lightfoot]], 2019&ndash;), have held the office.  Two sets of father and son have been elected Mayor of Chicago: [[Carter Harrison, Sr.]] (1893) and [[Carter Harrison, Jr.]] (1897&ndash;1905, 1911&ndash;1915), as well as [[Richard J. Daley]] (1955&ndash;1976) and [[Richard M. Daley]] (1989&ndash;2011). Carter Harrison, Jr. was the first mayor to have been born in the city. As an interim mayor, [[David Duvall Orr]] had the shortest mayoral term. Richard M. Daley was elected six times becoming Chicago's longest-serving mayor, surpassing his father's record.<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilKvZ_-QeQYYesyxYOrMxElWJQcA?docId=a29f3a05d0b5405e8e446c86c6e89c3f "Daley now Chicago mayor 1 day longer than father"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101064019/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilKvZ_-QeQYYesyxYOrMxElWJQcA?docId=a29f3a05d0b5405e8e446c86c6e89c3f |date=2011-01-01 }} [[Associated Press]] December 26, 2010</ref>  The first Irish Catholic mayor was [[John Patrick Hopkins]] (1893&ndash;1895), and [[Rahm Emanuel]] (2011&ndash;2019) is the only Jewish American to have served as mayor.  [[Harold Washington]] (1983&ndash;1987) was the first African American mayor. Current Mayor Lightfoot (sworn in May 2019) is the city's first African American woman and first openly LGBTQ mayor.

By charter, Chicago has a "[[mayor-council government#Weak-mayor form|weak-mayor]]" system, in which most of the power is vested in the city council. In practice, however, the mayor of Chicago has long been one of the most powerful municipal chief executives in the nation.  Unlike mayors in most other weak-mayor systems, he or she has the power to draw up the budget.  For most of the 20th century, before [[Shakman Decrees|the decline of patronage]] and the mayor's office becoming officially nonpartisan in 1999, the mayor was the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the city's Democratic Party, and had great influence over the ward organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/532.html|title=Government, City of Chicago|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015258/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/532.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==List of mayors==
The mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was changed to two years. In 1907, it was changed again, this time to four years. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation moved them to April. In 1869, however, election day was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were changed. In 1875, election day was moved back to April by the city's vote to operate under the [[Cities and Villages Act of 1872]].

<sup>1</sup> Since 1999, mayoral elections have officially been nonpartisan.  A 1995 Illinois law stipulated that "candidates for mayor . . . no longer would run under party labels in Chicago."  However, Richard M. Daley, Rahm Emanuel and Lori Lightfoot are known to be Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gov.

In accordance with Illinois law, the city council elects a vice mayor who serves as interim mayor in the event of a vacancy in the office of the mayor or the inability of the mayor to serve due to illness or injury, until the city council elects one of its members [[acting (law)|acting]] mayor or until the mayoral term expires. The current vice mayor is [[Tom Tunney]].<ref name=tunneyvice1/>
