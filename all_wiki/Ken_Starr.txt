'''Kenneth Winston Starr''' (born July 21, 1946) is an American lawyer who served as a [[United States federal judge|United States circuit judge]] and 39th [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general of the United States]]. He is best known for heading an investigation of members of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], known as the [[Whitewater controversy]].

Starr served as a federal [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals]] judge and as [[United States Solicitor General|solicitor general]] for [[George H. W. Bush]]. He received the most public attention for his tenure as [[Special prosecutor|independent counsel]] while [[Bill Clinton]] was [[President of the United States|U.S.&nbsp;president]]. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide of deputy White House counsel [[Vince Foster]] and the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the [[Ethics in Government Act]] later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including suspected [[perjury]] about Bill Clinton's sexual activity with [[Monica Lewinsky]]. After more than four years of investigation, Starr filed the [[Starr Report]], which alleged that Bill Clinton lied about the existence of the affair during a [[sworn declaration|sworn]] deposition. The allegation led to the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.

Starr served as the dean of the [[Pepperdine University School of Law]]. He was later the president and chancellor of [[Baylor University]] in [[Waco, Texas]], from June 2010 until May 2016, and was the Louise L. Morrison chair of constitutional law at [[Baylor Law School]]. On May 26, 2016, following an investigation into the mishandling by Starr of [[Baylor University sexual assault scandal|several sexual assaults at the school]], Baylor University's board of regents announced that Starr's tenure as university president would end on May 31.<ref>https://www.npr.org/2020/01/18/797622342/after-a-fall-at-baylor-ken-starr-became-a-fox-regular-and-then-a-trump-defender</ref> The board said he would continue as chancellor, but on June 1, Starr told [[ESPN]] that he would resign his position effective immediately.<ref name=espnresign>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/15875833/kenneth-starr-resign-chancellor-baylor-bears-continue-teach |publisher=ESPN|date=June 1, 2016|access-date=June 1, 2016|title=Kenneth Starr stepping down as Baylor chancellor}}</ref> On August 19, 2016, Starr announced he would resign from his tenured professor position at [[Baylor Law School]], completely severing his ties with the university in a "mutually agreed separation".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/texas-news/former-president-ken-starr-leaving-baylor-faculty/302855524|title=Former Baylor president Ken Starr leaving university's faculty|last=TEGNA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Starr was born near [[Vernon, Texas]], and was raised in [[Centerville, Texas]]. His father was a [[Religious minister|minister]] in the [[Churches of Christ]] who also worked as a barber. Starr attended [[Sam Houston High School (San Antonio, Texas)|Sam Houston High School]] in [[San Antonio]] and was a popular, straight‑A student.

In 1970, Starr married Alice Mendell, who was raised [[Jewish]] but converted to [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/us/08beliefs.html |work=New York Times |first=Mark |last=Oppenheimer |title=Kenneth Starr Tries to Help Baylor Move On |date=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="RossStarr2010Feb">{{cite news |url=http://www.christianchronicle.org/article2159012~Pepperdine_Law_Dean_Kenneth_Starr_named_president_of_Baylor |title=Pepperdine Law Dean Kenneth Starr named president of Baylor |first=Bobby |last=Ross Jr. |date=February 2010 |work=Christian Chronicle |access-date=February 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218155258/http://www.christianchronicle.org/article2159012~Pepperdine_Law_Dean_Kenneth_Starr_named_president_of_Baylor |archive-date=February 18, 2010}}</ref><ref name="WoodsTribStarr2010Feb16">{{cite news|url=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/Ken-Starr-named-president-of-Baylor-University.html|title=Ken Starr named president of Baylor University|last=Woods|first=Tim|date=February 16, 2010|work=Waco Tribune-Herald|access-date=February 17, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205194602/http://www.wacotrib.com/news/Ken-Starr-named-president-of-Baylor-University.html|archive-date=February 5, 2013}}</ref>

On September 13, 1983, he was nominated by [[Ronald Reagan]] to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] vacated by [[George MacKinnon]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on September 20, 1983, and received his commission on September 20, 1983. His service terminated on May 26, 1989, due to resignation.<ref name="fjc.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/starr-kenneth-winston|title=Starr, Kenneth Winston – Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}</ref>

Starr was the [[United States Solicitor General|United States solicitor general]], from 1989 to 1993, under [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref name="fjc.gov" />

== Early 1990s ==
When the Senate Ethics committee needed someone to review Republican senator [[Bob Packwood]]'s diaries, the committee chose Starr. In 1990, Starr was the leading candidate for the U.S.&nbsp;Supreme Court nomination after [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]]'s retirement. He encountered strong resistance from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] leadership, which feared that Starr might not be reliably conservative as a Supreme Court justice. George H. W. Bush nominated [[David Souter]] instead of Starr.<ref name="greenburg">{{cite book|last=Greenburg|first=Jan Crawford|title=Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court|publisher=Penguin|date=January 29, 2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00janc/page/89 89–93]|isbn=978-0-14-311304-1|url=https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00janc/page/89}}</ref>
Starr also considered running for the United States Senate, from Virginia in 1994, against incumbent [[Chuck Robb]], but opted against opposing [[Oliver North]] for the Republican nomination.

=== Appointment ===
In August 1994, pursuant to the newly reauthorized [[Ethics in Government Act]] ({{USC|28|593(b)}}), Starr was appointed by a special three-judge division of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia|D.C. Circuit]] to continue the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater investigation]].<ref>In re GRAND JURY SUBPOENAS DUCES TECUM, [https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/78/78.F3d.1307.95-3282.95-3279.html 78 F.3d 1307] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517044642/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/78/78.F3d.1307.95-3282.95-3279.html |date=May 17, 2010 }} (8th Cir. 1996)</ref> He replaced [[Robert B.

Starr took the position part-time and remained active with his law firm, [[Kirkland & Ellis]], as this was permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations.<ref name="kirkland">[http://www.kirkland.com/ourFirm/lawyerBio.aspx?InfiniumH4ID=4963&employeeH4ID=24771&attorneyH4ID=9101 Starr bio on Kirkland site.] See also [http://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=8020 Kirkland & Ellis LLP], accessed June 25, 2009.</ref> As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged [[conflicts of interest]] stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the [[Resolution Trust Company]], a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual harassment. Starr had explained to them why he believed that sitting U.S.&nbsp;presidents are not immune to civil suit.<ref>{{cite news|title=Can the President Be Indicted?

=== Investigation of the death of Vince Foster ===
{{Main|Vince Foster|Arkansas Project}}
On October 10, 1997, Starr's report on the death of deputy White House counsel [[Vince Foster]], drafted largely by Starr's deputy [[Brett Kavanaugh]], was released to the public by the Special Division. The complete report is 137 pages long and includes an appendix added to the Report by the Special Division over Starr's objection.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015042166499;view=1up;seq=7 Appendix to the Report on the Death of Vincent W. Foster, Jr.] HATHI trust digital library, Purdue University, vol 2, app</ref> The report agrees with the findings of previous independent counsel [[Robert B. Fiske]] that Foster committed suicide at [[Fort Marcy Park]], in Virginia, and that his suicide was caused primarily by undiagnosed and untreated [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. As CNN explained on February 28, 1997, "The [Starr] report refutes claims by conservative political organizations that Foster was the victim of a murder plot and coverup," but "despite those findings, right-wing political groups have continued to allege that there was more to the death and that the president and [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]] tried to cover it up."<ref name="cnn">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/02/23/starr.report/|title=Report: Starr Rules Out Foul Play In Foster Death|date=February 23, 1997|work=All Politics |publisher=CNN|access-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref> [[CNN]] also noted that organizations pushing the murder theory included the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', owned by billionaire [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], and [[Accuracy in Media]], supported in part by Scaife's foundation.<ref name="jackson">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/27/scaife.profile/|title=Who Is Richard Mellon Scaife?|last=Jackson|first=Brookes|date=April 27, 1998|publisher=CNN|access-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref> Scaife's reporter on the Whitewater matter, [[Christopher Ruddy]], was a frequent critic of Starr's handling of the case.<ref name="jurkowitz">{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/cgi-bin/ngate/BG?ext_docid=0EADDD04414A7CA3&ext_hed=THE%20RIGHT%60S%20DADDY%20MOREBUCKS%20BILLIONAIRE%27S%20CASH%20FUELS%20CONSERVATIVE%20JOURNALISM%27%20S%20FIRES&ext_theme=bg&pubcode=BG|title=THE RIGHT'S DADDY MOREBUCKS; Billionaire's cash fuels conservative journalism's fires|last=Jurkowitz|first=Mark|date=February 26, 1998|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=New York Times Co.|access-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref>

=== Expansion of the investigation ===
The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and the other independent counsels named to investigate the administration, including the right to subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of [[White House travel office controversy|White House Travel Office]] personnel, potential political abuse of confidential [[filegate|FBI&nbsp;files]], [[Madison Guaranty]], [[Rose Law Firm]], [[Paula Jones]] [[Clinton v. Jones|lawsuit]] and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with [[Monica Lewinsky]]. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker [[Linda Tripp]], requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.<ref name="timemag98">Lacayo, Richard and Cohen, Adam [http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,987779,00.html Inside Starr and His Operation], ''Time'', February 9, 1998</ref><ref name="froomkin">Froomkin, Dan [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/whitewater.htm Untangling Whitewater], ''Washington Post'', accessed June 25, 2009</ref>

=== Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, Paula Jones lawsuit ===
{{Main|Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|Clinton v. Jones}}
In his deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having "sexual relations" with Monica Lewinsky. On the basis of the evidence provided by [[Monica Lewinsky]], a blue dress with Clinton's [[semen]], Ken Starr concluded that this sworn testimony was false and perjurious.

During the deposition in the Jones case, Clinton was asked, "Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit&nbsp;1, as modified by the Court?" The definition included contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of a person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of that person, any contact of the genitals or anus of another person, or contact of one's genitals or anus and any part of another person's body either directly or through clothing.<ref name="deposition-pj">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/clintondep031398.htm|title=President Clinton's Deposition in the Paula Jones Case|date=January 17, 1998|work=Washington Post|access-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name="king">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/05/clinton.deposition|title=New Details Of Clinton's Jones Deposition Leaked|last=King|first=John|date=May 3, 1998|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name="hentoff">{{cite news|title=Above the law; Bill Clinton gets away with perjury (editorial)|last=Hentoff|first=Nat|date=January 29, 2001|work=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=The Washington Times LLC}}</ref> The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition.

Starr's investigation eventually led to the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment of President Clinton]], with whom Starr shared ''[[Time (magazine)|Time']]''s [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] designation for 1998. Despite his impeachment, the president was acquitted in the subsequent trial before the United States Senate as all 45&nbsp;Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to acquit.<ref>See [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton#Trial before U.S.&nbsp;Senate]].</ref>

=== Second thoughts on DOJ request ===
In 2004, Starr expressed regret for ever having asked the Department of Justice to assign him to oversee the Lewinsky investigation personally, saying, "the most fundamental thing that could have been done differently" would have been for somebody else to have investigated the matter.<ref name="media">''[[Deseret News]]'': [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595109948/Starr-regrets-lead-role-in-Clinton-investigation.html Starr regrets lead role in Clinton investigation.] December 4, 2004.</ref>

=== Criticism and political satire ===
As with many controversial figures, Starr has been the subject of political satire. The book, ''And the Horse He Rode In On'', by pundit [[James Carville]], attempts to portray Starr's time as special prosecutor in a comedic, negative light. At the end of his tenure at Baylor, many called Starr a hypocrite for playing a role in covering up the [[Baylor University sexual assault scandal|Baylor Football sex scandal]], considering how harshly he stood against Clinton in regards to Clinton's scandal.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/18/reviews/981018.18learlt.html|title=Preaching to the Converted|work=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://starrplay.com/images/pressclips/cindynew.htm|title=Cindy New|work=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://starrplay.com/images/pressclips/timenew.htm|title=BackStageNew}}</ref>

== Post-independent counsel activities ==
[[File:Ken Starr (49285075311).jpg|thumb|right|Starr in December 2019]]
After five years as independent counsel, Starr resigned and returned to private practice as an appellate lawyer and a visiting professor at [[New York University]], the [[Chapman University School of Law]], and the [[George Mason University School of Law]]. Starr worked as a partner at [[Kirkland & Ellis]], specializing in litigation. He was one of the lead attorneys in a [[class-action]] lawsuit filed by a coalition of liberal and conservative groups (including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[National Rifle Association]]) against the regulations created by the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002, known informally as [[John McCain|McCain]]-[[Russ Feingold|Feingold]] Act. In the case, Starr argued that the law was an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech.

On April 6, 2004, he was appointed dean of the [[Pepperdine University School of Law]]. He originally accepted a position at Pepperdine as the first dean of the newly created School of Public Policy in 1996; however, he withdrew from the appointment in 1998, several months after the Lewinsky controversy erupted. Critics charged that there was a conflict of interest due to substantial donations to Pepperdine from billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, a Clinton critic who funded many media outlets attacking the president. (Scaife's money, however, supported the Foster-was-murdered theory, according to CNN, and Scaife defunded ''The American Spectator'' after it endorsed Starr's conclusion of suicide and mocked a Scaife-aided book.<ref name="jackson" />) In 2004, some five years after President Clinton's impeachment, Starr was again offered a Pepperdine position at the School of Law and this time accepted it.

=== Death penalty cases ===
In 2005, Starr worked to overturn the death sentence of [[Robin Lovitt]], who was on [[Virginia]]'s [[death row]] for murdering a man during a robbery in 1998. Starr provided his services to Lovitt [[pro bono]]. On October 3, 2005, the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]]. (Lovitt was granted clemency and had his sentence commuted to life in prison without parole, on November 29, 2005, by Governor [[Mark Warner]] of Virginia.)

On January 26, 2006, the defense team of convicted murderer [[Michael Morales]] (which included Starr) sent letters to [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] requesting clemency for Morales.<ref name="elias">{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/01/27/state/n172048S85.DTL |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328035349/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2006%2F01%2F27%2Fstate%2Fn172048S85.DTL |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 28, 2008 |title=Ken Starr asks governor to spare condemned killer |last=Elias |first=Paul |date=January 27, 2006 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc. |access-date=June 25, 2009 }}</ref> Letters purporting to be from the jurors who determined Morales's death sentence were included in the package sent to Schwarzenegger.

=== ''Morse v. Frederick'' ===
{{Main|Morse v. Frederick}}
On May 4, 2006, Starr announced that he would represent the [[Board of education|school board]] of [[Juneau, Alaska]], in its appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in a case brought by a former student, Joseph Frederick. A high school student at that time, Joseph Frederick unfurled a banner at a school-sponsored event saying "[[Morse v. Frederick|Bong Hits 4 Jesus]]" as the Olympic torch was passing through Juneau, before arriving in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. The board decided to suspend the student. The student then sued and won at the [[U.S.&nbsp;Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which stated that the board violated the student's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech|free speech]].<ref name="ap">{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002970774_bong04.html |title=Starr to take on appeal over "bong" banner |agency=Associated Press |date=April 5, 2006 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |publisher=The Seattle Times Company |access-date=June 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229233018/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002970774_bong04.html |archive-date=December 29, 2008 }}</ref> On August 28, 2006, Starr filed a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]] for a hearing with the Supreme Court.<ref name="juneau">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/news/archive/pdf_documents/jsdboard_cert_petitionFINAL.pdf|title=PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI|last=Juneau School Board|date=August 28, 2006|work=On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|access-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref> On June 21, 2007, in an opinion authored by [[Chief Justice]] [[John G.

=== California Proposition 8 post-election lawsuits ===
{{Main|Lawsuits to overturn Proposition 8}}
On December 19, 2008, [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition&nbsp;8]] supporters named Starr to represent them in post-election lawsuits to be heard by the [[Supreme Court of California]]. Opponents of the measure sought to overturn it as a violation of fundamental rights, while supporters sought to invalidate the 18,000 [[same-sex marriage]]s performed in the state before Proposition&nbsp;8 passed.<ref name="egelko">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/20/MN6514RNVU.DTL|title=Brown asks state high court to overturn Prop. 8|last=Egelko|first=Bob|date=December 20, 2008|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref> Oral arguments took place on March 5, 2009, in San Francisco.

Starr argued that "Prop.&nbsp;8 was a modest measure that left the rights of same-sex couples undisturbed under California's domestic-partner laws and other statutes banning discrimination based on sexual orientation," to the agreement of most of the judges.<ref name=SFGATE_justice>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/05/MNLP169S2G.DTL|title=Justices seem to be leaning in favor of Prop. 8|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 5, 2009|access-date=March 5, 2009 |first=Bob |last=Egelko}}</ref> The main issue that arose during the oral argument included the meaning of the word "[[inalienable right|inalienable]]," and to which extent this word goes when used in Article&nbsp;I of the Californian Constitution. Christopher Krueger of the [[attorney general]]'<nowiki/>s office said that inalienable rights may not be stripped away by the initiative process. Starr countered that "rights are important, but they don't go to structure ... rights are ultimately defined by the people."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11838385?source=most_viewed|title=California Supreme Court hears Prop.&nbsp;8 arguments|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|last=Richman|first=Josh |date=March 5, 2009|access-date=March 5, 2009}}</ref>

The court ultimately held that the measure was valid and effective, but would not be applied retroactively to marriages performed prior to its enactment.

=== Defense of Jeffrey Epstein ===
In 2007, Starr joined the legal team defending [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] billionaire [[Jeffrey Epstein]], who was criminally accused of the statutory rape of numerous underage high school students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.page2live.com/2007/09/12/lewinsky-prosecutor-joins-defense-of-clinton-crony/ |title=Lewinsky prosecutor joins defense of Clinton crony |work=[[Palm Beach Post]] |date=September 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516122546/http://www.page2live.com/2007/09/12/lewinsky-prosecutor-joins-defense-of-clinton-crony/ |archive-date=May 16, 2012 }}</ref> Epstein would later plea bargain to plead guilty to several charges of soliciting and trafficking of underage girls, serve 13&nbsp;months on work release in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail, and register as a sex offender.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-03-25/jeffrey-epstein-how-the-billionaire-pedophile-got-off-easy/ |title=how the billionaire pedophile got off easy |date=March 25, 2011|work=[[Daily Beast]] |access-date=March 27, 2013}}</ref> Starr said he was “in the room” when then-US attorney Alex Acosta made the deal that yielded the plea bargain for Epstein and later described Acosta as “a person of complete integrity,” adding  that “everyone was satisfied” with the agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/former-epstein-attorney-ken-starr-says-alex-acosta-played-tough-in-2008 |title=Former Epstein attorney Ken Starr says Alex Acosta played tough in 2008 |date=July 13, 2019|work=[[Fox News]] |access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> In early 2019 a federal judge ruled that because prosecutors failed to disclose the deal to Epstein's victims, they had violated the [[Crime Victims' Rights Act|Crime Victims’ Rights Act]] (CVRA) which entitles victims to know about significant events in their cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/judge-prosecutors-deal-with-jeffrey-epstein-in-molestation-case-violated-law-misled-victims/2019/02/21/2b48684a-3618-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html |title=Judge: Prosecutors' deal with Jeffrey Epstein in molestation case violated law, misled victims |date= February 22, 2019|work=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref>

=== Support for Christopher Kloman ===
In 2013, Starr was among many high-profile figures to express support for [[Christopher Kloman]], a 74-year-old retired teacher at the [[Potomac School (McLean, Virginia)|Potomac School]] who pleaded guilty to molesting five female students over a period from 1966 to 1985. Starr signed a letter, written by his wife Alice, to the [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], judge presiding over the case. The letter asked for leniency for Kloman, who is a friend of the Starr family and who "took the time to chat" with Starr's daughter, a student at the school until 1998. "Community service would be a far better punishment than having him languish in jail," they wrote.<ref>{{cite web|title="He Took the Time to Chat": Ken Starr's Plea for a Child Molester |url=http://gawker.com/he-took-the-time-to-chat-ken-starr-s-plea-for-a-chil-1464516616 |website=Gawker |access-date=January 12, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070343/http://gawker.com/he-took-the-time-to-chat-ken-starr-s-plea-for-a-chil-1464516616 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref> Kloman was convicted in October 2013 and sentenced to 43 years in prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/former-potomac-school-teacher-to-be-sentenced-in-decades-old-molestations/2013/10/17/b41ba620-3743-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html|title=Former Potomac School sentenced to 43 years in decades-old molestations|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

In September 2015, Baylor's Board of Regents initiated an external review of the university's response to [[Baylor University sexual assault scandal|reports of sexual violence]] to be conducted by the [[Pepper Hamilton]] law firm. Baylor had been accused of failing to respond to reports of rape and sexual assault filed by at least six female students from 2009 to 2016.

The May 26, 2016, announcement of personnel changes by the Board of Regents said Starr was to have continued as Chancellor and also as a faculty member at Baylor Law School. Starr, however, announced his resignation as Chancellor on June 1, effective immediately. He told an interviewer that he took that action "as a matter of conscience." He said he "willingly accepted responsibility" and "The captain goes down with the ship."<ref name=espnresign /> He resigned his position as the Louise L.
