[[China]] has been on the internet intermittently since May 1989 and on a permanent basis since 20 April 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.cn/introduction_1378/20060323/t20060323_4285.shtml|title=中国教育和科研计算机网CERNET|website=Edu.cn|accessdate=15 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527120608/http://www.edu.cn/introduction_1378/20060323/t20060323_4285.shtml|archive-date=27 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although with limited access.

China's first foray into global cyberspace was an [[email]] (not TCP/IP based and thus technically not internet) sent on 20 September 1987 to [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]. It said "Across the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], we can reach every corner in the world" ({{zh |s=越过长城，走向世界 |t=越過長城，走向世界 |p=Yuèguò Chángchéng, Zǒuxiàng Shìjiè }}).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/122.shtml |title = Archived copy |accessdate = 30 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130101104447/http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/122.shtml |archivedate=1 January 2013  }}</ref><ref>[http://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2017/9/388707.shtm 中国E-mail：值而立之年却未老先衰]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. 科技日报. 19 September 2017.</ref> This has since become a well-known phrase in China, and is displayed on the desktop login screen for [[Tencent QQ|QQ]] mail.<ref name="guar1">{{cite news |title=The great firewall of China |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown |accessdate=29 June 2018 |work=The Guardian|date=28 June 2018}}</ref>

A majority of broadband subscribers are DSL, mostly from [[China Telecom]] and [[China Netcom]]. The price varies in different provinces, usually around US$5 – $20/month for a 4M – 100M ADSL/Fiber (price varies by geographic region).{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

As of June 2011, Chinese internet users spent an average of 18.7 hours online per week, which would result in a total of about 472 billion hours in 2011.<ref name="EWC">{{cite web |author =CNNIC |title=30th statistical report on internet development in China |url = http://www1.cnnic.cn/IDR/ReportDownloads/201209/t20120928_36586.htm |publisher=CNNIC |accessdate=28 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128121724/http://www1.cnnic.cn/IDR/ReportDownloads/201209/t20120928_36586.htm |archivedate=28 November 2012  }}</ref>

Broadband makes up the majority of internet connections in China, with 363.81 million users at this service tier. The price of a broadband connection places it well within the reach of the mainland Chinese middle class. Wireless, especially internet access through a mobile phone, has developed rapidly. 500 million are accessing the internet via cell phones.<ref name="CNNIC33"/> The number of dial-up users peaked in 2004 and since then has decreased sharply. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Generally statistics on the number of mobile internet users in China show a significant slump in the growth rate between 2008 and 2010, with a small peak in the next two years.<ref>[http://www.iresearchchina.com/views/3959.html China Mobile Internet Market] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304061006/http://www.iresearchchina.com/views/3959.html |date=4 March 2013 }}, China Internet Network Information Center, iResearch.

By the end of 2009, the number of Chinese domestic websites grew to 3.23 million, with an annual increase rate of 12.3%, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.<ref>Zuo Likun, 4 May 2010, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-05/04/content_9808444.htm Websites in China mushroomed to over 3 million], China Daily</ref> As of first half of 2010, the majority of the Web content is user-generated.<ref name="ChinaDaily2">{{Cite news| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-07/23/content_11042851.htm | work=China Daily | title=User-generated content online now 50.7% of total | accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref>

==Structure==
An important characteristic of the Chinese internet is that online access routes are owned by the [[PRC]] government, and private enterprises and individuals can only rent bandwidth from the state.<ref name=dkh>{{cite journal|last=Herold|first=David Kurt|title=Escaping the World: A Chinese Perspective on Virtual Worlds|journal=Journal of Virtual Worlds Research|date=September 2012|volume=5|issue=2|doi=10.4101/jvwr.v5i2.6206|url=https://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/6206/6040 | accessdate= 27 November 2017|doi-access=free}}</ref> The first four major national networks, namely [[CSTNET]], [[ChinaNet]], [[CERNET]] and [[CHINAGBN]], are the "backbone" of the mainland Chinese internet. Later dominant [[Telecommunications industry in China|telecom providers]] also started to provide internet services.

In January 2015, China added seven new access points to the world's internet backbone, adding to the three points that connect through Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.<ref>{{cite web|title = 7个新增国家级互联网骨干直联点建设全面竣工|url = http://www.miit.gov.cn/n11293472/n11293832/n11293907/n11368223/16402896.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150121025150/http://www.miit.gov.cn/n11293472/n11293832/n11293907/n11368223/16402896.html|url-status = dead|archive-date = 21 January 2015|website = www.miit.gov.cn|accessdate = 28 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Chinese Internet Gets A Stronger Backbone|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisachanson/2015/02/24/the-chinese-internet-gets-a-stronger-backbone/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 28 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = China expands Internet backbone to improve speeds, reliability|url = http://www.itworld.com/article/2868215/china-expands-internet-backbone-to-improve-speeds-reliability.html|website = ITworld|accessdate = 28 November 2015}}</ref>

Public internet services are usually provided by provincial telecom companies, which sometimes are traded between networks. Internet service providers without a nationwide network could not compete with their bandwidth provider, the telecom companies, and often run out of business.
The interconnection between these networks is a big concern for internet users, since internet traffic via the global internet is quite slow. However, major internet services providers are reluctant to aid rivals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The majority of Chinese internet users are restricted their use of the internet to Chinese websites, as most of the population has a lack of foreign language skills and access to Google or Wikipedia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

English-language media in China often use the word "[[netizen]]" to refer to Chinese internet users.

==Content==
According to [[Kaiser Kuo]], the internet in China is largely used for entertainment purposes, being referred to as the "entertainment superhighway". However, it also serves as the first public forum for Chinese citizens to freely exchange their ideas.<ref>Kaiser Kuo, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-jqGmc6xKI TEDxHonolulu] Technology, Entertainment and Design Conference, 5 November 2009</ref> Most users go online to read news, to search for information, and to check their email. They also go to [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] or web forums, find music or videos, or download files.

===Content providers===
[[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] [[infotainment]] [[web portal]]s such as [[Tencent Holdings Ltd|Tencent]], [[Sina.com]], [[Sohu]], and [[163.com]] are popular. For example, Sina claims it has about 94.8 million registered users and more than 10 million active ones engaged in their fee-based services. Other Internet service providers such as the [[employment|human resource]] service provider [[51job]] and the [[electronic commerce]] web sites such as [[Alibaba.com]] are less popular but more successful on their specialty. Their success led some of them to make [[Initial public offering|IPOs]].

All websites that operate in China with their own domain name must have an [[ICP license]] from the [[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Industry and Information Technology]]. Because the PRC government blocks many foreign websites, many homegrown copycats of foreign websites have appeared.<ref>Goldkorn, Jeremy.

[[Baidu]] is the leading search engine in China, while most web portals also provide search opportunities like [[Soso.com]]. [[Bing China]] has also entered the Chinese market. Bing.cn also operates Yahoo's China search functions. As of 2015, Google was limited to no presence in China. Before 2014, Googlers in China were linked to Google [[Hong Kong]] from its google.cn page because of an issue with hackers reportedly based in [[Mainland China]]. As of 4 June 2014, Google became officially blocked without the use of a [[virtual private network]] (VPN), an effect still in place to date.

===Online communities===
Although the Chinese write fewer emails, they enjoy other online communication tools. Users form their communities based on different interests. Bulletin boards on portals or elsewhere, chat rooms, instant messaging groups, blogs and microblogs are very active, while photo-sharing and social networking sites are growing rapidly. Some Wikis such as the [[Soso Baike]] and [[Baidu Baike]] are "flourishing". Until 2008 the Chinese Wikipedia could not be accessed from mainland China. Since 2008, the government only blocks certain pages on Wikipedia which they deem to contain controversial content.

===Social media===
China is one of the most restricted countries in the world in terms of internet, but these constraints have directly contributed to the staggering success of local Chinese social media sites. The Chinese government makes it impossible for foreign companies to enter the Chinese social media network. Without access to the majority of social media platforms used elsewhere in the world, the Chinese have created their own networks, just like Facebook, Myspace, YouTube, and Foursquare – but with more users – which is why every global company pays attention to these sites. Some Chinese famous social medias are [[Sina Weibo]], [[Tencent Weibo]], [[Renren]], [[Pengyou]], [[QQ]], [[Douban]] etc. And in recent years, the use of [[WeChat]] has become more and more popular among people in China.

===Online shopping===
The rapidly increasing number of Internet users in China has also generated a large online shopping base in the country. A large number of Chinese internet users have even been branded as having an "online shopping addiction" as a result of the growth of the industry.<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/246032/number-of-online-buyers-in-china/ Statistics on the number of online buyers in China], eMarketer.

===Online Mapping Services===
China has endeavored to offer a number of online mapping services and allows the dissemination of geographic information within the country. Soso maps, [[Baidu Maps]] (百度地圖) and [[Tianditu|Tianditu (天地圖)]] are typical examples. Online mapping services can be understood as online cartography backed up by a [[geographic information system]] (GIS). GIS was originally a tool for cartographers, geographers and other types of specialists to store, manage, present and analyze spatial data. In bringing GIS online, the Web has made these tools available to a much wider audience.<ref>Tulloch, D. L. (2007) [http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1620/1535 ‘Many, Many Maps: Empowerment and Online Participatory Mapping’] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123185000/http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1620/1535 |date=23 November 2012 }}, First Monday 12 (2)</ref> Furthermore, with the advent of broadband, utilizing GIS has become much faster and easier. Increasingly, non-specialist members of the public can access, look up and make use of geographic information for their own purposes.<ref>Chen, Yu-Wen (2010) Drawing Borders Alters Our World. Taipei Times, 19 December, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2010/12/19/2003491313]</ref> [[Tianditu]] is China's first online mapping service. Literally World Map, [[Tianditu]] was launched in late October 2010. The Chinese government has repeatedly claimed that this service is to offer comprehensive geographical data for Chinese users to learn more about the world.

=== Online payment ===
The method of directly paying by online banking is required to be able to make online banking payment after opening online banking and can realize online payment of UnionPay, online payment by credit card and so on. 

This payment method is directly paid from the bank card. The third-party payment itself integrates multiple payment methods, and the process is as follows: 

1. Recharge the money in online banking to a third-party.

2. Pay by third-party deposit when the user pays.

3. The fee is charged for withdrawal. Third-party payment methods are diverse, including mobile payments and fixed-line payments. 

The most commonly used third-party payment is Alipay, Tenpay, Huanxun, Epro, fast money, online banking, and as an independent online merchant or a website with payment services, the most common choice is nothing more than Alipay, Huanxun payment, Epro payment, fast money these four. As of January 2015, Alipay, owned by Alibaba Group has 600 million counts of users and has the largest user group among all online-payment providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.china.com.cn/live/2015-02/27/content_31531594.htm|title=支付宝钱包活跃用户超6亿_新闻中心_中国网|website=News.china.com.cn|accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref>

===Online gaming===
{{main|Online gaming in China}}

===Adult content===
Although restrictions on political information remain strong, several sexually oriented blogs began appearing in early 2004. Women using the web aliases [[Muzi Mei]] (木子美) and [[Zhuying Qingtong]] (竹影青瞳) wrote online diaries of their sex lives and became minor celebrities. This was widely reported and criticized in mainland Chinese news media, and several of these bloggers' sites have since been blocked, and remain so to this day. This coincided with an artistic nude photography fad (including a self-published book by dancer [[Tang Jiali]]) and the appearance of pictures of minimally clad women or even topless photos in a few Chinese newspapers, magazines and on several websites. Many dating and "adult chat" sites, both Chinese and foreign, have been blocked. Some, however, continue to be accessible, although this appears to be due more to the Chinese government's ignorance of their existence than any particular policy of leniency.

===Censorship===
{{Main|Internet censorship in China|Internet censorship}}

The [[Golden Shield Project]] was proposed to the State Council by Premier Zhu Rongji in 1993. As a massive surveillance and content control system, it was launched in November 2000, and became known as the [[Internet censorship in China|Great Firewall of China]].  The apparatus of China's Internet control is considered more extensive and more advanced than in any other country in the world. The governmental authorities not only block website content but also monitor the Internet access of individuals; such measures have attracted the derisive nickname "[[Great Firewall|The Great Firewall of China]]."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2005-09-china-yahoo-youve.html|title=The China Yahoo! welcome: You've got Jail!|access-date=1 August 2017}}</ref>

The [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television]] issued a directive on 30 March 2009 to highlight 31 categories of content prohibited online, including violence, pornography and content which may "incite ethnic discrimination or undermine social stability".
