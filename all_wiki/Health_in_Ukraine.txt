===Vaccinations===
The crumbling, poorly financed healthcare system and rumours that children have fallen ill or even died after being immunised have led to a very poor vaccination rate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ukraine health system in danger of collapse as reforms stall|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0U60LN20151223|accessdate=5 October 2015|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=23 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34289480|title=Ukraine health officials fear big polio outbreak|first=David|last=Stern|date=22 September 2015|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24504960|title=Why does Ukraine have Europe's lowest vaccination rate?|date=12 October 2013|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In August 2016, 30% of children in Ukraine were fully immunized against [[measles]], 10%, against [[hepatitis B]], and 3% of against [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]] and [[tetanus]].<ref name="unian.info">Read more on [[UNIAN]]: http://www.unian.info/society/1556482-us-canada-ambassadors-urge-putting-routine-immunization-in-ukraine-back-on-track.html</ref> At the time Ukraine had the lowest routine immunization rate in the world.<ref name="unian.info"/>

As of June 2019, Ukraine is suffering one of the world's worst [[Epidemiology of measles|measles epidemics]] with more than 100,000 cases since 2017, with 16 deaths in 2018. In 2016 only 31% of the population had been immunised with the [[MMR vaccine]]. Various reasons are given for the low rate of vaccination including: a distrust of the state in the 1990s, a failure to keep vaccine supplies reliably refrigerated leading to ineffectiveness, a poorly informed medical profession and a high level of vaccine distrust in the wider population. Children are required to be vaccinated before entering the school system, but [[Unicef]] estimates that as many as 30% of vaccination certificates are falsified.<ref name=bbc-20190622>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-48668841 |title=The medical student who died of measles |author1=Tim Whewell |author2=Kateryna Shipko |author3=Diana Kuryshko |work=BBC News |date=22 June 2019 |accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=science-20190212>{{cite journal |last1=Wadman |first1=Meredith |title=Measles cases have tripled in Europe, fueled by Ukrainian outbreak |journal=Science |date=12 February 2019 |doi=10.1126/science.aaw9903 |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/measles-cases-have-tripled-europe-fueled-ukrainian-outbreak |accessdate=17 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218021350/https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/measles-cases-have-tripled-europe-fueled-ukrainian-outbreak |archive-date=18 February 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===High blood pressure and obesity===
{{See|Obesity in Ukraine}}

According to a study, entitled "Main reasons for the high death rate in Ukraine" conducted by the [[World Bank]] and released in December 2010 every third Ukrainian aged 18–65, including every fifth aged 18–25, had a high blood pressure. Almost 29% of the respondents suffered from being overweight, and 20% suffered from obesity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/92830/|title=Every third Ukrainian has high blood pressure - Dec. 14, 2010|date=14 December 2010}}</ref>

===Smoking===
According to the above-mentioned 2010 World Bank study 36% (28.6% is the average in [[Europe]]) of Ukrainians smoke tobacco, including 31% of those who smoke every day. Men with primary education and women with higher education are inclined to smoking. Some 80% of daily smokers are men. The average age that daily smokers start the habit is decreasing, and at present is 16 years. In the younger age group there are four times as many smokers as in the older age group. The smallest percentage of smokers is to be found in the west of the country (24.6%), while the largest is in the east (34%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/92832/|title=Over one third of people in Ukraine smoke - Dec. 14, 2010|date=14 December 2010}}</ref>

2.7 million people in Ukraine (6%<ref name="pop">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html |title=People and Society: Ukraine |publisher=CIA World Factbook |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref>) were reported as having a [[disability]] in 2014.<ref name="UPDiU21814">{{in lang|uk}} [http://life.pravda.com.ua/columns/2014/08/21/178384/ Ukrainian city for all or only for the elect?], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (21 August 2014)</ref> This number did not include the (reportedly) 1.5% of people with temporary disabilities.<ref name="UPDiU21814"/> In 2014, 35% of people aged 60–70 had some age-related disability.

===HIV/AIDS===
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Ukraine}}
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] epidemics in the world. About 1.63 percent of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] adults, or about 756,300 citizens, were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS in 2007, up from 1.46 percent of the population in 2005, or 685,600 citizens, according to [[UNAIDS]]. The statistics only reflect official cases, while those infected is likely higher according to UNAIDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/28938/|title=Ukraine losing HIV/AIDS fight - May. 07, 2008|date=7 May 2008}}</ref> The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Ukraine reduced by 200 or 3.9% to 4,900 in the period of January–November 2008, compared with the corresponding period of last year.

===Mental health===
A 2017 article in ''[[The Independent]]'' reports that due to its mainly macho,  [[Patriarchy|patriarchal culture]] there is great resistance to [[psychotherapy]] in Ukraine. Weak mechanisms for licensing effective counsellors aggravates this resistance and a shame fostered by the years Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]]{{#tag:ref|As the [[Ukrainian SSR]] Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]] since 1920 until [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 24 August 1991]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&pg=PA722&dq=16+July+1991+Ukrainian+state+sovereignty.&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ejEVUc-7G-Xa0QX4-4HgBg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=16%20July%201991%20Ukrainian%20state%20sovereignty.&f=false A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples] by [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1442610212}} (page 563/564 & 722/723)</ref>|group=nb}} compounds the problem, owing to [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|Soviet authorities rendering psychiatry a tool for punishment]] (by imprisoning political dissidents in asylums) demonised mental health issues further.<ref name=mhU8117>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-three-years-psychological-toll-ukrainians-doctors-health-war-a7515271.html Three years of conflict takes its psychological toll on the people of Ukraine], [[The Independent]] (8 January 2017)</ref>

==Demographic decline==
{{Further|Demographics of Ukraine}}

Ukraine is considered to be in a demographic crisis due to its high death rate and a low birth rate. The current Ukrainian birth rate is 11 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 16.3 deaths/1,000 population. A factor contributing to the relatively high death is a high [[mortality rate]] among working-age males from preventable causes such as [[alcohol poisoning]] and [[smoking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/julaug99/pgs3-4.htm|title=What Went Wrong with Foreign Advice in Ukraine?|accessdate=2008-01-16|work=The World Bank Group|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720122016/http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/julaug99/pgs3-4.htm|archivedate=2009-07-20}}</ref>

In 2008, the country's population was one of the fastest declining in the world at -5% growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html|title=Field Listing - Population growth rate|accessdate=2008-07-05|work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/ State Statistics Committee of Ukraine] Retrieved on 07-09-09</ref> The UN warned that Ukraine's population could fall by as much as 10 million by 2050 if trends did not improve.<ref>[http://esa.un.org/unpp/p2k0data.asp UN population estimates]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[UN]] Retrieved on 07-09-09</ref>
