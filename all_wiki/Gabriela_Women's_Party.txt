== History ==
GABRIELA was founded in April 1984 after 10,000 women marched in [[Metro Manila|Manila]], defying a [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] decree against demonstrations.<ref name="radgeek.com">{{cite web|url=http://radgeek.com/gt/2006/03/23/reign_of/ |title=Rad Geek People's Daily 2006-03-23 – Reign of Terror in the Philippines; women's movement criminalized |publisher=Radgeek.com |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> Amidst a backdrop of widespread social inequality and unrest, GABRIELA aimed to synthesize issues of national liberation, poverty and women's emancipation. The organization's founders pushed for comprehensive social transformation, rather than focusing on individual forms of oppression. This came to be known as [[Postcolonial feminism|Third World feminism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Feminista: Gender, Race and Class in the Philippines|last=Arnado|first=Mary Janet|publisher=Anvil Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-971-27-2594-4|location=the Philippines|pages=12}}</ref> 
The NGO was named in honor of [[Gabriela Silang]], a revolutionary Filipina, who led a revolt against [[Spain]] in the second half of the eighteenth century. The death of her husband was the reason she took over his role as the anti-colonialist leader.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niu|first=Greta Ai-Yu|date=Summer 1999|title=Wives, widows, and workers: Corazon Aquino, Imelda Marcos, and the Filipina "other"|journal=NWSA Journal}}</ref> GABRIELA has been a monumental party for Filipino women because they challenge a lot of the patriarchal views placed on them, alongside resisting foreign influence and [[neocolonialism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ty|first=Rey|date=July 2018|title=GABRIELA: Contributions of a Third-World Women's Movement to Feminist Theory and Practice|journal=Young Ambassadors of Peace in Asia (YAPA)}}</ref>
