==History==
The Bank of America name first appeared in 1923, with the formation of [[Bank of America, Los Angeles]]. In 1928, it was acquired by [[Bank of Italy (United States)|Bank of Italy]] of San Francisco, which took the Bank of America name two years later.<ref name="britannica.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bank-of-America-Corporation|title=Bank of America {{!}} History, Services, Acquisitions, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

The eastern portion of the Bank of America franchise can be traced to 1784, when [[BankBoston#The Massachusetts Bank|Massachusetts Bank]] was chartered—the first iteration of [[FleetBoston Financial|FleetBoston]], which Bank of America acquired in 2004. In 1874, [[Commercial National Bank]] was founded in Charlotte. That bank merged with American Trust Company in 1958 to form American Commercial Bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/living-here-guide/article99119107.html|title=Here's what to know about the area's biggest employers|last=Roberts|first=Deon|date=August 31, 2016|website=The Charlotte Observer|access-date=January 29, 2020}}</ref> Two years later it became [[North Carolina National Bank]] when it merged with Security National Bank of Greensboro. In 1991, it merged with [[Citizens & Southern National Bank|C&S]]/[[Sovran Bank|Sovran]] Corporation of [[Atlanta]] and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to form '''[[NationsBank]].'''

The central portion of the franchise dates to 1910, when Commercial National Bank and Continental National Bank of Chicago merged in 1910 to form Continental & Commercial National Bank, which evolved into [[Continental Illinois|Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust]].

===Bank of Italy===
{{Main|Bank of Italy (United States)}}
From a naming perspective, the history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when [[Amadeo Giannini|Amadeo Pietro Giannini]] founded the [[Bank of Italy (United States)|Bank of Italy]] in San Francisco.<ref name="britannica.com"/> In 1922, Bank of America, Los Angeles was established with Giannini as a minority investor.

===Expansion in California===
Giannini introduced branch banking shortly after 1909 legislation in California allowed for branch banking in the state, establishing the bank's first branch outside San Francisco in 1909 in San Jose. By 1929 the bank had 453 banking offices in California with aggregate resources of over US$1.4 billion.<ref>"Statewide Expansion" pp. 34–38 In: Branch Banking California.

Giannini sought to build a national bank, expanding into most of the western states as well as into the [[insurance industry]], under the aegis of his holding company, [[Transamerica Corporation]]. In 1953 regulators succeeded in forcing the separation of [[Transamerica Corporation]] and Bank of America under the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].<ref>[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/206/206.F2d.163.10768.html Transamerica Corporation, a corporation of Delaware] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051239/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/206/206.F2d.163.10768.html |date= August 30, 2009}}, has petitioned this court to review an order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System entered against it under Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 21, to enforce compliance with Section 7 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 18.</ref> The passage of the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] prohibited banks from owning [[non-bank subsidiary|non-banking subsidiaries]] such as insurance companies. Bank of America and Transamerica were separated, with the latter company continuing in the insurance sector. However, federal banking regulators prohibited Bank of America's interstate banking activity, and Bank of America's domestic banks outside California were forced into a separate company that eventually became [[First Interstate Bancorp]], later acquired by [[Wells Fargo and Company]] in 1996. Only in the 1980s, with a change in federal banking legislation and regulation, could Bank of America again expand its domestic consumer banking activity outside California.

New technologies also allowed the direct linking of [[credit card]]s with individual bank accounts. In 1958, the bank introduced the BankAmericard, which changed its name to [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] in 1977.<ref>

 |quote = Bank of America had the entire state of California as a potential market, and when it issued BankAmericard in 1958, the card was an instant success. [...] In many countries, there was still reluctance to issue a card associated with Bank of America, even though the association was entirely nominal in nature. For this reason, in 1977 BankAmericard became the Visa card, retaining its distinctive blue, white and gold flag. NBI became Visa U.S.A., and IBANCO became Visa International.

===Expansion outside California===
Following the passage of the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]],<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6000-1880.html|title= FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts - Bank Holding Company Act|website= www.fdic.gov|access-date= 2020-01-29}}</ref> BankAmerica Corporation was established{{by whom|date=March 2020}} for the purpose of owning and operating Bank of America and its subsidiaries.

Bank of America expanded outside [[California]] in 1983, with its acquisition, orchestrated in part by [[Stephen McLin]], of [[Seafirst Corporation]] of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Seattle-First National Bank.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url= https://www.seattletimes.com/business/remember-seafirst-its-more-than-a-local-tale/|title= Remember Seafirst?

BankAmerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as Seafirst rather than Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank.<ref name=":1" />

BankAmerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 due to the placement of a series of bad loans in the [[Third World]], particularly in [[Latin America]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} The company fired its CEO, [[Samuel Armacost|Sam Armacost]] in 1986.

[[First Interstate Bancorp]] of Los Angeles (which had originated from banks once owned by BankAmerica), launched such a bid in the fall of 1986, although BankAmerica rebuffed it, mostly by selling operations.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-08-fi-4689-story.html|title= BankAmerica, 1st Interstate Merger Seen Leading to Cuts in Staff and Branch Closings |date= 1986-10-08 |website= Los Angeles Times |language= en-US |access-date= 2020-01-29}}</ref> It sold its FinanceAmerica subsidiary to [[Chrysler]] and the brokerage firm [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab and Co.]] back to [[Charles R.

By the time of the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock-market crash]], BankAmerica's share price had fallen to $8, but by 1992 it had rebounded mightily to become one of the biggest gainers of that half-decade.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

BankAmerica's next big acquisition came in 1992. The company acquired Security Pacific Corporation and its subsidiary [[Security Pacific Bank|Security Pacific National Bank]] in California and other banks in [[Arizona]], [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which Security Pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s.

In 1994 BankAmerica acquired the [[Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co.]] of Chicago.

While NationsBank was the nominal survivor, the merged bank took the better-known name of Bank of America.

In 2001, McColl stepped down and named [[Ken Lewis (executive)|Ken Lewis]] as his successor.

In 2004, Bank of America announced it would purchase Boston-based bank [[FleetBoston Financial]] for $47&nbsp;billion in cash and stock.<ref name="fleetboston-merger">{{cite news| title=US banking mega-merger unveiled| date=October 27, 2003| work=[[BBC News]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/business/3217803.stm| access-date=February 27, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040625190526/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/business/3217803.stm| archive-date=June 25, 2004| url-status=live}}</ref> By merging with Bank of America, all of its banks and branches were given the Bank of America logo. At the time of merger, FleetBoston was the seventh largest bank in United States with $197&nbsp;billion in assets, over 20 million customers and revenue of $12&nbsp;billion.<ref name="fleetboston-merger" /> Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted, according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.

On June 30, 2005, Bank of America announced it would purchase credit card giant [[MBNA]] for $35&nbsp;billion in cash and stock. The [[Federal Reserve Board]] gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer. The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140&nbsp;billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America, the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.

Bank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In May 2006, Bank of America and [[Banco Itaú]] (Investimentos Itaú S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement, through which Itaú agreed to acquire BankBoston's operations in Brazil, and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America's operations in [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]], in exchange for Itaú shares. The deal was signed in August 2006.

Prior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay, it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Itaú stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Itaú to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.

On November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of [[The United States Trust Company]] for $3.3&nbsp;billion, from the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]]. US Trust had about $100&nbsp;billion of [[assets under management]] and over 150 years of experience. The deal closed July 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bank of America To Buy U.S. Trust |work=Forbes |date=November 20, 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/2006/11/20/bank-of-america-markets-equity-cx_jl_1120markets12.html |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012191411/http://www.forbes.com/markets/2006/11/20/bank-of-america-markets-equity-cx_jl_1120markets12.html |archive-date=October 12, 2007}}</ref>

On September 14, 2007, Bank of America won approval from the Federal Reserve to acquire [[LaSalle Bank Corporation]] from [[ABN AMRO]] for $21&nbsp;billion. With this purchase, Bank of America possessed $1.7&nbsp;trillion in assets. A Dutch court blocked the sale until it was later approved in July. The acquisition was completed on October 1, 2007. Many of LaSalle's branches and offices had already taken over smaller regional banks within the previous decade, such as Lansing and Detroit-based [[Michigan National Bank]]. The acquisition also included the [[Chicago Marathon]] event, which ABN AMRO acquired in 1996. Bank of America took over the event starting with the 2007 race.

The deal increased Bank of America's presence in [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Indiana]] by 411 branches, 17,000 commercial bank clients, 1.4&nbsp;million retail customers, and 1,500 ATMs. Bank of America became the largest bank in the Chicago market with 197 offices and 14% of the deposit share, surpassing [[JPMorgan Chase]].

[[LaSalle Bank]] and [[LaSalle Bank Midwest]] branches adopted the Bank of America name on May 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tom |first=Henderson |title=BOA to 'paint the town red' with LaSalle name change |work=[[Crain Communications|Crain's Detroit Business]] |date=April 14, 2008 |url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080414/SUB/804140331 |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605152132/http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080414%2FSUB%2F804140331 |archive-date=June 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The bank, in its January 16, 2009, earnings release, revealed massive losses at Merrill Lynch in the fourth quarter, which necessitated an infusion of money that had previously been negotiated<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/business/16merrill.html| work=The New York Times| title=Bank of America to Receive Additional $20&nbsp;billion| first1=Eric| last1=Dash| first2=Louise| last2=Story| date=January 16, 2009| accessdate=April 26, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425170435/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/business/16merrill.html| archive-date=April 25, 2009| url-status=live}}</ref> with the government as part of the government-persuaded deal for the bank to acquire Merrill. Merrill recorded an operating loss of $21.5&nbsp;billion in the quarter, mainly in its sales and trading operations, led by Tom Montag. The bank also disclosed it tried to abandon the deal in December after the extent of Merrill's trading losses surfaced, but was compelled to complete the merger by the U.S. government. The bank's stock price sank to $7.18, its lowest level in 17 years, after announcing earnings and the Merrill mishap. The market capitalization of Bank of America, including Merrill Lynch, was then $45&nbsp;billion, less than the $50&nbsp;billion it offered for Merrill just four months earlier, and down $108&nbsp;billion from the merger announcement.

Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis testified before Congress<ref name=ATLoffer /> that he had some misgivings about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and that federal officials pressured him to proceed with the deal or face losing his job and endangering the bank's relationship with federal regulators.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=a5A4F5W_PygQ|archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100312122842/http%3A//www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3D20601110%26sid%3Da5A4F5W_PygQ|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 12, 2010|title=Bank Chief Tells of U.S. Pressure to Buy Merrill Lynch |author=LOUISE STORY and JO BECKER |work=The New York Times |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 13, 2009}}</ref>

Lewis, for his part, states he didn't recall requesting such a letter.

According to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' published on March 15, 2009, Bank of America received an additional $5.2&nbsp;billion in government bailout money, channeled through [[American International Group]].<ref>Walsh, Mary Williams (March 15, 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/business/16rescue.html "A.I.G.

As a result of its federal bailout and management problems, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that the Bank of America was operating under a secret "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) from the U.S. government that requires it to "overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management". With the federal action, the institution has taken several steps, including arranging for six of its [[Bank of America#Board of directors|directors]] to resign and forming a Regulatory Impact Office. Bank of America faces several deadlines in July and August and if not met, could face harsher penalties by federal regulators. Bank of America did not respond to ''The Wall Street Journal'' story.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124771415436449393 "US Regulators to B of A: Obey or Else"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812134333/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124771415436449393 |date=August 12, 2017 }}, ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 16, 2009</ref>

====Bonus settlement====
On August 3, 2009, Bank of America agreed to pay a $33&nbsp;million fine, without admission or denial of charges, to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) over the non-disclosure of an agreement to pay up to $5.8&nbsp;billion of bonuses at Merrill. The bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the Merrill acquisition, in December 2008. The issue was originally investigated by [[New York Attorney General]] [[Andrew Cuomo]], who commented after the suit and announced a settlement that "the timing of the bonuses, as well as the disclosures relating to them, constituted a 'surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility{{'"}} and "our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to New York's [[Martin Act]] will continue." Congressman Kucinich commented at the same time that "This may not be the last fine that Bank of America pays for how it handled its merger of Merrill Lynch."<ref>Kouwe, Zachery (August 3, 2009), [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/sec-sues-bank-of-america-over-merrill-deal/ "BofA Settles S.E.C.

A first hearing before the judge on August 10 was at times heated, and he was "sharply critic[al]" of the bonuses. David Rosenfeld represented the SEC, and Lewis J. Liman, son of [[Arthur L. Liman]], represented the bank. The actual amount of bonuses paid was $3.6&nbsp;billion, of which $850&nbsp;million was "guaranteed" and the rest was shared amongst 39,000 workers who received average payments of $91,000; 696 people received more than $1&nbsp;million in bonuses; at least one person received a more than $33&nbsp;million bonus.<ref>Story, Louise (August 10, 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/business/11bank.html "Judge Attacks Merrill Pre-Merger Bonuses"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024044803/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/business/11bank.html |date=October 24, 2017 }}, ''The New York Times'', (p.

On September 14, the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than February 1, 2010. The judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the bank's shareholders, who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure. He wrote, "It is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims' money should be used to make the case against the management go away," ... "The proposed settlement," the judge continued, "suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties: the S.E.C. gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the Bank of America in a high-profile merger; the bank's management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators. And all this is done at the expense, not only of the shareholders but also of the truth."<ref name="NYT10" />

While ultimately deferring to the SEC, in February 2010, Judge Rakoff approved a revised settlement with a $150&nbsp;million fine "reluctantly", calling the accord "half-baked justice at best" and "inadequate and misguided". Addressing one of the concerns he raised in September, the fine will be "distributed only to Bank of America shareholders harmed by the non-disclosures, or 'legacy shareholders', an improvement on the prior $33&nbsp;million while still "paltry", according to the judge.

In April 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Bank of America to provide an estimated $727 million in relief to consumers harmed by practices related to credit card add-on products. According to the Bureau, roughly 1.4 million customers were affected by deceptive marketing of add-on products, and 1.9 million customers were illegally charged for credit monitoring and reporting services they were not receiving. The deceptive marketing misconduct involved telemarketing scripts containing misstatements and off-script sales pitches made by telemarketers that were misleading and omitted pertinent information. The unfair billing practices involved billing customers for privacy-related products without having the authorization necessary to perform the credit monitoring and credit report retrieval services. As a result, the company billed customers for services they did not receive, unfairly charged consumers for interest and fees, illegally charged approximately 1.9 million accounts, and failed to provide the product benefit.<ref>{{cite web| title=CFPB Orders Bank Of America To Pay $727 Million In Consumer Relief For Illegal Credit Card Practices| url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-bank-of-america-to-pay-727-million-in-consumer-relief-for-illegal-credit-card-practices/| publisher=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau| accessdate=8 June 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521025448/http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-bank-of-america-to-pay-727-million-in-consumer-relief-for-illegal-credit-card-practices/| archive-date=May 21, 2016| url-status=live}}</ref>

===WikiLeaks===
In October 2009, [[Julian Assange]] of [[WikiLeaks]] claimed that his organization possessed a 5 gigabyte [[hard drive]] formerly used by a Bank of America executive and that Wikileaks intended to publish its contents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9139180/Wikileaks_plans_to_make_the_Web_a_leakier_place |title=Wikileaks plans to make the Web a leakier place |first=Dan |last=Nystedt |date=October 9, 2009 |work=[[Computerworld]] |accessdate=December 19, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217211520/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9139180/Wikileaks_plans_to_make_the_Web_a_leakier_place |archive-date=December 17, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2010, ''[[Forbes]]'' published an interview with Assange in which he stated his intent to publish information which would turn a major U.S. bank "inside out".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/11/29/wikileaks-julian-assange-wants-to-spill-your-corporate-secrets |title=WikiLeaks' Julian Assange Wants To Spill Your Corporate Secrets |author=Andy Greenberg |date=November 29, 2010 |work=Forbes |accessdate=December 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218034911/http://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/11/29/wikileaks-julian-assange-wants-to-spill-your-corporate-secrets/ |archive-date=December 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> In response to this announcement, Bank of America stock dropped 3.2%.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bank-of-america-shares-fall-on-wikileaks-fears/ |title=Bank Of America Shares Fall On WikiLeaks Fears |agency=Associated Press |date=November 30, 2010 |work=CBS News |accessdate=February 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204124135/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bank-of-america-shares-fall-on-wikileaks-fears/ |archive-date=February 4, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In December 2010, Bank of America announced that it would no longer service requests to transfer funds to WikiLeaks,<ref name="CB1">{{cite web| last=Lundin| first=Leigh| title=WikiLicks| url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=15747| work=Crime| publisher=Criminal Brief| location=Orlando| date=February 20, 2011| access-date=February 22, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025082942/http://criminalbrief.com/?p=15747| archive-date=October 25, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref> stating that "Bank of America joins in the actions previously announced by [[MasterCard]], [[PayPal]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] Europe and others and will not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for WikiLeaks...

===Mortgage business===
In 2010 the state of [[Arizona]] launched an investigation into Bank of America for misleading homeowners who sought to modify their [[mortgage loan]]s.

In response to the investigation, the bank has given some modifications on the condition that the homeowners remove some information criticizing the bank online.<ref>{{cite web| last=Garofalo| first=Pat| title=Bank Of America's Offer To Homeowners: We'll Modify Loans If You'll Erase All The Mean Things Said About Us On Twitter| work=[[ThinkProgress]]| date=January 26, 2012| url=http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/01/26/412273/bank-of-america-buys-silence-fraud-investigation/| accessdate=January 26, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126233510/http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/01/26/412273/bank-of-america-buys-silence-fraud-investigation/| archive-date=January 26, 2012| url-status=live}}</ref>

===Former buildings===
The [[Robert B. Atwood Building]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] was at one time named the Bank of America Center, renamed in conjunction with the bank's acquisition of building tenant Security Pacific Bank. This particular branch was later acquired by Alaska-based Northrim Bank and moved across the street to the [[Linny Pacillo Parking Garage]].

The [[Bank of America Building (Providence)]] opened in 1928 as the Industrial Trust Building and remains the tallest building in Rhode Island. Through a number of mergers it was later known as the Industrial National Bank building and the Fleet Bank building. The building was leased by Bank of America from 2004 to 2012 and has been vacant since March 2013. The building is commonly known as the Superman Building based on a popular belief that it was the model for the [[Daily Planet]] building in the [[Superman]] comic books.

The [[Miami Tower]] iconic in its appearance in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' was known as the Bank of America Tower for many years. It is located in [[Downtown Miami]]. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed it on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places as the Bank of America Tower.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aiaflatop100.org/Current-Standings.cfm| title=Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places| publisher=AIA Florida| access-date=October 24, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429200439/http://www.aiaflatop100.org/Current-Standings.cfm| archive-date=April 29, 2012| url-status=live}}</ref>
