=== 2010: Nobel Peace Prize ===
{{main|2010 Nobel Peace Prize}}
The Chinese-Norwegian relationship ran into a large setback in 2010 because the Norwegian parliament-appointed Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the prize to incarcerated Chinese human rights activist, [[Liu Xiaobo]].  China reacted strongly, saying that relations between their two countries had been damaged.<ref name=infuriates>MacKinnon, Mark (9 October 2010).

Elsewhere, performances of a Norwegian musical scheduled for the following month starring [[Alexander Rybak]], winner of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], also fell victim to the diplomatic fallout, according to the musical's composer.<ref>Deshayes, Pierre-Henry (12 October 2010).

Retrieved 10 June 2011.</ref> In early December, Norway announced that its bilateral trade talks with China had been indefinitely put on hold. Haakon Hjelde, Norway's negotiator alleged the postponement was not directly linked to the award, but Henning Kristofferson, director of international relations of the [[Norwegian School of Management|BI Norwegian School of Management]], was certain that this was a retaliatory move. He said that Beijing had been "very clear that the prize was a big mistake and that it would damage relations."<ref name=20101203Reuters>Fouche, Gwladys; Gibbs, Walter (30 November 2010).

=== 2011 ===
Press secretary of Norway's foreign ministry ([[Hilde Steinfeld]]) confirmed in November 2011, the absence of bilateral talks during the last 12 months.<ref>http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/kina/artikkel.php?artid=10024175"''En del samarbeidsområder fortsetter, men det har ikke vært bilaterale samtaler det siste året, forteller kommunikasjonsrådgiver Hilde Steinfeld.''"</ref>

The finance committee of [[Stortinget|Norway's parliament]], cancelled its planned trip (''[[studiereise]]'') to China in spring 2012, after not having secured appointments with any leading government representatives of China.<ref>http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/kina/artikkel.php?artid=10024175"''Ingen ledere vil møte norske politikere ... Vi har lenge ønsket dette, men de har sagt at vi ikke kommer til å få til så mange møter. Da er det heller ikke noen vits å reise, sier [[Gunvor Eldegard]] (Ap). Hun er leder av finanskomiteens reisekomité. – [[Jørund Rytman]] (Frp) sier at komiteen valgte å skyve på studiereisen fra høsten 2011 til mars 2012 i håp om at forholdene skal normalisere seg, men så langt er det ingenting som tyder på at kineserne vil ta Norge inn igjen i varmen. Nå kan de ikke vente lenger. – Dette er jo veldig beklagelig. Kina spiller en dominerende rolle i verdensøkonomien. Derfor var det et ønske fra hele finanskomiteen å reise dit, sier Rytman, som også er medlem av reisekomiteen. – Høyres finanspolitiske talsmann [[Jan Tore Sanner]] tar kinesernes beslutning til etterretning. – Vi hadde en ambisjon om å reise dit, men tar til etterretning at det ikke lar seg gjøre. Ansvaret ligger på kinesiske myndigheter. Vi har ingenting å beklage.''"</ref>

The newspaper ''[[Klassekampen]]'' wrote that Norwegian "[[war ship]]s are being directed to Northern areas (''[[nordområdene]]'') because nations like Russia and China are showing increased interest for the natural resources of the North. – This is an important region for resources, and a number of nations are showing their interest there, but there is no imminent threat, says [[Minister of Defence (Norway)|Minister of Defence]] [[Espen Barth Eide]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Forsvaret vil beskytte nord|newspaper=[[Klassekampen]]|date=3 December 2011|page=16|language=Norwegian|quote=Forsvaret sender flere krigsskip til nordområdene fordi land som Russland og Kina viser økt interesse for naturressursene i nord. – Dette er jo en viktig ressursregion og en rekke land viser interesse for dette området, men det er ingen akutt trussel, sier forsvarsminister Espen Barth Eide.}}</ref>

=== 2013 ===
The standoff continues into 2013 with unofficial Chinese restrictions on Norwegian salmon and visas and China comparing Norway's action to a noose around the tiger's neck.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2013/10/28/why_is_china_snubbing_norway-2.html |title=Why Is China Snubbing Norway? |last1=Beam |first1=Christopher |date=28 October 2013 |website=www.realclearworld.com |publisher=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>

=== 2014 ===
A 22 April 2014 [[NRK]] article said that by not having Norwegian officials meet with [[Dalai Lama]] during his upcoming visit, "one sends a quite unfortunate signal, not only to Chinese authorities but to people in Tibet who are exposed to ever increasing repression".<ref name=Dalai>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/amnesty_-uheldig-dalai-nei-1.11678283|title=Amnesty: Uheldig Dalai-nei|last=NRK|date=22 April 2014}}</ref> A same day [[Dagbladet]] [[op-ed]] said that "We, as a nation, come across as being led by a president of parliament (and a Government?) that live by the ''moral'' [that] the ''[[brakkebaronene]]'' lived by during the war: Close the eyes for violations of human rights, forget the occupation, money [[trumph]]s [or decides]".<ref name=Oped>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/meninger/kronikk-kapitulasjonspresidenten/a/10147713/|title=Kronikk: Kapitulasjonspresidenten}}</ref>

Norway and China normalized its diplomatic and political bilateral relations, which had been frozen since 2010 when [[Liu Xiaobo]] received the Nobel Peace Prize.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-china-idUSKBN1480R4|title=Norway, China normalize ties after Nobel Peace Prize row|date=19 December 2016|newspaper=Reuters}}</ref>

=== 2019 ===

In July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Norway, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC condemning China's mistreatment of the [[Uyghurs]] as well as its mistreatment of other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the [[Xinjiang re-education camps]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Which Countries Are For or Against China's Xinjiang Policies? |url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/ |work=[[The Diplomat]] |date=15 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=More than 20 ambassadors condemn China's treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang {{!}} Xinjiang {{!}} The Guardian |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/more-than-20-ambassadors-condemn-chinas-treatment-of-uighurs-in-xinjiang |work=The Guardian|date=11 July 2019}}</ref>
