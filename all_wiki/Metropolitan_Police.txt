{{Law enforcement in the United Kingdom}}

The '''Metropolitan Police Service''' ('''MPS'''), formerly and still commonly known as the '''Metropolitan Police''' and informally as '''the Met''', '''Scotland Yard''', or '''the Yard''', is the [[Territorial police force#United Kingdom|territorial police force]] responsible for law enforcement in the [[Metropolitan Police District]], which currently consists of the 32 [[London boroughs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.met.police.uk/police-forces/metropolitan-police/areas/about-us/about-the-met/jurisdiction/|title=The Met's area of jurisdiction {{!}} The Met|website=www.met.police.uk|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> The MPD does not include the "square mile" of the [[City of London]], which is policed by the much smaller [[City of London Police]].

The Met also has significant national responsibilities, such as co-ordinating and leading on UK-wide national [[counter-terrorism]] matters and protecting the [[British Monarch|Royal Family]], certain members of [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]] and others as deemed appropriate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehallpages.net/news/archive/6064 |title=MPA&nbsp;— Metropolitan Police dedicated to protecting the UK from terrorism |publisher=whitehallpages.net |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724131809/http://www.whitehallpages.net/news/archive/6064 |archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> As the police force for the capital, the Met has significant unique responsibilities and challenges within its [[police area]], such as protecting 164 foreign embassies and [[High commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissions]],<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/priorities_and_how_we_are_doing/corporate/mps_business_plan_2017_2018.pdf|title=MPS Business Plan 2017-18 |access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref> policing City Airport and [[Heathrow Airport]], policing and protecting the [[Palace of Westminster]], and dealing with significantly more protests and events than any other force in the country, with 3,500 such events in 2016.<ref name=":1" />

As of September 2019, the Met had 41,399 full-time personnel. This included 30,940 police officers, 8,472 police staff, 1,273 [[police community support officer]]s and 714 designated officers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Police workforce, England and Wales: 31 September 2019|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-workforce-england-and-wales-30-september-2019|last=|first=|date=|website=GOV.UK|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> This number excludes the 1,838 [[Metropolitan Special Constabulary|special constables]], who work voluntarily part-time (a minimum of 16 hours a month) and who have the same powers and uniform as their regular colleagues. This makes the Metropolitan Police the largest [[List of police forces of the United Kingdom|police force in the United Kingdom]] in officer numbers by a significant margin, and one of the biggest in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/default.htm |title=Metropolitan Police Authority |accessdate=20 July 2006 |work=MPA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719203122/http://www.mpa.gov.uk/default.htm |archivedate=19 July 2006 }}</ref> Leaving its national responsibilities aside, the Met has the eighth-smallest [[police area]] (primary geographic area of responsibility) of the territorial police forces in the United Kingdom.

The overall operational leader of the force is the Commissioner, whose formal title is [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis]]. The Commissioner is answerable, responsible and accountable to [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the Queen]], the [[Home Office]] and the [[Mayor of London]], through the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime]]. The post of Commissioner was first held jointly by Sir [[Charles Rowan]] and Sir [[Richard Mayne]]. [[Cressida Dick]] was appointed Commissioner in April 2017.

A number of informal names and abbreviations are applied to the Metropolitan Police Service, the most common being ''the Met''. In colloquial London (or [[Rhyming slang|Cockney]]) slang, it is sometimes referred to as the ''Old Bill''.<ref name="metropolitan2">{{cite web |url=http://content.met.police.uk/Article/Origins-of-the-name-Old-Bill/1400015472442/1400015472442 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406123659/http://content.met.police.uk/Article/Origins-of-the-name-Old-Bill/1400015472442/1400015472442 |archive-date=6 April 2014 |title=Origins of the name "Old Bill" |publisher=Metropolitan Police |year=2009 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Met is also referred to as [[Scotland Yard]] after the location of its original headquarters in a road called [[Great Scotland Yard]] in [[Whitehall]].<ref>Douglas Browne (1956) ''The Rise of Scotland Yard: A History of the Metropolitan Police''</ref> The Met's current headquarters is [[New Scotland Yard (building)|New Scotland Yard]], situated on the [[Victoria Embankment]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Metropolitan Police Service}}
{{expand section|date=May 2020}}
The Metropolitan Police Service was founded in 1829 by [[Robert Peel]] under the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] and on 29 September of that year, the first constables of the service appeared on the streets of London.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.onthisday.com/day/september/29 |title=September 29: On This Day in History |work=OnThisDay.com |access-date=2017-09-28 |language=en}}</ref> In 1839, the [[Marine Police Force]], which had been formed in 1798, was amalgamated into the Metropolitan Police.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thamespolicemuseum.org.uk/h_police_3.html|title=Thames Police - History Page|website=www.thamespolicemuseum.org.uk}}</ref> In 1837, it also incorporated with the Bow Street Horse Patrol that had been organised in 1805.<ref>[http://www.met.police.uk/history/archives.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925200337/http://www.met.police.uk/history/archives.htm|date=25 September 2006}}</ref>

In 1999, the organisation was described as "institutionally racist" in the [[MacPherson Report|Macpherson Report]]. Just under twenty years later, police leaders said that this was no longer the case, but that the service would be "disproportionately white" for at least another one hundred years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/19/met-police-disproportionately-white-for-another-100-years|title=Met disproportionately white for another 100 years – police leaders|last=Dodd|first=Vikram|date=19 February 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref>

==Governance==
Since January 2012, the [[Mayor of London]] is responsible for the governance of the Metropolitan Police through the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime]] (MOPAC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk//what-we-do/mayors-office-policing-and-crime-mopac/about-mayors-office-policing-and-crime-mopac/mayor-mopac|title=The Mayor at MOPAC|date=2015-04-15|website=London City Hall|language=en|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref> The mayor is able to appoint someone to act on his behalf. {{As of|2019|04}}, the office-holder is Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, [[Sophie Linden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk//what-we-do/mayors-office-policing-and-crime-mopac/about-mayors-office-policing-and-crime-mopac/deputy-mayor-policing-and-crime|title=The Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime|date=2015-04-15|website=London City Hall|language=en|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref> The work of MOPAC is scrutinised by the Police and Crime Committee (also known as a [[police and crime panel]]) of the [[London Assembly]]. These structures were created by the [[Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011]] and replaced the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]]-appointed board created in 2000 by [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]].

==Police area and other forces==
The [[police area|area policed]] by the Metropolitan Police Service is known as the [[Metropolitan Police District]] (MPD). The Met was divided into 32 Borough Operational Command Units that directly aligned with the 32 [[London borough]]s covered. This situation has changed since 2017, as the Met has attempted to save money due to cuts in funding. There is currently a period of transition which will result in the MPD being divided into 12 Basic Command Units made up of two, three or four boroughs. There is criticism of these changes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-43033510 |title=Met to merge all policing boroughs |date=2018-02-12 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-10-06 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The [[City of London]] (which is not a London borough) is a separate police area and is the responsibility of the separate [[City of London Police]].

The [[Ministry of Defence Police]] is responsible for policing of [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] property throughout the United Kingdom, including [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)#Property portfolio|its headquarters]] in Whitehall and other MoD establishments across the MPD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modpoliceofficers.co.uk |title=Ministry of Defence Police |accessdate=28 December 2008 |publisher=MOD}}</ref>

The [[British Transport Police]] are responsible for policing of the [[Rail transport in the United Kingdom|rail network in the United Kingdom]], including London. Within London, they are also responsible for the policing of the [[London Underground]], [[Tramlink]], The [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)]] and the [[Docklands Light Railway]].<ref>[http://www.btp.police.uk/about_us.aspx About us]. Btp.police.uk. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.</ref>

The English part of the [[Royal Parks Constabulary]], which patrolled a number of Greater London's major parks, was merged with the Metropolitan Police in 2004, and those parks are now policed by the [[Royal Parks Operational Command Unit]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/about/police.cfm |title=Policing the Royal Parks&nbsp;– keeping you safe in the Royal Parks |publisher=Royalparks.org.uk |date=1 April 2004 |accessdate=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219220809/http://www.royalparks.org.uk/about/police.cfm |archivedate=19 February 2009 }}</ref> There is also a small park police force, the [[Kew Constabulary]], responsible for the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens]], whose officers have full police powers within the park. A few local authorities maintain their own borough park constabularies, including [[Wandsworth Parks and Events Police]], [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Parks Police|Kensington and Chelsea Parks Police]], [[Hammersmith and Fulham Parks Constabulary]], [[Havering Parks Constabulary]] and the [[Hampstead Heath Constabulary]]. All of which enjoy powers of arrest without warrant as constables<ref>https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/668480/response/1584347/attach/4/P%20EP%20Enforcement%20Policy.pdf?cookie_passthrough=1</ref>, however the officers of the latter have full police powers, much like officers of the Metropolitan Police on the Heath. The other parks police primarily focus on [[by-law]] enforcement, and as such, the Met handles all investigations. 

Metropolitan Police officers have legal jurisdiction throughout all of [[England and Wales]], including areas that have their own special police forces, such as the Ministry of Defence, as do all police officers of [[territorial police forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/30 |title=Police Act 1996 |website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> Officers also have limited powers in Scotland and Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/137 |title=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> Within the MPD, the Met will take over the investigation of any serious crime from the [[Ministry of Defence Police]] and to a lesser degree BTP, if it is deemed appropriate. Terrorist incidents and complex murder enquiries will almost always be investigated by the Met,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2008/028-2008/ |title=A protocol between police forces and the Ministry of Defence police - Home Office |website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130125102358/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2008/028-2008/ |archivedate=25 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/policies/railways_impact.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312051348/http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/policies/railways_impact.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref> with the assistance of any relevant specialist force, even if they are committed on Ministry of Defence or railway property.  A minor incursion into the normal jurisdiction of territorial police officers in England and Wales is that Met officers involved in the protection duties of the Royal Family and other VIPs have full police powers in Scotland and Northern Ireland in connection with those duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/99 |title=Police Act 1996 |website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>

==Organisation and structure==
{{Main|Organisation and structure of the Metropolitan Police Service}}

The Metropolitan Police Service is organised into the following directorates:<ref name="Home - The Met">{{cite web|url=https://www.met.police.uk/police-forces/metropolitan-police/areas/about-us/about-the-met/senior-management-team/ |title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk|accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref>

* [[Frontline Policing]]
* [[Met Operations]]
* [[Specialist Operations]]
* Directorate of Professionalism
* Shared Support Services (part of Met Headquarters)

Each is overseen by an Assistant Commissioner, or in the case of administrative departments, a director of police staff, which is the equivalent civilian staff grade. The management board is made up of the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioners and Directors.

==Ranks==
{{See also|Police ranks of the United Kingdom}}

The Metropolitan Police Service uses the standard British police ranks, indicated by shoulder boards, up to [[Chief Superintendent]], but uniquely has five ranks above that level instead of the standard three; namely Commander, Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/about/ranks.htm |title=Badges of Rank |accessdate=19 July 2006 |publisher=Metropolitan Police Service |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718172407/http://www.met.police.uk/about/ranks.htm |archivedate=18 July 2006}}</ref> All senior officers of the rank of Commander and above are [[chief police officer]]s of [[National Police Chiefs' Council|NPCC]] (previously [[Association of Chief Police Officers|ACPO]]) rank.

The Met approved the use of name badges in October 2003, with new recruits wearing the Velcro badges from September 2004. The badge consists of the wearer's rank, followed by their surname.<ref>{{cite web |author=Clerk and Treasurer |url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/x-cop/2003/031020/04/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220061603/http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/x-cop/2003/031020/04/ |archivedate=20 February 2012 |title=Report 4 of the 20 Oct 03 meeting of the Co-ordination and Policing Committee: Introduction of name badges |date=20 October 2003 |publisher=[[Metropolitan Police Authority]] |accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref>

The Met also has several active [[Police cadets in the United Kingdom|Volunteer Police Cadet]] units, which maintain their own internal rank structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/cadets/ |title=Volunteer Police Cadets |accessdate=19 July 2006 |publisher=Metropolitan Police Service}}</ref> The [[Metropolitan Special Constabulary]] is a contingent of part-time volunteer police officers and is attached to most Borough Operational Command Units. The [[Metropolitan Special Constabulary]] Ranks are as follows:
{{MET Special Rank Insignia}}
The prefix "Woman" in front of female officers' ranks has been obsolete since 1999. Members of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) up to and including the rank of Chief Superintendent prefix their ranks with "Detective". Detective ranks are equivalent in rank to their uniform counterparts.  Other departments, such as [[SO12|Special Branch]] and Child Protection, award non-detectives "Branch Detective" status, allowing them to use the "Detective" prefix. None of these detective ranks confer on the holder any extra pay or supervisory authority compared to their uniformed colleagues.

===Workforce===
The following is the current released workforce data for the ranks. The Chief officers rank covers all senior ranks as well as Special Constables covering all special constable ranks.

The Metropolitan Police Service consists of regular [[police officer]]s and volunteer part-time [[Metropolitan Special Constabulary|special constables]] (both of whom have full police powers), and employed civilian staff and [[police community support officer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/careers/pcso/ |title=Metropolitan Police PCSO |publisher=Metropolitan Police |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408130445/http://www.met.police.uk/careers/pcso/ |archivedate=8 April 2010 }}</ref> The Met was the first force to introduce PCSOs. Unlike police staff and PCSOs, police officers are not employees: they are [[Crown servant|servants of the crown]].  Funding for the Metropolitan police has been cut due to [[United Kingdom government austerity programme#Effects|austerity]].  Changes in the way the government pays for police pensions will lead to further cuts.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/london-met-police-pensions-money-extra-cost-a8588926.html London's cash-strapped police must find £130m per year to pay extra pensions costs despite 'end of austerity'] ''[[The Independent]]''</ref>

===Fleet===
The Met operates and maintains a fleet of nearly 5,000 vehicles, covering nearly 47&nbsp;million miles per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/fleet_mileage_and_accident_stati |title=Freedom of Information Request - Fleet Mileage & Accident Statistics| accessdate=26 March 2019 }}</ref> The fleet is used for a range of duties, including:<ref name=fleet>{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/disclosure_2011/february/2011010002376.pdf |title=Freedom of Information request - list of vehicles currently owned/operated by the Metropolitan Police Service|date=February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117022326/http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/disclosure_2011/february/2011010002376.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2012 }}</ref>
*'''Incident Response Vehicles (IRV)''': used for patrol and 999 emergency response.
*'''Q-cars:''' unmarked response vehicles, belonging to a variety of departments, that respond to incidents.
*'''Area Cars''': carry out the same role as IRVs, but the driver is an advanced driver and thus allowed to engage in pursuit, much like a Traffic unit.
* '''Armed Response Vehicle (ARV)''': Transports [[Authorised firearms officer]]s trained to ARV level to incidents, typically including firearms
* '''Traffic Units:''' respond to incidents on major roads, enforce traffic laws and encourage road safety.
*'''Collision Investigation Units (CIU):''' respond and appropriately investigate all major road traffic collisions on any road in the Metropolitan Police area.
* '''Protected Carriers''': used for public order duties.
* '''Station Vans''': used to transport both officers and suspects in a cage in the rear of the van.
* '''Commercial Vehicle Units''': used to respond to incidents involving commercial vehicles.
* '''CBRN Units''': used to mitigate chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents. These are identified by a large amount of equipment lockers on newer vans and a large array of detecting equipment on the top of older vans.
* '''Control Units''': used for incident command and control purposes.
* '''Armoured Multi-role Vehicles''': used for public order duties, airport duties or as required.
* '''General Purpose Vehicles''': used for general support and transportation duties of officers or equipment.
* '''Training Vehicles''': used to train police drivers under lights and sirens.
* '''Miscellaneous Vehicles''': such as horseboxes and trailers.

The majority of vehicles have a service life of three to five years; the Met replaces or upgrades between 800 and 1,000 vehicles each year. By 2012 the Met was marking all new marked vehicles with [[Battenburg markings]], a highly-reflective material on the side of the vehicles, chequered blue and yellow for the police, and in other colours for other services. The old livery was an [[Jam sandwich (police car)|orange stripe through the vehicle, with the force's logo]].

The [[National Police Air Service]] has a base at [[North Weald Airfield]], in Essex, which houses four helicopters to support the Met and surrounding forces.

A [[Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit|marine policing unit]] operates 22 vessels from its base in [[Wapping]].

The Metropolitan Police Service "screened out" 34,164 crimes the day they were reported in 2017 and did not investigate them further.  This compares to 13,019 the previous year. 18,093 crimes were closed in 24 hours during the first 5 months of 2018 making it likely that the 2017 total will be exceeded.  Crimes not being investigated include sexual assaults and arson, burglaries, thefts and assaults.  Some critics believe this shows the effect of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme#Effects|austerity]] on the force's ability to carry out its responsibilities.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/09/met-police-dropped-30000-criminal-investigations-in-first-24-hours-last-year Met police dropped 30,000 criminal investigations in first 24 hours last year] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

===Specialist units===
*[[File:POLICE BOAT RIVER THAMES.jpg|thumb|A [[Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit|marine policing unit]] on the [[River Thames]]]]'''[[Protection Command]]''' – This command is split into two branches:  Royalty and Specialist Protection (RASP) and [[Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection]] (PaDP).  RaSP provides personal armed protection for the [[Royal family]], [[Prime Minister]] and other ministers, ambassadors and visiting heads of state.  PaDP is responsible for providing armed officers to protect the Palace of Westminster, important residences such as [[Downing Street]] and the many embassies found located in London.  Royal Palaces are the responsibility of RaSP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Site/protectioncommand|title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk}}</ref> The [[Special Escort Group (Metropolitan Police)|Special Escort Group]] (SEG) are responsible for escorting the Royal Family, Prime Minister and other ministers, ambassadors and visiting heads of state, and occasionally prisoner transport. They use motorcyclists to halt traffic, and use armed cars at the rear of the escort for armed assistance and traffic control. Once the escort has passed, the roads are immediately opened, different from how the United States handle police escorts, which tend to close the road off completely. All SEG officers are armed, the motorcycle officers carrying the [[Glock 17]], and the car officers which utilize the more effective firearms such as the [[Heckler & Koch G36|G36]] and [[MP5]] semi-automatic carbines. Their motto is "We lead, others follow".
* '''[[Aviation Security Operational Command Unit|Aviation Policing]]''' – Responsible for providing policing (with the majority being armed officers) at [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[London City Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Site/securitycommand|title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk}}</ref>
* '''[[Flying Squad]]''' – A unit which investigates and intercepts armed robberies. The name comes from the fact its members travelled across divisional and borough boundaries.
* '''[[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Trident Gang Crime Command]]''' – Investigates and works to prevent [[gang crime]].
* '''[[Roads and Transport Policing Command|Roads and Transport Policing Command]]''' – Provides policing for the transport network in London.

* '''[[Specialist Firearms Command]]''' – (SCO19) Responsible for providing armed response and support across the whole of London with Authorised Firearms Officers (AFO) travelling in ARVs (Armed Response Vehicles) responding to calls involving firearms and weapons. SCO19 has a number of CTSFOs (Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officers), who have additional training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Site/sco19|title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk}}</ref> 
* '''[[Metropolitan Police Dog Support Unit|Dog Support Unit]]''' – (DSU) Provides highly trained dogs and police handlers. They are trained to detect drugs and firearms, respond to searches, missing people, and fleeing suspects. There is also a division which has bomb-detection dogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Site/dogsupportunit|title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk}}</ref>
* '''[[Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit|Marine Policing Unit]]''' – (MPU) Provides policing on the waterways of London, responding to situations in the [[River Thames]] and tracking and stopping illegal vessels entering and exiting London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Site/marinepolicingunit|title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk}}</ref>
* '''[[Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch|Mounted Branch]]''' – Provides policing on horseback in London. One of their duties is escorting the [[Royal Guard]] down [[The Mall, London|The Mall]], into and out of [[Buckingham Palace]] every morning from April to July, then occasionally through the remainder of the year. They also provide public order support and are commonly called to police football matches in the event of any unrest. All officers are trained in public order tactics on horseback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Site/mountedbranch|title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk}}</ref>
* '''[[Territorial Support Group]]''' – (TSG) Highly trained officers, specialised in public order and large scale riots responding around London in marked Public Order Vehicles (POV) with 6 constables and a sergeant in each POV. They aim to: secure the capital against terrorism, respond to any disorder in London, and reduce priority crime through borough support. They respond in highly-protective uniform during riots or large disorder, protecting themselves from any thrown objects or hazards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Site/tsg|title=Home - The Met|website=content.met.police.uk}}</ref>

In addition to the headquarters at New Scotland Yard, there are many [[police station]]s in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/contacts/AZPhonenumbers.htm |title=Met Police stations: A-Z Directory |publisher=Metropolitan Police |accessdate=8 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205194643/http://www.met.police.uk/contacts/AZPhonenumbers.htm |archivedate=5 February 2009 }}</ref> These range from large borough headquarters staffed around the clock every day to smaller stations, which may be open to the public only during normal business hours, or on certain days of the week. In 2017, there were 73 working front counters open to the public in London.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-40607533 | title=Half of London police stations to close| work=BBC News| date=2017-07-14}}</ref>

Most police stations can easily be identified from one or more blue lamps located outside the entrance, which were introduced in 1861.

The oldest Metropolitan police station, which opened in [[Bow Street]] in 1881, closed in 1992 and the adjoining [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] heard its last case on 14 July 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5179270.stm |title=BBC: Bow Street court closes its doors |work=BBC News |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=8 June 2009}}</ref> The oldest operational police station in London is in [[Wapping]], which opened in 1908. It is the headquarters of the [[Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit|marine policing unit]] (formerly known as Thames Division), which is responsible for policing the [[River Thames]]. It also houses a mortuary and the River Police Museum.

[[Paddington Green Police Station]], which is no longer operational, received much publicity for its housing of terrorism suspects in an underground complex prior to its closure in 2017.

In 2004, there was a call from the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] for more imaginative planning of police stations to aid in improving relations between police forces and the wider community.<ref>[http://www.ippr.org.uk/ecomm/files/reinventing_police_station.pdf Institute for Public Policy Research: Re-inventing the police station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927074315/http://www.ippr.org.uk/ecomm/files/reinventing_police_station.pdf |date=27 September 2006 }}</ref>

The [[Police Roll of Honour Trust]] lists and commemorates all British police officers killed in the line of duty.

==Issues==

During the 2020 [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the Metropolitan police were found to be 2.17 time as likely to issue fines to black people for lockdown breaches, relative to the general population. This could suggest that they were disproportionately policing black people. This could also suggest that black people were more likely to breach lockdown restrictions. Black people were responsible for several nights of unrest due to unlicensed music events during the lockdown period.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-53176472 |accessdate=21 September 2020}}</ref> The Met, the biggest force in the country, was one of the forces least likely to use enforcement powers, compared with other forces.

The Met said: “In total, more white people received FPNs [fixed penalty notices] or were arrested than other individual ethnic groups. However, when compared with the composition of the resident population, higher proportions of those in black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups were issued with FPNs or arrested across London as a whole.

“The reasons for this are likely to be complex and reflect a range of factors. This includes interactions between the areas subject to significant proactive policing activity targeting crime hotspots and both the variation in the age profile and geographical distribution of ethnic groups in London.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dodd |first1=Vikram |title=Met police twice as likely to fine black people over lockdown breaches – research |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research |website=Guardian |accessdate=23 June 2020}}</ref>
