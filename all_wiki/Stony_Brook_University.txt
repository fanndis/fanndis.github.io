== History ==
===Origins in Oyster Bay===
[[File:Coe Hall - PFA; January 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park|Coe Hall]] on the original Oyster Bay campus (used 1957–1964)]]The State University of New York at Stony Brook was established in [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]] in 1957 as the State University College on Long Island (SUCOLI), by the governor and state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Established almost a decade after the creation of New York's public higher education system, the institution was envisioned as a college for the preparation of secondary school teachers.<ref name="SBAtAGlance">{{Cite news| url=http://www.sunysb.edu/sb/ataglance.shtml | title=Stony Brook At A Glance | publisher= Stony Brook University | year= 2007 | accessdate=March 1, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Staller Center2.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Staller Center for the Arts, located on the campus of Stony Brook]]
[[Ward Melville]], a philanthropist and businessman from the [[Three Village Central School District|Three Village]] area in western Suffolk County donated over {{Convert|400|acres}} of land to the state for the development of a state university<ref name="Statesmanv1n1" /> and in 1962 the institution relocated to Stony Brook<ref name="SBULibrariesTimeline" /> and officially renamed as the State University of New York at Stony Brook. However, the longer name has fallen out of favor; since 2005, it has usually been called simply Stony Brook University (SBU).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/11/education/to-woo-students-colleges-choose-names-that-sell.html|title=To Woo Students, Colleges Choose Names That Sell|last=Finder|first=Alan|date=2005-08-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-05|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The campus had 782 students enrolled in 1962, but enrollment had increased more than tenfold by 1969, surpassing the 8,000 mark,<ref name="EnrollmentHistory1957-2010">{{Cite news| url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/offires/enrollment/TotalEnrollment.pdf |title=Stony Brook University: Enrollment History 1957-2010|publisher=Stony Brook University |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref> fueled by the large funding of public higher education in the Sputnik era. In 1963, only three years after the release of the Heald Report, the Governor commissioned the "Education of Health Professions" (Muir Report) report.<ref name="MuirReport">{{Cite news |url=http://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/bitstream/handle/1951/36209/Muir%20Report.pdf |title=Education for the Health Professions Report (Muir Report)|publisher=State of New York|year=1960|last1=Muir|first1=Malcolm|last2=Parran|first2=Thomas|last3=Willard |first3=William R.|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref> The report outlined the need for expansion of the university system to prepare medical professionals for the future needs of the state.<ref name="MuirReport" /> The report was particularly important for Stony Brook as it recommended creation of a Health Science Center and academic hospital at the campus to serve the need of the fastest-growing counties (Nassau and Suffolk) in New York at the time.<ref name="MuirReport" />

===Growth===
In 1965, the State University appointed [[John S. Toll]], a renowned physicist from the [[University of Maryland]] as the second president of Stony Brook.<ref name="SBULibrariesTimeline" /> In 1966, the university set forth initial timetables for the development of the Health Science Center, which would house the university's health programs and [[Stony Brook University Medical Center|hospital]]. Despite the budgetary concerns and challenges from Albany, the university released a formalized plan early in 1968 and funding for recruitment of faculty was provided. At the same time, residential housing was expanded to 3,000, the Stony Brook Union opened in 1970, and in 1971, the massive expansion project for the campus library (named in memory of Frank Melville Jr., father of philanthropist [[Ward Melville]]) was completed.

Despite the fast-paced growth, campus infrastructure often struggled to keep pace: overcrowding,<ref name="SBULibrariesTimeline1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/collections/archives/timeline.html |title=Stony Brook University Timeline "Buildings on West Campus are filled to capacity.

In January 1968, the infamous "Operation Stony Brook" drug raid resulted in the arrest of twenty nine students<ref name="FromSUCOLItoSBU" /> and in the fall of 1968, tension climaxed as the administration and students decided on a three-day moratorium to bring together the entire university with the goal of improving communication between the students, faculty, and administration. Despite the initiatives of the "Three Days" in improving the campus, in February 1973, a tragedy occurred when a freshman student fell to his death into one of the many uncovered steam pipe manholes at the university.<ref name="FromSUCOLItoSBU" /><ref name="SBIndependent">{{Cite news |url=http://www.sbindependent.org/campus-mythology/ |title=Stony Brook Independent: Campus Mythology|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}</ref>

The 1970s witnessed the growth of the university and its transformation as a major research institution within New York's public school system, with strong graduate programs and scientific breakthroughs like the development of [[magnetic resonance imaging]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/chemistry/about/BoMRI.html|title=Birth of MRI|website=www.stonybrook.edu|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> But the university lagged significantly in undergraduate education, prioritizing graduate education and research over undergraduate studies and student life. By 1975, enrollment had reached 16,000 and expansion crossed over Nicolls Road with the construction of the Health Science Center, which would be completed in 1980.

In 1981, [[John Marburger]] was inaugurated as the third president of the university and continued the expansion of the institution. By the late 1980s, the administration affirmed the need to improve other areas of the institution, which included undergraduate education, student and residential life, and intercollegiate athletics. The university approved a decision to transition athletics to the Division I of the NCAA and followed with the construction of the Stony Brook Arena and the expansion of the Indoor Sports Complex.

===Recent developments===
The 1990s affirmed Stony Brook's success at building a research university with a strong undergraduate education. Under the leadership of its fourth president, [[Shirley Strum Kenny]], the administration sought out to showcase the value of the institution. Kenny was responsible for campus wide improvement projects which included large scale landscaping, renovations of every residence hall, the continued growth of the athletics programs, the improvement of student life, ever increasing research expenditures, a branding/marketing campaign, and the university's increasing ties with private philanthropy.

In the mid-1990s, the school began to distance itself from the SUNY system, as Kenny believed that the SUNY name was hurting the school's reputation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americaeast.com/news/2006/6/22/785740.aspx|title=Feisty President at SUNY Stony Brook Has Led a Makeover of 'Mudville'|website=americaeast.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref>

[[File:Simons Center for Geometry and Physics.JPG|thumb|right|The Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, one of the many gifts received by the university in the 2000s]]
In 1998, the university became one of the top 100 of American research universities in the [[U.S. News & World Report]]. That same year, the university and Battelle Memorial Institute were chosen by the Department of Energy as joint operators of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, joining a selective group of universities that operated national laboratories across the nation. Enrollment reached the 20,000 mark in 2001, and the administration's improvement efforts climaxed with the invitation to the highly selective [[Association of American Universities]], an organization of sixty-two universities across North America committed to a strong system of research and education.

[[File:Wang Center.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Charles B. Wang Center]]]]
2002 saw the opening of the $22 million [[Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium]] and the inauguration of the massive [[Charles B. Wang Center]] dedicated to Asian and American culture, funded by a $50 million donation from Charles B. Wang. At the time, it was the largest private donation to a SUNY institution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/charles-wang-philanthropy-1.22238388|title=Charles Wang's philanthropy reached around the world|website=Newsday|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> In 2003, chemistry professor [[Paul Lauterbur]] received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research and discovery of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which was instrumental in the development of NMR Imaging (MRI) while at Stony Brook. In 2005, the university bought the Flowerfield property adjacent to campus through eminent domain as land for the development of a Research and Development Park. Plans for a law school were in the talks but scrapped shortly after.

In 2009, president Shirley Strum Kenny stepped down, and in May, [[Samuel L. Stanley|Dr. Samuel Stanley, Jr.]] was announced as Stony Brook's fifth president. The late 2000s saw the university receive historic philanthropic donations. Hedge funder [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] made multiple multi-million donations, including a $25 million donation to the Stony Brook Foundation in 2006, a $60 million donation for the development of the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] in 2008, and a landmark $150 million donation to the university in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwindurgy/2011/12/14/billionaire-hedge-funder-donates-150-million-to-suny-stony-brook/|title=Billionaire Hedge Funder Donates $150 Million to SUNY Stony Brook|last=Durgy|first=Edwin|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> Other major donations were provided by alumni [[Joe Nathan]], [[Stuart Goldstein]], and [[Glenn Dubin]] for major renovation of athletic facilities. In 2010 Dr. Stanley announced Project 50 Forward, a comprehensive plan for the development of the university in the next fifty years with a focus on "operational excellence, academic greatness, and building for the future."

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of Stony Brook University}}

===Main campus===
The main campus is in the historic [[North Shore (Long Island)|north shore]] [[political subdivisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]] near the geographic midpoint of [[Long Island]], approximately {{convert|50|mi|0}} east of Manhattan and {{convert|62|mi|0}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcmap.com/search?Q=41%ef%bf%bd02&EL=41%ef%bf%bd02&ET=Fix+location&P=41%ef%bf%bd02|title=Fix location 41ï¿½02 - Great Circle Mapper|website=www.gcmap.com}}</ref> west of [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]]. Bounded to the north by [[New York State Route 25A]] (North Country Road) the campus is subdivided into "West Campus" and "East Campus" by the thoroughfare [[County Route 97 (Suffolk County, New York)|County Road 97]] (Nicolls Road). The Ashley Schiff Forest Preserve separates the South Campus from West Campus. The [[Long Island Rail Road]] serves the community with the [[Stony Brook (LIRR station)|Stony Brook station]] situated along the northern edge of the campus.

====West====
[[File:SBU01.JPG|thumb|View toward the Chemistry Building on Stony Brook's West Campus|alt=]]
[[File:Stony brook west campus.jpg|thumb|Stony Brook West Campus]]
The west campus is the center of the academic life of the university. It houses the majority of academic, athletic, and undergraduate student housing facilities while also being the original site of the university.

The modern campus is centered around the Academic Mall, which stretches for more than a quarter of a mile from the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] at the west end to the Administration Building at the east end. The Academic Mall includes the [[Stony Brook Student Activity Center|Student Activity Center]], [[Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library]], [[Staller Center for the Arts]], Humanities building, Psychology A & B, Harriman Hall, Frey Hall (previously known as Old Chemistry), the Earth and Space Sciences Building, Math Tower, and Physics building.
[[File:AcademicMallSBU2019 2.jpg|left|thumb|The Academic Mall]]
The Engineering Quad is located near the Academic Mall, and contains the Engineering, Light Engineering, Heavy Engineering, and Computing Center facilities. The Javits Lecture Center, Social and Behavioral Sciences Building, Computer Science building, New Computer Science building and Student Union facilities are also on the west campus. The Life Sciences complex, also on the west campus, consists of the Life Sciences Building, Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology, Centers for Molecular Medicine, Bioengineering building, and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science.

Among the latest additions to the campus are the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, the new [http://sb.cc.stonybrook.edu/news/general/2014-09-19-sbu-rec-center-named-for-campus-builder.php Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center], the Hilton Garden Inn hotel, Frey Hall, and a new Computer Science building. The [[Staller Center]], which contains the largest movie screen in [[Long Island]]'s [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], holds the annual [[Stony Brook Film Festival]].

The athletic facilities are in the northwest quadrant of west campus, which include the [[Stony Brook Sports Complex]], [[Island Federal Credit Union Arena]], [[Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium]], [[Joe Nathan Field]], [[Stony Brook University Track|University Track]], and University Field.

====South====
The South Campus is about half a mile south of the Academic Mall and separated from West Campus by the Ashley Schiff Forest Preserve. It is home to the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS), the Cody Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, and the University Police headquarters.

====Research and development====
The [[Stony Brook University Research and Development Park|Research and Development Park]] is on Stony Brook Road, a mile from the center of campus. On November 3, 2005, the university announced it had formally acquired {{convert|246|acre|ha}} of the adjacent Flowerfield property, originally owned by the [[St. James, New York|St. James]] [[Gyrodyne Company of America]], through [[eminent domain]], three years after the university had expressed its desire to acquire the property.<ref name="Southhamptonbuy" />

Stony Brook is using this property as a Research and Development Park, similar to other university-affiliated [[Science Park|science parks]] around the country. The campus will ultimately house ten new buildings. The first building, the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology, was completed in October 2008. Construction for the Advanced Energy Research and Technology Center, designed by [[Flad Architects]], commenced in the Summer of 2008 and is open as of spring 2010.

====East====
[[File:04272013UniversityHospitalStonyBrook.jpg|right|thumb|Stony Brook Hospital at the East Campus in 2013]]
The East Campus is separated from the main campus by Nicolls Road (County Road 97). It is home to the [[Stony Brook University Hospital]] and the Health Science Center. Stony Brook University Hospital, completed in 1980, is Suffolk County's only tertiary hospital and Level 1 Trauma Center, and the only [[Stony Brook University School of Medicine|academic medical center]] in Suffolk County&mdash;larger also than any in Nassau County.<ref>Nassau County has the [[New York College of Osteopathic Medicine]] (NYCOM) of [[New York Institute of Technology]] (NYIT) since 1977, and the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine at Hofstra University opened in 2010.</ref>
The hospital is the largest in Suffolk County, and the attached Health Sciences Center (HSC) and Basic Science Tower (BST) houses numerous laboratories, the [[Stony Brook University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], the nursing school, and numerous Allied Health programs. The area also includes the Ambulatory Surgery Center and the Center for Outpatient Services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stonybrook.edu/newsroom/press-release/medical/121908smokefree/|title=STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY EAST CAMPUS FACILITIES, GROUNDS RING IN THE NEW YEAR BY BECOMING SMOKE-FREE {{!}}|date=2008-12-19|website=SBU News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>

Construction on the Medical and Research Translation (MART) building began in November 2013, and the 240,000 square foot building opened on November 1, 2018, with its $194 million cost funded by state grants and donations from Jim Simons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/medical-and-research-translation-mart-building-stony-brook-university/|title=Medical and Research Translation (MART) Building, Stony Brook University - Pharmaceutical Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://portjefferson.greaterlongisland.com/2018/11/02/stony-brook-celebrates-new-medical-and-research-translation-and-cancer-center-with-ribbon-cutting/|title=Stony Brook celebrates new cancer and research facility with ribbon cutting|date=2018-11-02|website=GreaterPortJeff - greaterlongisland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> The MART building is the home to the Stony Brook Cancer Center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/business/stony-brook-cancer-center-1.22691338|title=Stony Brook set to open $194 million cancer center|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> In November 2019, Stony Brook Medicine opened a four-story, $73 million expansion to the Stony Brook Children's Hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/business/stony-brook-hospital-pediatric-1.37616524|title=Children's hospital to open 4-story addition in November|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/news/health/children-s-hospital-stony-brook-1.38152385|title=Stony Brook Children's Hospital unveils kid-friendly building|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>

Also in the east side of campus are the Chapin apartments, which provide housing for graduate students. The Long Island High Technology Incubator, one of the four business incubators of the university, is a short walk north of the hospital. The Long Island State Veterans Home serving the Long Island veteran community is in this part of campus.

===Manhattan Campus===
{{Main|Stony Brook Manhattan}}
In 2002, the university established a presence in [[Manhattan]] with the opening of [[Stony Brook Manhattan]]. The original site was at 401 Park Avenue South; a newer operation opened in late 2008 in the adjacent building on the third floor of 387 Park Avenue South. The university consolidated operations in 2011 to just the 3rd floor of 387 Park Avenue South, with a classroom entrance around the corner at 101 East 27th Street. The {{convert|18000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} site allows Stony Brook to offer professional and graduate courses targeted towards students in [[New York City]]; undergraduate courses are held primarily during the summer and winter sessions. Conferences and special events take place throughout the year. In February 2017 however, the lease for this campus was terminated, and there are no classes offered at this location.

===Southampton Campus===
{{Main|Stony Brook Southampton}}
On March 24, 2006, the university completed the purchase of the {{convert|81|acre||adj=|abbr=}} [[Southampton College]] (on the east end of Long Island) property from [[Long Island University]] with the intent to develop it as a full college campus focusing on academic programs related to the environment and sustainability.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/artman/publish/article_1215.shtml |title=Stony Brook University Completes Purchase of Former Southampton College Property|publisher=Stony Brook University|date=October 4, 2006|accessdate=July 1, 2007}}</ref> Stony Brook expanded its original program, started in the fall of 2005, when it offered an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from Long Island University. An enrollment of about 2,000 students is expected within the next five years. Professor Martin Schoonen was appointed interim dean of Southampton campus on August 3, 2006, and conservationist Mary Pearl was appointed dean and vice president in March 2009.

[[File:Southampton-college-windmill.jpg|thumb|right|Southampton campus, with its prominent windmill]]On April 7, 2010, the university had suspended residential programs and transferred sustainability programs to the main campus.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/sbsouthampton/SEVERE_STATE_FUNDING_REDUCTIONS_FORCE_STONY_BROOK_UNIVERSITY_TO_MAKE_STRATEGIC_CUTS.shtml |title=Severe State Funding Reductions Force Stony Brook University to Make Strategic Cuts|publisher=Stony Brook University |date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> The change was prompted by severe state budget cuts. Although the Marine Sciences and Graduate Writing programs are still in session at Southampton, undergraduates were relocated to the main campus. As a result of the suspension of residential programs, all dining services and retail operations were suspended by the Faculty Student Association. The old LIU radio station and [[National Public Radio]] affiliate no longer operate on the campus.

In September 2011 Stony Brook Southampton began offering an undergraduate program called Semester by the Sea, where students attend undergraduate classes to study the Ocean or the Arts. Students studying the Ocean are immersed in marine topics that are enhanced with close proximity to the water, a fleet of research vessels and graduate research projects that are ongoing. Students studying the Arts are engaged in studies for filmmaking and creative writing.  Both programs offer a Public Lecture Series.

As of 2015, the Stony Brook Southampton campus has shown growth, despite almost being closed down in 2010. Programs had been added back and the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York approved a long-awaited partnership agreement between Southampton and Stony Brook University hospitals. Enrollment increased to over 400, after being around 175, three years following the addition of new funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/East-End/95571/After-Nearly-Closing-In-2010-Stony-Brook-Southampton-Has-Grown-And-Prospered |title=After Nearly Closing In 2010, Stony Brook Southampton Has Grown And Prospered |publisher=27east |date=February 11, 2015 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref>

As of 2019, Stony Brook University operates the [[Stony Brook Southampton Hospital]] with plans to take ownership of more eastern Long Island hospitals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crainsnewyork.com/health-care/eastern-long-island-hospital-joins-stony-brook-medicine|title=Eastern Long Island Hospital joins Stony Brook Medicine|date=July 2, 2019|website=Crain's New York Business}}</ref>

===South Korea===
In May 2009, the SUNY board of trustees granted Dr. Stanley authority to conduct negotiation measures towards a partnership campus between Stony Brook and the South Korean government. Stony Brook would be joining other universities in a univerCITY complex, potentially involving other schools such as North Carolina State University, George Mason, Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, and Boston University. The campus would be a global university with intentions to offer a diverse learning environment while at the same time stimulating the [[economy of South Korea]].

In July 2011, Dr. Stanley announced that the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (South Korea)|Ministry of Education, Science and Technology]] in South Korea has approved the establishment of SUNY Korea as part of [[Songdo International Business District]] in [[Incheon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.suny.edu/sunynews/News.cfm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805224948/http://www.suny.edu/sunynews/News.cfm?filname=2011-07-25-SUNYKoreaRelease.htm|url-status=dead|title=suny.edu - SUNY Brand as Symbol of Excellence: Chancellor, Stony Brook President Announce New Partnership in South Korea|archive-date = August 5, 2012}}</ref> The campus was expected to begin academic programs in March 2012 with an enrollment of 200.<ref>http://www.stonybrook.edu/pres/korea.html</ref>

===Art on campus===
Stony Brook University has four gallery spaces on campus. As was the desire of donor Paul W. Zuccaire, the '''Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery''', formerly known as the University Art Gallery, showcases professional exhibitions as well as annual graduate and undergraduate student works. The Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery is in the [[Staller Center|Staller Center for the Arts]].

Also on campus is the '''Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center's Art Gallery''', which features works from Latino and Latin American artists as well as local artists who fall under that category. '''The SAC Art Gallery''' is a center for interactive and participatory art projects.

The Tabler Center for Arts, Culture, and Humanities includes an art gallery and blackbox theater performance space.

The Simons Center for Geometry and Physics includes an art gallery as well.

| The Graduate School || -
|}
The Stony Brook University consists of a main campus in Stony Brook, and additional satellite campuses in [[Stony Brook Southampton|Southampton]] and [[SUNY Korea|South Korea]]. The university is composed of twelve schools and colleges. By enrollment, the largest college or school is the College of Arts and Science.

The university is governed by the [[State University of New York]] board of trustees, a body of eighteen members which regulate all the individual units of the SUNY system. The trustees have the authority to appoint the president of each state-operated institution, grant all degree diplomas and certificates for the completion of studies at any state-operated campus, and regulation of admissions, tuition, curricula, and all other matters pertaining to the operation and administration of each state-operated campus.  The president of Stony Brook is the principal executive officer of the university. The position was first held by John Francis Lee and is held by the sixth president in the institution's history, [[Maurie McInnis]], who took office on July 1, 2020.

===Endowment===
Stony Brook's [[financial endowment]] is managed by the Stony Brook Foundation. The foundation was established in 1965 as a not-for-profit corporation under the New York State Education Law.<ref name="SBULibrariesTimeline" /> Chartered to collect and manage gifts from private and non-state resources to supplement the funding of the university and managed by a voluntary Board of Trustees.<ref name="SBULibrariesTimeline" /> Donations can be made to a wide selection of funds which benefit different areas of the university. In 2012 the endowment was valued at approximately $125 million with total assets amounting to nearly $350 million and has fully recovered from the losses endured in the 2008 economic downturn.<ref name="AnnualReportDonor">{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/giving/annual_report/ar_2012/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225145325/http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/giving/annual_report/ar_2012/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 25, 2013|title=Annual Report to Donors|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> After a strong fundraising campaign led by Jim Simon's $150 million donation, the university amounted to more than $180 million in fundraising for the 2011-12 year and raised $200 million by March 2013.<ref name="Fundraising200million">{{cite web |url=http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/Stony_Brook_University_Secures_200_Million_in_12_Months.shtml|title=Stony Brook University Secures $200 Million in 12 Months|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref> It is the second largest endowment among [[State University of New York]] university centers behind the [[University at Buffalo]]. However, the University's endowment remains far below the average of its [[Association of American Universities]] peers.

===Student government===
{{main|Undergraduate Student Government at Stony Brook University}}
Housed in the Student Activity Center, the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) is the governing body representing the undergraduate students of the university. The main functions of USG involve regulation, funding, and recognizing official clubs and organizations of the university. Undergraduate students are obligated to pay a Student Activity Fee per semester which is then administered by the Undergraduate Student Government. USG manages the yearly Homecoming events, Roth Pond Regatta and the traditional end-of-the year Brookfest concert and a series of concerts and events branded as "Stony Brook Concerts" that occur throughout the academic year while also directly funding undergraduate organizations, clubs, and other student services. USG at Stony Brook has a long history going back to the founding of the Student Polity Association (Polity) in 1959. After the controversial de-certification of Polity by the administration in 2002, USG was founded in 2003.

Like USG, the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) is the governing body representing the graduate students of the university. The GSO advocates for graduate student interests to senior university administration, and is part of shared governance at the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/univsenate/ |title=Stony Brook University Senate |publisher=Stonybrook.edu |date=November 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 14, 2017}}</ref> Graduate students pay a per-semester activity fee which is used to fund events and programs for the Graduate community. The GSO provides services for graduate students including funding for conferences, seminars, speaker events, travel to Brookhaven and Coldspring Harbor Laboratories, funding for social events, departmental organizations, and student clubs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sbgso.org/index.php/funding/forms1 |title=SBU Graduate Student Organization - Applications and Instructions |publisher=Sbgso.org |accessdate=September 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914220056/http://sbgso.org/index.php/funding/forms1 |archive-date=September 14, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The GSO hosts social events, professional development programming, and free legal and tax clinics. Traditional events hosted by the GSO include graduate student orientation, [[Three Minute Thesis]], an annual speaker event, and national conferences. The GSO co-manages the University Cafe. GSO executive board members partake in national advocacy, and work with organizations such as the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS) on advocating for higher education policy issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/government_relations/newsletter.html|title=Newsletter - Government Relations|website=www.stonybrook.edu|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref>

===Tuition===
For the 2013-2014 academic year, annual undergraduate tuition was $5,870, about 70% of the AAU mean of $11,328 when including mandatory fees, for in-state students and $17,810, approximately 67% of the AAU mean of $29,700 when including fees, for out-of-state students. Mandatory fees for all matriculated undergraduate students totaled  $2,130 (included in the AAU calculation above).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/fastfacts/|title=Stony Brook University Fast Facts|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref> For graduate level education the tuition ranged from $7,398 to $19,550 for in-state students and $13,770 to $35,440 for out-of-state students, depending on program and/or credit hours per semester.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/bursar/tuition/tuition-and-fee-rates.shtml|title=Tuition and Fee Rates|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref> Stony Brook tuition is rising approximately $300 yearly, or 5% yearly for the next five years for in-state students and 10% yearly rise for out-of-state students after the passage of the SUNY 2020 legislation for rational tuition increases in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/nysuny/overview.html|title=Stony Brook University - About SUNY 2020|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>
