'''Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition''', commonly called the '''Official Opposition''', in [[New Zealand]] is usually the largest political party or coalition which is not a member of the ruling [[New Zealand Government|government]]—it does not provide [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministers]]. This is usually the second-largest party in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], although in certain unusual circumstances it may be the largest party (due to a larger government bloc) or even a third or fourth party.

==Overview==
The Opposition aims to hold the government accountable and to present itself to the national electorate as a credible government in waiting. For example, during [[Question Time]], Opposition spokespersons will ask questions of ministers with the aim of highlighting a weakness or embarrassing the government. Oppositions also engage in parliamentary gestures such as [[no-confidence motion|refusal to grant confidence]] or voting down the [[New Zealand budget|budget]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schmitz |first1=Gerald |title=The opposition in a Parliamentary system |url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp47-e.htm |publisher=Political and Social Affairs Division, [[Government of Canada]] |accessdate=26 May 2019 |date=December 1988}}</ref>

With the introduction of [[Mixed Member Proportional|MMP]] in 1996 (after [[electoral reform in New Zealand|referendums in 1992 and 1993]]), there was consideration to remove the official role of the Opposition; with several parties outside the government, it was no longer clear which party, if any, was 'the' opposition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Role of the Opposition in government.|url=http://decisionmaker.co.nz/guide2003/hgw/oppose.html|website=decisionmaker.co.nz|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref> This is complicated more by parties which occasionally act with the government and at other times vote against it.  The unusual positioning that developed after the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]] – in which minor parties supported the government and received ministers but remained outside the Cabinet – further complicated the concept of 'opposition'. However, the continued dominance of the political scene by the [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] parties means that the official Opposition has been retained, and inevitably the official Opposition is whichever of the National and Labour parties is not leading a Government at the time. Parties and members of parliament outside the government which do not work with the official Opposition party are said to "sit on the [[cross-benches]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=John Armstrong: What does sitting on cross benches actually mean? |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11317698 |accessdate=26 May 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2 September 2014}}</ref>

[[Grand coalition]]s have been formed only twice in New Zealand, and on both occasions with the aim of forming a national response to a crisis. The first was the War Cabinet of 1915–1919, involving the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform]] and [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal]] Parties, under the leadership of Reform Prime Minister [[William Massey]]. The second was the Coalition Government of 1931–1935 to combat the [[Great Depression]], between the United Party (successor to the Liberal Party) and the Reform Party, and led by United leader [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]]. In both cases, Labour formed the official Opposition. (It is however anachronistic to speak of a Labour Party until 1916; in 1915, the handful of MPs who were to become part of the Labour Party had been elected as "independent" candidates on behalf of several different social-democratic organisations.)

The '''[[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]''' currently form the Official Opposition.
