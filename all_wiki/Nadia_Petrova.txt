A former top 5 player in both singles and doubles, she reached a career-high ranking of No. 3 in the world in both disciplines (doing so in doubles on 21 March 2005, then in singles on 15 May 2006). Petrova won a total of 37 titles on the [[WTA Tour]] in her career, 13 in singles and 24 in doubles, as well as over $12.4 million in prize money, making her one of the most successful Russian tennis players of all time.

Petrova's career highlights in singles include reaching a total of nine Grand Slam quarterfinals across all four major tournaments (including two Grand Slam semifinals at the French Open in 2003 and 2005), and qualifying for the [[WTA Finals|WTA Tour Championships]] on three separate occasions. Her largest singles titles came at two Tier I tournaments, [[2006 Family Circle Cup – Singles|Charleston]] and [[2006 Qatar Telecom German Open – Singles|Berlin]] in 2006 (during a span in which she won three consecutive tournaments and a career-best 15 matches in a row), one [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier 5]] title in [[2012 Toray Pan Pacific Open – Singles|Tokyo]] in 2012, and winning the year-end [[2012 Qatar Airways Tournament of Champions – Singles|WTA Tournament of Champions]] in 2012. From June 2003 to September 2013, Petrova was continuously ranked inside the top 30 (a period of 538 weeks), was inside the top 20 for over 500 of them, and spent over 150 weeks ranked inside the top 10. Over a 10 year period from 2003 to 2012, she finished the year ranked inside the top 30 on every single occasion, and inside the top 20 in all of them except 2011.

Equally successful in doubles, Petrova's career highlights included winning the year-ending [[WTA Championships]] twice, with [[Meghann Shaughnessy]] in 2004, and with compatriot [[Maria Kirilenko]] in 2012. With Kirilenko, she also won the bronze medal in the doubles competition at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

She also won a total of nine Tier I/Premier Mandatory titles (including three in Miami in [[2004 NASDAQ-100 Open – Women's Doubles|2004]], [[2012 Sony Ericsson Open – Women's Doubles|2012]] and [[2013 Sony Open Tennis – Women's Doubles|2013]]), was a seven-time Grand Slam doubles semifinalist, a twenty-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist, and finished with a year-end top 10 ranking four times.

Petrova announced her retirement from professional tennis on 11 January 2017 at the age of 34, due to a multitude of injuries. and a nearly three-year absence from the tour (she played her last professional match in April 2014).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Petrova was born in Moscow. Her parents were both very athletic: her father Viktor was a leading hammer thrower, while her mother [[Nadezhda Ilyina]] won a bronze medal at the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]] in the 400 meter relay. Her father is still an athletics coach, and her mother was an athletics coach until her death in 2013. As a child, Nadia did a lot of travelling around the world with her parents. She eventually settled in [[Egypt]], where she trained with Mohammed Saif and her parents.

===Playing style===
Petrova is an all-court aggressive player who is capable of hitting winners off both wings, but particularly off her back-hand and which she hits flat and with slice. Petrova's serve is considered her biggest asset and one of the best serves in the women's game. In 2010, she hit the most aces on the tour with 306. She had an impressive 70% of first serve points won and also won over 74% of her service games. As an accomplished doubles player, Petrova's volleying skills are considered exceptional and she is not afraid to come into the net to finish off points. Petrova's main weakness is her movement around the court as she is often slow to retrieve balls and can sometimes struggle to defend well during rallies. Also, her forehand is sometimes erratic and can produce many unforced errors. Petrova states [[hard courts]] as her preferred surface, however, she has been most successful on [[clay courts]] where she can dictate play easier because it gives her more time on the ball. She is known for her unpredictability and inconsistency.

==Career==
===Early years===
As a junior, Petrova won the [[1998 French Open]], beating [[Jelena Dokić]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gimelstob-V.

She thrashed compatriot [[Maria Sharapova]] 6-1,6-2, but lost here other two singles matches to [[Patty Schnyder]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]] meaning she exited at the round robin stage.

However, Petrova was defeated in the first round of the [[2006 French Open|French Open]] by [[Akiko Morigami]], 2–6, 2–6.

At [[2008 Rogers Cup|Montreal]], she again suffered a surprise defeat by Cibulková in the third round, this time losing 6–7, 2–6.

Nadia then played in [[2008 Western & Southern Financial Group Women's Open|Cincinnati]], as she did not gain entry into the Olympics because she was not in the top-four ranked Russian players at the time. After easy wins over [[Galina Voskoboeva]], [[Julie Ditty]], and [[Lilia Osterloh]], Petrova once again found herself up against Maria Kirilenko for a place in the final. This time though, Petrova was victorious, coming back from a set down to win, 1–6, 6–2, 6–1.
