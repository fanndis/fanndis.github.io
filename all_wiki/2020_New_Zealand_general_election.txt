[[New Zealand First]] won 9 seats and held the balance of power; it was in a position to give either National or Labour the 61 seats needed to form a government.

== Electoral system ==
{{Main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}

New Zealand uses a [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties that meet the [[Electoral threshold|threshold]] (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 72 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 48 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]].<ref name="MMP info" /> If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/vote-in-elections/|title=Vote in elections|website=Parliament.nz|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=9 September 2020|archive-date=13 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913071548/https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/vote-in-elections/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The political party or party bloc with the [[majority]] of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party had won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats, until the landslide 2020 Labour victory, which gave them 65 seats.  When no party has commanded a majority, parties have had to negotiate with other parties to form a [[coalition government]] or a [[minority government]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/why-an-absolute-majority-is-absolutely-possible-for-labour|title=Why an absolute majority is absolutely possible for Labour|first=Liam|last=Hehir|work=Newsroom|date=11 August 2020|accessdate=9 September 2020|archive-date=13 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913062011/https://www.newsroom.co.nz/why-an-absolute-majority-is-absolutely-possible-for-labour|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Representation Commission undertook a review of electoral boundaries. This review was commenced in October 2019 and was completed in April 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boundary Review 2019/20 |url=https://vote.nz/boundary-review-2019-2020/ |accessdate=17 April 2020 |website=vote.nz |publisher=Electoral Commission |archive-date=29 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429065221/https://www.vote.nz/boundary-review-2019-2020/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The boundaries will apply in the 2020 general election, and the subsequent general election. In total, 36 electorates remained unchanged, 35 electorates were modified, and one new electorate created. The most significant boundary changes occurred in the [[Auckland Region|Auckland]], [[Waikato]], central [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], and [[Otago]] regions, with smaller changes in the [[Northland Region|Northland]] and [[Tasman District|Tasman]] regions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Map of current and proposed electorates |url=https://vote.nz/map/index.html?id=6&modified=20191115033549 |accessdate=14 April 2020 |website=vote.nz |publisher=Electoral Commission |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224012654/https://vote.nz/map/index.html?id=6&modified=20191115033549 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The new electorate was created in [[South Auckland]] and named {{NZ electorate link|Takanini}}. Taking area from the Hunua, Manurewa, and Papakura electorates, Takanini is predicted to be a National-tilting to marginal electorate.<ref>{{Cite web|date=20 November 2019|title=National could take new Flat Bush electorate – academics|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/403752/national-could-take-new-flat-bush-electorate-academics|access-date=17 July 2020|website=RNZ|archive-date=9 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809141030/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/403752/national-could-take-new-flat-bush-electorate-academics|url-status=live}}</ref> Takanini's creation cascaded existing electorates north through Auckland and south through Waikato. Significant changes to the north include Manukau East taking [[Sylvia Park]] and [[Panmure, New Zealand|Panmure]] from Maungakiekie, with the electorate renamed [[Panmure-Ōtāhuhu]]; New Lynn taking the Waitakere Ranges from Helensville; Helensville taking [[Wellsford]], [[Warkworth, New Zealand|Warkworth]] and the Kowhai Coast from Rodney and Northland, with the electorate renamed [[Kaipara ki Mahurangi]]; and Rodney taking Dairy Flat from Helensville and being renamed {{NZ electorate link|Whangaparāoa}}. To the south, Papakura took the entire Hunua electorate east of State Highway 1, in exchange for Hunua taking the northern part of the Waikato electorate as far south as, and including, [[Te Kauwhata]]. Hunua subsequently returned to its pre-2008 name, [[Port Waikato (New Zealand electorate)|Port Waikato]]. Waikato took [[Te Aroha]] and the remainder of the Matamata-Piako District area from Coromandel, allowing Coromandel to take [[Omokoroa]] from Bay of Plenty.<ref name="Representation Commission report">{{Cite web|title=Read the Report of the Representation Commission 2020|url=https://elections.nz/democracy-in-nz/historical-events/boundary-review-2019-2020/read-the-report-of-the-representation-commission-2020/|access-date=17 July 2020|website=Elections.nz|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]|archive-date=9 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709014557/https://elections.nz/democracy-in-nz/historical-events/boundary-review-2019-2020/read-the-report-of-the-representation-commission-2020/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the South Island, Selwyn lost the [[Rakaia]] area to Rangitata, Mcleans Island and [[Christchurch Airport]] to Ilam, and [[Hornby, New Zealand|Hornby South]] to Wigram. Ilam gained [[Avonhead]] from Wigram, allowing Wigram to take [[Aidanfield]] from Port Hills, which in turn allowed Port Hills to take the entire [[Banks Peninsula]] from Selwyn. Port Hills subsequently returned to its pre-2008 name of [[Banks Peninsula (New Zealand electorate)|Banks Peninsula]]. Clutha-Southland lost the [[Tuatapere]]-[[Te Waewae Bay|Te Waewae]] area to Invercargill and [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]], [[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]] and the lower Clutha Valley to Dunedin South, while gaining [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and the Clutha Valley upstream of [[Beaumont, New Zealand|Beaumont]] from Waitaki. Waitaki in turn took the [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] area from Dunedin North, allowing Dunedin North to take the [[Otago Peninsula]] from Dunedin South. The Otago-Southland boundary changes saw three electorates change names: Clutha-Southland to [[Southland (New Zealand electorate)|Southland]], Dunedin North to [[Dunedin (New Zealand electorate)|Dunedin]], and Dunedin South to [[Taieri (New Zealand electorate)|Taieri]]. In the Tasman region, the town of [[Brightwater]] moved from Nelson to West Coast-Tasman to bring the latter electorate within quota.<ref name="Representation Commission report" />

Two electorates had name changes to correct their spelling. Rimutaka was renamed {{NZ electorate link|Remutaka}} in line with its namesake, the [[Remutaka Range]], which was renamed in 2017 as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement. The {{NZ electorate link|Whangārei}} electorate was renamed by adding a macron to the second "a".<ref name="Representation Commission report" />

== Campaigning ==

=== Expense limits and broadcasting allocations ===
[[File:Dunedin Northern Motorway at Pinehill, 28 August 2020.jpg|thumb|Election hoardings lining the Dunedin Northern Motorway, August 2020]]
During the regulated period prior to election day, parties and candidates have limits on how much they may spend on election campaigning. The limits are updated every year to reflect inflation. It is illegal in New Zealand to campaign on election day itself, or within 10 metres of an advance polling booth.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 197.</ref>

For the 2020 general election, the regulated period runs from 18 August to 16 October 2020. Every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend [[NZD|$]]1,199,000 plus $28,200 per electorate candidate on campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately). For example, a registered party with candidates in all 72 electorates is permitted to spend $3,229,400 on campaigning for the party vote. Electorate candidates are permitted to spend $28,200 each on campaigning for the electorate vote.<ref name="regulated period">{{Cite web|title=Change in regulated period|url=https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/change-in-regulated-period/|access-date=22 August 2020|website=Elections.nz|archive-date=13 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913081625/https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/change-in-regulated-period/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Registered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning. Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; production costs can come from the general election expenses budget. The Electoral Commission determines how much broadcasting funding each party gets, set out by part 6 of the [[Broadcasting Act 1989]]. The allocation is based a number of factors including the number of seats in the current Parliament, results of the previous general election and any by-elections since, and support in opinion polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/2020-broadcasting-allocation-decision-released/|title=2020 Broadcasting Allocation Decision Released|website=Elections.nz|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]|date=29 May 2020|accessdate=9 September 2020|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806213409/https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/2020-broadcasting-allocation-decision-released/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The National Party initially chose [[Paula Bennett]] as its [[campaign manager]]. (All previous elections since [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]] had seen National with [[Steven Joyce]] as campaign manager.<ref name="NZH campaigning" />) On 2 February 2020, Simon Bridges announced that National would not want to form a coalition with New Zealand First after the election should NZ First become [[kingmaker]] once again.

Ross stated in regards to the merger that "By forming an alliance of parties, together with other small parties that believe in greater freedom and democracy, we stand a stronger chance of uniting together and crossing the 5 percent threshold in to Parliament," and branded Advance NZ "the new [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance Party]] of the 2020s, but a centrist version of that model".<ref>{{cite web |title=Advance NZ Launches Alliance Of Parties For Election 2020 With New Zealand Public Party |url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA2007/S00255/advance-nz-launches-alliance-of-parties-for-election-2020-with-new-zealand-public-party.htm |website=Scoop |publisher=[[Advance New Zealand]] |accessdate=27 July 2020 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727001503/https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA2007/S00255/advance-nz-launches-alliance-of-parties-for-election-2020-with-new-zealand-public-party.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> At the launch, Te Kahika promised an immediate repeal of the [[COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jami-Lee Ross' newly formed alliance with NZ Public Party aims to repeal Govt's Covid-19 Response Bill |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/jami-lee-ross-newly-formed-alliance-nz-public-party-aims-repeal-govts-covid-19-response-bill |accessdate=27 July 2020 |work=1 News |date=26 July 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731111329/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/jami-lee-ross-newly-formed-alliance-nz-public-party-aims-repeal-govts-covid-19-response-bill |url-status=live }}</ref> Ross also reportedly told the NZ Herald that the party was in talks with six smaller parties about joining Advance NZ.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walls |first1=Jason |title=Election 2020: Advance NZ – Jami-Lee Ross joins forces with controversial NZ Public Party |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12351040 |accessdate=27 July 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]  |date=26 July 2020 |archive-date=28 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828052853/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12351040 |url-status=live }}</ref> On 6 August 2020, the party was registered with the Electoral Commission.<ref>{{cite web |title=Registration of three parties and logos |url=https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/registration-of-three-parties-and-logos/ |publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission |accessdate=6 August 2020 |archive-date=29 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200829053403/https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/registration-of-three-parties-and-logos/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== TVNZ qualification criteria ====
The inclusion criteria set by TVNZ for its multi-party debate was either having current representation in Parliament or winning 3% in a poll, which sparked controversy as those criteria excluded minor parties such as the [[Māori Party]], [[The Opportunities Party]] and the [[New Conservative Party (New Zealand)|New Conservative Party]] from the debate. Māori Party co-leader [[John Tamihere]] said TVNZ had a responsibility to "reflect Māori perspectives, as laid out in ministerial direction".

== Opinion polls ==
{{Main|Opinion polling for the 2020 New Zealand general election}}

Various organisations commissioned opinion polling for the general election. Two main polling organisations regularly sampled the electorates' opinions: Reid Research (on behalf of [[MediaWorks New Zealand]]) and [[Colmar Brunton]] (on behalf of [[Television New Zealand]]). Roy Morgan Research released a series of polls in June 2020, covering the first five months of the year, and subsequently released monthly polls. These were their first opinion polls in New Zealand since November 2017.

== Voting ==
EasyVote packs were sent to voters starting on 28 September 2020. These packs contain the voter's personalised EasyVote card, which is used by polling booth staff to help identify and locate the voter on the electoral roll. It also included flyers on the voting process and two referendums. On 5 October 2020, ''[[The Spinoff]]'' reported that four EasyVote packs in Northland allegedly contained a flyer from Votesafe, a third-party promoter opposing the End of Life Choice Act. Votesafe confirmed its flyers were printed at the same facility as the Electoral Commission's flyers, and both Votesafe and the Electoral Commission were investigating.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Braae|first=Alex|date=5 October 2020|title=Complaint laid after assisted dying 'vote no' flyers found in official EasyVote packs|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/05-10-2020/complaint-laid-after-assisted-dying-vote-no-flyers-found-in-official-easyvote-packs/|access-date=6 October 2020|website=The Spinoff|archive-date=7 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201007202453/https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/05-10-2020/complaint-laid-after-assisted-dying-vote-no-flyers-found-in-official-easyvote-packs/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Group opposing euthanasia referendum claims to have no idea how its flyers got in EasyVote packs|language=en|work=Newshub|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/10/group-opposed-to-end-of-life-choice-act-claims-to-have-no-idea-how-its-flyers-ended-up-inside-electoral-commission-envelopes-says-manager.html|access-date=6 October 2020|archive-date=13 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113231015/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/10/group-opposed-to-end-of-life-choice-act-claims-to-have-no-idea-how-its-flyers-ended-up-inside-electoral-commission-envelopes-says-manager.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Early voting|Advance voting]] began on 3 October at 450 polling locations, increasing to 2,600 locations on election day, 17 October. The [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] estimated that 60% of votes would occur during the advance voting period, up from 47% in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hundreds of sites to open for advance voting from today|work=Radio NZ|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/hundreds-sites-open-advance-voting-today|accessdate=2 October 2020|via=1 News|archive-date=2 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002233744/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/hundreds-sites-open-advance-voting-today|url-status=live}}</ref> On 12 October, the number of advance votes cast passed the 1,240,740 advance votes cast overall at the 2017 election.<ref>{{Cite web|date=13 October 2020|title=Election 2020: Advance votes surpass total in 2017|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/428240/election-2020-advance-votes-surpass-total-in-2017|access-date=14 October 2020|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|archive-date=15 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201015182346/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/428240/election-2020-advance-votes-surpass-total-in-2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Voters on the Māori roll faced issues with receiving [[Māori electorates|Māori electorate]] ballots due to high demand during advance voting, leading to some people having to cast [[special vote]]s instead.<ref>{{cite news|title='Disgusting' – Voters frustrated after electorates struggle with Māori roll for advance voting|work=1 News|publisher=TVNZ|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/disgusting-voters-frustrated-after-electorates-struggle-m-ori-roll-advance-voting|date=6 October 2020|accessdate=6 October 2020|archive-date=8 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008192056/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/disgusting-voters-frustrated-after-electorates-struggle-m-ori-roll-advance-voting|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 5 October, an error was discovered on [[Port Waikato (New Zealand electorate)|Port Waikato]] electorate ballot papers, where there was no circle to tick next to [[Vision NZ]] on the party vote ballot. The Electoral Commission subsequently reprinted the ballot papers.

=== Government formation ===
On 31 October, Ardern announced that despite the Labour Party having won enough seats to continue the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Sixth Labour Government]] on their own, they had invited the Greens to participate in a "cooperation agreement", seeking their input on matters such as the environment, climate change and child wellbeing, and that the Greens had accepted the offer. Under the deal (which is not a coalition agreement), the two co-leaders of the Greens will receive ministerial portfolios outside the cabinet. James Shaw will continue in his previous role as climate change minister, as well as associate environment minister (biodiversity). Marama Davidson will be appointed to the new position of minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence, and will also take on the role of associate minister of housing (homelessness).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Roy|first=Eleanor Ainge|date=31 October 2020|title=New Zealand Greens accept Ardern's offer of 'cooperation agreement'|language=en-GB|work=The Observer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/31/new-zealand-greens-accept-arderns-offer-of-cooperation-agreement|access-date=1 November 2020|issn=0029-7712|archive-date=1 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101010850/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/31/new-zealand-greens-accept-arderns-offer-of-cooperation-agreement|url-status=live}}</ref> The Green Party also agreed to abstain on motions of Confidence and Supply during the term.

On 3 November, [[Geoff Simmons]] stepped down as leader of The Opportunities Party. Shai Navot, former deputy leader, took over from Simmons and is currently acting as interim leader.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Opportunities Party leader Geoff Simmons resigns, interim leader named |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/123287891/the-opportunities-party-leader-geoff-simmons-resigns-interim-leader-named |accessdate=21 November 2020 |agency=Stuff |date=3 November 2020}}</ref>

On 19 November, the board of the [[New Conservative Party (New Zealand)|New Conservative Party]] removed the party's leader, [[Leighton Baker]], and replaced him with his deputy, [[Elliot Ikilei]]. The party's third-ranked list candidate at the election, Victoria O'Brien, became deputy leader.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=No-nonsense' gun advocate Victoria O'Brien part of New Conservative's fresh leadership team as Leighton Baker departs |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/no-nonsense-gun-advocate-victoria-o-brien-part-of-new-conservative-s-fresh-leadership-team-as-leighton-baker-departs.html |accessdate=19 November 2020 |agency=Newshub |date=19 November 2020}}</ref> O'Brien however resigned after less than a week in the role, on 25 November, amid apparent division in the party over Baker's removal and his subsequent role within its organisation. A new deputy leader is expected to be chosen in early 2021.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Braae |first1=Alex |title=New Conservative deputy quits one week in, deepening leadership tumult |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/25-11-2020/new-conservative-deputy-quits-one-week-in-deepening-leadership-tumult/ |access-date=25 November 2020 |publisher=The Spinoff |date=25 November 2020}}</ref>

=== Local by-elections ===
A number of [[Local government in New Zealand|local by-elections]] are required due to the resignation of an incumbent local body politician following their election to Parliament:

=== Calls for vote recount ===
On 11 November, the [[Māori Party]] co-leader [[John Tamihere]] requested a vote recount in the [[Māori electorates|Māori electorate]]s of [[Tāmaki Makaurau]] and [[Te Tai Hauāuru]], alleging there had been voter discrimination against Māori during the 2020 election. Tamihere claimed that the recount was intended to expose discriminatory laws such as the five-yearly Māori Electoral Option (which limited the ability of Māori to switch between the general and Māori rolls for a period five years), longer wait times for Māori voters at election booths, and some Māori not being allowed to vote on the Māori roll.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Burrows |first1=Matt |title=NZ Election 2020: Māori Party asks for recount in two electorates, pushes for Electoral Act reform |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/nz-election-2020-m-ori-party-asks-for-recount-in-two-electorates-pushes-for-electoral-act-reform.amp.html |accessdate=13 November 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=13 November 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113075414/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/nz-election-2020-m-ori-party-asks-for-recount-in-two-electorates-pushes-for-electoral-act-reform.amp.html |archivedate=13 November 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The altered official results for the two electorates following the recounts were released on 20 November. Tamihere's margin of defeat in [[Tāmaki Makaurau]] decreased from 956 to 927, while [[Debbie Ngarewa-Packer]]'s margin of defeat in [[Te Tai Hauāuru]] increased from 1,035 to 1,053.<ref>{{cite web |title=2020 General Election Results of the Official Count |url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2020-au5126 |work=New Zealand Gazette |accessdate=20 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Amended Official Result for the Tāmaki Makaurau and Te Tai Hauāuru Electoral Districts |url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2020-au5297 |work=[[New Zealand Gazette]] |accessdate=20 November 2020}}</ref>
