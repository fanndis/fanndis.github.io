The airline is based in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Mascot, New South Wales|Mascot]], adjacent to its main hub at [[Sydney Airport]]. {{As of|2014|3}}, Qantas had a 65% share of the Australian domestic market and carried 14.9% of all passengers travelling in and out of Australia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/qantas-internationals-market-share-slips-as-capacity-growth-slows/story-e6frg95x-1227258403192 |title=Qantas International's market share slips as capacity growth slows |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com.au/in-detail-heres-why-alan-joyce-says-qantas-must-defend-its-65-market-share-2014-3 In Detail, Here's why Alan Joyce says Qantas must defend its 65% marketshare] ''Business Insider'' 5 March 2014.</ref> Various subsidiary airlines operate to regional centres and on some trunk routes within Australia under the [[QantasLink]] banner.

===QEA era===
In 1934, QANTAS and Britain's [[Imperial Airways]] (a forerunner of [[British Airways]]) formed a new company, '''Qantas Empire Airways Limited''' (QEA).<ref>{{cite web

[[Flying boat]] services were resumed in 1943, with flights between the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] at [[Crawley, Western Australia|Crawley]] in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]] and [[Koggala Airport|Koggala Lake]] in Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]). This linked up with the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC, the successor airline to Imperial Airways) service to London.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rise of Civil Aviation to 1970 |work=National Stories |publisher=Australian Heritage Commission |url=http://www.ahc.gov.au/publications/national-stories/transport/chapter8.html |accessdate=7 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206065231/http://www.ahc.gov.au/publications/national-stories/transport/chapter8.html |archivedate=6 December 2006 }}</ref><ref name=Thiedeman>{{cite web

In 1947, QEA was nationalised by the Australian government led by Labor Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]]. QANTAS Limited was then wound up. After nationalisation, Qantas' remaining domestic network, in Queensland, was transferred to the also nationally owned [[Trans-Australia Airlines]], leaving Qantas with a purely international network.

===Oneworld and Jetstar===
In 1998, Qantas co-founded the [[Oneworld]] alliance with [[American Airlines]], British Airways, [[Canadian Airlines]] and [[Cathay Pacific]],<ref>{{cite web

Qantas briefly revived the [[Australian Airlines]] name for a short-lived international budget airline between 2002 and 2006,<ref>{{cite web

In 2004, the Qantas group expanded into the Asian budget airline market with [[Jetstar Asia Airways]], in which Qantas owns a minority stake. A similar model was used for the investment into [[Jetstar Pacific]], headquartered in Vietnam, in 2007, and [[Jetstar Japan]], launched in 2012.

===Uniform===
Paris-based Australian designer Martin Grant is responsible for the new Qantas airline staff uniforms that were publicly unveiled on 16 April 2013.

The new outfits combine the colours of navy blue, red and fuchsia pink. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce stated that the new design "speaks of Australian style on the global stage" at the launch event that involved Qantas employees modelling the uniforms. Grant consulted with Qantas staff members over the course of one year to finalise the 35 styles that were eventually created.<ref>{{cite news|title=It's hats off to new-age Qantas uniform|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/fashion/its-hats-off-to-new-age-qantas-uniform/story-e6frg8k6-1226622017102|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 April 2013|author=Glynnis Traill-Nash}}</ref> Not all employees were happy with the new uniform, however, with one flight attendant being quoted as saying "The uniforms are really tight and they are simply not practical for the very physical job we have to do."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hrgrapevine.com/markets/hr/article/2013-12-11-qantas-new-uniform-too-sexy-say-staff|title=Qantas new uniform too sexy say staff|publisher=HR Grapevine|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>

===Order history===
On 22 August 2012, Qantas announced that, due to losses and to conserve capital, it had cancelled its 35-aircraft Boeing 787-9 order while keeping the 15-aircraft 787-8 order for Jetstar Airways and moving forward 50 purchase rights.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Qantas Group Restructures Fleet Plan|publisher=Qantas Corporate Communication|date=23 August 2012|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20120823/pdf/4286925t854j6x.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606004850/http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20120823/pdf/4286925t854j6x.pdf|url-status=live|archivedate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Qantas drops order for 35 Boeing 787-9s|last=Gates|first=Dominic|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=22 August 2012|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2018971697_boeingqantas23.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113105015/http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2018971697_boeingqantas23.html|url-status=live|archivedate=13 November 2013}}</ref> On 20 August 2015 Qantas announced that it had ordered eight Boeing 787-9s for delivery from 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/qantas-is-buying-8-boeing-787-dreamliners-2015-8|title=Qantas is buying 8 Boeing 787 Dreamliners|last=Colgan|first=Paul|website=Business Insider Australia|publisher=Pedestrian Group|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>

===Indigenous Art liveries===
Two Qantas aircraft are currently decorated with an [[Indigenous Australian art]] scheme. One aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, wears a livery called ''Mendoowoorrji'', which was revealed in November 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=PICTURE: Qantas takes delivery of 'Mendoowoorrji' 737 |first=Ellis |last=Taylor |date=11 November 2013 |location=Singapore |publisher=[[Flightglobal]] |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/picture-qantas-takes-delivery-of-mendoowoorrji-737-392788/ |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111114217/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/picture-qantas-takes-delivery-of-mendoowoorrji-737-392788/ |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}&nbsp;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128140010/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/picture-qantas-takes-delivery-of-mendoowoorrji-737-392788/ |date=28 January 2015 }}</ref> The design was drawn from the late West Australian Aboriginal artist Paddy Bedford.<ref>{{cite web|title=Photo gallery: Qantas' new Boeing 737-800 wears Aboriginal livery|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/photo-gallery-qantas-new-boeing-737-800-wears-aboriginal-livery|work=Australian Business Traveller|publisher=Australian Business Traveller|accessdate=10 November 2013|author=David Flynn|date=9 November 2013}}</ref>

A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is adorned in a paint scheme inspired by the late [[Emily Kame Kngwarreye]]'s 1991 painting ''Yam Dreaming''. The adaptation of ''Yam Dreaming'' to the aircraft, led by Balarinji, a Sydney-based and Aboriginal-owned design firm, incorporates the red Qantas tailfin into the design, which includes white dots with red and orange tones. The design depicts the yam plant, an important and culturally significant symbol in Kngwarreye's Dreaming stories, and a staple food source in her home region of [[Utopia, Northern Territory|Utopia]]. The design was applied to the aircraft during manufacture, prior to its delivery in March 2018 to [[Alice Springs Airport]], situated 230 kilometers southeast of Utopia, where the aircraft was met by Kngwarreye's descendants, the local community, and Qantas executives.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2018/03/indigenous-painted-qantas-787-yam-dreaming-arrives-in-alice-springs/|title=Indigenous-painted Qantas 787 'Yam Dreaming' arrives in Alice Springs|last=Frawley|first=Gerard|website=Australian Aviation|publisher=Aviator Media Pty Ltd.|date=2 March 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qantas.com/fr/en/about-us/our-company/fleet/flying-art.html#emily|title=Flying Art Series – Qantas Dreamliner Emily Kame Kngwarreye - Boeing 787-9|website=Qantas|publisher=Qantas Airways Limited|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref> The aircraft would later operate Qantas' inaugural nonstop services between [[Perth Airport|Perth]] and [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], and between [[Melbourne Airport|Melbourne]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]], scheduled with Boeing 787 aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/world/europe/uk-qantas-australia-britain.html|title=A First in Flight: Australia to the U.K., in 17 Hours|last=Joseph|first=Yonette|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=25 March 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://airlinegeeks.com/2018/09/01/a-day-of-firsts-qantas-inaugurates-new-dreamliner-service-to-the-u-s/|title=A Day of Firsts: Qantas Inaugurates New Dreamliner Service to the U.S.|last=Pallini|first=Thomas|website=AirlineGeeks.com|publisher=Airline Geeks, LLC|date=1 September 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref>

Australian Aboriginal art designs have previously adorned some Qantas aircraft; the first design was called ''Wunala Dreaming'', which was unveiled in 1994 and had been painted on now-retired Boeing 747-400 and 747-400ER aircraft between 1994 and 2012.<ref name="Yananyi"/> The ''motif'' was an overall-red design depicting ancestral spirits in the form of kangaroos travelling in the [[outback]].<ref name="Superbrand"/>

The second design was called ''Nalanji Dreaming'' and was depicted on a Boeing 747-300 from 1995 until its retirement in 2005. ''Nalanji Dreaming'' was a bright blue design inspired by rainforest landscape and tropical seas.<ref name="Superbrand"/><ref>{{cite news|title=New Flying Art indigenous-themed aircraft to fly for Qantas in November |first=Steve |last=Creedy |date= 30 September 2013|work= [[The Australian]]|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/new-flying-art-indigenous-themed-aircraft-to-fly-for-qantas-in-november/story-e6frg95x-1226730000067 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}</ref>

The third design was titled ''Yananyi Dreaming,'' and featured a depiction of [[Uluru]]. The scheme was designed by Uluru-based artist Rene Kulitja, in collaboration with Balarinji. It was painted on the 737 at the Boeing factory prior to its delivery in 2002.<ref name="Yananyi">{{cite press release|title=New Aboriginal Design Aircraft For Domestic Skies|date=14 February 2002|publisher=Qantas|location=Melbourne|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/media-releases/feb-2002/2628/global/en|accessdate=29 December 2013|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref> It was repainted into the standard livery in 2014.

==Cabin==
===Domestic===
Qantas domestic flights are primarily operated by Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A330-200 aircraft; Airbus A330-300s sometimes operate domestically as well. A two-class configuration (Business and Economy) is offered.

====Business====
Domestic Business Class is offered on all Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 aircraft. On the Boeing 737, Business is exclusively available in the first three rows of the cabin, with a seat configuration of 2-2, seat recline, and a larger pitch between seats. As the A330s operate international flights, Business Suites are sometimes available on domestic routes. These seats feature all-aisle access in a 1-2-1 configuration and a fully flat {{cvt|198|cm}} bed.

====Economy====
Domestic Economy Class is offered on all Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 aircraft. Seat pitch is usually {{convert|31|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} and seat width ranges from {{convert|17|to|17+1/2|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Layouts are 3–3 on the 737<ref name="Economy Class">{{cite web|url=http://www.airreview.com/Qantas/Fleet.htm#Economy |title=Economy Class |publisher=Airreview |accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref> and 2-4-2 on the A330.

===International===
Qantas international flights are primarily operated on Airbus A380s, A330-300s, Boeing 747s, 787s, and sometimes on Airbus A330-200s and Boeing 737-800s. Passenger class configuration varies by aircraft, with the Airbus A330-300 offering a two-class configuration of Business and Economy on short to medium-haul flights. This compares to the Airbus A380, which offers a four-class configuration of First, Business, Premium Economy, and Economy on selected long haul flights.

====First====

Updated versions of this seat were fitted to the airline's refurbished Airbus A380 aircraft from late 2019. This seat featured refreshed cushioning and larger entertainment screens compared to the older version seat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.executivetraveller.com/qantas-first-class-facelift-for-the-airbus-a380|title=Qantas' first class facelift for the Airbus A380|last=Flynn|first=David|date=|website=Executive Traveller|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>

====Business====
International [[Business class]] is offered on all Qantas mainline passenger aircraft.

On all International and selected Domestic flights, Qantas offers two different types of Business Class seats, as listed below.

=====Business Suites=====
[[File:QantasA330businessclass.JPG|thumb|Qantas Business Suite on all [[Boeing 787]], [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] and selected [[Airbus A380]] aircraft.]]
Business Suites are offered on all Boeing 787, Airbus A330-300, and selected Airbus A330-200 and A380 aircraft.

These seats include beds and are in a 1-2-1 configuration.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.domesticflightaustralia.com/news/lie-flat-seats-for-qantas-a330-business-class-20130228.php | work=Domestic Flight Australia.com | title=Lie-Flat Seats for Qantas A330 Business Class}}</ref> The Business Suite was introduced on the A330 in October 2014, and also contains a bed. This seat includes a Panasonic eX3 system with a touchscreen. By the end of 2016, the business class seats of Qantas' entire Airbus A330 fleet were refitted. Airbus A330 Business Suites are available on Asian routes, transcontinental routes across Australia and smaller routes such as the East Coast triangle.

Updated versions of this seat were fitted to the airline's new Boeing 787 fleet from late 2017.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flynn |first1=David |title=Review: Qantas Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner business class seat |url=https://www.ausbt.com.au/review-qantas-boeing-787-9-dreamliner-business-class |website=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>

=====Business Skybeds=====
[[File:Qantas Business Skybed.jpg|thumbnail|Qantas Business Skybed 2 on selected [[Airbus A380]] aircraft.]]
Business Skybeds are offered exclusively on selected A380 aircraft.

On the Airbus A380, 64 fully-flat Skybed seats are available with {{convert|80|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} seat pitch (converting to a 200&nbsp;cm long bed). These seats are located on the upper deck in a 2-2-2 configuration in two separate cabins. Features include a 30&nbsp;cm touchscreen monitor with 1,000 AVOD programmes and an on-board lounge. Airbus A380 Business Skybeds are available on Qantas' flagship routes such as Australia to/from London via Singapore, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Hong Kong (seasonal).

The Skybed 1 (Mark I) version of the lie-flat seats, featured between 2003 and 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.australianfrequentflyer.com.au/qantas-completes-a330-refurbishments/ |title=Qantas Finally Completes Airbus A330 Refurbishments |publisher=The Australian Frequent Flyer |accessdate=11 August 2019}}</ref> had {{convert|60|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} of seat pitch and {{convert|21+1/2|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} width; however passengers slept at a distinct slope to the cabin floor. The Skybed 2 (Mark II) version, introduced in 2008 has a {{convert|80|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} pitch, and allows passengers to lie fully horizontal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airreview.com/Qantas/Fleet.htm#Business |title=International Business Class |publisher=Airreview |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

On the now-retired Boeing&nbsp;747, seating was in a 2-3-2 configuration on the main deck and a 2–2 configuration on the upper deck. Skybed seats on Boeing 747s featured a {{convert|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} touchscreen monitor with 400&nbsp;AVOD programs. Before their retirement, Boeing 747 Business Skybeds were available on Asian, African, and South American routes.

In 2019, Qantas began the process of retrofitting its Airbus A380 aircraft with new Business Suites as offered on Airbus A330 and Boeing 787 aircraft. The aircraft will gain six business class seats compared to the previous configuration.<ref name="ausbt.com.au">{{cite web |last1=Flynn |first1=David |title=Qantas to upgrade A380 business class seats to new Business Suites |url=https://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-to-upgrade-a380-business-class-seats-to-new-business-suites |website=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>

Complimentary access to the Qantas business class lounge (or affiliated lounges) is also offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airreview.com/Qantas/Lounges.htm |title=Qantas Business Class Lounges |publisher=Airreview |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

====Premium Economy====
[[File:Qantas Boeing 787 Dreamliner Premium Economy seat.jpg|thumbnail|A Qantas Premium Economy seat on the [[Boeing 787]].]]
[[Premium economy]] class is offered on all Airbus&nbsp;A380 and Boeing 787-9 aircraft.

On the Airbus&nbsp;A380, the seat pitch ranges from {{convert|38|to|42|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}, with a width of {{convert|19+1/2|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. On the Boeing&nbsp;787, it is configured in a 2-3-2 seating arrangement around the middle of the aircraft, whereas it is in a 2-3-2 seating arrangement at the rear of the upper deck on the A380. The total number of seats depends on the aircraft type, as A380s have 35-60&nbsp;seats, (depending on the configuration)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airreview.com/Qantas/Fleet.htm#Premium |title=Premium Economy Class |publisher=Airreview |accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> and 787s have 28&nbsp;seats.

Qantas premium economy is presented as a lighter business class product rather than most other airlines' premium economy, which is often presented as a higher economy class, however Qantas premium economy does not offer access to premium lounges, and meals are only a slightly uprated version of economy class meals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airreview.com/Qantas/Food.htm |title=Qantas Premium Economy Meals |publisher=Airreview |accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>

In 2019, Qantas began the process of retrofitting its Airbus A380 aircraft with new Premium Economy seats, as offered on Boeing 787 aircraft. The aircraft will gain 25 premium economy seats compared to the previous configuration.<ref name="Qantas Airbus A380 upgrades: first">{{cite web |last1=Flynn |first1=David |title=Qantas Airbus A380 upgrades: first refurb'd bird to fly in September |url=https://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-a380-refurbishment |website=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>

In 2019, Qantas began the process of retrofitting its Airbus A380 aircraft which includes new Economy seats with new seat cushions and improved inflight entertainment, as offered on Boeing 787 aircraft. The aircraft will have fewer economy seats compared to the previous configuration due to an increase in the number of premium seats.<ref name="Qantas Airbus A380 upgrades: first"/>

===In-flight entertainment===
[[File:QantasQIFEscreenB787.jpg|thumb|Qantas [[in-flight entertainment]] (IFE) system in Premium Economy]]

Every Qantas mainline aircraft has some form of video audio entertainment. Qantas has several types of [[in-flight entertainment]] (IFE) systems installed on its aircraft and refers to the in-flight experience as "On:Q".

==== Audio-video entertainment systems ====
The "Total Entertainment System" by [[Rockwell Collins]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/qantas-frequent-flyer/348814-qantas-go-avod.html |title=Qantas to go AVOD – FlyerTalk Forums |publisher=Flyertalk.com |date=30 March 2000 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref> was featured on selected domestic and international aircraft between 2000 and 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2017/07/oldest-qantas-747-retires-to-the-desert/|title=Oldest Qantas 747 retires to the desert - Australian Aviation|date=31 July 2017}}</ref> This AVOD system included personal LCD screens in all classes, located in the seat back for economy and business class, and in the armrest for premium economy and first class.

Movies are shown on the screens for lengthier flights or TV programmes on shorter flights. A news telecast will usually feature at the start of the flight. Audio options are less varied than on Q, iQ or the Total Entertainment System.

The "iQ" inflight entertainment system by [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation]] is featured on all Boeing 747, and selected Airbus A380 and Boeing 737-800 aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theqantassource.com/zk738.html |title=Jet Connect Boeing 737-800 Fleet Information |publisher=The QANTAS Source |accessdate=8 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110206034422/http://www.theqantassource.com/zk738.html |archivedate=6 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/a330-200/global/en |title=New Airbus 330-200 |publisher=Qantas.com.au |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theqantassource.com/a332.html |title=Airbus A330-200 Fleet Information |publisher=The QANTAS Source |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717024252/http://theqantassource.com/a332.html |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> This [[audio video on demand]] (AVOD) experience, introduced in 2008, is based on the Panasonic Avionics system and features expanded entertainment options; touch screens; and new communications-related features such as [[Wi-Fi]] and mobile phone functionality; as well as increased support for electronics (such as USB and [[iPod]] connectivity).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airreview.com/Qantas/IFE.htm |title=Qantas in Flight Entertainment |publisher=Airreview |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

==== Wireless entertainment systems and Wi-Fi ====
Q Streaming is an in-flight entertainment system in which entertainment is streamed to iPads or personal devices available in all classes on selected aircraft. A selection of movies, TV, music, and a kids' choice are available.

In 2007, Qantas conducted a trial for use of mobile telephones with [[AeroMobile]], during domestic services for three months on a Boeing 767. During the trial, passengers were allowed to send and receive text messages and emails but were not able to make or receive calls.<ref>{{cite news | title =Qantas to trial in-flight mobile phone use | publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] | date =18 April 2007 | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-04-18/qantas-to-trial-in-flight-mobile-phone-use/2526078 | accessdate =22 August 2013}}</ref>

Since 2014, [[Sky News Australia]] has provided multiple news bulletins both in-flight and in Qantas branded lounges. Previously, the Australian [[Nine Network]] provided a news bulletin for Qantas entitled ''Nine's Qantas Inflight News'', which was the same broadcast as Nine's ''[[Nine News#Early Morning News|Early Morning News]]'', however Nine lost the contract to Sky News.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/07/nine-news-grounded-by-qantas.html|title=Nine News grounded by Qantas|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>

In July 2015, Qantas signed a deal with American cable network [[Home Box Office|HBO]] to provide over 120 hours of television programming in-flight from the network which will be updated monthly, as well as original lifestyle and entertainment programming from both [[Foxtel]] and the [[National Geographic Channel]].

In 2017 Qantas commenced rolling out complimentary high speed Wi-Fi on domestic aircraft. The services utilises [[NBN Co]] [[Sky Muster]] satellites to deliver higher speeds than generally offered by onboard Wi-Fi.<ref>{{Cite media release|url=https://www.qantasnewsroom.com.au/media-releases/qantas-switches-on-fast-free-inflight-wifi/|title=Qantas switches on fast, free inflight wifi|date=7 April 2017|website=Qantas Newsroom|access-date=21 December 2018}}</ref> Previously, in July 2007 Qantas had announced Wi-Fi on would be available on its long haul A380s and 747-400s<ref name="APCMag.com">{{cite news|url=http://apcmag.com/inflight_internet_lives_again_qantas_introduces_wireless_broadband_laptop_power_in_all_classes.htm|title=Inflight internet lives again: Qantas introduces wireless broadband, laptop power in all classes|last=Warne|first=Dan|date=24 July 2007|accessdate=24 July 2007|publisher=APCMag.com}}</ref> although that system ultimately did not proceed following trials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.traveller.com.au/qantas-scraps-inflight-wifi-plans-2as2i|title=Qantas scraps inflight wi-fi plans|last=Platt|first=Craig|date=4 December 2012|website=traveller.com.au|access-date=21 December 2018}}</ref>

===Qantas Frequent Flyer===
[[File:Qantas Frequent Flyer Logo 2016.png|right]]
The Qantas [[frequent-flyer program]] is aimed at rewarding customer loyalty. The program is long-standing, although the date of the actual inception has been a matter that has generated some commentary. Qantas state the program launched in 1987<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qantas.com.au/infodetail/about/investors/qffSupplementaryInformation.pdf|title=Qantas Frequent Flyer: Supplementary Information|website=|access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref> although other sources claim what is the current program was launched in the early 1990s, with a Captain's Club program existing before that.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2007/10/10/fiction-fights-fact-over-the-qantas-frequent-flyer-program/|title=Fiction fights fact over the Qantas frequent flyer program|date=10 October 2007|work=Crikey|access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref>

Points are accrued based on distance flown, with bonuses that vary by [[travel class]]. Points can also be earned on other Oneworld airlines as well as through other non-airline partners. Points can be redeemed for flights or upgrades on flights operated by Qantas, Oneworld airlines, and other partners. Other partners include credit cards,<ref>{{cite web| title =Cards | work=Earning Points | publisher=Qantas | url =http://www.qantas.com.au/fflyer/dyn/partners/card | accessdate =17 May 2007 }}</ref> car rental companies, hotels and many others.

Qantas has faced criticism regarding availability of seats for members redeeming points.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission&nbsp;— The World Today|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s1933292.htm|title=Qantas frequent flyer program to be revamped|date=25 May 2007|accessdate=24 September 2007}}</ref> In 2004, the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] directed Qantas to provide greater disclosure to members regarding the availability of frequent-flyer seats.<ref>{{cite web|date=21 June 2004|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/545900/fromItemId/622685|accessdate=24 September 2007|title=ACCC finalises investigation of Qantas frequent flyer program|publisher=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission}}</ref>

In March 2008, an analyst at [[JPMorgan Chase]] suggested that the Qantas frequent-flyer program could be worth A$2&nbsp;billion (US$1.9&nbsp;billion), representing more than a quarter of the total market value of Qantas.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Bloomberg|title=Qantas Program May Be Worth A$2&nbsp;billion, Analyst Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&sid=a.SF8G1.KL10&refer=australia| date=12 March 2008|accessdate=17 March 2008}}</ref>

On 1 July 2008 a major overhaul of the program was announced. The two key new features of the program were Any Seat rewards, in which members could now redeem any seat on an aircraft, rather than just selected seats&nbsp;— at a price. The second new feature was Points Plus Pay, which has enabled members to use a combination of cash and points to redeem an award. Additionally, the Frequent Flyer store was also expanded to include a greater range of products and services.<ref>{{cite press release| title =Qantas Frequent Flyer&nbsp;— now bigger and better| publisher =Qantas| date =1 July 2008| url =http://www.qantas.com.au/regions/dyn/au/publicaffairs/details?ArticleID=2008/jul08/3777| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080814033826/http://www.qantas.com.au/regions/dyn/au/publicaffairs/details?ArticleID=2008%2Fjul08%2F3777| url-status =dead| archive-date =14 August 2008| accessdate =1 July 2008}}</ref>

==Accidents and incidents==
{{Main|List of Qantas fatal accidents}}
It is often claimed that Qantas has never had an aircraft crash. While it is true that the company has neither lost a [[Jet aircraft|jet airliner]] nor had any jet fatalities, it had eight fatal accidents and an aircraft shot down between 1927 and 1945, with the loss of 63&nbsp;people. Half of these accidents and the shoot-down occurred during World War&nbsp;II, when the Qantas aircraft were operating on behalf of Allied military forces. Post-war, it lost another four aircraft (one was owned by BOAC and operated by Qantas in a pooling arrangement) with a total of 21 people killed. The last fatal accidents suffered by Qantas were in 1951, with three fatal crashes in five months.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kamenev|first=Marina|title=Qantas: Airline Safety's Golden Child No More?|date=24 November 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2032492,00.html|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Palmer|first=Brian|title=Is Qantas The World's Safest Airline?|date=1 November 2011|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/airline_safety_does_qantas_airlines_crash_free_record_make_it_th.html|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref> Qantas' safety record allows the airline to be officially known as the world's safest airline for seven years in a row from 2012 until 2019 (current).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.airlineratings.com/news/worlds-safest-airlines-named-for-2019/|title=World's Safest Airlines named for 2019|last=Thomas|first=Geoffrey|date=3 January 2019|website=Airline Ratings|language=en-AU|access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref>

===Extortion attempts===
On 26 May 1971 Qantas received a call from a "Mr.&nbsp;Brown" claiming that there was a bomb planted on a Hong Kong-bound jet and demanding $500,000 in unmarked $20&nbsp;notes. The caller and threat were taken seriously when he directed police to an airport locker where a functional bomb was found. Arrangements were made to pick up the money in front of the head office of the airline in the heart of the Sydney business district. Qantas paid the money and it was collected, after which Mr.&nbsp;Brown called again, advising the "bomb on the plane" story was a hoax. The initial pursuit of the perpetrator was bungled by the [[New South Wales Police Force]] which, despite having been advised of the matter from the time of the first call, failed to establish adequate surveillance of the pick-up of the money. Directed not to use their radios (for fear of being "overheard"), the police were unable to communicate adequately.<ref>{{cite book | last =Young | first =Barry | title =The Qantas Extortion Case | publisher=Qantas Public Affairs Department | location =Sydney }}</ref> Tipped off by a still-unidentified informer, the police arrested an Englishman, Peter Macari,<ref>{{cite news | last =Macey | first =Richard | title ='Mr Brown' and riddle of the man who just vanished |work=Sydney Morning Herald | date =25 May 2002 | url =http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/24/1022038477530.html | accessdate =17 December 2006}}</ref> finding more than $138,000 hidden in an [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]] property.

== Controversies ==

===Sex discrimination controversy===
{{Main|Airline sex discrimination policy controversy}}
In November 2005 it was revealed that Qantas had a policy of not seating adult male passengers next to unaccompanied children. This led to accusations of discrimination. The policy came to light following an incident in 2004 when Mark Wolsay, who was seated next to a young boy on a Qantas flight in New Zealand, was asked to change seats with a female passenger. A steward informed him that "it was the airline's policy that only women were allowed to sit next to unaccompanied children".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10357510 |title=Ban on men sitting next to children |date=29 November 2005|work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=8 July 2011 |first=Ainsley |last=Thomson}}</ref> Cameron Murphy of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties president criticised the policy and stated that "there was no basis for the ban". He said it was wrong to assume that all adult males posed a danger to children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,10166,17403443-462,00.html?from=rss |work=News Limited |title=Qantas ban on men 'discriminatory' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501070249/http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0%2C10166%2C17403443-462%2C00.html?from=rss |archivedate= 1 May 2008 }}</ref> The policy has also been criticised for failing to take female abusers into consideration.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sex discrimination controversy | author=7:30 Report | publisher=ABC TV | url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s120777.htm | accessdate=27 May 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016222157/http://abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s120777.htm | archive-date=16 October 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2010, when British Airways was successfully sued to change its child seating policy, Qantas argued again that banning men from sitting next to unaccompanied children "reflected parents' concerns".<ref>[[BBC News]]: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11061577 BA changes child seating policy following court case], 23 August 2010. Retrieved 15 August 2012</ref> In August 2012, the controversy resurfaced when a male passenger had to swap seats with a female passenger after the crew noticed he was sitting next to an unrelated girl travelling alone. The man felt discriminated against and humiliated before the other passengers as a possible [[Pedophilia|paedophile]].<ref name="Nurse 'humiliated' by Qantas policy">[[The Age]]: ''[http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-incidents/nurse-humiliated-by-qantas-policy-20120813-243t4.html Nurse 'humiliated' by Qantas policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815221952/http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-incidents/nurse-humiliated-by-qantas-policy-20120813-243t4.html |date=15 August 2012 }}'', 13 August 2012.

===Price fixing===
In 2006 a class action lawsuit, alleging price-fixing on air cargo freight, was commenced in Australia. The lawsuit was settled early in 2011 with Qantas agreeing to pay in excess of $21&nbsp;million to settle the case.<ref>{{cite web|author=Freight Transport |url=http://www.eyefortransport.com/content/qantas-settles-us-class-action-lawsuit |title=Qantas settles US class action lawsuit |publisher=EyeforTransport |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117040206/http://eyefortransport.com/content/qantas-settles-us-class-action-lawsuit |archivedate=17 January 2011}}</ref>

Qantas has pleaded guilty to participating in a cartel that fixed the price of air cargo.

{{main|2011 Qantas industrial disputes}}
In response to ongoing industrial unrest over failed negotiations involving three unions (the [[Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association]] (ALAEA), the [[Australian and International Pilots Association]] (AIPA) and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia]] (TWU)), the company grounded its entire domestic and international fleet from 5&nbsp;pm [[Time in Australia|AEDT]] on 29 October.

The grounding affected an estimated 68,000 customers worldwide.

===Asylum seeker deportations===
Qantas has been subject to protests in relation to the deportation of asylum seekers, which led to disruptions of flights. In 2015 activists prevented the transfer of a Tamil man from Melbourne to Darwin (from where he was to be deported to Colombo) by refusing to take their seats on a Qantas flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/protesting-uni-student-who-held-up-flight-told-to-pay-qantas/7816930|title=Protesting uni student who held up flight told to pay Qantas $3,430|first=Journalist Sarah|last=McVeigh|date=5 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/02/woman-who-protested-against-asylum-seekers-deportation-on-qantas-flight-to-plead-not-guilty|title=Woman who protested against asylum seeker's deportation on Qantas flight to plead not guilty|first=Melissa|last=Davey|date=1 September 2016|website=the Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://newmatilda.com/2015/03/03/qantas-bans-second-passenger-over-tarmac-tamil-protest|title=Qantas Bans Second Passenger Over Tarmac Tamil Protest - New Matilda|date=3 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/qbeypm/protesters-on-a-plane-stopped-an-asylum-seeker-deportation|title=An Australian Protester on a Plane Stopped an Asylum Seeker from Being Potentially Deported|date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warcry.org.au/single-post/2016/09/09/Jasmine-Pilbrow-Qantas-and-the-cost-of-justice|title=Jasmine Pilbrow, Qantas and the cost of justice - Salvos Warcry Magazine|website=Salvos Warcry Magazine}}</ref> It was reported that Qantas banned the student from taking Qantas flights in the future.

A protest by the man led to him not being put on the plane. A spokesman for Qantas said flight QF838 was delayed almost two hours. The delays reportedly caused inconvenience to multiple passengers, especially those with connecting flights. A spokesperson from Qantas stated that "[s]afety and security is the number-one priority for all airlines and an aircraft is not the right place for people to conduct protests."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/protest-at-melbourne-airport-stops-forced-transfer-of-tamil-asylum-seeker|title=Protest at Melbourne airport stops forced transfer of Tamil asylum seeker|first1=Oliver|last1=Milman|first2=Ben|last2=Doherty|date=10 March 2015|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Campaigners also asked Qantas to rule out deporting Iraqi man Saeed in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://socialist-alliance.org/news/no-deportation-free-saeed-villawood-detention-centre|title=No deportation.
