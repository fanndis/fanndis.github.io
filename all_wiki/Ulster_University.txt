==History==
In 1963, the [[Government of Northern Ireland (1921–1972)|government of Northern Ireland]] appointed a committee to review facilities for university and higher technical education in Northern Ireland, modelled on [[Robbins Report|the committee on higher education in Great Britain]] chaired by [[Lionel Robbins]] which had reported that year. The Northern Ireland committee was chaired by Sir [[John Lockwood (classicist)|John Lockwood]], Master of [[Birkbeck College]], London. The Robbins Report had recommended a substantial expansion of higher education in Great Britain, partly triggered by the [[Anderson Report (British Education)|Anderson Report of 1960]], which increased demand by instigating a [[Student loans and grants in the United Kingdom|student grant]]s scheme.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/robbins1963.html  |author=Committee on Higher Education |title=Report of the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister under the Chairmanship of Lord Robbins 1961-63 |date=October 1963 |publisher=HMSO |location=London  |series=Command papers |volume=Cmnd. 2154 |accessdate=11 September 2020}}</ref> The Lockwood committee was expected to recommend a second university in Northern Ireland, after [[Queen's University Belfast]].  

In [[Derry]] groups led by the [[University for Derry Committee]] hoped that [[Magee College|Magee University College]] would become the new university. Founded as a Presbyterian training college in 1845, Magee was associated with the [[Royal University of Ireland]] which existed between 1880 and 1908, and then with the [[University of Dublin]] until 1953. However, the [[Lockwood Report]] criticised Magee's cramped site, complacent culture, and "eccentric" and "barely workable" administration; it found its claim to be based on historical entitlement rather than planning for future.<ref name="obrien2009p34t35">{{cite book |chapter=Lockwood and After |last1=O'Brien |first1=Gerard |editor-last1=Roebuck |editor-first1=Peter |editor-last2=O'Brien |editor-first2=Gerard |title=The University of Ulster: Genesis and Growth |date=2009 |publisher=Four Courts |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-84682-139-4 |pages=34–35}}</ref><ref>[[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]], ED 39/3</ref> Instead, the report recommended a greenfield university in [[Coleraine]] and closing Magee.<ref name="obrien2009p34t35"/> This was controversial, with many [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]s  suggesting the [[unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[O'Neill ministry]]  favoured a unionist-majority area rather than nationalist-majority Derry. Disgruntlement fed the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] which helped spark [[the Troubles]].<ref name = "The Trouble">{{cite book|author=Tim Pat Coogan|title=The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal and the Search for Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=33sWKhmPl3UC&pg=PA50|year=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-29418-2|page=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=Gerard |title=Derry and Londonderry: History and Society; Interdisciplinary Essays on the History of an Irish County |date=1999 |publisher=Geography Publications |pages=647–696 |url=https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/education/second_university/obrien99.htm |accessdate=11 September 2020 |chapter='Our Magee Problem': Stormont and the Second University |via=[[CAIN]]}}</ref> The "New University of Ulster" (NUU)  enrolled its first students at Coleraine in 1968.<ref name="Williamson1993"/> Magee was not closed but incorporated in the NUU, which obtained a [[charter]] in 1970.<ref name="Williamson1993">{{cite journal |last1=Williamson |first1=Arthur P. |title=Policy for higher education in Northern Ireland: The New University of Ulster and the origins of the University of Ulster |journal=Irish Educational Studies |date=March 1993 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=285–301 |doi=10.1080/0332331930120126}}</ref> 

Following a review of higher education in Northern Ireland under the chairmanship of [[Henry Chilver, Baron Chilver|Sir Henry Chilver]] in 1982 the [[Northern Ireland Office]] decided to merge NUU with another Lockwood Report foundation, the Ulster Polytechnic in [[Jordanstown]].<ref name="Williamson1993"/> The NUU charter was surrendered and the merged University of Ulster (dropping "New" from the name) got its charter on 1 October 1984.<ref name="Williamson1993"/> Later the [[Belfast]] School of Art and Design (founded in 1849) became part of the university.

Campus One, the Virtual Campus of the university, was launched on 8 October 2001 which successfully facilitated the provision on undergraduate and postgraduate level courses via distance learning.<ref name="Access & Distributed Learning http://adl.ulster.ac.uk">{{cite web |author=Access & Distributed Learning http://adl.ulster.ac.uk |url=http://campusone.ulster.ac.uk/aboutus/news.php?nid=16 |title=eLearning at the University of Ulster |publisher=Campusone.ulster.ac.uk |accessdate=22 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627014659/http://campusone.ulster.ac.uk/aboutus/news.php?nid=16 |archivedate=27 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The university now simply refers to this as distance learning.

The university formerly had a laboratory named 'The University of Ulster Freshwater Laboratory' at [[Traad|Traad Point]] on the shore of [[Lough Neagh]] in [[Ballymaguigan]]. The Freshwater Laboratory, although not a campus, was a site of the university and consisted of on-campus accommodation, classrooms and testing labs. Courses offered were in agriculture, the wildlife of Lough Neagh, water testing and other aquatic courses. The site is now owned by [[Magherafelt District Council]]. By 2010, the area had become popular with the locals for camping, fishing and sailing.

In autumn 2011 Vice-Chancellor Barnett announced a programme of financial restructuring with the aim of reducing the number of staff employed by the University from 3,150 to 3,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moriarty|first=Gerry|title=Learning curve for North's universities as cheaper fees may create free-for-all |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1129/1224308280653.html|newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date=29 November 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}</ref> Staff at the University expressed concern about the proposed means and impact of the restructuring, citing "the use of the threat of compulsory redundancy to bully and intimidate staff" and the belief that the University was "abdicating its responsibilities to the wider community that funds it".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reisz |first=Matthew |title=Cuts threaten access reputation, Ulster staff claim |newspaper=Times Higher Education Supplement |date=22 March 2012 |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=419409 }}</ref>

In April 2012, the Ulster University branch of the University and College Union (UCU) declared a formal dispute with university management over its implementation of the restructuring, stating that the recourse to "premature deadlines and unwarranted threats of compulsory redundancy" was "unreasonable as well as contrary to University policy and corporate goals".<ref>Fawcett, Lyn S.,[http://www.ulster.ac.uk/ucu/Documents/Declaration%20of%20dispute%20UCU%20April%202012.pdf "UCU Declaration of Dispute".

The reasons for cuts are not, however, unique to Ulster University. First of all, there was the [[Great Recession]] that began in 2008 and engendered a change in government and a sharp reduction in public spending. Secondly, there were issues pertaining to tuition fees. As a result of political devolution in the United Kingdom (mandated from 1998 onwards), [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|fees differ in the four countries]] that make up the union. For undergraduate tuition they are currently £9,250 in England but only £4,030 in Northern Ireland. For a while, the low fees in Northern Ireland were hailed as a triumph for devolution and seemed a tool to facilitate access for less advantaged students. Universities in Northern Ireland fared reasonably well financially. However, as Pritchard and Slowey<ref>PRITCHARD, R.M.O. and Slowey, M. (2017) "Resilience: a High Price for Survival? The Impact of Austerity on Irish Higher Education, South and North", in Debating Austerity in Ireland: Crisis, Experience and Recovery, edited by Emma Heffernan, John McHale and Niamh Moore-Cherry, Dublin: Royal Irish Academy, pp. 175-190.</ref> point out, if the government does not make up the shortfall, low fees left Northern Ireland universities at a disadvantage compared to their English counterparts. In 2015, the government reduced the funding allocation for Higher Education Institutions by 8.2%. Both Northern Ireland universities had to make cuts. Queen's University announced immediate job cuts of 236 and student number reductions of ca. 290 (1,010 over the next three years).<ref>ibid.: 184</ref> Ulster also announced its intention of cutting over 200 jobs and 250 student places in 2015/16 (1,200 over the following three years).

==Campuses==
Ulster University is Northern Ireland's regional university with four local campuses, in [[Belfast]], [[Coleraine]], [[Jordanstown]] and [[Derry]] (Magee college). There are also two other branch campuses, in [[London]] and [[Birmingham]] to deliver courses.

An online [[distance learning]] provision offers Ulster University courses globally. The University was among the first Universities to offer degree level programs through its previous "Campus One" program and was a pioneer in the introduction of online degree level courses in Biomedical Sciences.<ref name="Access & Distributed Learning http://adl.ulster.ac.uk"/><ref name="Archive of Campus One (http://campusone.ulster.ac.uk/staff/vista.php)">{{cite web|url=http://campusone.ulster.ac.uk/staff/vista.php |title=Archive of campusone.ulster.ac.uk |publisher=WayBackMachine / Ulster University (then University of Ulster) |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=4 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208235643/http://campusone.ulster.ac.uk/staff/vista.php |archivedate=8 December 2008 }}</ref><ref name="researchgate.net">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335392091_UU_BMS_25-40_Years_August_2019</ref> The university was subsequently selected by the European Commission to deliver the world's first Higher Educational Programme in Hydrogen Safety Engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hysafe.org/MScHSE|title=PgCert/PgDip/MS cc in Hydrogen Safety Engineering - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>

===Belfast===
{{Merge to|Ulster University at Belfast|section=yes|date=September 2020}}
The [[Ulster University at Belfast]] is in the city’s Cathedral Quarter, its artistic and cultural centre. Although traditionally associated with art and home to the university's School of Art, originally inaugurated as the Belfast School of Art and Design in 1849, the campus has a range of subjects including architecture, hospitality, event management, photography and digital animation. The award-winning Law Clinic is based at the Belfast campus, offering free legal advice on social security and employment law.

Ulster University has been expanding and developing the Belfast campus since 2009 as part of one of Northern Ireland's largest-ever urban developments, and nearly 15,000 students and staff will soon be based in the city centre. The first phase of this development opened in 2015 and completion of the project is due in 2019.

===Coleraine===
{{Merge to|Ulster University at Coleraine|section=yes|date=September 2020}}
The [[Ulster University at Coleraine]] is on the banks of the [[River Bann]] with views to the North Coast and County Donegal hills. Subjects taught at Coleraine include biomedical sciences, environmental science and geography, pharmacy, psychology, the humanities, film and journalism, travel and tourism as well as teacher training. 

The Coleraine campus hosts the only optometry school in Northern Ireland and is home to the [[Riverside Theatre, Coleraine|Riverside Theatre]], the third-largest professional theatre in Northern Ireland.

A major development at Coleraine was the introduction of the degree programme in biomedical sciences in 1980.<ref>http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/printPerson/2114</ref> This subject area grew into a leading UK centre in teaching and research, ranked first in the UK in three successive Research Assessment Exercises (1996, 2001 and 2008). It also spawned the development of related subject areas including human nutrition, radiography, clinical science, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, pharmacology and stratified medicine.<ref>The Biomedical Scientist, July 2007</ref><ref name="researchgate.net"/> 

In 2002, £14.5 million was awarded under the Support Programme for University Research (SPUR) to establish the Centre for Molecular Biosciences at Coleraine.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1795004.stm</ref>

The Coleraine campus now hosts a number of courses which were previously held at the School of Hotel, Leisure and Tourism in Portrush. This Portrush site closed in 2008, with courses relocated to the Coleraine and the newly developed Belfast campuses.

In 2009 the university launched a new Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) course at Coleraine, becoming the top UK university for pharmacy and pharmacology in 2014 and maintaining that position in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

In July 2011, in cooperation with [[Zhejiang University of Media and Communications (ZUMC)]], 'The Confucius Institute at Ulster University' (CIUU) was developed. The Confucius Institute is part of a network of 322 institutes in over 50 countries which promote and teach Chinese language and culture and facilitate cultural exchanges aimed at fostering trade links with China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulster.ac.uk/confucius/index.php|title=About Confucius- Confucius Institute at the University of Ulster|accessdate=16 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717013850/http://www.ulster.ac.uk/confucius/index.php|archivedate=17 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In Spring 2015, a new £5.1 million teaching block was completed at the Coleraine Campus providing an active learning environment and allowing for more flexible and technology-led learning styles.

In Summer 2015, the new Faculty of Arts building was opened following a £6.75million investment which is home to a vast digital media archive, state-of-the-art media facilities, including radio and television studios, and a postgraduate research centre as well as office and administration accommodation.

===Jordanstown===
{{Merge to|Ulster University at Jordanstown|section=yes|date=September 2020}}
The [[Ulster University at Jordanstown]], often informally referred to as UUJ, was formerly the site of the Ulster College of Physical Education, one of several Colleges which came together in the formation of the Ulster Polytechnic, and is the largest university campus. The {{convert|114|acre|km2|adj=on}} site is located seven miles north of Belfast city centre situated at the foot of the Antrim Hills overlooking Belfast Lough. The buildings are mostly situated around a central mall with on-site stores and services. The campus has a strong profile in business, engineering, social sciences (including [[Ulster University School of Law|law]]), communication and academic disciplines relating to the science and coaching of sport. Sport plays a significant part in the life of the campus. It is home to the Sports Institute of Northern Ireland, a partnership between the University and Sport Northern Ireland, and most of Northern Ireland's elite athletes train in the impressive facilities. The campus is also the only university in Northern Ireland to offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses in various Allied Health Professions, such as Cardiac and Respiratory Clinical Physiology, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Radiography, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Podiatry and Speech and Language Therapy. The campus is also the only campus delivering courses in Biomedical Engineering within Northern Ireland.

===Magee===
{{Merge to|Magee College|section=yes|date=September 2020}}
The [[Ulster University at Magee|Magee campus]] in the city of [[Derry]] comprises a mixture of historic and new buildings in a Victorian residential area.
It was named after [[Martha Magee]] and opened in 1865 as a [[Presbyterian]] Christian arts and [[Seminary|theological college]].<ref name="magee-history">{{cite web|title=History of Magee College|url=http://library.ulster.ac.uk/magee/history.htm|publisher=UU Library|accessdate=7 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626003541/http://library.ulster.ac.uk/magee/history.htm|archivedate=26 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since 1953, it has had no religious affiliation, and was one of the founding campuses of the university in 1968. Ongoing investment in the Magee campus provides teaching, research and support facilities for students and staff. This investment has delivered a student residential village offering en-suite accommodation, a library, the Intelligent Systems Research Centre, the Foyle Arts Building and a state of the art Centre for Engineering and Renewable Energy offering a wide range of Engineering courses.

In addition to the university's teaching and learning facilities, the campus has on-site residential, catering and sports facilities. Sports facilities include a multi-purpose sports hall, fitness suite and studio as well as a grass and floodlit synthetic 3G pitch with pavilion and changing facilities.
