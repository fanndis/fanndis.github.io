She is known for her stripped-down songwriting style in the [[folk music]] genre. Her songs have been covered by numerous musicians, including [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Ellis Paul]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Rory Block]], [[Dave Hause]], [[Sugarland]] and [[The Chicks]].

In 2007, Griffin received the Artist of the Year award from the [[Americana Music Association]], and her album ''[[Children Running Through]]'' won the award for Best Album.

In 2011, Griffin's album ''[[Downtown Church]]'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Gospel Album]] and her 2019 [[Patty Griffin (album)|self-titled album]] won the [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]].

==Biography==
Griffin is from [[Old Town, Maine]], United States, next to the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] [[Native American reservation]]. The youngest child in her family, with six older siblings, she bought a guitar for $50 at age 16. She sang and played but had no inclination to become a professional musician. After a 6-year marriage, which ended in 1994, Griffin began playing in Boston coffee houses and was scouted by [[A&M Records]], which signed her on the strength of her demo tape. When the finished studio recordings were submitted to A&M, the company executives thought it was overproduced, so producer [[Nile Rodgers]] and A&M instead released a stripped-down reworking of her demo tape as the album ''[[Living with Ghosts]].''<ref name="Harris">Harris, Craig (accessed March 17, 2008) [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=patty griffin|bio=true}} Billboard com]</ref>

Griffin's second album, ''[[Flaming Red]]'', released in 1998, was a departure from the [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound of ''Living with Ghosts'', with a mix of mellow songs and high-tempo [[rock and roll]] songs. The title track, "Flaming Red", is an example of the latter, beginning with an even beat until it increases to a fevered pitch of emotion. Another song from the album, "Tony", is also featured on the charity benefit album ''[[Live in the X Lounge]]''.

Her third album, ''[[Silver Bell (album)|Silver Bell]]'', has a sound similar to its predecessor. It was released by A&M in 2013, 13 years after it was recorded (and well after bootlegged copies had been circulated). A&M dropped Griffin's contract after ''Silver Bell'' was recorded, and she was then signed by [[Dave Matthews]]'s [[ATO Records]]. Griffin re-recorded songs from that album for later releases, such as "Making Pies", "Mother of God", "Standing", and "[[Top of the World (Dixie Chicks song)|Top of the World]]". Copies of the unreleased ''Silver Bell'' were leaked and bootlegged and can be easily acquired by the B&P ([[blanks and postage]]) method on [[message boards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pattynet.net/forum/|title=PattyNet • Index page|website=Pattynet.net|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref> In August 2013, it was announced that [[Universal Music Enterprises|UM<sup>e</sup>]] planned to release ''Silver Bell'', mixed by producer [[Glyn Johns]], in October 2013.<ref name="Billboard 20130731">{{cite news|last=Votaw|first=Emily|title=Patty Griffin's Lost 'Silver Bell' Album to Be Released in October|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 31, 2013|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5327862/patty-griffins-lost-silver-bell-album-to-be-released-in-october|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

Four albums followed on ATO: ''[[1000 Kisses (album)|1000 Kisses]]'' (2002), ''[[A Kiss in Time]]'' (2003), ''[[Impossible Dream]]'' (2004), and ''[[Children Running Through]]'' (2007).

In 2004, Griffin toured with Emmylou Harris, [[Buddy Miller]], [[Gillian Welch]] and [[David Rawlings]] as the [[Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue]]. On February 6, 2007, she released ''[[Children Running Through]]''. The album debuted at number 34 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 27,000 copies sold.<ref name="Zuel">{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054981/fall-out-boy-hits-high-note-with-no-1-debut |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305115440/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054981/fall-out-boy-hits-high-note-with-no-1-debut |archive-date=March 5, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Of the album, Griffin told ''Gibson Lifestyle'', "I just kind of felt like singing what I wanted to sing, and playing how I wanted to play.

Griffin's songs have been recorded by numerous artists, including the Irish-born singer [[Maura O'Connell]] ("Long Ride Home"), [[Linda Ronstadt]] ("Falling Down"), [[The Chicks]] ("Truth No. 2", "Top of the World", "Let Him Fly", "Mary"), [[Bette Midler]], [[Melissa Ferrick]] and [[Missy Higgins]] ("Moses"), [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Christine Collister]], and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] ("Dear Old Friend"), [[Jessica Simpson]] ("Let Him Fly"), [[Martina McBride]] ("Goodbye"), Emmylou Harris ("One Big Love", "Moon Song"), [[Bethany Joy Galeotti]] ("Blue Sky"), [[the Wreckers]] ("One More Girl"), [[Keri Noble]] and [[Ruthie Foster]] ("When It Don't Come Easy"), [[Joan Osborne]] ("What You Are"), [[Solomon Burke]] ("[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]"), and [[Miranda Lambert]] ("Getting Ready"). [[Kelly Clarkson]] performed "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]" with [[Jeff Beck]] on guitar, accompanied by some orchestration on the "[[Idol Gives Back]]" episode of ''[[American Idol]]'', and the live recording was released as a single immediately afterwards, reaching number 56 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in its first week and giving Griffin her highest-charting position as a songwriter. (The audience gave Clarkson a [[standing ovation]] following her performance.) Griffin's version of the song was featured in episode 11 of the fourth season of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.
