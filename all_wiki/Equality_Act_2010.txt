The '''Equality Act 2010'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=22 September 2016|ref={{sfnref|Equality Act}}}}</ref> is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] with the primary purpose of consolidating, updating and supplementing the numerous prior Acts and Regulations, that formed the basis of [[anti-discrimination law]] in Great Britain.  These consisted, primarily, the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Race Relations Act 1976]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and three major [[statutory instruments]] protecting discrimination in employment on grounds of [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003|religion or belief]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|sexual orientation]] and [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006|age]].<ref>E McGaughey, ''A Casebook on Labour Law'' (Hart 2019) chs 12–14.

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/notes/division/2/1 'Equality Act 2010 Explanatory Notes/Introduction/Background and summary']</ref> 

The act has broadly the same goals as the four major EU [[Equal Treatment Directive]]s, whose provisions it mirrors and implements.<ref>see [[Employment Equality Framework Directive|EU Directive 2000/78/EC]], 2000/43/EC, 2006/54/EC</ref> However, the act also offers protection beyond the EU directives, protecting against discrimination based on a person's nationality and citizenship<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/race-discrimination|title=Race discrimination|website=Equality and Human Rights Commission}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFhPNz_PaZ0|title=What is race discrimination? – Equality law: discrimination explained|publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission|date=29 May 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> and also extending individuals' rights in areas of life beyond the workplace in religion or belief, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/your-rights-under-equality-act-2010|title=Your rights under the Equality Act 2010|website=Equality and Human Rights Commission}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/know-your-rights/equality/non-discrimination_en|title=Non-discrimination|website=European Commission}}</ref>

The Act protects people against discrimination, harassment or victimisation in employment, and as users of private and public services based on nine protected characteristics:  age, [[disability]], [[sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, [[sex]], and [[sexual orientation]]. The Act includes provisions for single-sex services where the restrictions are "a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim".{{sfn|Equality Act|loc=schedule 3, part 7, para 28}} In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make [[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustments]] to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people. In this regard, the Equality Act 2010 did not change the law. Under s.217, with [[Disability in Northern Ireland| limited exceptions]] the Act does not apply to [[Northern Ireland]].{{sfn|Equality Act|loc=s.217}}

==Background==
{{main|UK employment discrimination law}}
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] included a commitment to an Equality Bill in its 2005 election manifesto. The ''Discrimination Law Review'' was established in 2005 to develop the legislation and was led by the [[Government Equalities Office]]. The review considered the findings of the Equalities Review Panel, chaired by [[Trevor Phillips]], which reported in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/dlr/index.htm|title=Discrimination Law Review (DLR)|publisher=Government Equalities Office}}</ref> The Act is intended to simplify the law by bringing together existing anti-discrimination legislation. The Equality Act 2010 has replaced the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], [[Race Relations Act 1976]], [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003]]<ref>See also, [[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations]]</ref> and the [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006]].

[[Polly Toynbee]] wrote that the bill, which was drafted under the guidance of [[Harriet Harman]], was "Labour's biggest idea for 11 years. A public-sector duty to close the gap between rich and poor will tackle the class divide in a way that no other policy has... This new duty to narrow the gap would permeate every aspect of government policy. Its possible ramifications are mind-bogglingly immense." One cabinet member described it as "socialism in one clause".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/13/polly-toynbee-harriet-harman-social-mobility guardian.co.uk: "Harman's law is Labour's biggest idea for 11 years"] (Toynbee) 13 January 2009</ref>

Sections 104–105 of the Act extend until 2030 the exemption from sex discrimination law, which allows political parties to create [[all-women shortlist]]s.<ref name=equalityhumanrights-2011>{{cite book |pages=179–182 |url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/servicescode_0.pdf |title=Equality Act 2010 Statutory Code of Practice – Services, public functions and associations |isbn=9780108509728 |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |year=2011 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> The exemption was previously permitted by the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]].

The Parliamentary process was completed, following a debate, shortly after 11&nbsp;pm on 6 April 2010, when amendments by the House of Lords were accepted in full.<ref>See the debate in Hansard HC vol 508 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100406/debtext/100406-0021.htm#1004073000001 cols 927–942] (6 April 2010)</ref>

==Debate==
===Reform of the monarchy===
In April 2008, [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Vera Baird]] announced that as part of the Single Equality Bill, legislation would be introduced to repeal parts of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] that prevent [[Roman Catholics]] or those who marry Roman Catholics from ascending to the throne, and to change the inheritance of the monarchy from [[Primogeniture#Cognatic primogeniture|cognatic primogeniture]] to [[Primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]], so that the first-born heir would inherit the throne regardless of gender or religion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7357017.stm|accessdate=21 April 2008|title=Move to change succession laws|date=20 April 2008|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]}}</ref>

However, later in 2008 the Attorney General [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal|Baroness Scotland of Asthal]] decided not to sponsor a change in the law of succession, saying, "To bring about changes to the law on succession would be a complex undertaking involving amendment or repeal of a number of items of related legislation, as well as requiring the consent of legislatures of member nations of the Commonwealth".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/1905565/U-turn-on-royal-succession-law-change.html|title=U-turn on royal succession law change|author=Andrew Pierce|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The published draft bill did not contain any provisions to change the succession laws. Cognatic primogeniture for the British monarchy was instead abolished separately three years after the Equality Act came into force, with the enactment of the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]].

===Opposition by Roman Catholic Bishops===
Although the act was never going to change the law with regard to churches from its existing position, nor change the binding European Union law which covers many more Roman Catholics than those living in the United Kingdom, and although the position had been spelled out in the High Court in ''[[R (Amicus) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]'',<ref>[2004] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2004/860.html EWHC 860 (Admin)]</ref> a small number of Roman Catholic bishops in England and Wales made claims that they might in future be prosecuted under the Equality Act 2010 for refusing to allow women, married men, transgender people, and gay people into the priesthood.<ref name="thebostonpilot1">[http://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.asp?ID=11224 English, Welsh bishops say Equality Bill redefines who can be priest]{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=18231 |title=Equality Bill redefines who can be priest: UK Bishops |publisher=Cathnews.com |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103215847/http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=18231 |archivedate=3 January 2010 }}</ref> This claim was rejected by the government.  A spokesman said an exemption in the law "covers ministers of religion such as Catholic priests"<ref name="thebostonpilot1"/> and a document released by the Government Equalities Office states that "the Equality Bill will not change the existing legal position regarding churches and employment".<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/Equality%20Bill%20and%20Religion%20for%20press%20and%20website%20(3).pdf |title=Myth-Busting: the Equality Bill and Religion |accessdate=10 January 2010 |format=PDF |publisher=Government Equalities Office |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mfNU5Tok?url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/Equality%20Bill%20and%20Religion%20for%20press%20and%20website%20%283%29.pdf |archivedate=10 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}  ''In the case of Ministers of Religion and other jobs which exist to promote and represent religion, the Bill recognises that a church may need to impose requirements regarding sexual orientation, sex, marriage and civil partnership or gender reassignment if it is necessary to comply with its teachings or the strongly held beliefs of followers. However, it would not be right to permit such requirements across all jobs within organised religions, such as administrators and accountants, and the Equality Bill makes this clear.''</ref>  The legislation was also criticised by Anglican clergy.<ref>[http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=5374 UK Government attacked over Equality Bill] {{Dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=October 2020}}</ref>

==Exempt occupations==
{{refimprove section|date = December 2017}}
Certain employment is exempted from the Act, including:

*Priests, monks, nuns, rabbis and ministers of religion.
*Actors and models in the film, television and fashion industries (a [[British Chinese]] actress for a specific role, for instance).
*Special employment training programmes aimed at ethnic minorities, ex-offenders, young adults, the long term unemployed, or people with physical or learning disabilities.
*Employment where there are cultural sensitivities (such as a documentary where male victims of domestic violence need to be interviewed by a male researcher, or a gay men's domestic violence helpline).
*Where safety or operational efficiency could be jeopardised.
*Political parties who use 'protected characteristics' (age, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/equality-act/protected-characteristics|title=Protected characteristics {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref> as candidate selection criteria; however, these 'Selection arrangements do not include short-listing only such persons as have a particular protected characteristic'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/7/crossheading/special-provision-for-political-parties|title=Equality Act 2010|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref> other than sex,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/sex-discrimination|title=Sex discrimination {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref> which may still be used to prejudice selection in some circumstances (e.g. all-women/all-men shortlists).
*Local support staff who work in embassies and high commissions, by virtue of [[diplomatic immunity]].
* Where national security could be jeopardised.
