==Premise==
Sam-I-Am rescues the rare Chickeraffe from a zoo, saying that he intends to return it to its natural habitat. After he accidentally swaps his briefcase, containing the Chickeraffe, for that of failed inventor Guy-Am-I (the unnamed character in the original book), Sam and Guy end up on an road trip adventure with EB, a girl who wants to adopt the Chickeraffe as a pet, and EB's overprotective mother Michellee, who is also a romantic interest for Guy. The four are pursued by a wealthy, arrogant poacher and collector, Snerz, who wants to claim the Chickeraffe (named Mr. Jenkins by E.B.) as a trophy; two mysterious "B.A.D.G.U.Y.S." named McWinkle and Gluntz; and Snerz's bounty hunter Goat (as in the goat that rhymed with "boat" in the book).

 |ShortSummary    = As McWinkle and Gluntz zero in on Sam, Goat survives the avalanche and continues to hunt for the Chickeraffe. Sam, Guy and Mr. Jenkins arrive and try to book a motel room where everyone seems to recognize Guy. It is revealed that Stovepipe Junction is Guy's birthplace and he was considered most likely to succeed in high school. Guy wants to avoid seeing his family as they consider him a failure and they try to enter his childhood tree house. They get caught, but contrary to Guy's claim, his family is fully supportive of his creative endeavors. He announces to them all that he is no longer inventing and that he is going to become a paint watcher and leaves to his tree house angrily. Sam goes to talk to Guy, who admits that he feels insecure around his family due to their successful achievements. Sam then reveals that he himself never had a family and lived most of his life in an orphanage (throughout the show he mentions his bizarre past with his mother, but that was all lies). The reason why he loves green eggs and ham is because he still remembers how his mother cooks them and he hoped to this day that once he find the right flavor from various diners he visited, he would find her as well. Guy feels better and apologizes. When Sam enters the house he calls Snerz, revealing that he is actually the one employed by Snerz to take the Chickeraffe to him from the very start.

 |ShortSummary    = E.B. is heartbroken upon seeing Sam sell Mr. Jenkins to Snerz. She tries to break him out and ends up getting the attention of both Michellee and Guy, who went to investigate the noises coming from behind a wall he was [[watching paint dry]] from. Michellee points the finger at Guy, causing them to argue with one another upon seeing Snerz's pet collection. E.B. realizes that the Chickeraffe is actually a painted Girooster which relieves Guy and Michellee. The three escape just as Snerz realizes he has been "bamboozled". They find Sam at a cold air balloon port with plans to send Mr. Jenkins back home. Sam is still upset at Guy for what he said earlier and Guy makes it up to him by finally eating green eggs and ham, much to his own surprised enjoyment. McWinkle, Gluntz and Snerz arrive and chase the group up the port tower. Snerz gets entrapped while McWinkle and Gluntz let them go upon learning of Sam's mission. The balloon gets hijacked by Goat and Guy uses his invention to save Mr. Jenkins and finally defeat Goat as well as receiving a kiss from Michellee. The next day, Sam and Guy are having green eggs and ham when Sam recognizes the taste as his mother's. He learns that the eggs come from East Flubria and he and Guy set off on another adventure.
