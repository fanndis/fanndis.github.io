In 2012, Ocean released his debut studio album ''[[Channel Orange]]'' to universal acclaim from critics, who later named it the best album of the year in the [[HMV's Poll of Polls]]. It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. [[Funk]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name="Johnson">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] wrote,<blockquote>"Frank Ocean has been one of the more fascinating figures in contemporary music since his early-2010s arrival. A singer and songwriter whose artful output has defied rigid classification as R&B, he has nonetheless pushed that genre forward with seemingly offhanded yet imaginatively detailed narratives in which he has alternated between yearning romantic and easygoing braggart."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Frank Ocean {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank-ocean-mn0002592086/biography|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref></blockquote>Culture critic [[Nelson George]] asserts that, along with [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]], Ocean has "staked out ground where [he is] not competing with those hit-driven [commercial R&B] acts" and is "cultivating a sound that balances adult concerns with a sense of young men trying to understand their own desires (an apt description of Ocean, particularly)."<ref>{{cite web|title=For The Ladies: R.

Savage praised Ocean for taking R&B to a "new level [through] constructing startling sound pictures that fit his lyrics."<ref name="Why Frank Ocean is a musical icon"/> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] regarded Ocean as a "master of confessional songwriting, earning a cult-icon status with his enigmatic persona and idiosyncratic approach to pop."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Frank Ocean – Albums, Songs, and News|url=https://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref>

==Legal issues==
Ocean sampled the music from the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' song "[[Hotel California]]" on the song "American Wedding" from ''[[Nostalgia, Ultra]]''. When asked about it, Ocean stated that Eagles band member "[[Don Henley]] is apparently intimidated by my rendition of 'Hotel California'. He threatened to sue if I perform it again." In response to Ocean's comments, the Eagles' legal representative released a statement: "Frank Ocean did not merely 'sample' a portion of the Eagles' 'Hotel California,' he took the entire master track, plus the song's existing melody, and replaced the lyrics with his own; this is not creative, let alone 'intimidating.' It's illegal. For the record, Don Henley has not threatened or instituted any legal action against Frank Ocean, although the Eagles are now considering whether they should."<ref>{{cite web |last=Garcia |first=Courtney |url=http://entertainment.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/02/10562495-did-rb-singer-steal-entire-melody-of-hotel-california |title=Did R&B singer steal entire melody of 'Hotel California'? |publisher=Entertainment.msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=February 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712043146/http://entertainment.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/02/10562495-did-rb-singer-steal-entire-melody-of-hotel-california |archivedate=July 12, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalgrind.com/music/frank-ocean-new-song-coachella-performs-american-wedding-videos |title=Frank Ocean Debuts New Song At Coachella & Performs "American Wedding" (VIDEOS) |publisher=Globalgrind.com |date=April 23, 2012 |accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> [[Ris Paul Ric|Chris Richards]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remarked that "certain [[baby boomer|boomers]] don't like Ocean as much" as "[[Information Age|information-age]] babies" due to the controversy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richards |first=Chris |date=July 24, 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/frank-ocean-at-the-930-club-contemplative-confident-rewarding/2012/07/24/gJQAIQMt6W_story.html |title=Frank Ocean at the 9:30 Club: Contemplative, confident, rewarding |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=July 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820023314/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/frank-ocean-at-the-930-club-contemplative-confident-rewarding/2012/07/24/gJQAIQMt6W_story.html |archivedate=August 20, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
