{{Emmy Awards sidebar}}

An '''Emmy Award''', or simply '''Emmy''', is a trophy presented at one of the numerous annual American events or competitions that each recognize achievements in a particular sector of the television industry. The two events that receive the most media coverage are the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and the [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, which recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively. Other notable Emmy events include those honoring [[Sports Emmy Award|national sports programming]], [[News & Documentary Emmy Award|national news and documentary shows]], and [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award|technological and engineering achievements]] in television, including the [[Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards]]. [[#Regional Emmys|Regional Emmy Awards]] are also presented throughout the country at various times through the year, recognizing excellence in local and statewide television. In addition, the [[International Emmy Award]]s honor excellence in TV programming produced and initially aired outside the United States.

The Emmy is named after "immy", an informal term for the [[Video camera tube#Image orthicon|image orthicon tube]] that was common in early television cameras. Although the weight and dimensions of the statuette may vary among the Emmy events, the basic design depicts a winged woman holding an atom.<ref name="emmyHistory"/><ref name="History of the Emmy Statue"/> The Emmy is considered one of the [[EGOT|four major American entertainment awards]], the others being the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] (for [[music]]), the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] (for [[film]]), and the [[Tony Award|Tony]] (for [[theatre|theater]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/newsenglish/witn/2007/09/070917_emmy.shtml |title=BBC Learning English &#124; Emmy awards |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> 

Three related, but separate, organizations present the Emmy Award: the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (ATAS), the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (NATAS), and the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] (IATAS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/index.php |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |title=Awards |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914122914/http://www.emmys.tv/awards/index.php |archivedate=September 14, 2008 |df=mdy}}</ref> The ATAS first awarded the Emmy in 1949 to honor shows produced in the [[Los Angeles]] area before it became a national event in the 1950s to honor programs aired nationwide. Over the next two decades, the ATAS, the NATAS, and the IATAS expanded the award to honor other sectors of the TV industry, with each organization responsible for administering a particular set of Emmy events.<ref name="emmyHistory"/>

==History==
The Los Angeles–based [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (ATAS) established the Emmy Award as part of an image-building and [[public relations]] opportunity.<ref name="emmyHistory">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/content/history-emmy-1940s | title= A History of Emmy – The 1940s | publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] | accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref> The [[1st Primetime Emmy Awards|first Emmy ceremony]] took place on January 25, 1949, at the [[Hollywood Athletic Club]], but solely to honor shows produced and aired locally in the Los Angeles area. [[Shirley Dinsdale]] has the distinction of receiving the very first Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Television Personality, during that first awards ceremony.<ref name="emmyHistory"/> The term "Emmy" is a French alteration of the television crew slang term "Immy", the nickname for an "[[Video camera tube|image orthicon]]", a camera tube once used in TV cameras.<ref>''The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories''. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 157</ref>

In the 1950s, the ATAS expanded the Emmys into a national event to honor shows aired nationwide on [[broadcast television]]. In 1955, the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] (NATAS) was formed in New York City as a sister organization to serve members on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. While the ATAS maintained a separate ceremony to honor shows aired locally in the Los Angeles area,<ref name="ATAS Los Angeles"/> the NATAS established regional chapters throughout the rest of the United States, with each one developing their own local Emmy ceremony for local programming.<ref name="emmyHistory"/>

Originally, there was only one Emmy event held per year to honor shows nationally broadcast in the United States. In 1974, the first [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]] ceremony was held to specifically honor achievement in national daytime programming. Other area-specific Emmy events soon followed. Also, the International Emmy Awards, honoring television programs produced and initially aired outside the U.S., was established in the early 1970s.<ref name="emmyHistory"/> Meanwhile, all Emmys awarded prior to the emergence of these separate, area-specific events are listed along with the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] in the ATAS's official records.<ref name="emmyRecords">{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search |title=Advanced Primetime Awards Search |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |access-date=June 27, 2008}}</ref>

In 1977, due to various conflicts, the ATAS and the NATAS agreed to split ties. However, they also agreed to share ownership of the Emmy statue and trademark, with each responsible for administering a specific set of award events.<ref name="emmyHistory"/> There was an exception regarding the Engineering Awards (those honoring individuals, companies, or scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television): The NATAS continues to administer the [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s, while the ATAS holds the separate [[Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards]].

With the rise of cable television in the 1980s, cable programs first became eligible for the Primetime Emmys in 1988,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-15/entertainment/ca-7117_1_emmy-awards | title=Cable Executives Pleased Over Shot at Emmys | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=July 15, 1988 | accessdate=September 22, 2015}}</ref> and the Daytime Emmys in 1989.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-30/entertainment/ca-3020_1_brandon-capwell-lighting-direction-daytime-emmys| title=NBC's 'Santa Barbara' Is Top Daytime Emmy Winner | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=June 30, 1989 | accessdate=September 22, 2015 | quote=In the first year that they were eligible for Daytime Emmys, cable programs did not win any during Thursday's ceremonies.

==Emmy statuette==
The Emmy statuette, depicting a winged woman holding an atom, was designed by television engineer [[Louis McManus]], who used his wife as the model. The ATAS rejected forty-seven proposals before settling on McManus's design in 1948. The statuette "has since become the symbol of the TV Academy's goal of supporting and uplifting the art and science of television: The wings represent the muse of art; the atom the electron of science."<ref name="emmyOrigin">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/academy/about/statuette | title=History of the Emmy Statuette |first=Sandra |last=Parker | publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences | accessdate= October 1, 2014}}</ref>

When deciding a name for the award, ATAS founder [[Syd Cassyd]] originally suggested "Ike", the nickname for the television [[iconoscope]] tube. However, "Ike" was also the popular nickname of [[World War II]] hero and future U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and the ATAS members wanted something unique. Finally, television engineer and the third academy president Harry Lubcke suggested the name "Immy", a term commonly used for the [[Video camera tube#Image orthicon|image orthicon tube]] used in the early cameras.<ref name="emmyOrigin"/> After "Immy" was chosen, it was later feminized to Emmy to match their female statuette.<ref name="emmyOrigin"/>

The weight and dimensions of the Emmy statuette vary among the events. Each Primetime Emmy statuette weighs six pounds, twelve-and-a-half ounces (3.08&nbsp;kg), and is made of copper, nickel, silver, and gold. The statue stands {{convert|15.5|in|cm}} tall with a base diameter of {{convert|7.5|in|cm}} and weight of 88 oz (2.5&nbsp;kg). The Regional Emmy Award statuette is 11.5&nbsp;inches (29&nbsp;cm) tall with a base diameter of 5.5&nbsp;inches (14&nbsp;cm) and weight of 48 oz (1.4&nbsp;kg). Each takes five and a half hours to make and is handled with white gloves to prevent fingerprints. The Primetime Emmy statues are manufactured by [[R.S. Owens & Company]] based in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], which was also charged with manufacturing the Academy Award statues until 2016, when [[AMPAS]] switched to Polich Tallix in [[Walden, New York]].<ref name="History of the Emmy Statue">{{cite web|last=Award|first=Emmy|title=History of the Emmy Statue|url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/history-emmy-statuette|work=NATAS History|publisher=NATAS|accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="R.S.

As its trademark owners, the ATAS and the NATAS hold firm rules on the use of the "Emmy" image as well as its name. For example, the Emmy statuette must always appear facing left. Any copyright notice for the statue should read "ATAS/NATAS", listing both academies. Academy members must also obtain permission to use the statue image or name for promotional uses even though they are winners of the award. Furthermore, DVDs of Emmy-winning shows may reference the fact that they received an Emmy, but cannot use the statue image unless it is capable of being removed from all copies one year after the award is presented.<ref name="ATAS Trademark and Copyright">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/trademark-policy | title=ATAS Copyright and Trademark Policies | publisher=ATAS |accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref><ref name="NATAS Trademark and Copyright">{{cite web | url=http://emmyonline.com/trademarks | title=NATAS Copyright and Trademark Policies | publisher=NATAS | accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref>

Various Emmy events competitions are held annually throughout the calendar year, ranging from honoring nationally televised shows to regionally and locally produced programs. Each event has its own set of award categories, nominating and voting procedures, and rules regarding voting committees, among others. It is not uncommon for one event to have some of the same category names that another event uses. (e.g. [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|''Primetime'' Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series]] and [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|''Daytime'' Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]]).

A show that enters into one of the Emmy events generally cannot also be entered into any of the others. For example, [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated shows]] whose air times vary between media markets may be eligible for both the Daytime and Primetime Emmys, but cannot enter in both.<ref name="PrimetimeEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/pte11_rulesandproced_rev6.pdf | title=63rd Primetime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] | accessdate=March 3, 2012 | quote=Syndicated programs that have reached a cumulative audience of at least 50% of the total potential U.S. television audience during the eligibility period, but not 50% exclusively in Daytime or Primetime, may enter either in Daytime or Primetime, but not in both}}</ref> In general, a show is considered national if it reaches more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that do not reach at least 50 percent of the country may enter into the Regional Emmys instead. [[Web television]] shows are treated similar to syndicated shows: they must be available for downloading or streaming by more than 50 percent of the US national market to be eligible in one of the national Emmy competitions, and they can only enter into one of those national Emmy ceremonies.<ref name="41stDaytimeEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/daytime/daytime_41st_rulebook_full.pdf | title=41st Daytime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=September 22, 2015 | quote= Series and Specials (depending on the category), and their related craft achievements must have originally aired or been made available for viewing, downloading or streaming by more than 50% of the US national market}}</ref> And a primetime show that is a [[Co-production (media)|co-production]] between U.S and overseas companies might be eligible for both the Primetime and International Emmys, but also cannot enter in both.<ref name="InternationalEmmyFAQ"/>

Regardless of which area-specific competitions in which one wins an Emmy, all winners are called an "Emmy Winner".

===Primetime Emmys===

{{main|Primetime Emmy Award|List of Primetime Emmy Awards ceremonies}}

The [[Primetime Emmy Award|Primetime Emmys]] are presented in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in mid-September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season, and are currently broadcast in rotation among the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] networks.

Some award categories presented to behind-the-scenes personnel such as [[art director]]s, [[costume designer]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[casting (performing arts)|casting directors]], and [[sound design]]ers are awarded at a separate [[Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts Emmys]] ceremony held a few days earlier.

The Primetime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the ATAS. For most categories, members from each of the ATAS's branches vote around June to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can however vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting to determine the winners is held in August.<ref name="PrimetimeEmmyRules2">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/pte11_rulesandproced_rev6.pdf | title=63rd Primetime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] | accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>

===Daytime Emmys===

{{main|Daytime Emmy Award}}

The [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, generally held in May or June, are presented in recognition of excellence in American [[daytime television]] programming. The first daytime-themed Emmy Awards were given out at the primetime ceremony in 1972, but the first separate awards show made just for daytime programming was not held until 1974.

Like the Primetime Emmys, a separate Creative Arts Emmy ceremony is also held a few days earlier to honor the behind-the-scenes personnel working in daytime television.

The Daytime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the NATAS. Voting is done by peer judging panels. Any active member of the NATAS who has national credits for at least two years and within the last five years is eligible to be a judge. Depending on the category, voting is done using either a ratings score criteria or a preferential scoring system.<ref name="DaytimeEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.daytimeemmys.tv/ | title=39th Daytime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=February 29, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301180603/http://daytimeemmys.tv/ | archive-date=March 1, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> All the drama acting categories have an additional preliminary voting round called the pre-nominations, where one or two actors from each show is selected to then move on and be considered for the primary nominations for the awards.<ref>{{cite web | title=2010 Daytime Emmy Pre-Nominations Announced | url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/2010_daytime_emmy_pre_nominations_announced/ | work=Soap Opera Digest | quote=Those are the names put forth by each show for consideration to be nominated for the awards. | accessdate=March 15, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325205052/http://soapoperadigest.com/features/2010_daytime_emmy_pre_nominations_announced/ | archivedate=March 25, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Sports Emmys===
{{details|Sports Emmy Award}}

The Sports Emmy Awards are presented by the NATAS for excellence in [[Broadcasting of sports events|sports programming]]. The awards ceremony takes place every Spring, usually sometime in the last two weeks in April or the first week in May, and is held on a Monday night in New York City.

Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national sports production to serve as judges. The panels are organized so that they only have one representative from each corporate entity (i.e. [[ViacomCBS]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[NBCUniversal]], [[Fox Corporation]], [[WarnerMedia]] etc.) Most categories only have a single voting round using preferential scoring system. The top 5 entries in each category are announced as the nominations, and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.<ref name="SportsEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.org/sports/applications/33rd/sports_33rd_annual_rulebook.pdf | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6D4g2SJ53?url=http://www.emmyonline.org/sports/applications/33rd/sports_33rd_annual_rulebook.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=December 21, 2012 | title=33rd Sports Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=March 2, 2012 }}</ref>

===News and Documentary Emmys===
{{details|News & Documentary Emmy Award}}

The News & Documentary Emmy Awards are presented by the NATAS for excellence in [[Television news in the United States|national news]] and documentary programming. The awards ceremony takes place every fall.

Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national news or documentary reporting or production to serve as judges. Most categories have two voting rounds, with separate judging panels in each round. The top entries in each category are announced as the nominations, and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.<ref name="NewsEmmyRules">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmyonline.tv/news/applications/33rdNewsEntryForms/33rd_nd_rulebook.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6D4g2XrIu?url=http://www.emmyonline.tv/news/applications/33rdNewsEntryForms/33rd_nd_rulebook.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 21, 2012 |title=33rd News & Documentary Emmys Rules and Procedures |publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref>

The [[Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards]] presented by the ATAS and the [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s presented by the NATAS are two separate competitions that honor individuals, companies, or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.org/tech/scope_and_procedures.html | title=Technology and Engineering Emmy Award: Scope and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=September 8, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728011004/http://emmyonline.org/tech/scope_and_procedures.html | archivedate=July 28, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/primetime-emmys/2013/engineering-emmys | title=Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards}}</ref> Generally, the NATAS's Technology & Engineering Emmys ceremony is held in January, while the ATAS's Primetime Engineering Emmys are presented in October.

Each academy has its own separate panel of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry to determine their respective award recipients. Among the ATAS's Engineering Emmy Award repertoire is the [[Philo T. Farnsworth Award]], given to honor companies who have significantly affected the state of television and broadcast engineering over a long period of time.

There are 20 regional chapters located across the United States that each conduct regional awards to recognize excellence in all the regional [[Media market|television markets]], including state to state programming as well as [[local news]] and [[Local programming|locally produced shows]]. Nineteen of the regional chapters are affiliated with the NATAS,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html |title=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences: Chapters |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922040419/http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy}}</ref> while the Los Angeles-based ATAS acts as the regional chapter serving the Los Angeles area.<ref name="ATAS Los Angeles">{{cite web | url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/membership/nationalacademy.php | title=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences: National Academy | quote=because our headquarters, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, are located in Los Angeles, our offices handle regional membership and awards for the Los Angeles area only | accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/contact/faq.php | title=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences: FAQ | quote=The Academy also encompasses a Los Angeles branch whose members work in Southern California | accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref>

In general, a show is considered regional if it does not reach more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that reach more than 50 percent of the country must enter into one of the national Emmy competitions instead.

The Regional Emmys are essential in helping NATAS and ATAS honor the works of deserving individuals in local TV through a regional outreach. Like the national awards, each region goes through their own rigorous nomination and voting procedures. Committees are formed to review entries for eligibility and high standards. Once accepted, each entry goes before different review committees, and their votes are cast to determine the final nominees. The final votes are then calculated by certified accounting firms within each region. Regardless of winning on a national or regional level, all recipients are Emmy Award winners.

Originally, each Regional Emmy Awards ceremony primarily focused on only honoring individuals in local news programming.<ref name="emmyHistory"/> The regionals have since been expanded to encompass all locally and state to state-produced shows that receive less than fifty percent of the country's viewing audience.

The International Emmy Awards recognizes excellence in TV programming that is produced initially outside the United States. They have been presented annually by the IATAS since 1973.<ref name="thefreelibrary.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/20+years+of+the+International+Emmy+Awards.-a013370692 |publisher=thefreelibrary.com/ |author= |work= |title=20 years of the International Emmy Awards|date= |accessdate=}}</ref> The award ceremony generally takes place in November in [[New York City]].

In general, any non-U.S. organization or individual (such as a network, a local or regional television station, producer, director, or writer) may submit a program, regardless of whether they are a member of the IATAS. For shows that are [[Co-production (media)|co-produced]] between U.S. and foreign production companies, they may be eligible if they initially aired outside of the U.S., or if their broadcast dates were within a few days of each other. A program that enters into the international competition cannot also be entered into any of the domestic ones.<ref name="InternationalEmmyFAQ">{{cite web|url=https://www.iemmys.tv/files/EntryFAQ.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions (Submissions)|publisher=International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|accessdate=5 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406110346/https://www.iemmys.tv/files/EntryFAQ.pdf|archive-date=April 6, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
