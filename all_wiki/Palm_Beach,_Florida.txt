'''Palm Beach''' is an [[incorporated town]] in [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], United States. Located on an island in east-central Palm Beach County, the town is separated from several nearby cities including [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] and [[Lake Worth Beach, Florida|Lake Worth Beach]] by the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to its west, though Palm Beach borders a small section of the latter and [[South Palm Beach, Florida|South Palm Beach]] at its southern boundaries. As of [[U.S. Census, 2010|2010 census]], Palm Beach had a year-round population of 8,348 and an estimated population of 8,816 in 2019, with an increase to around 25,000&nbsp;people between November and April.

Settlers began arriving in modern-day Palm Beach as early as 1872, and opened a post office about five years later. Elisha Newton "Cap" Dimick, later the town's first mayor, established Palm Beach's first hotel, the Cocoanut Grove House, in 1880, but [[Standard Oil]] [[Business magnate|tycoon]] [[Henry Flagler]] became instrumental in transforming the island of jungles and swamps into a winter resort for the wealthy. Flagler and his workers constructed the [[Royal Poinciana Hotel]] in 1894, [[The Breakers (hotel)|The Breakers]] in 1896, and [[Whitehall (Henry M. Flagler House)|Whitehall]] in 1902; extended the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] southward to the area by 1894; and developed a separate city to house hotel workers, which later became West Palm Beach. The town of Palm Beach officially incorporated on April 17, 1911. [[Addison Mizner]] also contributed significantly to the town's history, designing 67&nbsp;structures, including [[El Mirasol (mansion)|El Mirasol]], the [[Everglades Club]], La Querida, the [[William Gray Warden House]], and [[Via Mizner]], which is a section of [[Worth Avenue]].

''[[Forbes]]'' reported in 2017 that Palm Beach had at least 30&nbsp;billionaires, with the town ranking as the 27th-wealthiest place in the United States in 2016 according to ''[[Bloomberg News]]''. Many famous and wealthy individuals have resided in the town, including [[President of the United States|United States presidents]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Donald Trump]]. Palm Beach is also noted for upscale shopping districts, such as Worth Avenue, Royal Poinciana Plaza, and the Royal Poinciana Way Historic District.

===Name===
The January 1878 wreck of the ''Providencia'' is credited with giving Palm Beach its name. The ''Providencia'' was traveling from [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]] to [[Cádiz, Spain]], with a cargo of coconuts harvested in the [[Crown Colony of Trinidad and Tobago]] in the [[British West Indies]], when the ship wrecked near Palm Beach.

Geologically, the island is a sand-covered ridge of [[coquina rock]].<ref name="CP"/>{{rp|I-7}} Before settlement, the island was a pronounced coastal ridge bordering the Atlantic Ocean. The Intracoastal Waterway coast was primarily low-lying and swampy; marshly sloughs generally lay between the two features,<ref name="CP"/>{{rp|IX-4}} though an [[Oolite|oolitic limestone]] ridge stood along some parts of the island's westward side. Since 1883, the environment has been significantly altered by developing land, the filling of the sloughs, and a receding coastline due to erosion, but the Atlantic ridge is still the dominating topographical feature of the island and acts as a seaward barrier. The former slough areas are flood prone.<ref name="CP"/>{{rp|I-8}}

===Police===
The town has [[Palm Beach Police Department|its own police department]], established on October&nbsp;17, 1922.

In the same year, the department made 2,039&nbsp;arrests &ndash; equal to about 24,581&nbsp;arrests per 100,000&nbsp;people, the highest arrest rate in Florida and over sevenfold the state average. However, many arrests were in relation to non-violent crimes, such as those involving auto theft, criminal traffic citations, fraud, and scams. The police department reported no rapes or homicides in Palm Beach in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/20190819/palm-beach-police-dept-has-highest-arrest-rate-in-florida-but-what-does-that-actually-mean|title=Palm Beach Police Dept. has the highest arrest rate in Florida, but what does that actually mean?|date=August 19, 2019|author=Wendy Rhodes|newspaper=Palm Beach Daily News|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>

===Firefighting===
In its early days, the town of Palm Beach depended heavily on the city of West Palm Beach for firefighting efforts. The Flagler Alerts, a volunteer firefighting group which later became the West Palm Beach Fire Department, responded to fires in Palm Beach by traversing the Intracoastal Waterway via ferry or railroad. Delayed response times and high insurance rates eventually led Palm Beach to establish its own fire rescue department in December 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.townofpalmbeach.com/810/Expanded-History|title=Expanded History|publisher=Town of Palm Beach|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref> Today, the Palm Beach Fire Rescue has three stations, retains 82&nbsp;employees &ndash; 75&nbsp;full-time and 7&nbsp;part-time, and annually responds to approximately 2,600&nbsp;calls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.townofpalmbeach.com/226/About-the-Department|title=About the Department|publisher=Town of Palm Beach|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>

In the subsequent years, undergrounding projects were initially performed by neighborhood on a "as requested" basis. However, following a 2014 town council meeting with FPL workers and a related voter-approved ballot question in 2016, it was decided that a town-wide undergrounding project would be undertaken at a cost of approximately $90&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.townofpalmbeach.com/376/UndergroundUtilities|title=Underground Utilities|publisher=Town of Palm Beach|accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref> The project is ongoing as of March 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://undergrounding.info/undergrounding-program-status-update-as-of-march-30-2020/|title=Undergrounding Program - Status Update As of March 30, 2020|publisher=Town of Palm Beach|accessdate=June 1, 2020}}</ref>

The town government provides and oversees sewage systems and wastewater treatment. Sewage is collected via {{convert|41|mi|km}} of mainline pipes at the more than 40&nbsp;pumping stations, which are capable of transporting over {{convert|100000|gal}} of water each minute. The sewage is then pumped into a regional wastewater treatment facility in West Palm Beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.townofpalmbeach.com/362/Water-Resources|title=Water Resources|publisher=Town of Palm Beach|accessdate=April 26, 2020}}</ref> Tap water has been supplied by the city of West Palm Beach since 1955, when the city purchased Palm Beach's water system, then owned by the Flagler Water Company.
