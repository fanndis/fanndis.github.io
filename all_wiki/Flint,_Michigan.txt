Flint was founded as a [[Administrative divisions of Michigan#Villages|village]] by fur trader [[Jacob Smith (Michigan fur trader)|Jacob Smith]] in 1819 and became a major lumbering area on the historic [[Saginaw Trail]] during the 19th century. From the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, the city was a leading manufacturer of carriages and later [[Car|automobiles]], earning it the nickname "Vehicle City". [[General Motors]] (GM) was founded in Flint in 1908, and the city grew into an [[Flint, Michigan auto industry|automobile manufacturing powerhouse]] for GM's [[Buick]] and [[Chevrolet]] divisions, especially [[Economic history of the United States#Post-World War II prosperity: 1945–1973|after]] [[World War II]] up until the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|early 1980s recession]]. Flint was also the home of the [[Flint sit-down strike|Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1936–37 that played a vital role in the formation of the [[United Auto Workers]].

Since the late 1960s, Flint has faced several crises. The city experienced an economic downturn after GM significantly downsized its workforce in the area from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. From 1960 to 2010, the population of the city nearly halved, from 196,940 to 102,434. In the mid-2000s, Flint became known for its comparatively [[Crime in Flint, Michigan|high crime rates]] and has repeatedly been ranked among the most dangerous cities in the United States according to crime statistics.<ref>[http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/america-tonight-blog/2013/10/24/growing-up-in-americasmostdangerouscityflint.html Growing up in America's most dangerous city, Flint] ''Al Jazeera'', October 24, 2013</ref> The city was under a [[Financial emergency in Michigan|state of financial emergency]] from 2002 to 2004 and again from 2011 to 2015.<ref name=budget2013/><ref name="emergencyover">{{cite news|title=Flint's finances in better shape; no more emergency managers|url=https://news.yahoo.com/flints-finances-better-shape-no-195902208.html;_ylt=AwrC1C13sENVCBMA7zDQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--|access-date=1 May 2015|work=Associated Press|date=29 April 2015}}</ref> Since 2014, the city has faced a [[Flint water crisis|public health emergency]] due to [[lead poisoning|lead contamination]] in parts of the local water supply as well as an outbreak of [[Legionnaires' disease]].<ref name="snyderwater">[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/governor_declares_state_of_eme.html Governor declares state of emergency over lead in Flint water] ''The Flint Journal'', January 5, 2016</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Khalil|last=Al Hajal|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2016/01/legionaires_disease_spike_disc.html|title=87 cases, 10 fatal, of ''Legionella'' bacteria found in Flint area; connection to water crisis unclear|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 13, 2016|access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
The region was home to several [[Ojibwe]] tribes at the start of the 19th century, with a particularly significant community established near present-day [[Montrose, Michigan|Montrose]]. The Flint River had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of arrowheads and burial mounds near it. Some of the city currently resides atop ancient Ojibwe burial grounds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/12/ancestral_remains_recovered_fr.html|title=Ancestral remains recovered from American Indian burial ground in Flint|work=MLive.com|access-date=July 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

===19th century: lumber and the beginnings of the automobile industry===
In 1819, [[Jacob Smith (Michigan fur trader)|Jacob Smith]], a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwe and the territorial government, founded a trading post at the Grand Traverse of the Flint River. On several occasions, Smith negotiated land exchanges with the Ojibwe on behalf of the U.S. government, and he was highly regarded on both sides. Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children. As the ideal stopover on the overland route between Detroit and [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], Flint grew into a small but prosperous village and incorporated in 1855.  The 1860 U.S. census indicated that Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan's 750,000.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry.  Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry.  As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry. Buick Motor Company, after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint.  [[ACDelco|AC Spark Plug]] originated in Flint.  These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the [[Dort Motor Car Company|Dort]], [[Little (automobile)|Little]], [[Flint (automobile)|Flint]], and [[Mason Truck|Mason]] brands.  Chevrolet's first (and for many years, main) manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit.  For a brief period, all Chevrolets and Buicks were built in Flint.

===Early and mid-20th century: the auto industry takes shape===
{{Main|Flint, Michigan auto industry|History of General Motors}}
In 1904, local entrepreneur [[William C. Durant]] was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded General Motors, filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html General Motors | Corporate Information – History | GM<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610221410/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html |date=June 10, 2011 }}</ref> Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended [[Louis Chevrolet]] and founded Chevrolet, which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. He later lost decisive control again, permanently. Durant experienced financial ruin in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.

The city's mayors were targeted for recall twice, Mayor David Cuthbertson in 1924 and Mayor [[William H. McKeighan]] in 1927. Recall supporters in both cases were jailed by the police. Cuthbertson had angered the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] by the appointment of a Catholic police chief. The KKK led the recall effort and supported [[Judson L. Transue|Judson Transue]], Cutbertson's elected successor. Transue however did not remove the police chief.  McKeighan survived his recall only to face conspiracy charges in 1928.<ref>{{cite news |first=James M. |last=Miller |title=Crackdowns on 'reds,' booze didn't silence decade's roar |url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html |work=[[Flint Journal]]:  Journal of the 20th Century |publisher=Booth Newspapers |access-date=March 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527003224/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html|archive-date=May 27, 2011}}</ref> McKeighan was under investigation for a multitude of crimes which angered city leaders enough to push for changes in the city charter.<ref name=fj20c>{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Kim|title=Flint mayor commanded attention from – voters, police|url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|access-date=October 24, 2014|work=Journal of the 20th Century|publisher=The Flint Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109020208/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|archive-date=November 9, 2004}}</ref>

In 1928, the city adopted a new city charter with a council-manager form of government. Subsequently, McKeighan ran the "Green Slate" of candidates who won in 1931 and 1932 and he was select as mayor in 1931.<ref name=fj20c/> In 1935, the city residents approved a charter amendment establishing the Civil Service Commission.<ref>{{cite news|title=Proposal 5: Voters can eliminate Flint Civil Service Commission with charter vote|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/10/proposal_5_voters_can_eliminat.html|access-date=October 24, 2014|work=The Flint Journal|publisher=Mlive Media Group|date=October 17, 2014}}</ref>

For the last century, Flint's history has been dominated by both the auto industry and car culture. During the [[Flint Sit-Down Strike|Sit-Down Strike]] of 1936–1937, the fledgling [[United Auto Workers|United Automobile Workers]] triumphed over General Motors, inaugurating the era of labor unions. The successful mediation of the strike by Governor [[Frank Murphy]], culminating in a one-page agreement recognizing the Union, began an era of successful organizing by the UAW.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=115&category=business |title=Detroit News, Rearview Mirror, ''The Sitdown strike at General Motors''. |access-date=May 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709044347/http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=115&category=business |archive-date=July 9, 2012 }}</ref>  The city was a major contributor of tanks and other war machines during World War II due to its extensive manufacturing facilities.  For decades, Flint remained politically significant as a major population center as well as for its importance to the automotive industry.

A freighter named after the city, the ''[[SS City of Flint (1919)|SS City of Flint]]'' was the first US ship to be captured during the Second World War in October, 1939. The vessel was later sunk in 1943.<ref>{{cite book |title=Å være eller ikke være – Under orlogsflagget i den annen verdenskrig |last=Bjørnsson |first=Nils |year=1994 |publisher=Sjømilitære Samfund ved Forlaget Norsk Tidsskrift for Sjøvesen |location=Haakonsvern |isbn=82-990969-3-6 |page=23 |language=no }}</ref> On June 8, 1953, The [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado]], a large F5 [[tornado]], struck the city, killing 116 people.

The city's population peaked in 1960 at almost 200,000, at which time it was the second largest city in the state. The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint's prosperity and influence.  They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably including the [[Flint Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flintcultural.org/ |title=Flint Cultural Center |publisher=Flintcultural.org |access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref>  This landmark remains one of the city's chief commercial and artistic draws to this day.  The city's [[Bishop International Airport|airport]] was the busiest in Michigan for [[United Airlines]] second only to [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]], with flights to many destinations in the Mid-West and the Mid-Atlantic.<ref>United Airlines timetable, April 27. 1969, https://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/ua/ua69/</ref>

===Late 20th century: deindustrialization and demographic changes===
Since the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from [[disinvestment]], [[deindustrialization]], [[Population decline|depopulation]], [[urban decay]], as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty. Initially, this took the form of "[[white flight]]" that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities.  Given Flint's role in the automotive industry, this decline was exacerbated by the [[1973 oil crisis]] with spiking oil prices and the U.S. auto industry's subsequent loss of market share to imports, as Japanese manufacturers were producing cars with better [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]].<ref>Peter Cheney, 'Globe and Mail,' November 5, 2015, "The rise of Japan: How the car industry was won" https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/adventure/red-line/the-rise-of-japan-how-the-car-industry-was-won/article27100187/</ref>

In the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint. Many factors have been blamed, including [[outsourcing]], [[offshoring]], increased [[automation]], and moving jobs to [[Labor unions in the United States|non-union]] facilities in right to work states and foreign countries.

This decline was highlighted in the film ''[[Roger & Me]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] (the title refers to [[Roger Smith (executive)|Roger B. Smith]], the CEO of General Motors during the 1980s). Also highlighted in Moore's documentary was the failure of city officials to reverse the trends with entertainment options (e.g. the now-demolished [[AutoWorld (theme park)|AutoWorld]]) during the 1980s. Moore, a native of [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]] (a Flint suburb), revisited Flint in his later movies, including ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''
and ''[[Fahrenheit 11/9]]''

====First financial emergency: 2002–2004====
By 2002, Flint had accrued $30 million in debt.<ref name=fj2>{{cite news|last=Mostafavi|first=Beata|title=What happened last time? A look back at Flint's 2002 state takeover|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/11/what_happened_last_time_a_look.html|access-date=December 5, 2011|newspaper=The Flint Journal|date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> On March 5, 2002, the city's voters [[recall election|recalled]] Mayor [[Woodrow Stanley]]. On May 22, [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] [[John Engler]] declared a financial emergency in Flint, and on July 8 the state appointed an [[Financial emergency in Michigan|emergency financial manager]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Longley|first=Kristin|title=Flint would be only Michigan city to twice undergo emergency state takeover|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/11/flint_would_be_only_michigan_c.html|access-date=November 14, 2011|newspaper=The Flint Journal|date=November 8, 2011}}</ref> Ed Kurtz.  The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, [[Darnell Earley]], in the city administrator position.

In August 2002, city voters elected former Mayor [[James W. Rutherford|James Rutherford]] to finish the remainder of Stanley's term of office.  On September 24,  Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm.  The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency demolitions.  On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor (from $107,000 to $24,000) and the City Council members (from $23,000 to $18,000).  He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials.  After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14.  Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager.  This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees.  On November 12, Kurtz directed the city's retirement board to stop unusual pension benefits, which had decreased some retiree pensions by 3.5%.  Kurtz sought the return of overpayments to the pension fund.  However, in December, the state attorney general stated that emergency financial managers do not have authority over the retirement system.  With contract talks stalled, Kurtz stated that there either need to be cuts or layoffs to union employees.  That same month, the city's recreation centers were temporarily closed.<ref name="fj2" />

Emergency measures continued in 2003.  In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman's office.  In September, a 4% pay cut was agreed to by the city's largest union.  In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in sewer and road projects. [[Don Williamson]] was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10.  In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit.  For the 2003–2004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.<ref name="fj2" />

With pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city's contribution into the system.  On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council's and the mayor's pay, and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004–05 budget.  In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.<ref name="fj2" />

====Redevelopment====
[[File:First National Bank and Trust Company Building - Flint Michigan.jpg|thumb|Renovated First National Bank building in downtown Flint.]]
In November 2013, [[American Cast Iron Pipe Company]], a [[Birmingham, Alabama]] based company, became the first to build a production facility in Flint's former [[Buick City]] site, purchasing the property from the [[RACER Trust]].<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20131113/BUSINESS0101/311130151/Flint-Buick-City-American-Cast-Iron-Pipe-Co-General-Motors-RACER-GM Pipe maker to add 60 jobs at Flint's Buick City property] ''Detroit Free Press'', November 13, 2013</ref> Commercially, local organizations have attempted to pool their resources in the central business district and to expand and bolster higher education at four local institutions.  Examples of their efforts include the following:
*  Landmarks such as the First National Bank building have been extensively renovated, often to create lofts or office space, and filming for the [[Will Ferrell]] movie ''[[Semi-Pro]]'' resulted in renovations to the Capitol Theatre.
* [[The Paterson Building]] at Saginaw and Third street has been owned by the Collison Family, Thomas W. Collison & Co., Inc., for the last 30 years.  The building is rich in [[Art Deco]] throughout the interior and exterior.  The building also houses its own garage in the lower level, providing heated valet parking to The Paterson Building Tenants.

* In 2004, University Park, the first planned residential community in Flint in over 30 years, was built north of Fifth Avenue off Saginaw Street, Flint's main thoroughfare.

* Local foundations have funded the renovation and redecoration of Saginaw Street and have begun work turning University Avenue (formerly known as Third Avenue) into a mile-long "University Corridor" connecting [[University of Michigan–Flint]] with [[Kettering University]].
*[[Atwood Stadium]], located on University Avenue, received extensive renovations, and the Cultivating Our Community project  landscaped 16 different locations as a part of a $415,600 beautification project.
* Wade Trim and Rowe Incorporated made major renovations to transform empty downtown Flint blocks into business, entertainment, and housing centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsupdowntown.com |title=What's Up Downtown? |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202102003/http://www.whatsupdowntown.com/ |archive-date=February 2, 2015 }}</ref> [[WNEM-TV]], a television station based in [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], uses space in the Wade Trim building facing Saginaw Street as a secondary studio and newsroom.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.mlive.com/flintjournal/newsnow/2007/09/wnem_plans_studio_in_downtown.html |title=WNEM plans studio in downtown Flint  | newspaper=The Flint Journal}}</ref>

On March 20, 2012, days after a lawsuit was filed by labor union [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees|AFSCME]], and a [[restraining order]] was issued against Brown, his appointment was found to be in violation of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, and Mayor Walling and the City Council had their powers returned.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judge: State violated law in appointing Flint emergency manager; Powers of mayor, city council reinstated|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/03/emergency_manager_lawsuit.html|newspaper=The Flint Journal|date=March 20, 2012}}</ref> The state immediately filed an emergency appeal, claiming the financial emergency still existed.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/03/state_plans_emergency_appeal_a.html State plans emergency appeal after judge removes Flint emergency manager, restores mayor and city council] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, March 20, 2012</ref> On March 26, the appeal was granted, putting Brown back in power.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/03/flint_emergency_manager_reinst.html Flint emergency manager reinstated as battle over Public Act 4 continues] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, March 26, 2012</ref> Brown and several unions agreed to new contract terms in April.<ref name=emtl/> Brown unveiled his fiscal year 2013 budget on April 23.

On August 3, 2012, the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] ordered the state Board of Canvassers to certify a referendum on Public Act 4, the Emergency Manager Law, for the November ballot.  Brown made several actions on August 7 including placing a $6 million public safety millage on the ballot and sold [[Genesee Towers]] to a development group for $1 to demolish the structure.  The board certified the referendum petition on August 8, returning the previous Emergency Financial Manager Law into effect.  With Brown previously temporary mayor for the last few years, he was ineligible to be the Emergency Financial Manager. [[Ed Kurtz]] was once again appointed [[Emergency financial manager|Emergency Financial Manager]] by the Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board.<ref name=emtl/>

Flint lies in the [[Flint/Tri-Cities]] region of [[Michigan]]. Flint and [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] can be categorized as a subregion of Flint/Tri-Cities. It is located along the Flint River, which flows through [[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer]], Genesee, and [[Saginaw County, Michigan|Saginaw]] counties and is {{convert|78.3|mi|abbr=on}} long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/miwatershed.html|title=Lakes, Rivers and Wetlands|publisher=Michigan State University |access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
Flint has several neighborhoods grouped around the center of the city on the four cardinal sides. The downtown business district is centered on Saginaw Street south of the Flint River. Just west, on opposite sides of the river, are Carriage Town (north) and the Grand Traverse Street District (south). Both neighborhoods boast strong neighborhood associations. These neighborhoods were the center of manufacturing for and profits from the nation's carriage industry until the 1920s and are the site of many well-preserved [[Victorian house|Victorian homes]] and the setting of Atwood Stadium.

The University Avenue corridor of Carriage Town is home to the largest concentration of Greek housing in the area, with fraternity houses from both Kettering University, and the University of Michigan-Flint. Chapter houses include [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Theta Xi]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], and [[Delta Tau Delta]] Fraternities.

Just north of downtown is River Village, an example of gentrification via mixed-income public housing. To the east of [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] is [[Central Park, Flint|Central Park]] and Fairfield Village.  These are the only two neighborhoods between UM-Flint and [[Mott Community College]] and enjoy strong neighborhood associations. Central Park piloted a project to convert street lights to LED and is defined by seven cul-de-sacs.

[[File:Flint hallsflats.JPG|thumb|250px|Hall's Flats on the West Side is one of Flint's many neighborhoods.]]
The North Side and 5th Ward are predominantly African American, with such historic districts as Buick City and Civic Park on the north, and Sugar Hill, Floral Park, and Kent and Elm Parks on the south. Many of these neighborhoods were the original centers of early Michigan [[blues]]. The South Side in particular was also a center for multi-racial migration from Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the [[Deep South]] since World War II. These neighborhoods are most often lower income but have maintained some level of economic stratification. The East Side is the site of the Applewood Mott Estate, and Mott Community College, the [[Flint Cultural Center|Cultural Center]], and [[East Village, Flint|East Village]], one of Flint's more prosperous areas. The surrounding neighborhood is called the College/Cultural Neighborhood, with a strong neighborhood association, lower crime rate and stable housing prices.

Just north is Eastside Proper, also known as the State Streets, and has much of Flint's Hispanic community.<ref name=WarikooFlintimm>Warikoo, Niraj.

The West Side includes the main site of the 1936–37 sit-down strike, the Mott Park neighborhood, Kettering University, and the historic Woodcroft Estates, owned in the past by legendary automotive executives and current home to prominent and historic Flint families such as the Motts, the Manleys, and the Smiths.

Facilities associated with General Motors in the past and present are scattered throughout the city, including GM Truck and Bus, Flint Metal Center and Powertrain South (clustered together on the city's southwestern corner); Powertrain North, Flint Tool and Die and Delphi East. The largest plant, Buick City, and adjacent facilities have been demolished.

===Radio===
The Flint radio market has a rich history. WAMM-AM 1420 (started in 1955, now gospel station WFLT) on the city's eastside was one of the first stations in the country to program to the black community and was also where legendary DJ [[Casey Kasem]] had his first radio job.<ref>{{cite web|author=WFLT AM 1420 Flint |url=http://www.michiguide.com/dials/rad-d/wflt.html |title=WFLT AM 1420 Flint |publisher=Michiguide.com |access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> WTAC-AM 600 (now religious station WSNL) was a highly rated and influential [[Top Forty|Top 40]] station in the 1960s and 1970s, showcasing Michigan artists and being the first in the U.S. to play acts like [[The Who]] and [[AC/DC]]. WTAC changed its format to country music in 1980 and then became a pioneering [[contemporary Christian]] music station a few years later; the calls are now on 89.7 FM, a member of the "[[Smile FM]]" network.  WTRX-AM 1330 also played Top 40 music for a time in the 1960s and '70s. The city's first radio station, AM 910 [[WFDF (AM)|WFDF]], first went on the air in 1922. It has since relocated south into the Detroit market, changing its city of license to [[Farmington Hills]] and increasing its power to 50,000 watts.
