'''''Vogue''''' is an [[United States|American]] monthly [[Fashion journalism|fashion]] and [[lifestyle magazine]] covering many topics, including fashion, beauty, culture, living, and [[Fashion show#Runway|runway]], based in New York City. It began as a weekly newspaper, first published in New York City in 1892, before becoming a monthly publication years later. 

The [[British Vogue|British ''Vogue'']], launched in 1916, was the first international edition, while the Italian version ''[[Vogue Italia]]'' has been called the top fashion magazine in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last=Press |first=Debbie |title=Your Modeling Career: You Don't Have to Be a Superstar to Succeed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkeaOOxb_isC&pg=PA16 |year=2004 |publisher=Allworth Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58115-359-0}}</ref> As of today, there are 26 international editions.

[[File:VogueHeader1892to1906.png|upright|thumb|right|Header used for issues between 1892 and 1906]]
[[Arthur Baldwin Turnure]], an American businessman, founded ''Vogue'' as a weekly newspaper based in New York City, sponsored by Kristoffer Wright, with its first issue on December 17, 1892.<ref>Rowlands, Penelope (2008) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aD_q00HcIBkC&pg=PT78&dq=1892+Arthur+Carmel+Snow&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwikwOj8q6vsAhVMZMAKHZu7A1sQ6AEwAXoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=1892%20Arthur%20Carmel%20Snow&f=false ''A Dash of Daring: Carmel Snow and Her Life In Fashion, Art, and Letters''] [[Simon & Schuster]], 2008.</ref><ref>Warren, Lynne (2005) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=31VsBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA308&dq=1892+Vogue&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJiJXWmKvsAhUzQkEAHa09CQgQ6AEwAXoECAkQAg#v=onepage&q=1892%20Vogue&f=false ''Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography, 3-Volume Set''] [[Routledge]], 2005</ref> The first issue was published with a cover price of 10 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.10|1892|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).<ref name="Esfahani Smith">{{cite web |url=http://acculturated.com/2012/06/26/the-early-years-of-vogue-magazine/ |title=The Early Years of Vogue Magazine |last=Esfahani Smith |first=Emily |date=June 26, 2013 |website=acculterated.com |accessdate=October 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007130257/http://acculturated.com/2012/06/26/the-early-years-of-vogue-magazine/ |archive-date=October 7, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Turnure's intention was to create a publication, that celebrated the "ceremonial side of life"; one that "attracts the sage as well as [[debutante]], men of affairs, as well as the belle".<ref name="Esfahani Smith"/> From its inception the magazine targeted the new New York [[upper class]], "recounting their habits, their leisure activities, their social gatherings, the places they frequented, and the clothing they wore...and everyone who wanted to look like them and enter their exclusive circle".<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=2&docId=GALE%7CA163247690&docType=Book+review&sort=Relevance&contentSegment=&prodId=AONE&contentSet=GALE%7CA163247690&searchId=R1&userGroupName=pont19987&inPS=true# |title=In ''Vogue'': The Illustrated History of the World's Most Famous Fashion Magazine |last=Ludwin |first=Nancy Flinn |date=Jan–Feb 2007 |publisher=Gale Resources |url-access=registration}}</ref> The magazine at this time was primarily concerned with fashion, with coverage of sports and social affairs included for its male readership.<ref name="Esfahani Smith"/> Growth was slow during this initial period.

===1905–1920: Condé Nast===
[[Condé Montrose Nast]] purchased ''Vogue'' in 1909 one year before Turnure's death and gradually grew the publication. He changed it to a women's magazine, and started ''Vogue'' editions overseas in the 1910s. Its price was also raised. The magazine's number of publications and profit increased dramatically under Nast's management. It continued to target an upscale audience and expanded into the coverage of weddings. According to Condé Nast Russia, when the First World War made deliveries in the Old World impossible, printing began in England.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The decision to print in England proved successful, causing Nast to release the first issue of French ''Vogue'' in 1920.

===1920–1970: Expansion===
[[File:VogueMagazine1Oct1924.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Issue of 1 October 1924]]
The magazine's number of subscriptions surged during the [[Great Depression]], and again during [[World War II]]. During this time, noted critic and former ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' editor [[Frank Crowninshield]] served as its editor, having been moved over from ''Vanity Fair'' by publisher [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]].<ref name="crown in shield">{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/vintage/earlyyears |last=Fine Collins |first=Amy |title=Vanity Fair: The Early Years, 1914–1936 |publisher=Vanity Fair |accessdate=July 18, 2007}}</ref>

In July 1932, American ''Vogue'' placed its first color photograph on the cover of the magazine. The photograph was taken by photographer [[Edward Jean Steichen]] and portrayed a woman swimmer holding a beach ball in the air.<ref name=":3">{{cite news |url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/vogue-magazine-list-10-most-groundbreaking-covers-in-the-history-of-vogue/?_r=0 |title=The 10 Most Groundbreaking Covers in the History of Vogue |last=Oloizia |first=Jeff |work=T Magazine |access-date=March 29, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Laird Borrelli notes that ''Vogue'' led the decline of [[fashion illustration]] in the late 1930s, when it began to replace its illustrated covers, by artists such as [[Dagmar Freuchen]], with [[Fashion photography|photographic images]].<ref name="Borrelli">{{cite book |title=Fashion Illustration Now |author=Laird Borrelli |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[Thames & Hudson]] |year=2000 |isbn=9780500282342 |quote=Fashion Illustration has gone from being one of the sole means of fashion communication to having a very minor role. The first photographic cover of Vogue was a watershed in the history of fashion illustration and a watershed mark of its decline. Photographs, no matter how altered or retouched, will always have some association with reality and by association truth. I like to think of them [fashion Illustrations] as prose poems and having more fictional narratives. They are more obviously filtered through an individual vision than photos. Illustration lives on, but in the position of a poor relative to the fashion.}}</ref>

Nast was responsible for introducing color printing and the "two-page spread".<ref name=":0" /> He has been credited with turning ''Vogue'' into a "successful business" and the "women's magazine we recognize today", having substantially increased sales volumes until his death in 1942.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://acculturated.com/the-early-years-of-vogue-magazine/ |title=The Early Years of Vogue Magazine – Acculturated |date=June 26, 2012 |work=Acculturated |access-date=March 29, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the 1950s, the decade known as the magazine's "powerful years",<ref name=":6">{{cite news |last=Whitman |first=Alden |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/24/archives/jessica-daves-of-vogue-is-dead-favored-readytowear-trend-went.html |title=Jessica Daves of Vogue is Dead |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 24, 1974 |access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref> [[Jessica Daves]] became editor-in-chief. As [[Rebecca C. Tuite]] has noted, "Daves led a quiet charge for excellence during one of the most challenging, transformative, and rich decades in the magazine's history."<ref name=":7">{{cite book |title=1950s In Vogue: The Jessica Daves Years, 1952-1962 |author-link=Rebecca Tuite |last=Tuite |first=Rebecca C. |publisher=Thames & Hudson |year=2019 |isbn=978-0500294376 |location=London |pages=238, see note 16}}</ref> Daves believed that "taste is something that can be taught and learned",<ref>{{cite news |title=Editor Practices Style Magazine's Message |last=Hicks |first=Cordell |date=April 12, 1960 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=2: 4}}</ref> and she edited ''Vogue'' with the conviction that it should be "a vehicle to educate public taste".<ref name=":6" /> While fashion coverage remained a priority, Daves also elevated the written content of American ''Vogue'', particularly championing more robust arts and literature features.<ref name=":7" />

The Daves era of ''Vogue'' came to an end in 1962, when [[Diana Vreeland]] joined the magazine (first as associate editor, and then, following Daves's departure in December 1962, as editor-in-chief).<ref name=":7" /> The pair had diametrically opposed approaches to editing ''Vogue'': Daves famously declared, "I respect fashion ... it is exciting ... but I am annoyed at people who treat it as a joke, who constantly take sledge-hammers to it ... it's a very serious business."<ref name=":7" /> On the other hand, Vreeland believed, as she once told art director Alexander Liberman, "it's only entertainment",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/1993/11/diana-vreeland-199311|title=The Cult of Diana |last=Collins |first=Amy Fine |date=November 1993 |website=Vanity Fair |access-date=December 2, 2019}}</ref> and conversely led the magazine into a period of youth and vitality, but also "extravagance, and luxury and excess".<ref>{{cite book |title=Alex: The Life of Alexander Liberman |last=Dodie Kazanjian and Calvin Tomkins |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=1993 |location=New York |pages=281}}</ref>

In the 1960s, with Diana Vreeland as editor-in-chief and personality, the magazine began to appeal to the youth of the [[sexual revolution]] by focusing more on contemporary fashion and editorial features that openly discussed sexuality. Toward this end, Vogue extended coverage to include [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] boutiques such as [[Limbo (boutique)|Limbo]] on [[St. Mark's Place]], as well as including features of "downtown" personalities such as [[Andy Warhol]]'s "Superstar" [[Baby Jane Holzer|Jane Holzer]]'s favorite haunts.<ref>''Vogue'' (February 15, 1968)</ref> ''Vogue'' also continued making household names out of models, a practice that continued with [[Suzy Parker]], [[Twiggy]], [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Lauren Hutton]], [[Veruschka]], [[Marisa Berenson]], [[Penelope Tree]], and others.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dwight |first=Eleanor |title=The Divine Mrs. V |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/shopping/fashion/features/n_7930/index1.html |accessdate=November 18, 2007}}</ref>

In 1973, ''Vogue'' became a monthly publication.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecollections.scad.edu/iii/cpro/DigitalItemViewPage.external;jsessionid=4CAA1806EA85BBBAD19144D331B817CA?lang=eng&sp=1001279&sp=T&sp=1&suite=def|title=Advertisement – Vogue Magazinec|website=ecollections.scad.edu |publisher=Scad Libraries |accessdate=October 7, 2013}}</ref> Under editor-in-chief [[Grace Mirabella]], the magazine underwent extensive editorial and stylistic changes to respond to changes in the lifestyles of its target audience.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mirabella |first=Grace |author-link=Grace Mirabella |title=In and Out of Vogue |publisher=Doubleday |year=1995}}</ref> Mirabella states that she was chosen to change Vogue because "women weren't interested in reading about or buying clothes that served no purpose in their changing lives."<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&sw=w&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA17349577&asid=5066a358fca5863704a313a041fed540 |title=Grace Under Pressure |date=1995 |website=Gale Resources }}</ref> She was selected to make the magazine appeal to "the free, working, "liberated" woman of the seventies.<ref name=":1"/> She changed the magazine by adding text with interviews, arts coverage, and serious health pieces. When that type of stylistic change fell out of favor in the 1980s, Mirabella was fired.<ref name=":1"/>

===1988–present: Anna Wintour leadership===
In July 1988, after ''Vogue'' had begun to lose ground to three-year-old upstart ''Elle'', [[Anna Wintour]] was named editor-in-chief.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web |title=Vogue – Editor-in-chief Bio |url=http://www.condenast.com/brands/vogue/editor |publisher=Condé Nast |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |date=May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514045630/http://www.condenast.com/brands/vogue/editor |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/anna-wintour-214147 |title=Anna Wintour |website=Biography |language=en-us |access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref> Noted for her trademark [[bob cut]] and sunglasses, Wintour sought to revitalize the brand by making it younger and more approachable;<ref name="Coddington 2012">{{cite book |last=Coddington |first=Grace |author-link=Grace Coddington |title=Grace: A Memoir |year=2012 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0449808061}}</ref> she directed the focus towards new and accessible concepts of "fashion" for a wider audience.<ref name="timestyle">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/2004/style/020904/power/3.html |last=Orecklin |first=Michelle |title=The Power List: Women in Fashion, No 3 Anna Wintour |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 9, 2004 |access-date=January 29, 2007}}</ref> Wintour's influence allowed the magazine to maintain its high circulation, while staff discovered new trends that a broader audience could conceivably afford.<ref name="timestyle" /> For example, the inaugural cover of the magazine under Wintour's editorship featured a three-quarter-length photograph of [[Michaela Bercu]], an Israeli model, wearing a bejeweled [[Christian Lacroix]] jacket and a pair of jeans, a departure from her predecessors' tendency to portray a woman's face alone; according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', this gave "greater importance to both her clothing and her body".<ref name="weber" /> As fashion editor [[Grace Coddington]] wrote in her memoirs, the cover "endorsed a democratic new high/low attitude to dressing, added some youthful but sophisticated raciness, and garnished it with a dash of confident energy and drive that implied getting somewhere fast. It was quintessential Anna."<ref name="Coddington 2012"/> Throughout her reign at ''Vogue'', Wintour accomplished her goals to revitalize the magazine and oversaw production of some of its largest editions. The September 2004 edition measured 832 pages, the highest ever for a monthly magazine.<ref name=":2" /> Wintour continues to be American ''Vogue''{{'}}s editor-in-chief to this day.

The contrast of Wintour's vision with that of her predecessors was noted as striking by observers, both critics and defenders. Amanda Fortini, fashion and style contributor for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', argues that her policy has been beneficial for ''Vogue'', delivering it from what some critics had termed its boring "beige years."<ref name="slate">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2113278 |last=Fortini |first=Amanda |title=Defending Vogue's Evil Genius: The Brilliance of Anna Wintour |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}</ref>
{{quote| Among Condé Nast executives, there was worry that the grand dame of fashion publications was losing ground to ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', which in just three years had reached a paid circulation of 851,000, compared to ''Vogue''{{'}}s 1.2 million. Thus, [[Condé Nast]] publisher [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|Si Newhouse]] brought in the 38-year-old Wintour, who through editor-in-chief positions at [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']] and ''[[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]]'', had become known not only for her cutting-edge visual sense, but also for her ability to radically revamp a magazine—to shake things up.}} Although she has had a strong impact on the magazine, throughout her career, Wintour has been pinned as being cold and difficult to work with. In an article on Biography.com, Wintour admittes that she is "very driven by what [she does]", and has said "I am certainly very competitive. I like people who represent the best at what they do, and if that turns you into a perfectionist then maybe I am."<ref name=":2" />

===Healthy body initiative===
May 2013 marked the first anniversary of a healthy body initiative that was signed by the magazine's international editors—the initiative represents a commitment from the editors to promote positive [[body image]]s within the content of ''Vogue''<nowiki/>'s numerous editions. ''Vogue Australia'' editor Edwina McCann explained:

<blockquote>In the magazine we're moving away from those very young, very thin girls. A year down the track, we ask ourselves what can ''Vogue'' do about it? And an issue like this [June 2013 issue] is what we can do about it. If I was aware of a girl being ill on a photo shoot I wouldn't allow that shoot to go ahead, or if a girl had an eating disorder I would not shoot her.<ref name="Nash">{{cite news |last=Traill-Nash |first=Glynis |title=Vogue eager to make an issue of 'real' women |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/fashion/vogue-eager-to-make-an-issue-of-real-women/story-e6frg8k6-1226644826840 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |newspaper=The Australian |date=17 May 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

The Australian edition's June 2013 issue was entitled ''Vogue Australia'': "The Body Issue" and featured articles on exercise and nutrition, as well as a diverse range of models. New York-based Australian [[plus-size model]] [[Robyn Lawley]], previously featured on the cover of ''[[Vogue Italia]]'', also appeared in a swimwear shoot for the June issue.<ref name="Nash" />

Jonathan Newhouse, Condé Nast International chairman, states that "''Vogue'' editors around the world want the magazines to reflect their commitment to the health of the models who appear on the pages and the wellbeing of their readers."<ref name=":4">{{cite news |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/the-health-initiative-vogue-model-health-wellbeing |title=The Health Initiative |last=Milligan |first=Lauren |work=British Vogue |access-date=April 3, 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref> Alexandra Shulman, one of the magazine's editor, comments on the initiative by stating "as one of the fashion industry's most powerful voices, ''Vogue'' has a unique opportunity to engage with relevant issues where we feel we can make a difference."<ref name=":4" />

The word ''vogue'' means "style" in French.

===Technological===
Google partnered with ''Vogue'' to feature [[Google Glass]] in the September 2013 issue, which featured a 12-page spread.<ref name="Google Glasses">{{citation |last=Bilton |first=Nick |title=Trying to Make Google Glass Fashionable |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/google-tries-to-make-google-glass-look-fashionable/ |work=The New York Times |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref> Chris Dale, who manages communications for the Glass team at Google, stated:

===Economic===
Wintour's "Fashion Night" initiative was launched in 2009 with the intention of kickstarting the economy following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], by drawing people back into the retail environment and donating proceeds to various charitable causes. The event was co-hosted by ''Vogue'' in 27 cities around the US and 15 countries worldwide, and included online retailers at the beginning of 2011.<ref>{{cite news |last=Garton |first=Christie |title=Fashion's Night Out mobilized fashionistas worldwide for good. |url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/mind-soul/doing-good/kindness/post/2010/09/Fashions-Night-Out-mobilized-fashionistas-worldwide-for-good-/111861/1 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref> Debate occurred over the actual profitability of the event in the US, resulting in a potentially permanent hiatus in 2013; however, the event continues in 19 other locations internationally.<ref>{{citation |last=Krupnick |first=Ellie |title=Fashion's Night Out 2013 On 'Hiatus' In New York City |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/fashions-night-out-2013-new-york_n_2772795.html |publisher=Huffington Post |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=October 10, 2020}}</ref> ''Vogue'' also has the ability to lift the spirits of readers during tough times and revels that "even in bad times, someone is up for a good time."

===Political===
In 2006, ''Vogue'' acknowledged salient political and cultural issues by featuring the [[burqa]], as well as articles on prominent [[Muslim]] women, their approach to fashion, and the effect of different cultures on fashion and women's lives.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McLarney |first=Ellen |title=The burqa in ''Vogue'': fashioning Afghanistan |journal=[[Journal of Middle East Women's Studies]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.2979/mew.2009.5.1.1 |jstor=10.2979/mew.2009.5.1.1 |date=Winter 2009 |s2cid=149439213 }}</ref> ''Vogue'' also sponsored the "Beauty Without Borders" initiative with a US$25,000 donation that was used to establish a [[cosmetology school]] for Afghan women. Wintour stated: "Through the school, we could not only help women in Afghanistan to look and feel better but also give them employment." A documentary by Liz Mermin, entitled ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul'', which highlighted the proliferation of Western standards of beauty, criticized the school, suggesting that "the beauty school could not be judged a success if it did not create a demand for American cosmetics."<ref>{{cite news |last=Bose |first=Purnima |title=A Cosmetic Cover for Occupation |url=http://www.solidarity-us.org/site/node/2368 |work=Solidarity |date=September–October 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref>

Leading up to the [[2012 Presidential election (United States)|2012 US Presidential election]], Wintour used her industry clout to host several significant fundraising events in support of the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama campaign]].

In October 2016, the magazine stated that "''Vogue'' endorses [[Hillary Clinton]] for [[president of the United States]]". This was the first time that the magazine supported as a single voice a presidential candidate in its 120 years of history.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vogue.com/13492873/hillary-clinton-endorsement-president-united-states-democrat/ |title=''Vogue'' Endorses Hillary Clinton for President of the United States |work=Vogue |language=en-US |access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Ikon London Magazine |url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/has-anna-wintour-crossed-the-line/ |title=Has Anna Wintour Crossed the Line |date=November 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://wwd.com/business-news/media/did-vogue-hillary-clinton-advocacy-endorsement-go-too-far-10702125/ |title=Did Anna Wintour And Vogue's Hillary Clinton Advocacy Gone Too Far? |publisher=WWD |date=November 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}</ref>

In 2015, ''Vogue'' listed their "15 Roots Reggae Songs You Should Know"; and in an interview with Patricia Chin of [[VP Records]], ''Vogue'' highlighted an abbreviated list of early "reggae royalty" that recorded at Studio 17 in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] which included [[Bob Marley]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Gregory Isaacs]], [[Dennis Brown]], [[Burning Spear]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[The Heptones]], and [[Bunny Wailer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/15-roots-reggae-songs-playlist |title=15 Roots Reggae Songs You Should Know |last=Nast |first=Condé |website=Vogue |access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/golden-age-of-reggae-photographs-patricia-chin |title=The Golden Age of Reggae: An Archival Romp With Roots Pioneer Patricia Chin |last=Nast |first=Condé |website=Vogue |access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In addition to their coverage of historically significant artists, ''Vogue'' is a source for contemporary music news on artists such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Eminem]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Taylor Swift]], as well as being an influencer that introduces new artists to the scene such as [[Suzi Analogue]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/suzi-analogue-chromat-nyfw-spring-2018-collection-soundtrack |title=Meet the Producer Behind Chromat's Bass-Heavy, Femme-Empowering Soundscape |last=Nast |first=Condé |website=Vogue |access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>

As Wintour came to personify the magazine's image, both she and ''Vogue'' drew critics. Wintour's one-time assistant at the magazine, [[Lauren Weisberger]], wrote a ''[[roman à clef]]'' entitled ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''. Published in 2003, the novel became a bestseller and was adapted as a highly successful, [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|film]] in 2006.<ref>{{citation |title=The Devil Wears Prada |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458352/awards |date=June 30, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |first=David |last=Frankel}}</ref> The central character resembled Weisberger, and her boss was a powerful editor-in-chief of a fictionalized version of ''Vogue''. The novel portrays a magazine ruled by "the Antichrist and her coterie of fashionistas, who exist on cigarettes, [[Diet Dr Pepper]], and mixed green salads", according to a review in ''The New York Times''. The editor is described by Weisberger as being "an empty, shallow, bitter woman who has tons and tons of gorgeous clothes and not much else".<ref name="dwpnrevnyt">{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507EED61F39F930A25757C0A9659C8B63&sec=&pagewanted=all |last=Betts |first=Kate |title=Anna Dearest |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 2003 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}</ref> The success of both the novel and the film brought new attention from a wide global audience to the power and glamour of the magazine, and the industry it continues to lead.<ref name="newatt">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/fashion/28ROW.html |last=Wilson |first=Eric |title=The Devil Likes Attention |work=The New York Times |date=December 28, 2006 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}</ref>

In 2007, ''Vogue'' drew criticism from the anti-smoking group "Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids", for carrying [[tobacco advertisement]]s in the magazine. The group claims that volunteers sent the magazine more than 8,000 protest emails or faxes regarding the ads. The group also claimed that in response, they received scribbled notes faxed back on letters that had been addressed to Wintour stating, "Will you stop? You're killing trees!"<ref name="AP">{{cite news |last=Noveck |first=Jocelyn |title=Fashion Mags Anger Some With Tobacco Ads |work=San Francisco Chronicle |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 30, 2007 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/05/30/national/a133947D71.DTL |accessdate=November 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531211635/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F05%2F30%2Fnational%2Fa133947D71.DTL |archive-date=May 31, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In response, a spokesperson for Condé Nast released an official statement: "''Vogue'' does carry tobacco advertising.

In April 2008, American ''Vogue'' featured a cover photo by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] of Gisele Bündchen and the basketball player LeBron James. This was the third time that Vogue featured a male on the cover of the American issue (the other two men were actors George Clooney and Richard Gere), and the first in which the man was black. Some observers criticized the cover as a prejudicial depiction of James because his pose with Bündchen was reminiscent of a poster for the film ''[[King Kong]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-03-24-vogue-controversy_N.htm?csp=3 |title=LeBron James' 'Vogue' cover called racially insensitive |last=Scott |first=Megan K. |work=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=March 24, 2008 |accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref> Further criticism arose when the website ''Watching the Watchers'' analyzed the photo alongside the [[Committee on Public Information|World War I recruitment poster]] titled ''Destroy This Mad Brute''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://watchingthewatchers.org/news/1378/annie-leibovitz-monkeys-around-lebron |first=Rogers |last=Cadenhead |title=Annie Leibovitz Monkeys Around with LeBron James |date=March 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2009}}</ref> James reportedly however liked the cover shoot.<ref>{{cite web |title=LeBron James' Vogue cover draws criticism |url=https://www.cleveland.com/sports/2008/03/lebron_james_vogue_cover_draws.html |last1=Campbell |first1=David |last2=clevel |date=2008-03-23 |website=cleveland |access-date=2020-05-30 |last3=.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Vogue cover with LeBron stirs up controversy |url=http://www.today.com/news/vogue-cover-lebron-stirs-controversy-wbna23797883 |website=TODAY.com |access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref>

In February 2011, just before the [[Syrian civil war|2011 Syrian protests]] unfolded, ''Vogue'' published a controversial piece by [[Joan Juliet Buck]] about [[Asma al-Assad]], wife of the Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/asma-al-assad-a-rose-in-the-desert/ |title= Asma al-Assad: A Rose in the Desert |last=Buck |first=Joan Juliet |author-link=Joan Juliet Buck |publisher=Vogue |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> A number of journalists criticized the article as glossing over the poor [[Human rights in Syria|human rights record of Bashar al-Assad]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2289021/ |title=The Middle East's Marie Antoinettes |last=Malone |first=Noreen |publisher=Slate |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/middleeast/18iht-letter18.html |title=The Balance of Charm and Reality |last=Freeland |first=Chrystia |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |date=March 17, 2011}}</ref> According to reports, the [[Syrian government]] paid the U.S. lobbying firm [[Brown Lloyd James]] US$5,000 per month to arrange for and manage the article.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/the-only-remaining-online-copy-of-vogues-asma-al-assad-profile/250753/ |title=The Only Remaining Online Copy of Vogue's Asma al-Assad Profile |last=Fisher |first=Max |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=January 5, 2012 |date=January 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/175149-pr-firm-worked-with-syria-on-controversial-photo-shoot |title=PR firm worked with Syria on controversial photo shoot |last=Bogardus |first=Kevin |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=January 5, 2012 |date=August 3, 2011}}</ref>
