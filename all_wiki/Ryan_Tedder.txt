He produced demos for songwriters and labels, charging $300 to $400 a track.<ref name="biog"/> Tedder claims that DreamWorks offered him his first publishing deal shortly after his arrival; however, he was intent on pursuing a career as an artist, and his first venture in that arena came via a different route altogether.

Tedder's performance of one of his songs, "The Look", received the most votes from the judges and fans, and he won the competition; however, a contract with a recording label was not finalized and no album was released.<ref name="lance" /> Tedder later revealed that the record and publishing deal he was offered "wasn't real. It was just a bunch of hype that didn't turn into anything."<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7079683.stm|title=Talking Shop: Ryan Tedder|work=[[BBC News]]|date=November 6, 2007|access-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref>
