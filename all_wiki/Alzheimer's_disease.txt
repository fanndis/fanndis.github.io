<!-- Definition and symptoms -->

===Pre-dementia===

Subtle problems with the [[executive functions]] of [[attention|attentiveness]], [[planning]], flexibility, and [[abstraction|abstract thinking]], or impairments in [[semantic memory]] (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD.<ref name="pmid15324363"/> [[Apathy]] and depression can be seen at this stage, with apathy remaining as the most persistent symptom throughout the course of the disease.<ref name="Deardorff">{{cite journal |vauthors=Deardorff WJ, Grossberg GT |title=Behavioral and psychological symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia |journal=Handbook of Clinical Neurology |volume=165 |pages=5–32 |date=2019 |pmid=31727229 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-64012-3.00002-2|isbn=9780444640123 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4377-0434-1|vauthors=Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH |edition=6th|veditors=Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J |chapter=Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice}}</ref>
The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI).<ref name="pmid12603249"/> This is often found to be a transitional stage between normal ageing and [[dementia]]. MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, and when memory loss is the predominant symptom, it is termed "amnestic MCI" and is frequently seen as a [[prodromal]] stage of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="Grundman">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grundman M, Petersen RC, Ferris SH, et al | title = Mild cognitive impairment can be distinguished from Alzheimer disease and normal aging for clinical trials | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14732621 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.61.1.59 }}</ref>

===Early===
In people with AD, the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, [[perception]] ([[agnosia]]), or execution of movements ([[apraxia]]) are more prominent than memory problems.<ref name="pmid10653284">{{cite journal | vauthors = Förstl H, Kurz A | title = Clinical features of Alzheimer's disease | journal = European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 249 | issue = 6 | pages = 288–90 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10653284 | doi = 10.1007/s004060050101 | s2cid = 26142779 }}</ref> AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. [[long-term memory|Older memories]] of the person's life ([[episodic memory]]), facts learned ([[semantic memory]]), and [[implicit memory]] (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.<ref name="pmid1300219">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlesimo GA, Oscar-Berman M | title = Memory deficits in Alzheimer's patients: a comprehensive review | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–69 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1300219 | doi = 10.1007/BF01108841 | s2cid = 19548915 }}</ref><ref name="pmid8821346">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jelicic M, Bonebakker AE, Bonke B | title = Implicit memory performance of patients with Alzheimer's disease: a brief review | journal = International Psychogeriatrics | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–92 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8821346 | doi = 10.1017/S1041610295002134 }}</ref>

[[primary progressive aphasia|Language problems]] are mainly characterised by a shrinking [[vocabulary]] and decreased word [[fluency]], leading to a general impoverishment of oral and [[written language]].<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid1856925">{{cite journal | vauthors = Taler V, Phillips NA | title = Language performance in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a comparative review | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 501–56 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18569251 | doi = 10.1080/13803390701550128 | s2cid = 37153159 }}</ref> In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid1856925"/><ref name="pmid7967534">{{cite journal | vauthors = Frank EM | title = Effect of Alzheimer's disease on communication function | journal = Journal of the South Carolina Medical Association | volume = 90 | issue = 9 | pages = 417–23 | date = September 1994 | pmid = 7967534 }}</ref>  While performing [[fine motor skill|fine motor tasks]] such as writing, drawing, or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties (apraxia) may be present, but they are commonly unnoticed.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

===Moderate===
Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to [[Anomic aphasia|recall vocabulary]], which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ([[paraphasia]]s). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7967534"/> Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Long-term memory]], which was previously intact, becomes impaired.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

Behavioural and [[neuropsychiatric]] changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are [[Wandering (dementia)|wandering]], [[irritability]] and [[labile affect]], leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated [[aggression]], or resistance to caregiving.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Sundowning]] can also appear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volicer L, Harper DG, Manning BC, Goldstein R, Satlin A | s2cid = 10492607 | title = Sundowning and circadian rhythms in Alzheimer's disease | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 158 | issue = 5 | pages = 704–11 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11329390 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.704 }}</ref> Approximately 30% of people with AD develop [[Delusional misidentification syndrome|illusionary misidentifications]] and other [[delusion]]al symptoms.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations ([[anosognosia]]).<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Urinary incontinence]] can develop.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> These symptoms create [[stress (biology)|stress]] for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from [[home care]] to other [[Nursing home|long-term care facilities]].<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7806732">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gold DP, Reis MF, Markiewicz D, Andres D | title = When home caregiving ends: a longitudinal study of outcomes for caregivers of relatives with dementia | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–6 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7806732 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-5415.1995.tb06235.x | s2cid = 29847950 }}</ref>

===Advanced===
During the final stages, the patient is completely dependent upon caregivers.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7967534"/> Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme [[apathy]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks independently; [[musculature|muscle mass]] and mobility deteriorates to the point where they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of [[pressure ulcer]]s or [[pneumonia]], not the disease itself.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><!-- cites previous 4 sentences -->

==Causes==

Alzheimer's disease is believed to occur when abnormal amounts of proteins, [[amyloid]]s and possibly [[tau protein]]s, form in the brain and begin to encroach upon the organ's cells. The resultant [[Senile plaque|plaque]] disrupts normal function and chemistry, and leads to a significant deficit of [[neurotransmitter]]s, resulting in a progressive loss of brain function.<ref>[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/causes/ ‘ Alzheimer's disease - Causes‘] (NHS)</ref> As for ''why'' these protein ‘malfunctions’ occur in the first place, the ultimate cause is poorly understood, and subject to ongoing research and speculation.

The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still mostly unknown except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alz.org/research/science/alzheimers_disease_causes.asp|title=What We Know Today About Alzheimer's Disease|publisher=Alzheimer's Association|access-date=1 October 2011|quote=While scientists know Alzheimer's disease involves progressive brain cell failure, the reason cells fail isn't clear.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007055341/http://alz.org/research/science/alzheimers_disease_causes.asp|archive-date=7 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reitz C, Mayeux R | title = Alzheimer disease: epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, risk factors and biomarkers | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 88 | issue = 4 | pages = 640–51 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24398425 | pmc = 3992261 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2013.12.024 }}</ref> Several competing [[hypotheses]] exist trying to explain the cause of the disease.

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]]. Every neuron has a [[cytoskeleton]], an internal support structure partly made up of structures called [[microtubules]]. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the [[axon]] and back. A protein called ''tau'' stabilises the microtubules when [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], and is therefore called a [[microtubule-associated protein]]. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming [[Hyperphosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]]; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.<ref name="pmid17604998">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hernández F, Avila J | title = Tauopathies | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 64 | issue = 17 | pages = 2219–33 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17604998 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-007-7220-x }}</ref> Pathogenic tau can also cause neuronal death through [[transposable element]] dysregulation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun W, Samimi H, Gamez M, Zare H, Frost B | title = Pathogenic tau-induced piRNA depletion promotes neuronal death through transposable element dysregulation in neurodegenerative tauopathies | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 1038–48 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30038280 | pmc = 6095477 | doi = 10.1038/s41593-018-0194-1 }}</ref>

[[File:InterlockingPentagons.svg|right|thumb|Neuropsychological [[screening test]]s can help in the diagnosis of AD. In the tests, people are instructed to copy drawings similar to the one shown in the picture, remember words, read, and subtract serial numbers.]]

Further neurological examinations are crucial in the [[differential diagnosis]] of AD and other diseases.<ref name="pmid17222085"/> Interviews with family members are also utilised in the assessment of the disease.

==Management==
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain [[palliative care|palliative]] in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|cognitive retraining]], is the reduction of [[cognitive deficit]]s. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities.

Stimulation-oriented treatments include [[Art therapy|art]], [[Music therapy for Alzheimer's disease|music]] and [[Animal-assisted therapy|pet]] therapies, [[Physical therapy|exercise]], and any other kind of [[Recreational therapy|recreational activities]].

The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.

Regarding incidence, [[cohort study|cohort]] [[longitudinal studies]] (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD,<ref name="pmid17727890">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bermejo-Pareja F, Benito-León J, Vega S, Medrano MJ, Román GC | title = Incidence and subtypes of dementia in three elderly populations of central Spain | journal = Journal of the Neurological Sciences | volume = 264 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 63–72 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17727890 | doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2007.07.021 | s2cid = 34341344 }}</ref><ref name="pmid12028245">{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Carlo A, Baldereschi M, Amaducci L, Lepore V, Bracco L, Maggi S, Bonaiuto S, Perissinotto E, Scarlato G, Farchi G, Inzitari D | title = Incidence of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia in Italy.

Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75–84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group.<ref>2000 U.S. estimates:

===Social costs===
Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for society in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]],<ref name="pmid15685097"/><ref name="pmid9543467"/> while their costs in other countries such as [[Argentina]],<ref name="pmid16870037">{{cite journal | vauthors = Allegri RF, Butman J, Arizaga RL, Machnicki G, Serrano C, Taragano FE, Sarasola D, Lon L | s2cid = 41247271 | title = Economic impact of dementia in developing countries: an evaluation of costs of Alzheimer-type dementia in Argentina | journal = International Psychogeriatrics | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 705–18 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 16870037 | doi = 10.1017/S1041610206003784 }}</ref> and [[South Korea]],<ref name="pmid16858741">{{cite journal | vauthors = Suh GH, Knapp M, Kang CJ | title = The economic costs of dementia in Korea, 2002 | journal = International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 722–28 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16858741 | doi = 10.1002/gps.1552 | s2cid = 24138151 }}</ref> are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important [[social issue|social problem]]. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as [[nursing home care]], direct nonmedical costs such as in-home [[day care]], and indirect costs such as lost [[productivity]] of both patient and caregiver.<ref name="pmid9543467"/> Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160&nbsp;billion,<ref name="pmid16401889">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wimo A, Jonsson L, Winblad B | title = An estimate of the worldwide prevalence and direct costs of dementia in 2003 | journal = Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–81 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16401889 | doi = 10.1159/000090733 | s2cid = 11304720 }}</ref> while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100&nbsp;billion each year.<ref name="pmid9543467"/>

The senescence accelerated mouse (SAMP8) is an Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal model in which amyloid precursor protein (APP) is overproduced. The mice develops early memory disturbances and alters the blood–brain barrier, which causes a decreased expulsion of amyloid-β protein from the brain. It has a marked increase in oxidative stress in the brain. Medications that reduce oxidative stress have been shown to improve memory. Treatments that reduce amyloid-β (antisense to APP and antibodies to amyloid-β) not only improve memory but also reduce oxidative stress. It has been shown that the initial deviations in lipid peroxidative damage favor mitochondrial dysfunction as being a trigger for amyloid-β overproduction in this AD mouse strain. This process begets increased amyloid-beta, which further damages mitochondria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morley JE, Armbrecht HJ, Farr SA, Kumar VB | title = The senescence accelerated mouse (SAMP8) as a model for oxidative stress and Alzheimer's disease | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease | volume = 1822 | issue = 5 | pages = 650–6 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22142563 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.11.015 }}</ref>
