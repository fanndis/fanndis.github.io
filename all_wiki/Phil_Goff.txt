==Early life==
Goff was born and raised in [[Auckland]]. His family was very poor, and his father wanted Goff to enter the workforce immediately after finishing high school. Goff, however, wished to attend university, a decision that caused him to leave home when only sixteen years old.

Goff joined the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] in 1969, the same year he left home, and held a number of administrative positions within the party. In the [[1981 New Zealand general election|1981 elections]], Goff stood for [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] in the [[Roskill (New Zealand electorate)|Roskill electorate]], and was elected.<ref name="candidate profile"/>

===Cabinet minister: 1984–1990===
Three years later, when Labour won the [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984 elections]], Goff was elevated to [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], becoming its youngest member. He served as Minister of Housing and Minister of Employment. After the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 elections]], Goff dropped the Housing portfolio, but also became [[Minister for Youth (New Zealand)|Minister of Youth Affairs]] and Minister of Tourism. Later, after a significant rearrangement of responsibilities, Goff became Minister of Education. In the disputes between [[Roger Douglas]] (the reformist [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]]) and other Labour MPs, Goff generally positioned himself on the side of Douglas, supporting [[deregulation]] and [[free trade]].

===In opposition: 1990–1999===
In the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 elections]], Labour was defeated, and Goff lost his own parliamentary seat to [[Gilbert Myles]]. While many commentators blamed Douglas's controversial reforms for Labour's loss, Goff said that the main problem had been in communication, not policy. Goff was appointed to a position at the [[Auckland Institute of Technology]], and later accepted a scholarship to study for six months at Oxford University.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Orsman |first1=Bernard |title=Phil Goff officially sworn in as Mayor of Auckland |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11740032 |accessdate=5 June 2018 |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=1 November 2016 |language=en-NZ}}</ref> Returning to New Zealand, he eventually decided to stand for parliament once again.

In the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 elections]], Goff was re-elected as MP for [[Roskill (New Zealand electorate)|Roskill]]. [[Helen Clark]], Labour's new leader, made him the party's spokesperson for Justice. In 1996, Goff was part of the group which asked Clark to [[1996 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|step down as leader]]. Clark survived the challenge, and was advised by her allies to demote Goff, but chose not to do so.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Brian |last=Edwards |title=Helen: Portrait of A Prime Minister |place = Auckland |publisher=Exisle Publishing |year=2001 |isbn=0-908988-20-6 |page=249 }}</ref>

Goff retained his seat in the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 elections]], having elected not to be placed on Labour's [[List MP|party list]]. In Opposition from 1996 to 1999, Goff was Labour's spokesperson on Justice, and Courts & Corrections.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Cabinet minister: 1999–2008===
[[File:Robert M. Gates and Phil Goff walk into the Pentagon.jpeg|thumb|left|Goff and U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] walk into [[the Pentagon]], 11 May 2007.]]
In the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 elections]], which Labour won, Goff accepted seventh place on the party list, but also retained his electorate seat. In Clark's new government, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister of Justice. He retained this position after the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 elections]]. Following the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 elections]] [[Winston Peters]] was made Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Goff was made Minister of Defence and Disarmament and retained the Trade portfolio.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2003 convicted rapist [[Stewart Murray Wilson]] doctored and distributed a letter from [[Justice Minister]] Goff, in an apparent attempt to get his case reviewed.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3518884 |title=Prisoner doctors letter to imply Goff supports him |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2011 |quote=A convicted sex offender dubbed the 'Beast of Blenheim' has distributed a doctored letter from Justice Minister Phil Goff – and Mr Goff is not impressed. |accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> In 2005, as justice minister, he passed legislation that dramatically strengthened laws condemning child pornography and child sex.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goff makes further change to child porn penalties|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/goff-makes-further-change-child-porn-penalties|website=The Beehive|accessdate=6 September 2016|date=8 February 2005}}</ref>

As Foreign and Trade Minister, Goff favoured [[free trade]] deals as a means of diplomacy and strengthening New Zealand's links with Asian neighbours.<ref name="freetrade">{{cite web|title=Good news for free trade fans|url=http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2008/09/good_news_for_free_trade_fans.html|accessdate=6 September 2016|date=22 September 2008}}</ref> Goff had a strong public profile and became one of the better-known members of the Labour Party; he was placed number four on the Labour Party [[party list|list]] during the 2008 general election. Clark and Goff differed substantially in their economic policies, but they were able to work relatively well together, and this was shown during Goff's signing of the [[New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement]].<ref name="freetrade" />

===Leader of the Opposition: 2008–2011===

At the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]] Labour was defeated, and Clark resigned as leader. Goff was widely tipped as her successor. Goff became leader after a special caucus meeting on 11 November 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gower |first=Patrick |title = Helen Clark takes foreign affairs post in Labour reshuffle |url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&objectid=10542417 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date  = 11 November 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="goff_leader">{{cite press release |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0811/S00156.htm |title=Labour elects Phil Goff as new leader |agency=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |publisher=[[New Zealand Labour Party]] |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref>

After initial strong popularity, Goff and Labour began to struggle in public [[opinion polls]]. A July 2011 poll showed support for the Labour Party at a 10-year low, at just 27%.<ref name="levy2011">{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Danya|title=Latest poll shows Labour struggling|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5298346/Latest-poll-shows-Labour-struggling|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=6 September 2016|language=English|date=18 July 2011}}</ref> This followed a leaked policy proposal for a [[capital gains tax]],<ref name="levy2011" /> which the party's critics suggested was unpopular with the electorate. Polls in 2011 also showed an increase in support for the [[Green Party of New Zealand|Green Party]].

In an October 2010 speech, Goff emphasised the "[[New Zealand dream|Kiwi Dream]]" of high-wage jobs, home ownership and social protection. He criticised the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National Government]] for free-market economic policies that Goff argued were accentuating inequality; he attributed social inequality to societal problems such as drug abuse and obesity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phil Goff: The Leader Emerges|url=http://thestandard.org.nz/phil-goff-the-leader-emerges/|work=The Standard|accessdate=6 September 2016|date=18 October 2010}}</ref>

Both Goff and Prime Minister [[John Key]] said that they would not vote in the [[2009 New Zealand citizens-initiated referendum|2009 corporal punishment referendum]]. Goff said that the question ''"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?"'' was "absolutely" the wrong question, and that "the question implies that if you vote 'yes' that you're in favour of criminal sanctions being taken against reasonable parents – actually nobody believes that."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10578819|title=Key, Goff won't vote on smacking referendum |date=16 June 2009|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=15 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Politicians kick for touch |url=http://yesvote.org.nz/2009/06/17/politicians-kick-for-touch/ |work=The Yes Vote |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2009}}</ref>

In John Key's Statement to Parliament in February 2010, the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|government]] announced its consideration of raising [[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|Goods and Services Tax]] from 12.5% to 15%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/politics/3307891/GST-could-go-up-to-15-per-cent|title=GST could go up to 15 per cent|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|first=Martin|last=Kay| date=9 February 2010|accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref> Goff opposed the raise, saying that "GST increase will hurt families that are already struggling to make ends meet", and the Labour caucus set out on an 'Axe the Tax' nationwide road trip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/businesslink/4299.html|title=Lift in GST will trigger inflation|first=Venkat|last=Raman|work=[[Indian Newslink]]|date=29 March 2010|accessdate=9 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/ageing/news/article.cfm?c_id=15&objectid=10628697|title=PM: Super rise to match GST|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=26 February 2010|accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref> In May 2010 Goff suggested exempting fresh fruit and vegetables from GST.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/3692321/Fruit-and-vege-may-lose-GST-ndash-Goff|title=Fruit and vege may lose GST – Goff|work=[[The Nelson Mail]]|first=Sally|last=Kidson|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=17 May 2010}}</ref> Key called the exemption of such items "very bureaucratic" and Goff's announcement "desperate".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/politics/3667168/Key-pans-idea-of-exempting-food-from-GST|title=Key pans idea of exempting food from GST|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|first=Vernon|last=Small|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=7 May 2010|accessdate=17 May 2010}}</ref>

===Proposed Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux speaking event===
In early July 2018, Mayor Goff announced that the [[Auckland Council]] would not allow the far right Canadian activists [[Lauren Southern]] and [[Stefan Molyneux]] to use council premises on the grounds that they stirred up ethnic or religious tensions and promoted divisive views. Southern and Molyneux have drawn controversy in the past for their controversial views on feminism, gender, and Muslim immigration. The pair had booked the Bruce Mason Centre in Auckland's [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]] for a talk on 3 August 2018. While the [[Auckland Peace Action]] activist group and the [[Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand]] had objected to Southern and Molyneux's planned talk, Goff's decision was criticised by the promoter David Pellowe and human rights lawyer Craig Tuck for violating free speech.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hatton |first1=Emma |title=Far-right pair banned from speaking at Auckland Council venues – Phil Goff |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/361220/far-right-pair-banned-from-speaking-at-auckland-council-venues-phil-goff |accessdate=8 July 2018 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=6 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Phil Goff bans Right wing speakers from talking in Council venues |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/mayor-bans-controversial-canadian-pair-from-talking-in-auckland-council-venues/ |accessdate=8 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newstalk ZB]] |date=6 July 2018}}</ref> In addition, ''[[The Spinoff]]'' contributor and self-described [[agnosticism|agnostic]] Muslim Ali Shakir defended the Southern and Molyneux tour and disputed the FIANZ's claim to speak for all Muslims on this matter.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shakir |first1=Ali |title=To ban, or not to ban: an (agnostic) Muslim's view |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/07/to-ban-or-not-to-ban-an-agnostic-muslim-s-view.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=13 July 2018}}</ref> New Zealand [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Winston Peters]] and National Party leader [[Simon Bridges]] said they would have supported her right to speak, while Green Party co-leader [[Marama Davidson]] said she supported the ban.<ref>{{cite news |title=Government divided over far right speakers |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/07/government-divided-over-far-right-speakers.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=10 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Craig |title=Winston Peters would've let far-right activists speak |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/361448/winston-peters-would-ve-let-far-right-activists-speak |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=9 July 2018}}</ref>

In response to Goff's decision, a group calling themselves the "Free Speech Coalition" announced that it would be collecting funds for a judicial review of the decision to ban Southern and Molyneux from Council premises.
