The '''''Harvard Law Review''''' is a [[law review]] published by an independent student group at [[Harvard Law School]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the ''Harvard Law Review's'' 2015 [[impact factor]] of 4.979 placed the journal first out of 143 journals in the category "Law".<ref>{{cite book |year=2012 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Law |title=2011 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |series=[[Web of Science]] |postscript=.}}</ref> It is published monthly from November through June, with the November issue dedicated to covering [[Foreword to the supreme court term|the previous year's term]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The journal also publishes the online-only ''Harvard Law Review Forum'', a rolling journal of scholarly responses to the main journal's content.

The Harvard Law Review Association, in conjunction with the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', publishes the ''[[Bluebook]]: A Uniform System of Citation'', a widely followed authority for [[legal citation]] formats in the United States.

==History==
The ''Harvard Law Review'' published its first issue on April 15, 1887, making it one of the oldest operating student-edited law reviews in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |first=Lawrence M. |last=Friedman |title=A History of American Law |edition=3rd |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=2005 |page=481 |isbn=0684869888 }}</ref> The establishment of the journal was largely due to the support of [[Louis Brandeis]], then a recent Harvard Law School [[alumnus]] and Boston [[attorney at law|attorney]] who would later go on to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

From the 1880s to the 1970s, editors were selected on the basis of their grades; the president of the ''Review'' was the student with the highest academic rank.  The first female editor of the journal was Priscilla Holmes (1953-1955, Volumes 67-68);<ref>

Gannett House, a white building constructed in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style that was popular in [[New England]] during the mid-to-late 19th century, has been home to the ''Harvard Law Review'' since the 1920s. Before moving into Gannett House, the journal resided in the Law School's [[Austin Hall (Harvard University)|Austin Hall]].

Since the change of criteria in the 1970s, grades are no longer the primary basis of selection for editors.  Membership in the ''Harvard Law Review'' is offered to select Harvard law students based on first-year grades and performance in a writing competition held at the end of the first year except for twelve slots that are offered on a discretionary basis.<ref name=selection>{{cite web|title=Harvard Law Review Membership Selection Policies|url=http://harvardlawreview.org/about/#membership|publisher=Harvard Law Review|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref><ref name="president"/><ref name=obamaonhlrselection>{{cite web|last=Obama|first=Barack|title=Review President Explains Affirmative Action Policy (letter)|url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=11263|publisher=The Harvard Law Record|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}</ref> The writing competition includes two components: an edit of an unpublished article and an analysis of a recent United States Supreme Court or [[Court of Appeals]] case.<ref name=selection/> The writing competition submissions are graded blindly to assure anonymity.<ref name=obamaonhlrselection/><ref name=blind>{{cite web|title=Prospective Transfer Students Applying for Membership|url=http://harvardlawreview.org/about/#competition|publisher=Harvard Law Review|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref> Fourteen editors (two from each [[Law school in the United States#Curriculum|1L]] section) are selected based on a combination of their first-year grades and their competition scores. Twenty editors are selected based solely on their competition scores. The remaining twelve editors are selected on a discretionary basis. According to the law review's webpage, "Some of these discretionary slots may be used to implement the Review's affirmative action policy."<ref name=selection/> The president of the ''Harvard Law Review'' is elected by the other editors.<ref name="president"/><ref name=peers>{{cite news|last=Seo|first=Jane|title=Tochilin '06 elected president of Harvard Law Review|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/7/tochilin-law-review-president/|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|date=February 7, 2012}}</ref>

It has been a long tradition, apparently since the first issue, that the works of students published in the Harvard Law Review are called "notes," and they are unsigned as part of a policy reflecting "the fact that many members of the ''Review'' besides the author make a contribution to each published piece."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/about/|title=About the Harvard Law Review|website=harvardlawreview.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}</ref>

In 2012, Harvard Law Review had 1,722 paid subscriptions.<ref>https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/06/the-nonsense-factory-the-making-and-breaking-of-the-american-legal-system.html</ref>
