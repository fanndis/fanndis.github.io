===Memoir===
Fraser's memoir ''Must You Go? My Life with Harold Pinter'' was published in January 2010 and she read a shortened version as BBC Radio Four's ''Book of the Week'' that month.<ref name=Guardian>[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jun/09/antonia-fraser-harold-pinter-love-story "Antonia Fraser to tell Harold Pinter 'love story']. Historical biographer will publish her 'portrait of a marriage' to the Nobel laureate in January 2010", ''The Guardian'', 9 June 2009. Retrieved 19 June 2009. [There is a factual error in this account; the Pinter-Merchant marriage was not dissolved in 1977, as stated, but in 1980, shortly before Pinter and Fraser married; Merchant's delay in signing the divorce papers resulted in the reception (scheduled for Pinter's 50th birthday on 10 October 1980) being held before the wedding, which occurred two weeks later, according to [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]]'s authorised biography of Pinter (''Harold Pinter'', pp. 271–72). It was the Frasers' marital union that was dissolved in 1977.]</ref>

At the [[Cheltenham Literary Festival]] on 17 October 2010, Lady Antonia announced that her next work would be on the subject of the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Bill 1832]].

==Perspective and criticism==
Fraser acknowledges she is "less interested in ideas than in 'the people who led nations' and so on. I don't think I could ever have written a history of political thought or anything like that.
