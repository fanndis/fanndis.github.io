==History==
FactCheck.org was launched in December 2003 by Brooks Jackson, a former [[Associated Press]], [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]], and [[CNN]] reporter who had covered Washington and national politics since 1970.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://factcheck.org/2003/12/is-this-a-great-job-or-what/| title = Is This a Great Job or What?| accessdate = 2013-04-25| date = 2003-12-05| publisher = FactCheck.org}}</ref> As a special assignment correspondent at CNN during the 1992 political campaign season, Jackson became well known for his “Ad Police” reports, which monitored candidates' advertising and financing strategies throughout the campaign.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/bios/cnn/jackson.shtml| title = Brooks Jackson| accessdate = 2013-04-25| publisher = CNN}}</ref> In 2003, [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] of the Annenberg Public Policy Center approached Jackson about forming FactCheck.org,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/publications/unspun-finding-facts-world-disinformation|title=UnSpun: Finding Facts in a World of Disinformation|publisher= The Annenberg School for Communication at University of Pennsylvania|date=2007|access-date=23 August 2016}}</ref> and the site was online in December of that year.

In 2007, ''UnSpun'' was published. This book was co-written by Brooks Jackson, the Director Emeritus of Factcheck.org and by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the Director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. It teaches readers how to be aware of the deceptions, or "spin", that is commonly used in media and by politicians.<ref>Jackson, B., & Jamieson, K. H. (2007). unSpun: finding facts in a world of disinformation. Random House Digital, Inc.</ref>

In January 2013, Jackson stepped down as director of FactCheck.org. He now holds the title of Director Emeritus. Eugene Kiely, a former reporter and editor at [[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] (of [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]), [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] and [[USA Today]], is now the site's director. FactCheck.org employs a staff of four full-time journalists, and offers yearly fellowships to undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://factcheck.org/about/| title = About| access-date = 2013-04-25| publisher = factcheck.org| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130420045855/http://factcheck.org/about/| archive-date = 2013-04-20| df = }}</ref>

In 2019, Factcheck.org celebrated its 15th anniversary.<ref name="Celebrating" />

==Topic in the 2004 vice-presidential debate==
FactCheck.org became a focus of political commentary following the [[U.S. presidential election debates, 2004|2004 vice-presidential debate]] between [[Dick Cheney]] and [[John Edwards]]. Cheney cited the website, claiming that the independent site defended his actions while CEO of [[Halliburton]]. Cheney's claim was disputed by FactCheck.org as wrong, saying that "Edwards was mostly right" when talking about "Cheney's responsibility for earlier Halliburton troubles".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/cheney_edwards_mangle_facts.html |title=Cheney & Edwards Mangle Facts |access-date=2010-01-10 |date=2004-10-06 |publisher=Factcheck.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108020551/http://www.factcheck.org/cheney_edwards_mangle_facts.html |archive-date=January 8, 2010 }}</ref>

Cheney's reference created some controversy because he incorrectly cited the web site's address as "FactCheck.''com''." At the time of the debate, factcheck.com was controlled by [[Frank Schilling|Frank Schilling's]] company Name Administration Inc., who quickly redirected the address to point to an anti-Bush website owned by Bush critic [[George Soros]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Milbank|first=Dana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12901-2004Oct6.html|work=Washington Post|date=2004-10-07|page=A08|title=Urging Fact-Checking, Cheney Got Site Wrong}}</ref>

==Topic in the 2012 presidential election==
FactCheck.org also became a focus of national attention in the summer of 2012, during the presidential race between incumbent Democrat [[Barack Obama]] and GOP challenger [[Mitt Romney]]. The Obama campaign ran a TV ad accusing Romney of involvement in the outsourcing of American jobs overseas by [[Bain Capital]], the venture capital firm that he had founded in 1984.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://electad.com/video/barack-obama-ad-come-and-go/| title = Come and Go| accessdate = 2013-04-25}}</ref> FactCheck.org ruled this ad to be false, claiming that the acts of outsourcing occurred after Romney had left the company to head the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://factcheck.org/2012/06/obamas-outsourcer-overreach/| title = Obama's Outsourcer Overreach| publisher = factcheck.org| date = 2012-06-29| accessdate = 2013-04-25}}</ref> In response, the Obama campaign contested FactCheck.org’s ruling in a six-page letter that was distributed to major news corporations, holding that Romney still retained responsibility for the company's actions.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/07/obama-to-factcheckorg-drop-dead-127932.html| title = Obama to FactCheck.org: "Drop Dead"| publisher = POLITICO| date = 2012-07-03| accessdate = 2013-04-25}}</ref>

== 2016 presidential election ==
Since November 2014, FactCheck.org has published twenty-eight pages of articles checking the facts on the many [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential]] candidates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/tag/presidential-election-2016/|title=Presidential Election 2016|website=www.factcheck.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref>  As of April 2016, the five remaining candidates had dedicated archives to their fact-checked claims.

In 2016, FactCheck.org became a fact-checking partner of [[Facebook]].<ref name="Celebrating" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/19/viral-image/no-factcheckorg-didnt-bust-snopescom/ |title=FactCheck.org exposed Snopes.com as an extremely liberal propaganda site with an agenda to discredit anything that appears to be conservative.  |publisher=[[PolitiFact]] |date=June 7, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2020 }}</ref>
