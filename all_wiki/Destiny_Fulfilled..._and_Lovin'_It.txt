==History==
The tour kicked off in [[Hiroshima]], Japan on April 9, 2005 and ended [[Vancouver]], Canada on September 10.

Destiny's Child embarked on the world tour sponsored by [[McDonald's Corporation]],<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Destiny's Child Debuts World Children's Day(TM) at McDonald's(R) Anthem |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/destinys-child-debuts-world-childrens-daytm-at-mcdonaldsr-anthem-55593902.html |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |date=November 15, 2005 |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> and performed hits such as "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]", "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]", "[[Say My Name]]", "[[Independent Women]]" and "[[Lose My Breath]]".  In addition to renditions of the group's recorded material, they also performed songs from each singer's solo careers, most notably numbers from [[Beyoncé]]'s debut album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''.  The stage design afforded 360 degree viewing within the typical [[arena]] show venue.  Several interludes by the show's dancers allowed for the expected costume changes; those costumes, often glittering gowns, were designed by Tina Knowles, Beyoncé's mother, and manufactured by [[House of Deréon]]. A special set of outfits were designed as a tribute to the Broadway musical [[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]], hinting at the play's "One Night Only (Disco)" scene where [[Deena Jones & the Dreams]] wear the same color pants suits.

===Split-up announcement===
During the last stop of their European tour in [[Barcelona]] on June 11, 2005, [[Kelly Rowland]] suddenly announced: "This is the last time you would see us on stage as Destiny's Child".<ref name="quote"/>

{{cquote|We have been working together as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After a lot of discussion and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest. ... No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1071405,00.html |title=Destiny's Child to Split Up After Tour |last1=Silverman |first1=Stephen |last2= |first2= |date=June 13, 2005 |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref>}}

The announcement was surprising to many, as the trio had downplayed rumors of a split in the wake of Knowles' success, although prior plans had called for the members to focus on solo projects at the end of the tour.

==Broadcasts and recordings==
A performance from the tour was filmed in [[Atlanta]] at [[Philips Arena]] on July 15, 2005, and the resulting DVD ''[[Destiny's Child Live in Atlanta]]'' was released on March 28, 2006. [[RIAA]] subsequently certified the DVD as Platinum. The concert was also aired in the USA on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] as a television special, on Channel 4 in the UK and on the Dutch television channel [[AT5]].
