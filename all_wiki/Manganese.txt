'''Manganese''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Mn''' and [[atomic number]] 25. It is not found as a [[free element]] in nature{{not in body|date=June 2020}}; it is often found in [[mineral]]s in combination with [[iron]]. Manganese is a [[transition metal]] with a multifaceted array of industrial [[alloy]] uses, particularly in [[stainless steel]]s.

Historically, manganese is named for [[pyrolusite]] and other black minerals from the region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] in Greece, which also gave its name to [[magnesium]] and the [[iron]] ore [[magnetite]]. By the mid-18th century, [[Sweden|Swedish-]] [[Germanic peoples|German]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had used pyrolusite to produce [[chlorine]]. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be [[manganese dioxide]]) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

[[Phosphate conversion coating|Manganese phosphating]] is used for rust and corrosion prevention on [[steel]]. Ionized manganese is used industrially as [[pigment]]s of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The [[permanganate]]s of [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the [[cathode]] (electron acceptor) material in [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon]] and [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].

In biology, manganese(II) ions function as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for a large variety of [[enzymes]] with many functions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roth |first1=Jerome |last2=Ponzoni |first2=Silvia |last3=Aschner |first3=Michael|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|pages=169–201 |chapter=Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport|title=Metallomics and the Cell |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_6|pmid=23595673 |pmc=6542352 }} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}}</ref> Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of [[superoxide]] free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental [[oxygen]]. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic [[plants]]. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a [[neurotoxin]] in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause [[manganism]], a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.

At the surface, dMn is elevated due to input from external sources such as rivers, dust, and shelf sediments. Coastal sediments normally have lower Mn concentrations, but can increase due to anthropogenic discharges from industries such as mining and steel manufacturing, which enter the ocean from river inputs. Surface dMn concentrations can also be elevated biologically through photosynthesis and physically from coastal upwelling and wind-driven surface currents. Internal cycling such as photo-reduction from UV radiation can also elevate levels by speeding up the dissolution of Mn-oxides and oxidative scavenging, preventing Mn from sinking to deeper waters.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Sim|first=Nari|last2=Orians|first2=Kristin J.|date=October 2019|title=Annual variability of dissolved manganese in Northeast Pacific along Line-P: 2010–2013|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marchem.2019.103702|journal=Marine Chemistry|volume=216|pages=103702|doi=10.1016/j.marchem.2019.103702|issn=0304-4203}}</ref> Elevated levels at mid-depths can occur near mid-ocean ridges and hydrothermal vents.

Dissolved Mn concentrations are even higher when oxygen levels are low. Overall, dMn concentrations are normally higher in coastal regions and decrease when moving offshore.<ref name=":1" />

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of manganese}}
Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable [[isotope]], <sup>55</sup>Mn. Several [[radioisotope]]s have been isolated and described, ranging in [[atomic weight]] from 44 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>44</sup>Mn) to 69 u (<sup>69</sup>Mn). The most stable are <sup>53</sup>Mn with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years, <sup>54</sup>Mn with a half-life of 312.2 days, and <sup>52</sup>Mn with a half-life of 5.591 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours, and the majority of less than one minute. The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, <sup>55</sup>Mn, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta decay]].<ref name="Audi" /> Manganese also has three [[meta state]]s.<ref name="Audi">{{NUBASE2016}}</ref>

Manganese is part of the [[iron]] group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large [[star]]s shortly before the [[supernova]] explosion. <sup>53</sup>Mn decays to <sup>53</sup>[[chromium|Cr]] with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, <sup>53</sup>Mn is relatively rare, produced by [[cosmic rays]] impact on [[iron]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Jeorg|last2=Faestermann |first2=Thomas |title=Terrestrial manganese-53 – A new monitor of Earth surface processes |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=251|issue=3–4 |pages=334–345|date=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.016 |bibcode=2006E&PSL.251..334S |last3=Herzog |first3=Gregory F. |last4=Knie |first4=Klaus |last5=Korschinek |first5=Gunther |last6=Masarik |first6=Jozef |last7=Meier |first7=Astrid |last8=Poutivtsev |first8=Michail |last9=Rugel |first9=Georg |last10=Schlüchter |first10=Christian |last11=Serifiddin |first11=Feride |last12=Winckler |first12=Gisela}}</ref> Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with [[chromium]] isotopic contents and have found application in [[isotope geology]] and [[radiometric dating]].

Variations in <sup>53</sup>Cr/<sup>52</sup>Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several [[meteorite]]s suggest an initial <sup>53</sup>Mn/<sup>55</sup>Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from ''in situ'' decay of <sup>53</sup>Mn in differentiated planetary bodies.

The most common [[oxidation state]]s of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn<sup>2+</sup> often competes with Mg<sup>2+</sup> in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly restricted to the unstable oxide Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, and a few oxyhalides (MnO<sub>3</sub>F and MnO<sub>3</sub>Cl), are powerful [[oxidation|oxidizing agents]].<ref name="Holl"/> Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to [[disproportionation]].

[[File:KMnO4 in H2O.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|Aqueous solution of KMnO<sub>4</sub> illustrating the deep purple of Mn(VII) as it occurs in permanganate]]
The most stable oxidation state for manganese is +2, which has a pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as [[manganese(II) sulfate]] (MnSO<sub>4</sub>) and [[manganese(II) chloride]] (MnCl<sub>2</sub>). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite ([[manganese(II) carbonate]]). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II).<ref name="Saha 1703–1708">{{cite journal|last=Saha|first=Amrita|last2=Majumdar|first2=Partha|last3=Goswami|first3=Sreebrata|title=Low-spin manganese(II) and cobalt(III) complexes of N-aryl-2-pyridylazophenylamines: new tridentate N,N,N-donors derived from cobalt mediated aromatic ring amination of 2-(phenylazo)pyridine.

The +3 oxidation state is known in compounds like [[manganese(III) acetate]], but these are quite powerful [[Redox|oxidizing agents]] and also prone to [[disproportionation]] in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the [[Jahn-Teller effect]].

The oxidation state +5 can be produced by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten [[sodium nitrite]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=R. B. |last=Temple|author2=Thickett, G.

==History==
The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, there were two black minerals from the regions of the [[Magnetes]] (either [[Ancient Magnesia|Magnesia]], located within modern Greece, or [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]], located within modern Turkey).<ref name="LanguageHAt">{{cite web |last1=languagehat |title=MAGNET. |url=http://languagehat.com/magnet/ |website=languagehat.com |accessdate=18 June 2020 |language=en |date=28 May 2005}}</ref>
They were both called ''magnes'' from their place of origin, but were considered to differ in sex. The male ''magnes'' attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as [[lodestone]] or [[magnetite]], and which probably gave us the term [[magnet]]. The female ''magnes'' ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This female ''magnes'' was later called ''magnesia'', known now in modern times as [[pyrolusite]] or [[manganese dioxide]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ''manganesum'' (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a ''magnesia nigra'' (the black ore) from ''magnesia alba'' (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). [[Michele Mercati]] called magnesia nigra ''manganesa'', and finally the metal isolated from it became known as ''manganese'' (German: ''Mangan''). The name ''magnesia'' eventually was then used to refer only to the white [[magnesia alba]] (magnesium oxide), which provided the name [[magnesium]] for the free element when it was isolated much later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=J.

Because it was used in glassmaking, [[Manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. [[Ignatius Gottfried Kaim]] (1770) and [[Johann Glauber]] (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to [[permanganate]], a useful laboratory reagent.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Centaurus|volume=19|issue=4|title=The Discovery of an Element|first=E.|last=Rancke-Madsen|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1975.tb00329.x|pages=299–313|date=1975|bibcode=1975Cent...19..299R}}</ref> By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] used manganese dioxide to produce [[chlorine]]. First, [[hydrochloric acid]], or a mixture of dilute [[sulfuric acid]] and [[sodium chloride]] was made to react with manganese dioxide, and later hydrochloric acid from the [[Leblanc process]] was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the [[Weldon process]]. The production of chlorine and [[hypochlorite]] [[bleach]]ing agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.

Scheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the [[Sparta]]n steel exceptionally hard.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajim.20524|date=2007|title=From lead to manganese through mercury: mythology, science, and lessons for prevention|volume=50|issue=11|pages=779–787 |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|pmid=17918211|last1=Alessio|first1=L.|last2=Campagna|first2=M.|last3=Lucchini|first3=R.}}</ref> Around the beginning of the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted.

The invention of the [[Leclanché cell]] in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic [[depolarizer]] increased the demand for manganese dioxide. Until the development of batteries with [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The [[zinc-carbon battery]] and the [[alkaline battery]] normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities.

A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850&nbsp;°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of [[sulfuric acid]] and ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form [[iron hydroxide]] and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.<ref name="ManganeseRecovery">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|title=The Recovery of Manganese from low grade resources: bench scale metallurgical test program completed|date=2010|author=Chow, Norman|author2=Nacu, Anca|author3=Warkentin, Doug|author4=Aksenov, Igor|author5=Teh, Hoe|name-list-style=amp|publisher=Kemetco Research Inc.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202065633/http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2012}}</ref>

Mn nodules are found along the ocean floor and are mined for the manganese. This mining can have setbacks. Physical, chemical, and biological environmental impacts can occur due to this nodule mining. Mining disturbs the seafloor, causing a cloud of resuspended sediments to form. This suspension includes heavy metals and inorganic nutrients, which can lead to contamination of the near-bottom waters from dissolved toxic compounds. Mn nodules are also the grazing grounds, living space, and protection for endo- and epifaunal systems. When theses nodules are removed, these systems are directly affected. Overall, this can cause species to leave the area or completely die off.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oebius|first=Horst U|last2=Becker|first2=Hermann J|last3=Rolinski|first3=Susanne|last4=Jankowski|first4=Jacek A|date=January 2001|title=Parametrization and evaluation of marine environmental impacts produced by deep-sea manganese nodule mining|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0967-0645(01)00052-2|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|volume=48|issue=17-18|pages=3453–3467|doi=10.1016/s0967-0645(01)00052-2|issn=0967-0645}}</ref>

Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy.<ref name=USGSMCS2009/> In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), [[zinc]] and sometimes [[vanadium]] are viable substitutes.

===Steel===
[[File:M1917helmet.jpg|thumb|U.S. M1917 [[combat helmet]], a variant of [[Brodie helmet]], made from [[Hadfield steel]] manganese alloy.]]
Manganese is essential to iron and [[steelmaking|steel production]] by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, [[deoxidized steel|deoxidizing]], and [[alloying]] properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist [[Robert Forester Mushet]] (1811–1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of [[Spiegeleisen]], into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. [[Steelmaking]],<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-87170-858-8|pages=56–57|first=John D. |last=Verhoeven|date=2007|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|title=Steel metallurgy for the non-metallurgist}}</ref> including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand.<ref name="hydrometI"/> Manganese is a key component of low-cost [[stainless steel]].<ref name="MangUSGS2006"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648339|title=Mechanism of work hardening in Hadfield manganese steel|date=1981|last=Dastur|first=Y.

Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid [[iron sulfide]] at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high [[tensile strength]] of up to 863&nbsp;MPa.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-1-4086-2616-0 |pages=351–352|title=Iron and Steel|first=John Henry|last=Stansbie|publisher=Read Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FyogLqUxW1cC&pg=PA351|date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-07-136076-0|pages=585–587|last=Brady|first=George S.|author2=Clauser, Henry R. |author3=Vaccari.

Many enzymatic systems need Mn to function, but in high levels, Mn can become toxic. One environmental reason Mn levels can increase in seawater is when hypoxic periods occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hernroth|first=Bodil|last2=Krång|first2=Anna-Sara|last3=Baden|first3=Susanne|date=February 2015|title=Bacteriostatic suppression in Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) exposed to manganese or hypoxia under pressure of ocean acidification|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.025|journal=Aquatic Toxicology|volume=159|pages=217–224|doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.025|issn=0166-445X}}</ref> Since 1990 there have been reports of Mn accumulation in marine organisms including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and echinoderms. Specific tissues are targets in different species, including the gills, brain, blood, kidney, and liver/hepatopancreas. Physiological effects have been reported in these species. Mn can affect the renewal of immunocytes and their functionality, such as phagocytosis and activation of pro-phenoloxidase, suppressing the organisms’ immune systems. This causes the organisms to be more susceptible to infections. As climate change occurs, pathogen distributions increase, and in order for organisms to survive and defend themselves against these pathogens, they need a healthy, strong immune system. If their systems are compromised from high Mn levels, they will not be able to fight off these pathogens and die.<ref name=":2" />

The [[U.S. Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for minerals in 2001. For manganese there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs). As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11&nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).<ref name=MnDRI>{{cite book|chapter=Manganese|chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/12 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Chromium|publisher= National Academy Press|year= 2001|pages=394–419|pmid=25057538|isbn=978-0-309-07279-3|author1=Institute of Medicine (US) Panel on Micronutrients }}</ref> Manganese deficiency is rare.<ref>''See'' {{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/manganese |title=Manganese|work=Micronutrient Information Center|publisher=[[Oregon State University]] [[Linus Pauling Institute]]|date=2014-04-23}}</ref>

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For people ages 15 and older the AI is set at 3.0&nbsp;mg/day. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 3.0&nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 0.5 to 2.0&nbsp;mg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}</ref> The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set a UL.<ref>{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref>

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).

=== Biological role in bacteria ===

Mn-SOD is the type of SOD present in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[mitochondria]], and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and related [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.

=== Biological role in plants ===
Manganese is also important in photosynthetic [[oxygen evolution]] in [[chloroplast]]s in plants. The [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal [[Oxygen evolution|photooxidation of water]] during the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]], and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Umena|first=Yasufumi|last2=Kawakami|first2=Keisuke|last3=Shen|first3=Jian-Ren|last4=Kamiya |first4=Nobuo|title=Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 Å|journal=Nature|volume=473|issue=7345|pages=55–60|doi=10.1038/nature09913|pmid=21499260|date=May 2011|bibcode=2011Natur.473...55U|url=http://ousar.lib.okayama-u.ac.jp/files/public/4/47455/20160528084139320094/Nature_473_55–60.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dismukes|first=G.

Permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10&nbsp;g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to [[necrosis]] of the [[mucous membrane]]. For example, the [[esophagus]] is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/emj.14.1.43|title=Potassium permanganate poisoning – a rare cause of fatal self poisoning|date=1997|last=Ong|first=K.

Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms.

==Role in neurological disorders==

===Manganism===
{{Main|Manganism}}
Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with [[manganism]], a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys<ref>Baselt, R.

Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles [[Parkinson's disease]]. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance.<ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/><ref name="Cersosimo 2007 340–346">{{cite journal|last=Cersosimo|first=M.

===Childhood developmental disorders===
Several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low-dose manganese overexposure on [[child development]]. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350&nbsp;µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300&nbsp;µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400&nbsp;µg Mn/L by the [[World Health Organization]], the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610&nbsp;µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160&nbsp;µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.<ref name="Bouchard 138–143" />

The current maximum safe concentration under EPA rules is 50&nbsp;µg Mn/L.<ref name="EPA drinking water">{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Contaminants|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
A protein called [[DMT1]] is the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the [[blood–brain barrier]]. [[DMT1]] also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Prabhakaran|first=K.|last2=Ghosh|first2=D.|last3=Chapman|first3=G.D.|last4=Gunasekar|first4=P.G.|date=2008|title=Molecular mechanism of manganese exposure-induced dopaminergic toxicity|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=76|issue=4|pages=361–367|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2008.03.004|pmid=18502311|issn=0361-9230}}</ref>
