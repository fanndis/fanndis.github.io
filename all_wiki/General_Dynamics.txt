'''General Dynamics Corporation''' ('''GD''') is an American [[aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]] and [[military|defense]] corporation.

==History==
[[File:General Dynmamics 1960.jpg|thumb|Poster by [[Erik Nitsche]] from 1960]]

===Electric Boat===
{{main|General Dynamics Electric Boat}}

General Dynamics traces its ancestry to [[John Philip Holland]]'s Holland Torpedo Boat Company.<ref name="history1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/general-dynamics-corporation-history/|title=History of General Dynamics Corporation|publisher=Funding Universe |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> Holland Torpedo was responsible for developing the [[U.S. Navy]]'s first modern [[submarine]]s which were purchased by the Navy in 1900.<ref name="britannicahistory">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/General-Dynamics-Corp|title=General Dynamics Corp|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> 

In 1906 Electric Boat subcontracted submarine construction to the [[Fore River Shipyard]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], to build the submarines they had designed and won contracts for. In 1917, the name of the company was officially changed to Submarine Boat Corporation.<ref name="history1"/> In 1933 Electric Boat acquired ownership of a shipyard in [[Groton, Connecticut]], to build submarines. The first submarine built in Groton to be delivered to the U.S. Navy was the [[USS Cuttlefish (SS-171)|USS ''Cuttlefish'']] in 1934.

Electric Boat was cash-flush but lacking in work following [[World War II]], during which it produced 80 submarines for the Navy, with its workforce shrinking from 13,000 to 4,000 by 1946.<ref name="history1"/> President and chief executive officer [[John Jay Hopkins]] started looking for companies that would fit into Electric Boat's market in hopes of diversifying.<ref name="history1"/>

===Canadair purchase===
[[Canadair]] was owned by the Canadian government and was suffering from the same post-war malaise as Electric Boat. It was up for sale, and Hopkins bought the company for $10 million in 1946. The factory alone was worth more than $22 million, according to the Canadian government's calculations,<ref name="history1"/> excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts. However, Canadair's production line and inventory systems were in disorder when Electric Boat purchased the company. Hopkins hired Canadian-born mass-production specialist H. Oliver West to take over the president's role and return Canadair to profitability. Shortly after the takeover, Canadair began delivering its new [[Canadair North Star]] (a version of the [[Douglas DC-4]]) and was able to deliver aircraft to [[Trans-Canada Airlines]], [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]], and [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) well in advance of their contracted delivery times.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/canadair50yearhistory/introduction|title=introduction - canadair50yearhistory|website=sites.google.com |access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>

Defense spending increased with the onset of the Cold War, and Canadair went on to win many Canadian military contracts for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and became a major aerospace company. These included [[Canadair CT-133 Silver Star]] trainer, the [[Canadair Argus]] long-range maritime reconnaissance and [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]], and the [[Canadair F-86]] ''Sabre''. Between 1950 and 1958, 1,815 Sabres were built.  Canadair also produced 200 [[CF-104 Starfighter]] supersonic fighter aircraft, a license-built version of the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104]].

In 1976, General Dynamics sold Canadair to the Canadian Government for $38 million.<ref name="CA sold back">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/29/archives/general-dynamics-to-sell-canadair-ottawa-says-it-will-acquire.html|title=GENERAL DYNAMICS TO SELL CANADAIR Ottawa Says It Will Acquire Aircraft‐Manufacturing Unit for $38 Million|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Trumbull|first=Robert|date=November 29, 1975 |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> Canadair was acquired by [[Bombardier Inc.]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/19/business/company-news-canadair-to-be-sold-to-bombardier-inc.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Canadair to Be Sold To Bombardier Inc.|last=Salpukas|first=Agis|date=1986-08-19|work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-08-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===General Dynamics emerges===
Aircraft production became increasingly important at Canadair, and Hopkins argued that the name "Electric Boat" was no longer appropriate—so Electric Boat was reorganized as General Dynamics on 24 April 1952.<ref name="centennial_GD">{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/generaldynamics/Aero35.htm |title=General Dynamics Corporation |work=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |access-date=2008-12-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112045623/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/generaldynamics/Aero35.htm |archive-date=2008-11-12 }}</ref>

General Dynamics purchased [[Convair]] from the Atlas Group in March 1953.<ref name="centennial_GD"/> The sale was approved by government oversight with the provision that GD would continue to operate out of [[Air Force Plant 4]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. This factory had been set up in order to spread out strategic aircraft production and rented to Convair during the war to produce [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers. 

General Dynamics purchased Liquid Carbonic Corporation in September 1957 and controlled it as a wholly owned subsidiary until being forced by a Federal antitrust ruling to spin it off to shareholders in January 1969.  Liquid Carbonic was then bought  that same month by the Houston Natural Gas Company.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/258/36/1510699/ | title=United States v. General Dynamics Corporation, 258 F. Supp. 36 (S.D.N.Y. 1966)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/28/archives/market-place-hitormiss-notification.html | title=Market Place| newspaper=The New York Times| date=1975-03-28| last1=Metz| first1=Robert}}</ref>

Convair worked as an independent division under the General Dynamics umbrella. Over the next decade, the company introduced the [[F-106 Delta Dart]] [[interceptor aircraft|Interceptor]], the [[B-58 Hustler]], and the [[Convair 880]] and [[Convair 990|990]] [[airliner]]s. Convair also introduced the [[Atlas missile]] platform, the first operational [[intercontinental ballistic missile]].

===Management churn===
Hopkins fell seriously ill during 1957 and was eventually replaced by Frank Pace later that year.<ref name="centennial_GD"/> Meanwhile, John Naish succeeded Joseph McNarney as president of Convair. Chicago industrialist [[Henry Crown]] became the company's largest shareholder and merged his [[Material Service Corporation]] with GD in 1959.<ref name="henrycrown">{{Cite book |first=Stewart |last=Alsop |title=America's Big New Rich |date=July 17, 1965 |publisher=The Saturday Evening Post}}</ref>

GD subsequently reorganized into Eastern Group in [[New York City]] and Western Group in [[San Diego]], [[California]], with the latter taking over all of the aerospace activities and dropping the Convair brand name from its aircraft in the process.<ref name="history2">{{cite book |author=Donald M. Pattillo |date=2001 |publisher= University of Michigan Press|title=Pushing the Envelope: The American Aircraft Industry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shwtKbTbEuEC&q=general+dynamics+reorganize+western+eastern+group&pg=PA225|pages=225, 226 |isbn=0472086715 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

Frank Pace retired under pressure in 1962 and Roger Lewis, former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force and [[Pan American Airways]] CEO, was brought in as CEO.  The company recovered, then fell back into the same struggles.  In 1970, the board brought in [[McDonnell Douglas]] president [[David S. Lewis, Jr.|Dave Lewis]] (no relation) as chairman and CEO, who served until retiring in 1985.<ref name="history1"/>

===Aviation powerhouse===
During the early 1960s the company bid on the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[TFX Program|Tactical Fighter, Experimental]] (TFX) project for a new low-level "penetrator". [[Robert McNamara]], newly installed as the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], forced a merger of the TFX with [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] plans for a new long-range "fleet defender" aircraft. In order to bid on a naval version successfully, GD partnered with [[Grumman]], which would build a customized version for [[aircraft carrier]] duties. After four rounds of bids and changes, the GD/Grumman team finally won the contract over a [[Boeing]] submission.

The [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] that resulted first flew in December 1964. The F-111B flew in May 1965, but the navy said that it was too heavy for use on aircraft carriers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_sep2018-cancelled-f111b-1-180969916/|title=Was the Navy's F-111 Really That Bad?|publisher=[[Air&Space Magazine]]|author=Robert Bernier |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> With an unacceptable navy version, estimates for 2,400 F-111s, including exports, were sharply reduced, but GD still managed to make a $300-million profit on the project.<ref name="history2"/> Grumman went on to use many of the innovations of the F-111 in the highly successful [[F-14 Tomcat]],<ref name="history1"/> an aircraft designed solely as a carrier-borne fighter.

===Reorganization===
In May 1965, GD reorganized into 12 operating divisions based on product lines. The board decided to build all future planes in Fort Worth, ending plane production at Convair's original plant in San Diego but continuing with space and missile development there. In October 1970, Roger Lewis left and David S. Lewis from [[McDonnell Douglas]] was named CEO. Lewis required that the company headquarters move to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which occurred in February 1971.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/boeing-moving-defense-hq-from-st-louis-to-d-c/article_029c405c-5f9b-5445-9008-3f8084708306.html|title=Boeing moving defense HQ from St. Louis to D.C. area|last=Brown|first=Lisa|work=stltoday.com |access-date=2017-04-12|language=en}}</ref>

===F-16 success===
{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2020}}
In 1972, GD bid on the USAF's [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) project. GD and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] were awarded prototype contracts. GD's F-111 program was winding down, and the company desperately needed a new aircraft contract. It organized its own version of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]'s famed "[[Skunk Works]]", the Advanced Concepts Laboratory, and responded with a new aircraft design incorporating advanced technologies.

GD's [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]] first flew in January 1974 and proved to have slightly better performance than the [[Northrop YF-17|YF-17]] in head-to-head testing. It entered production as the F-16 in January 1975 with an initial order of 650 and a total order of 1,388. The F-16 also won contracts worldwide, beating the F-17 in foreign competition as well. GD built an aircraft production factory in Fort Worth, Texas.  F-16 orders eventually totaled more than 4,000, making it the largest and most successful program for the company, and one of the most successful western military projects since World War II.

===Land Systems and Marine Systems focus===
{{main|General Dynamics Land Systems}}
{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2020}}
In 1976, General Dynamics sold the struggling Canadair back to the Canadian government for $38 million. By 1984, General Dynamics had four divisions: Convair in San Diego, General Dynamics-Fort Worth, General Dynamics-Pomona, and General Dynamics-Electronics. In 1985 a further reorganization created the Space Systems Division from the Convair Space division. In 1985, GD also acquired [[Cessna]].  In 1986 the Pomona division (which mainly produced the Standard Missile and the Phalanx CIWS for the navy) was split up,  creating the Valley Systems Division.  Valley Systems produced the Stinger surface-to-air missile and the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM).  Both units were recombined into one entity in 1992.

Henry Crown, still GD's largest shareholder, died on 15 August 1990. Following this, the company started to rapidly divest its under-performing divisions under CEO [[William Anders]]. Cessna was re-sold to [[Textron]] in January 1992, the San Diego and Pomona missile production units to [[General Motors]]-[[Hughes Aerospace]] in May 1992, the Fort Worth aircraft production to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in March 1993 (a nearby electronics production facility was separately sold to Israeli-based [[Elbit Systems]], marking that company's entry into the United States market), and its Space Systems Division to [[Martin Marietta]] in 1994. The remaining Convair Aircraft Structure unit was sold to McDonnell Douglas in 1994. The remains of the Convair Division were simply closed in 1996. GD's exit from the aviation world was short-lived, and in 1999 the company acquired [[Gulfstream Aerospace]].  The Pomona operation was closed shortly after its sale to Hughes Aircraft.

In 1995, General Dynamics purchased the privately held [[Bath Iron Works]] shipyard in [[Bath, Maine]], for $300 million, diversifying its shipbuilding portfolio to include U.S. Navy surface ships such as [[Guided missile destroyer|guided-missile destroyers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-18-fi-36555-story.html|title=General Dynamics to Buy Bath Iron Works Shipyard : Defense: The purchase would give the contractor access to $2 billion in orders for Navy ships.|date=1995-08-18|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> In 1998, the company acquired NASSCO, formerly [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company]], for $415 million. The San Diego shipyard produces U.S. Navy auxiliary and support ships as well as commercial ships that are eligible to be U.S.-flagged under the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-oct-09-fi-30651-story.html|title=Defense Giant to Purchase Nassco for $415 Million|date=1998-10-09|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref>

Having divested itself of its aviation holdings, GD concentrated on land and sea products. GD purchased [[Chrysler]]'s defense divisions in 1982, renaming them General Dynamics Land Systems. In 2003, it purchased the defense divisions of [[General Motors]] as well. It is now a major supplier of armored vehicles of all types, including the [[M1 Abrams]], [[LAV 25]], [[Stryker]], and a wide variety of vehicles based on these chassis.  [[Force Protection Inc|Force Protection, Inc.]] was acquired by General Dynamics Land Systems in November 2011 for $350 million.

===General Dynamics UK===

In 1997, General Dynamics acquired Computing Devices Ltd based in [[Hastings]], [[England]] which had developed avionics and mission systems for the [[Panavia Tornado]], [[British Aerospace Harrier II]] and [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Transatlantic Defence Industrial Relationship: An Audit and Commentary |url=https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/D0005452.A1.pdf |website=CNA.org |access-date=3 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Sullivan |first1=Hugh |title=Protest over Hastings Firm's Links to US Child Detention |url=https://www.hastingsindependentpress.co.uk/news/protest-over-hastings-firms-links-to-us-child-detention/ |access-date=3 September 2020 |agency=Hastings Independent |date=30 November 2018}}</ref> In 2001, Computing Devices Canada (CDC) was awarded a contract from the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] to supply tactical communication systems for their [[Bowman (communications system)|Bowman]] program.

===Recent history===
On August 19, 2008, GD agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the US Government claiming that a GD unit fraudulently billed the government for defectively manufactured parts used in US military aircraft and submarines.  The US alleged that GD defectively manufactured or failed to test parts used in US military aircraft from September 2001 to August 2003, such as for the [[C-141 Starlifter]] transport plane. The GD unit involved, based in [[Glen Cove, New York]], closed in 2004.<ref>''[[Washington Post]]'', "General Dynamics To Settle Suit For $4 Million", August 19, 2008, p. D4.</ref>
