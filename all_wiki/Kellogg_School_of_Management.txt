==History==

=== Early history (1908–1950) ===
The school was founded in 1908 as Northwestern University's School of Commerce. It offered a part-time evening program. It was a founding member of the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]], that sets accreditation standards for business schools.<ref>American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business, 1916–1966 (Homewood, Ill.: Richard D. Irwin, 1966), pp. 181–92.</ref> The school played a major role in helping to establish the [[Graduate Management Admission Test]].<ref>The Evolution of Management Education, Sedlak, Michael W. and Harold F. Williamson, University of Illinois Press, 1983, pp. 93–94.</ref> Also, researchers associated with the school have made contributions to fields such as [[marketing]] and [[decision sciences]].<ref name="kellogg.northwestern.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/kwo/sum07/features/reiter.htm|title=Quant catalyst, Kellogg World Alumni Magazine, Summer 2007, Kellogg School of Management}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/meds/schwartz/2008.html|title=2008 – Roger B.

Borden, Jr., The Journal of Marketing, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Jan. 1973), pp. 110–111.</ref>

In 1919, [[Ralph E. Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial – Home}}</ref>

In 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.

=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===
In 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[Bürgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975–2001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.

In 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors – rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850–1975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>

These dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965–1975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name="kellogg.northwestern.edu"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?) Stories on the Late 20th-Century Rise of Game Theory|date=June 2008|last1=Giocoli|first1=Nicola}}</ref><ref>The Evolution of Management Education, Sedlak, Michael W. and Harold F. Williamson, University of Illinois Press, 1983, p. 134.</ref><ref>Wide Awake in the Windy City, Matt Golosinski, NU Press, 2008, pp. 142–145.</ref>

=== Continued expansion: John L. Kellogg (1979–2008) ===
In 1979, in honor of a $10 million gift made to the school on behalf of John L. Kellogg,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20020520/kelloggs.html|title=The Scripps Research Institute – News and Views}}</ref> the school was renamed as the ''J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.'' The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory. Even before the Kellogg gift, the school had been expanding its research-focused faculty: In 1978 alone, the school added six additional "named" professorships and two new research professorships.<ref name="Cent"/>

In 2001, its name was shortened to the ''Kellogg School of Management''.<ref name="Cent">{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu|title=Kellogg Centennial – Home|access-date=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111051745/http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|archive-date=January 11, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Recent history (2009–today) ===
In June 2009, Kellogg announced that [[Dipak C. Jain]] would step down after eight years as dean and return to teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/News_Articles/2009/Dean-Jain-May-2009.aspx|title=Dipak C. Jain to step down Sept. 1 as Kellogg School dean}}</ref> On September 1, 2009, Sunil Chopra, former Senior Associate Dean for Curriculum and Teaching and the IBM Distinguished Professor of Operations Management, assumed the role of interim dean while a search committee worked to find a permanent replacement. Later in 2009, Northwestern University announced plans to construct a new building at the northeast corner of its Evanston campus to serve as Kellogg's new home. The new facility, called the Global Hub, opened in March 2017 adjacent to Lake Michigan and includes classrooms, faculty offices, collaborative learning spaces, and administrative offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/about/global-hub.aspx|title=Global Hub – Kellogg School of Management – Northwestern|access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://menlocoaching.com/kellogg-global-hub/|title=Assistant Dean Kate Smith on Kellogg's Global Hub|access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref>

In March 2010, Kellogg announced that [[Sally Blount]] would replace Sunil Chopra as dean, starting in July. Blount was the dean of the undergraduate college, and vice dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/69833de6-3bf0-11df-9412-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=02e16f4a-46f9-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8.html|title=Kellogg appoints female dean|work=Financial Times}}</ref> Dean Blount launched ambitious marketing and capital campaigns. These started in 2011 with the Think Bravely campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/video/opencontent/thinkbravely/Dean-Blount.htm|title=Dean Blount on Think Bravely – Kellogg School of Management – Northwestern University}}</ref> and subsequently announced a new Inspiring Growth campaign in 2014. This campaign is focused on the dual meaning of creating economic value while increasing self-knowledge and insight.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/press/2014/0914-brand-evolution.aspx|title=Kellogg School of Management Launches New Brand Strategy Focused on Inspiring Growth- Kellogg School of Management – Northwestern University}}</ref>

On February 6, 2012, Blount unveiled a seven-year plan, Envision Kellogg, aimed at restructuring the business school and launching Kellogg to the top of global rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://envisionkellogg.com/|title=envisionkellogg.com}}</ref> As of 2018, $365

==Campuses==
The Kellogg School's full-time and Executive MBA facilities are situated along the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]], on [[North Shore (Chicago)|Chicago's North Shore]], while the school's evening and weekend MBA program is housed on Northwestern's Downtown Chicago campus in Wieboldt Hall, between the law and medical schools. The downtown campus is also on Lake Michigan to the east and close to Michigan Avenue to the west. In January 2006, Kellogg opened a new campus for its EMBA program for Latin American executives in Miami.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miami EMBA – Monthly Program {{!}} Kellogg Executive MBA|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/executive-mba/locations-and-schedule/miami-monthly.aspx|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu|language=en}}</ref>

Students in the Kellogg full-time program take the majority of their classes at the Global Hub, which opened on March 28, 2017. This 415,000 square-foot building is located on the shores of Lake Michigan. Toronto-based Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects designed this building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/about/global-hub.aspx|title=Kellogg Opens Its Global Hub}}</ref> The Global Hub is built-out in four directions surrounding two atriums and numerous other commons areas.

Kellogg was the first business school in the world to insist that all applicants be interviewed to assess their leadership potential and suitability for the Kellogg School's cooperative environment.<ref name="Business-School Boom 2000, p. 1">"Mr. Business-School Boom; What Jacobs Wrought, in a Quarter-Century, at Kellogg," [[David Leonhardt]], ''The New York Times,'' May 3, 2000, Section C; p. 1; Column 2; Business/Financial Desk</ref> As a result, in addition to grades, GMAT scores, professional achievement, and demonstrated leadership, 'fit' is an important part of the admissions equation at Kellogg.<ref name="Business-School Boom 2000, p. 1" />

===Programs===
Kellogg offers full-time [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], Executive MBA, [[MMM Program|MMM]] (MBA + MSDI), JD-MBA, MBAi, evening and weekend MBA, and Master of Science in Management Studies programs, as well as Ph.D. programs in several fields, and non-degree executive education programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/all-programs.aspx|title=MBA Programs|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>

====Full-time MBA====
The regular full-time MBA program at Kellogg requires two years to complete. Kellogg accepts the [[Graduate Record Examination]] in addition to the GMAT from applicants.<ref name="GRE">{{cite news |last=Moules |first=Jonathan |date=14 May 2018 |title=The GMAT is no longer the only way into business school|work=Financial Times |location=United Kingdom }}</ref> Students may choose from seven majors including accounting, economics, finance, marketing, operations, strategy, and managing organizations. If a student does not elect a major "General Management" will appear on their transcript. In addition to majors, Kellogg offers "pathways" to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital & private equity.

====One-year MBA====
Kellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world. Program graduates include [[Robert Eckert]] '77, former chairman and CEO, [[Mattel]]; Richard Lenny '77, former chairman and CEO, the [[The Hershey Company|Hershey Company]]; and [[Thomas J. Wilson]] '80, chairman and CEO, [[Allstate]]. With the exception of the two-year MBA at [[London Business School]], European MBA's are one year, as at INSEAD in France, IMD in Switzerland, IE Business School in Madrid and Oxford's Saïd Business School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-ranking-2014|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times – FT.com}}</ref>

====Evening & Weekend MBA====
Kellogg offers an Evening & Weekend MBA (E&W MBA) program aimed towards students who continue to develop their careers as they pursue their MBA degree. Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.

====Executive MBA====
Kellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.

====MMM====
Graduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science]]. This seven-quarter program begins in the summer before the traditional fall start of a two-year program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two-Year MBA|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/two-year-mba-program.aspx|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu|language=en}}</ref>

====JD-MBA====
In cooperation with the Northwestern Pritzker School Law, Kellogg offers a program that leads to earning a JD and an MBA in just three years. Students spend their first year in law school where they study the standard curriculum. During the first summer and second-year, students study entirely at Kellogg. The second summer students choose to devote their time to either law or business entirely. During the final year, most classes are spent at the law school, but students may take some electives at the business school.<ref name="Law">{{cite web |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/jd-mba-program.aspx |title=JD-MBA Program |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Kellogg School of Management |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=14 May 2017}}</ref>

==== Ph.D. programs ====
Kellogg awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in 1927. Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management. The program is full-time on the Evanston campus. Students typically graduate in five years.

====Kellogg Asset Management Practicum====
Students declaring a finance major may choose to follow the asset management track, a special set of courses offered by the Kellogg finance department. At the core of the asset management track is a yearlong experiential learning course sequence, the Asset Management Practicum (FINC 933, 934, 935, and 936). In the practicum – a for-credit course with limited enrollment – students manage a portfolio under the guidance of faculty from the finance and accounting departments. Currently, the portfolio's value is more than $6.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/asset_management|title=Kellogg Asset Management Practicum }}</ref>

====Overseas exchange programs====
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}
In addition to the Kellogg School campuses in Evanston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami, the Kellogg School partners with institutions in Asia, Europe, South America, Australia, the Middle East, and Canada.

Kellogg students have the opportunity to study abroad in the fall or winter of their second year on six continents. The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.

Beginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.

The Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.

Kellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with—and grant Kellogg degrees to—these schools:

*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong

==Student life==
Students tend to be very active in impacting the local Evanston and Chicago communities, and frequently collaborate on philanthropic causes. One example combining the campus culture and passion for giving is the annual Charity Auction Ball, held each winter quarter.

Unlike many peer schools, Kellogg does disclose grades to recruiters. The issue of grade disclosure was last voted on by students in 2005, and a process exists whereby Kellogg students can vote to change the policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evaluating the Pros and Cons of Kellogg's Grade Disclosure Policy|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/student/ksa/site/KSA2010/docs_secure/Grade%20Disclosure%20Policy%20Evaluation.pdf|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu|language=en}}</ref>

Kellogg has an alumni network of over 60,000 graduates working in nearly every industry and endeavor. Alumni can participate in over 60 active regional alumni clubs and more than 20 special interest clubs. The Kellogg Alumni Council helps strengthen connections among alumni.

Current Kellogg students are encouraged to interact with alumni on a number of levels. Most recently, the evening & weekend MBA program introduced the Kellogg Alumni Mentorship Program (KAMP).
