== Career ==

=== The National ===
{{Main|The National (band)}}
Dessner and his twin brother Bryce were childhood friends with [[Bryan Devendorf]]. In 1998, after Dessner's earlier band, Project Nim, broke up, Devendorf invited the brothers to join his band [[The National (band)|The National]]. With Devendorf and the Dessner brothers were [[Scott Devendorf]], Bryan's older brother, and [[Matt Berninger]]. The band's self-titled first album was released in 2001 on Brassland Records, a label Dessner co-founded along with his brother Bryce and [[Alec Hanley Bemis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brassland.org/about|title=Brassland {{!}} About Us|website=brassland.org|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> The band's second album, ''[[Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers]]'', was released in 2003, also on Brassland.

After some critical success with ''Sad Songs'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brassland.org/releases/sad-songs-for-dirty-lovers|title=Brassland {{!}} Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers|website=brassland.org|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> the band signed with [[Beggars Banquet Records]]. With the new label, they released their third studio album, ''[[Alligator (The National album)|Alligator]]'', in 2005. The album received a positive response from critics,<ref>{{Citation|title=Alligator by The National|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/alligator/the-national|language=en|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/7710-the-top-200-albums-of-the-2000s-20-1/?page=2|title=The 200 Best Albums of the 2000s - Page 2|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> which exposed the band to a larger audience.

Following the success of ''Boxer'', the band began collaborating with other artists on various songs and compilation albums. In 2009, the band participated in ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'', a charity album to benefit the [[Red Hot Organization]]. That same year, they recorded a song for the album ''[[Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/76232/thom_yorke_michael_stipe_dinosaurs_contribute/news/|title=Thom Yorke, Michael Stipe, Dinosaur Contribute To Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs Of Mark Mulcahy|date=June 25, 2009|website=Stereogum|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> to help support [[Polaris (American band)|Polaris]] frontman [[Mark Mulcahy]] who had recently lost his wife.

In 2010, the band released ''[[High Violet]]'', their fifth full-length album. The album saw both critical and commercial success, debuting at No. 3 on US charts, and going on to sell over 850,000 copies worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1561451/the-national-stop-fighting-the-dad-rock-label-this-time-we-didnt-care|title=The National Stop Fighting the 'Dad Rock' Label: 'This Time, We Didn't Care'|last=Maloney|first=Devon|date=May 20, 2013|website=Billboard}}</ref>

The band followed up ''High Violet'' by releasing their sixth album, ''[[Trouble Will Find Me]]'', on May 21, 2013 via 4AD. Like their previous two efforts, ''Trouble'' was named to several year-end best-of lists. The album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] at the [[56th Grammy Awards]]. Later that year, Dessner and the rest of the band were featured in the documentary ''[[Mistaken for Strangers (film)|Mistaken for Strangers]]'', which followed the band's tour for ''High Violet'' and early recording of ''Trouble''.

In 2017, the band released ''[[Sleep Well Beast]]'', their seventh full-length album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/10/the-national-sleep-well-beast-review|title=The National: Sleep Well Beast review – a study in midlife angst|last=Empire|first=Kitty|date=September 10, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=February 6, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The lead single from the album, "[[The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness]]", became the band's first song to reach No. 1 on a ''Billboards'' chart after topping the [[Adult Alternative Songs]] list in August that same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7889813/the-national-first-number-1-billboard-songs-chart|title=The National Notches First No. 1 on a Billboard Songs Chart|website=Billboard|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>

Dessner has production credits on all of the band's albums since [[Alligator (The National album)|''Alligator'']]. The majority of both ''[[High Violet]]'' and ''[[Trouble Will Find Me]]'' were recorded in his garage studio behind his house in Brooklyn, and ''Alligator'' and ''Boxer'' were partially recorded in his attic and in his sister's attic, which is on the same street in Brooklyn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/aaron-dessner-mn0000044843/credits|title=Aaron Dessner - Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref> Most recently, he produced ''Sleep Well Beast'' and ''I Am Easy To Find'' in his upstate New York studio, Long Pond.

===Big Red Machine===
{{Main|Big Red Machine (band)}}
In 2008, Dessner sent [[Justin Vernon]] an instrumental sketch of a song called "Big Red Machine" for the compilation album ''Dark Was the Night''. At that point, the two had never met.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Vernon wrote a song to it, interpreting the Big Red Machine title as a heart. After 10 years, the pair formed a band called [[Big Red Machine (band)|Big Red Machine]], and on August 31, 2018, released a [[Big Red Machine (album)|self-titled album]]. The record was produced by Vernon and Dessner with longtime collaborator Brad Cook and engineered by Jonathan Low primarily at Dessner's studio Long Pond in Upper Hudson Valley, New York.

=== Other production work ===
Outside of his work with The National, Dessner has helped produce work for several other artists.

Dessner worked with singer [[Sharon Van Etten]] on her album, [[Tramp (album)|''Tramp'']] (2012). Van Etten and Dessner spent over fourteen months working in his studio, finally releasing the album to widespread critical success.

Dessner produced [[Local Natives]]' second full-length album [[Hummingbird (Local Natives album)|''Hummingbird'']], in 2013. Dessner was first introduced to the band while on tour with The National. ''Hummingbird'' received positive reviews, and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' praised Dessner's production work especially, saying that he "knows how to make things sound ''good'', and there's plenty of richness and depth to these songs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17537-hummingbird/|title=Local Natives: Hummingbird Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref>

In 2015, Dessner produced [[The Lone Bellow]]'s ''Then Came the Morning,'' which was recorded in Dessner's garage as well as in a 19th-century church in upstate New York. The album was released in January 2015 on Descendent Records. That same year, he worked with [[This Is the Kit|This Is The Kit]] for their album ''Bashed Out'', which was released through Dessner's Brassland Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/this-is-the-kit-bashed-out/|title=It’d be a pointless compartmentalising exercise to still call This Is The Kit a "folk" band|website=Thelineofbestfit.com|accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref>

In 2016, Dessner produced [[Lisa Hannigan]]'s album ''[[At Swim]]''. The album reached No. 1 in Ireland, No. 7 on the US [[Top Heatseekers Albums]] chart and No. 24 in the UK, and received widespread critical acclaim. ''[[The Guardian]]'', which awarded it four out of five stars, commented on the album's "stunningly pretty songs with quietly powerful undertones" and the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', which also awarded it four out of five stars, praised the "new-found accessibility" of the album. [[Frightened Rabbit]]'s fifth album ''[[Painting of a Panic Attack]]'', released in 2016 via [[Atlantic Records]], was also produced by Dessner.

Dessner produced The Lone Bellow's 2020 album ''[[Half Moon Light]]'' and co-wrote several tracks on it. He also co-wrote and produced the acclaimed debut of UK songwriter Eve Owen, ''Don't Let the Ink Dry'', released in 2020.

Also in 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Dessner was approached by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] to collaborate on music. This resulted in Dessner becoming the producer and co-writer of her eighth studio album, ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]''. The surprise release debuted to critical acclaim on July 24, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sodomsky|first=Sam|title=The National’s Aaron Dessner Talks Taylor Swift’s New Album folklore|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-nationals-aaron-dessner-talks-taylor-swifts-new-album-folklore/|access-date=July 25, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en-us}}</ref>

Additionally, Dessner produced ''[[Day of the Dead (2016 album)|Day of the Dead]]'', which was released in Spring 2016, and ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'', both of which are AIDS charity compilations for the Red Hot Organization; and [[Doveman]]'s 2009 release ''The Conformist''.

===Film scores===
Dessner and his brother Bryce co-composed the score for ''[[Transpecos (film)|Transpecos]]'', which won the Audience Award at the 2016 [[South by Southwest]]. They also worked together on the score for 2013 film ''[[Big Sur (film)|Big Sur]]'', an adaptation of the 1962 novel of the same name by [[Jack Kerouac]]. The film debuted on January 23, 2013 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it received positive reviews.

It was commissioned by Eaux Claires Festival and made its world premiere in 2015 where it served as the official starting point of the festival on both Friday and Saturday.

Forever Love marked a live performance reunion for the Dessner twins and Kjartansson, as both artists had previously collaborated on a six-hour video work, A Lot of Sorrow, which documents The National performing their three-song "Sorrow" for six hours in front of a live audience at [[MoMA PS1]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20511-a-lot-of-sorrow/|title=The National: A Lot of Sorrow|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>

On May 3, 2009, 4AD and Red Hot produced ''Dark Was the Night'' – Live, a concert celebrating the newest Red Hot album. The show took place at [[Radio City Music Hall]] and featured several of the artists that contributed to the compilation.

In May 2012 The National's performance of "Rains of Castamere" played during the closing credits of season two episode nine. Though the song is not an original, Dessner helped to interpret the instruments and music so that it evoked the land of Westeros.

In March 2012, Dessner, Scott Devendorf and Bryan Devendorf teamed up with Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir for a live webcast, which featured two musical sets and a political discussion. The event was produced by Head Count, a non-partisan organization that uses live music events to promote voter registration and awareness.

In December 2012, Dessner curated a day of Other Voices, an Irish music festival that aired live on RTÉ Two in Ireland. The performances took place in the Church of St James in Dingle, County Kerry.
