The '''chairperson''' (also '''chair''', '''chairman''', or '''chairwoman''') is the presiding officer of an organized group such as a [[Board of directors|board]], [[committee]], or [[deliberative assembly]]. The person holding the office, who is typically elected or appointed by members of the group, presides over meetings of the group, and conducts the group's business in an orderly fashion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 22|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref>

"Chairman" as a quasi-title gained particular resonance when socialist states from 1917 onward shunned more traditional [[leadership]] labels and stressed the collective control of ''soviets'' (councils or committees) by beginning to refer to executive figureheads as "Chairman of the X Committee".

}}

In addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the chairperson presides over meetings.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=449}}</ref> Such duties at meetings include:

* Calling the meeting to order
* Determining if a [[quorum]] is present
* Announcing the items on the [[order of business]] or [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] as they come up
*[[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|Recognition]] of members to have the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]]
* Enforcing the rules of the group
* Putting questions ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]]) to a vote, which is the usual way of resolving disagreements following discussion of the issues 
* Adjourning the meeting

While presiding, the chairperson should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=44}}: "The presiding officer must never interrupt a speaker simply because he knows more about the matter than the speaker does."</ref> In committees or small boards, the chairperson votes along with the other members; in assemblies or larger boards, the chairperson should vote only when it can affect the result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 1)|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher=The Robert's Rules Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|archive-date=2004-11-12|url-status=dead|access-date=2015-12-17}}</ref> At a meeting, the chairperson only has one vote (i.e. the chairperson cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the chairperson such authority).<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=406}}</ref>

=== Powers and authority ===
The powers of the chairperson vary widely across organizations. In some organizations they have the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions. In others they only make recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and or may have no executive powers, in which case they are mainly a [[spokesperson]] for the organization. The power given depends upon the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.

=== Disciplinary procedures ===
If the chairperson exceeds their authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform their duties, they may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher=The Robert's Rules Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archive-date=2004-11-12|url-status=dead|access-date=2015-12-24}}</ref> Usually, whoever appointed or elected the chairperson has the power to discipline them.

== Public corporations ==
There are three common types of chairperson in public corporations.

=== Chairperson and CEO{{Anchor|Chairperson and CEO}}===
The CEO may also hold the title of chairperson, in which case the board frequently names an independent member of the board as a lead director. This position is equivalent to the position of [[Président-directeur général (France)|président-directeur général]] in France.

=== Executive chairman ===
Executive chairman is an office separate from that of CEO, where the titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as [[Larry Ellison]] of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Douglas Flint]] of [[HSBC]] and [[Steve Case]] of AOL Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]). In particular, the group chair of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Before the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chair essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairperson oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html HSBC investors against Michael Geoghegan becoming chairman].

Telegraph. Retrieved on 2013-08-22.</ref>

=== Non-executive chairperson ===
Non-executive chairperson is also a separate post from the CEO, unlike an executive chairperson, a non-executive chair does not interfere in day-to-day company matters. Across the world, many companies have separated the roles of chairperson and CEO, saying that this move improves corporate governance. The non-executive chairperson's duties are typically limited to matters directly related to the board, such as:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hvs.com/Jump/?aid=1033|title=The Non-Executive Chairman Comes of Age|last=Kefgen|first=Keith|date=2004-05-11|work=HVS web site|access-date=2011-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027135952/http://www.hvs.com/Jump/?aid=1033|archive-date=27 October 2007|url-status=dead|publisher=HVS}}</ref>

* Chairing the meetings of the board.
* Organizing and coordinating the board's activities, such as by setting its annual agenda.
* Reviewing and evaluating the performance of the CEO and the other board members.

Many US companies have an executive chairperson; this method of organization is sometimes called the American model. Having a non-executive chairperson is common in the UK and Canada, and is sometimes called the British model. Expert opinion is rather evenly divided over which is the preferable model.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/jan2008/ca2008018_642807.htm |title=Splitting the Chairman and CEO roles |access-date=2011-04-03 |last=Behan |first=Beverly |date=10 January 2008 |work=BusinessWeek |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416101510/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/jan2008/ca2008018_642807.htm |archive-date=2011-04-16 }}</ref> There is a growing push by public market investors for companies with an executive chairperson to have a lead independent director to provide some element of an independent perspective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.governanceprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GovernancePrinciples_Principles.pdf|title=COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://isgframework.org/corporate-governance-principles|title=Corporate Governance Principles for US Listed Companies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202204319/https://www.isgframework.org/corporate-governance-principles/|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The role of the chairperson in a private equity-backed board differs from the role in non-profit or publicly listed organizations in several ways, including the pay, role and what makes an effective private-equity chairperson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nurole.com/news_and_guides/role-of-a-chair-in-private-equity|title=What is the role of a chair of the board in a private equity company?\|date=2018-05-04|website=www.nurole.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> Companies with both an executive chairperson and a CEO include [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://corporate.ford.com/company.html|title=About Us|date=2019|website=Ford Motor Company|publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511112107/http://blog.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=141|archive-date=2011-05-11|url-status=dead|access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref> [[HSBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership|title=Leadership|date=2019|publisher=[[HSBC]]|access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref> [[Alphabet Inc.]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abc.xyz/investor/other/board/#nominating-and-corporate-governance-committee|title=Board - Investor Relations|access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref> [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]],<ref>{{cite web|title=HP Investor Relations – Board of directors|url=http://h30261.www3.hp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71087&p=irol-govboard|publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]]|access-date=2011-09-24}}</ref> and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/leadership/|title=Apple Leadership|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=2014-11-06}}</ref>

== Vice-chairperson and deputy chairperson ==
A vice- or deputy chairperson, subordinate to the chairperson, is sometimes chosen to assist and to serve as chairperson in the latter's absence, or when a motion involving the chairperson is being discussed.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=452}}</ref> In the absence of the chairperson and vice-chairperson, groups sometimes elect a ''chairperson [[pro tempore]]'' to fill the role for a single meeting.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=453}}</ref> In some organizations that have both titles, deputy chairperson ranks higher than vice-chairperson, as there are often multiple vice-chairpersons but only a single deputy chairperson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbccm.com/about/cid-264063.html|title=Leadership|website=Rbccm.com|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> This type of deputy chairperson title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one (such as [[Ted Turner]] at Time Warner).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/news/a10201/ted-turner-quits-as-aoltw-vice-chairman.html|title=Ted Turner quits as AOLTW Vice Chairman – TV News|date=2003-01-29|publisher=Digital Spy|access-date=2011-12-31}}</ref>

An unrelated definition of vice- and deputy chairpersons describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than an [[Executive Vice President|executive vice-president]] (EVP). Sometimes, EVPs report to a vice-chairperson, who in turn reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) (so vice-chairpersons in effect constitute an additional layer of management), while other vice-chairpersons have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with EVPs. Executives with the title vice-chairperson and deputy chairperson are usually ''not'' members of the board of directors.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}<!--making invisible until the titles are checked: The [[Royal Bank of Canada]] previously used "deputy chair" (i.e. [[Anthony S. Fell]], deputy chairperson of RBC, who was also chairperson and CEO of RBC Dominion Securities) and "vice-chair" (i.e. Peter Currie, vice chairperson and Chief Financial Officer) in their inner management circle until 2004.-->
