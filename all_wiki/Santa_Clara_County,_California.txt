==Etymology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}[[File:USA-San Jose-70 West Hedding Street-East Wing-2.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Clara County Government Center in Central [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].]]

Santa Clara County is named for [[Mission Santa Clara de Asis|Mission Santa Clara]], which was established in 1777 and was in turn named for [[Clare of Assisi|Saint Clare of Assisi]].

==History==
{{main|History of Santa Clara County, California}}
Santa Clara County was one of the original counties of California, formed in 1850 at the time of statehood. The original inhabitants included the [[Ohlone]], residing on [[Coyote Creek (Santa Clara County)|Coyote Creek]] and [[Calaveras Creek (California)|Calaveras Creek]]. Part of the county's territory was given to [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] in 1853.

In 1882, Santa Clara County tried to levy taxes upon property of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] within county boundaries.  The result was the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'', [[Case citation|118 U.S. 394]] (1886), in which the Court extended Due Process rights to [[Juristic person|artificial legal entities]].

In the early 20th Century, the area was promoted as the "Valley of the Heart's Delight" due to its natural beauty, including a significant number of orchards.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyULAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA918 |page=918 |title=Automobiles: Good Roads |work=Sunset |volume=32 |year=1914}}</ref>

The first major technology company to be based in the area was [[Hewlett-Packard]], founded in a garage in Palo Alto in 1939. [[IBM]] selected San Jose as its West Coast headquarters in 1943. [[Varian Associates]], [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], and other early innovators were located in the county by the late 1940s and 1950s. The U.S. Navy had a large presence in the area and began giving large contracts to Silicon Valley electronics companies.  The term "[[Silicon Valley]]" was coined in 1971. The trend accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s, and agriculture has since then been nearly eliminated from the northern part of the county. Today, Santa Clara County is the headquarters for approximately 6500 high technology companies, including many of the largest tech companies in the world, among them hardware manufacturers [[AMD]], [[Cisco Systems]] and [[Intel]], computer and consumer electronics companies [[Apple Inc.]] and Hewlett-Packard, and internet companies [[eBay]], [[Google]], and [[Yahoo!]]. Most of what is considered to be Silicon Valley is located within the county, although some adjoining tech regions in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]] (e.g., [[Facebook]]), [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]], and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] counties are also considered part of Silicon Valley. <!--This needs a source citation!: In 2000, Santa Clara county sheriff Laurie Smith was elected as the first female sheriff in California history.-->

==Geography==
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1304|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1290|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|14|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=October 4, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>

Counties which border with Santa Clara County are, clockwise, [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]] (within a few hundred feet at [[Mount Boardman]]), [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus]], [[Merced County, California|Merced]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]], and [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]]. Santa Clara County formerly shared borders with [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]], [[Mariposa County, California|Mariposa]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], and [[Tuolumne County, California|Tuolumne]] counties until 1853, 1874, and 1854 respectively (Monterey County currently comes within a few miles of Santa Clara).

The [[San Andreas Fault]] runs along the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] in the
south and west of the county.

Both [[tule elk]] (''Cervus canadensis nannodes'') and [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana'') were historically native to Santa Clara County. In June 1776, Lieutenant Commander Don [[José Joaquín Moraga]] led a group of soldiers and colonists from the Presidio of Monterey to establish [[Mission San Francisco de Asis]] and encountered both tule elk and pronghorn, and clearly distinguished these two species from deer.<ref name=DaneandPalou>{{cite journal |title= The Founding of the Presidio and Mission of Our Father Saint Francis |authors=George Ezra Dane and Francisco Palóu |journal=California Historical Quarterly |date=June 1, 1935 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=102–110 |doi=10.2307/25160571 |jstor=25160571 }}</ref> The deer in California being [[California mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus'').

Regarding elk, Moraga wrote: “In the great plain called San Bernardino (the [[Santa Clara Valley]] which stretches from south San Jose to [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]]), while the expedition was strung out at length, we descried in the distance a herd of large animals that looked like cattle, but we could not imagine where they belonged or from whence they had come...with horns similar in shape to those of the deer, but so large that they measured sixteen palms from tip to tip.” Upon measurement, Morago reported the elk horns as four varas [11 feet] across… “These animals [elk] are called ''ciervos'' in order to differentiate them from the ordinary Spanish variety of deer, here called ''venados'', which also exist in abundance and of large size in the vicinity.”<ref name=DaneandPalou/>

Regarding pronghorn, Moraga reported: “In the said plains of San Bernardino (Santa Clara Valley)…there is another species of deer about the size of three-year-old sheep. They are similar in appearance to the deer, except that they have short horns and also short legs like the sheep. They live in the plains where they go in herds of 100, 200, or more. They run all together over the plains so fast that they seem to fly…These animals are called ''berrendos'' and there are many of them also in the southern Missions wherever the country is level.”<ref name=DaneandPalou/> 

[[Herbert Eugene Bolton]] also wrote of elk reports from another Spanish expedition, from the [[De Anza Expedition]] on March 23, 1776: " In Gilroy Valley (Santa Clara Valley) Moraga 's larder was replenished by three elks which the men killed without leaving the road." <ref>{{cite book |title=Anza's California Expeditions Volume I. An Outpost of Empire.  |author=Herbert Eugene Bolton |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1930 |page=393}}</ref>

In 1978, [[California Department of Fish and Game]] warden Henry Coletto urged the department to choose the [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] area as one of California's relocation sites under a new statewide effort to restore tule elk. While other ranchers refused, tech pioneers [[Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] allowed Coletto and state biologists to translocate the initial 32 tule elk from the [[Owens Valley]] in the eastern [[Sierra Nevada (California)|Sierra]] onto the {{Convert|28,000|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Rancho Cañada de San Felipe y Las Animas|San Felipe Ranch]], which the families jointly own, in the hills east of [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Restoration of tule elk - California success story |publisher=Billings Gazette |date=December 6, 2006 |url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/features/article_7ffb810d-45cc-5305-9ee9-cf4f069fd9b4.html |accessdate=January 27, 2013 }}</ref> From the three original 1978–1981 translocations (totaling 65 animals) to the Mount Hamilton region of the [[Diablo Range]], there are multiple herds in different locations including the Isabel Valley, [[San Antonio Valley, California|San Antonio Valley]], Livermore area, San Felipe Ranch, Metcalf Canyon, [[Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve|Coyote Ridge]], [[Anderson Lake (California)|Anderson Lake]], and surrounding areas such as the [[Sunol, California|Sunol]] and [[Cottonwood Creek (San Luis Creek tributary)|Cottonwood Creek]] (near [[San Luis Reservoir]] in western [[Merced County, California]]) herds.<ref name=ElkBack>{{cite news |title=The elk are coming back- even to San Jose | author=Lisa M.

==Economy==
The county's economy is heavily service based.  Technology, both hardware and software, dominates the service sector by value, but like any other county, Santa Clara has its share of retail and office support workers.

The San Jose/Sunnyvale/Santa Clara metropolitan region, comprising Santa Clara County and San Benito County, was ranked as the highest performing metropolitan area in the US in 2012, ahead of [[Austin, Texas]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], according to the [[Milken Institute]].<ref>[http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_22389575/silicon-valley-economy-ranked-best-performing-san-jose-tech "Santa Clara County economy ranked best performing", ''San Jose Mercury News'', January 17, 2013]</ref>  The GDP of the metro area reached $176.7 billion in 2011, or $94,587 per capita,<ref>http://bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/2013/pdf/gdp_metro0213.pdf</ref> roughly on par with [[Qatar]] in both total GDP and per capita (nominal).<ref>http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/dnltransfer.asp?fID=2</ref> GDP grew a strong 7.7% in 2011, and in contrast with most of California, GDP and per capita GDP (nominal) is well above 2007 (financial crisis) levels.  Despite relative wealth vis a vis other regions nationally, a large underclass exists whose income is roughly equivalent to that elsewhere in the country, despite extreme land prices.  The surge in metro GDP is highly correlated with home prices, which for average single-family homes passed $1 million ($1,017,528) in August 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2013/09/09/5191927/home-prices-in-santa-clara-county.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911174126/http://www.heraldonline.com/2013/09/09/5191927/home-prices-in-santa-clara-county.html |archive-date=September 11, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Buses====
Santa Clara County has consolidated its transportation services into the [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]], which operates a bus system.

====Bicycle network====
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority is establishing a bicycle network throughout the county. Santa Clara County Bicycle network is part of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] [[Bicycle transportation planning in the San Francisco Bay Area|Regional Bikeway Network]].

====Freeways and expressways====
The county has an extensive [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]] system and a separate expressway system (though it's not as extensive as those in [[Southern California freeways|Southern California]]). [[Limited-access road|Expressway]]s in California are distinct from freeways; although access to adjoining properties is eliminated, at-grade intersections are allowed.  However, unlike expressways virtually everywhere else in California, the Santa Clara County expressways were built, signed, and maintained as county roads; they are not maintained by [[Caltrans]], although they are patrolled by the [[California Highway Patrol]].

There is also a large [[street]] network dominated by four- and six-lane arterials.  Some of the newer boulevards (primarily in the West Valley) are divided with landscaped medians.
