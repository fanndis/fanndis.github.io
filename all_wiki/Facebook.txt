}}'''Facebook''' (stylized as '''{{Not a typo|facebook}}''') is an [[United States|American]] online [[social media]] and [[social networking service]] based in [[Menlo Park, California]], and a flagship service of the namesake company [[Facebook, Inc.]] It was founded by [[Mark Zuckerberg]], along with fellow [[Harvard College]] students and roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]], and [[Chris Hughes]].

The founders of Facebook initially limited membership to Harvard students. Membership was expanded to [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] before being expanded to the rest of the [[Ivy League]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston|higher education institutions in the Boston area]], then various other universities, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name comes from the [[face book]] directories often given to American university students.

Facebook can be accessed from devices with [[Internet]] connectivity, such as [[personal computer]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]] and [[smartphone]]s. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their [[Friending and following|"friend"]], or, with a different [[Privacy settings|privacy setting]], with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook claimed that it had more than 2.3&nbsp;billion monthly active users as of December 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-has-2-billion-plus-users-after-15-years-2019-2|title=In 15 years Facebook has amassed 2.3 billion users — more than followers of Christianity|first=Meira|last=Gebel|website=Business Insider}}</ref> and it was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s globally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2019/12/16/apps-and-games-of-the-decade/|title=These were the most-downloaded apps and games of the decade|last=Miller|first=Chance|date=December 17, 2019|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=December 17, 2019}}</ref>

Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending [[Harvard University]]. The site was comparable to [[Hot or Not]] and used "photos compiled from the online [[face book]]s of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".<ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash">{{cite web|first=Katharine A.|last=Kaplan|title=Facemash Creator Survives Ad Board|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/|website=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|date=November 19, 2003|access-date=June 24, 2017}}</ref> Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.<ref name="Fast Company on Zuckerberg">{{cite web|first=Ellen|last=McGirt|title=Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg: Hacker.

Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating [[copyright]]s and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.<ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash" /> Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an [[art history]] final exam. He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was accompanied by a comments section, then shared the site with his classmates.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Kincaid|title=Startup School: An Interview With Mark Zuckerberg|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/24/startup-school-an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg/|website=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=October 24, 2009|access-date=June 24, 2017}}</ref>

Facebook used a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).<ref name="high scalability">{{cite web|url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html|title=Facebook's New Real-time Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day|publisher=Highscalability.com|date=March 22, 2011|access-date=December 26, 2012}}</ref>

Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].<ref name="high scalability" />

Data is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.<ref name="high scalability" />

===User growth and decline===
Facebook's rapid growth began as soon as it became available and continued through 2018, before beginning to decline.

Facebook passed 100&nbsp;million registered users in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|first=Stan|last=Schroeder|title=Facebook's 100 Million Users: How Much are They Worth?|url=http://mashable.com/2008/08/26/facebook-100-million-users/|website=[[Mashable]]|date=August 26, 2008|access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref> and 500&nbsp;million in July 2010.<ref name="500 million">{{cite web|first=Robin|last=Wauters|title=Zuckerberg Makes It Official: Facebook Hits 500 Million Members|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/21/facebook-500-million/|website=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=July 21, 2010|access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref> According to the company's data at the July 2010 announcement, half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150&nbsp;million users accessed the site by mobile.<ref name="Quiet revolution">{{cite web|first1=Charles|last1=Arthur|first2=Jemima|last2=Kiss|title=Facebook reaches 500 million users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/21/facebook-500-million-users|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=July 21, 2010|access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

In November 2015, after skepticism about the accuracy of its "monthly active users" measurement, Facebook changed its definition to a logged-in member who visits the Facebook site through the web browser or mobile app, or uses the [[Facebook Messenger]] app, in the 30 day period prior to the measurement. This excluded the use of third-party services with Facebook integration, which was previously counted.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Cohen|title=Facebook Changes Definition of Monthly Active Users|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/monthly-active-users-definition-revised/|website=[[Adweek]]|publisher=Beringer Capital|date=November 6, 2015|access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref>

It is thought the records were amassed using a tool that Facebook disabled in April 2018 after the [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal|Cambridge Analytica]] controversy.

====Shadow profiles====
A "shadow profile" refers to the data Facebook collects about individuals without their explicit permission. For example, the [[Facebook like button#Tracking|"like" button]] that appears [[Facebook like button#Tracking|on third-party websites]] allows the company to collect information about an individual's internet browsing habits, even if the individual is not a Facebook user.<ref name="verge shadow profiles">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy|title=Shadow profiles are the biggest flaw in Facebook's privacy defense|last=Brandom|first=Russell|date=April 11, 2018|website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=June 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Facebook can have your data even if you're not on Facebook|work=USA TODAY|access-date=April 13, 2018|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/04/13/how-facebook-can-have-your-data-even-if-youre-not-facebook/512674002/}}</ref> Data can also be collected by other users. For example, a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site, allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and non-users alike.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691|title=How Facebook Figures Out Everyone You've Ever Met|last=Hill|first=Kashmir|date=November 7, 2017|website=[[Gizmodo]]|access-date=June 28, 2019}}</ref> Over time, countless data points about an individual are collected; any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual, but together allows the company to form a unique "profile."

This practice has been criticized by those who believe people should be able to opt-out of involuntary data collection. Additionally, while Facebook users have the ability to download and inspect the data they provide to the site, data from the user's "shadow profile" is not included, and non-users of Facebook do not have access to this tool regardless. The company has also been unclear whether or not it is possible for a person to revoke Facebook's access to their "shadow profile."<ref name="verge shadow profiles"/>

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story. After publication, Facebook claimed that it had been "lied to". On March 23, 2018, The [[High Court of Justice|English High Court]] granted an application by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] for a warrant to search [[Cambridge Analytica]]'s London offices, ending a standoff between Facebook and the Information Commissioner over responsibility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/uk-high-court-grants-cambridge-analytica-search-warrant-to-ico.html|title=UK High Court grants Cambridge Analytica search warrant to ICO|last=CNBC|date=March 23, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=March 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323222219/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/uk-high-court-grants-cambridge-analytica-search-warrant-to-ico.html|archive-date=March 23, 2018|url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{quote|You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014. This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.

We've already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we're limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook.

We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.

Finally, we'll remind you which apps you've given access to your information – so you can shut off the ones you don't want anymore.

Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.}}

In March 2019, Facebook confirmed a password compromise of millions of Facebook lite application users, however in April the company further stated that it was not just limited to Facebook but had also affected millions of Instagram users.

Facebook relies on its users to generate the content that bonds its users to the service.

Vaidhyanathan (2018) ''Antisocial Media''<ref>{{cite Q|Q56027099}}</ref> claims that there's no evidence that Cambridge Analytica and similar companies have delivered anything of value to anyone who has paid them, but Facebook is "growing on every continent.

Facebook is working directly with campaigns — many of which support authoritarian and nationalist candidates. You don’t need Cambridge Analytica if you have Facebook. The impact of Facebook on democracy is corrosive. ... A campaign like Trump’s can issue small, cheap advertisements via platforms like Facebook and Instagram that disappear after a day or get locked forever in Facebook’s servers.

But it’s the real story."<ref>p. 195-196 of 276 and chapter 6.

===Economy===
Economists have noted that Facebook offers many non-rivalrous services that benefit as many users as are interested without forcing users to compete with each other. By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users. E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone. Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139060011.003|chapter=The Economics of Internet Markets|title=Advances in Economics and Econometrics|pages=48–75|year=2013|last=Levin|first=Jonathan|s2cid=37187854|isbn=978-1-139-06001-1 |url=http://www-siepr.stanford.edu/repec/sip/10-018.pdf|editor1-last=Acemoglu|editor1-first=Daron|editor2-last=Arellano|editor2-first=Manuel|editor3-last=Dekel|editor3-first=Eddie}}</ref>

Facebook provides a development platform for many [[social-network game|social gaming]], communication, feedback, review, and other applications related to online activities.
