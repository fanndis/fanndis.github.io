{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}

The '''Crown dependencies''' ({{lang-fr|Dépendances de la Couronne}}; {{lang-gv|Croghaneyn-crooin}}) are three island territories off the coast of [[Great Britain]] that are self-governing possessions of [[The Crown]]: the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. They do not form part of either the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[British Overseas Territories]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5604.htm |title=Crown Dependencies – Justice Committee |website=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="Briefing2">{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/about/moj/our-responsibilities/Background_Briefing_on_the_Crown_Dependencies2.pdf |title=Background briefing on the Crown dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man |website=[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> Internationally, the dependencies are considered "territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible", rather than [[sovereign state]]s.<ref name="International recognition">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/361537/crown-dependencies.pdf |title=Fact sheet on the UK's relationship with the Crown Dependencies |website=Ministry of Justice |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> As a result, they are not member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="justice.gov.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/moj/2010/gov-response-justice-select-committee-crowndependencies.pdf |title=Government Response to the Justice Select Committee's report: Crown Dependencies |date=November 2010 |website=Ministry of Justice |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> However, they do have relationships with the Commonwealth, the [[European Union]], and other international organisations, and are members of the [[British–Irish Council]].

The Isle of Man (along with the United Kingdom) is within the [[European Union value added tax#EU VAT area|EU VAT area]].

As the Crown dependencies are not sovereign states, the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with the government of the United Kingdom (though this is rarely done without the consent of the dependencies, and the right to do so is disputed). However, they each have their own legislative assembly, with the power to legislate on many local matters with the assent of the Crown ([[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], or in the case of the Isle of Man in certain circumstances the [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|lieutenant-governor]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/ChiefMinister/International+Relations/Profile+of+Jersey.htm |title=Profile of Jersey |website=[[States of Jersey]] |accessdate=31 July 2008 |quote=The legislature passes primary legislation, which requires approval by The Queen in Council, and enacts subordinate legislation in many areas without any requirement for Royal Sanction and under powers conferred by primary legislation. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902092534/http://www.gov.je/ChiefMinister/International%2BRelations/Profile%2Bof%2BJersey.htm |archivedate=2 September 2006 }}</ref> In each case, the [[head of government]] is called the [[Chief Minister]].

== Definition ==
"The Crown" is defined differently in each Crown Dependency.

==Channel Islands: Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey==
{{Main|Channel Islands}}

[[File:Wyspy Normandzkie.png|thumb|right|The [[Channel Islands]] located in the [[English Channel]]]]

Since 1290,<ref>{{cite book |last=Mollet |first=Ralph |title=A Chronology of Jersey |year=1954 |publisher=[[Société Jersiaise]] |location=Jersey}}</ref> the Channel Islands have been governed as:

* the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], comprising the islands of [[Alderney]], [[Brecqhou]], [[Guernsey]], [[Herm]], [[Jethou]], [[Lihou]], and [[Sark]];
* the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]], comprising the island of [[Jersey]] and uninhabited islets such as the [[Écréhous]] and [[Minquiers]].

Each Bailiwick is a Crown dependency and each is headed by a Bailiff, with a Lieutenant Governor representing the Crown in each Bailiwick. Each Bailiwick has its own legal and healthcare systems, and its own separate immigration policies, with "local status" in one Bailiwick having no jurisdiction in the other. The two Bailiwicks exercise bilateral [[tax treaty|double taxation treaties]]. Since 1961, the Bailiwicks have had separate courts of [[appeal]], but generally the Bailiff of each Bailiwick has been appointed to serve on the panel of appellate judges for the other Bailiwick.

===Bailiwick of Guernsey===
{{Main|Bailiwick of Guernsey}}
{{See also|List of islands of the Bailiwick of Guernsey}}

The Bailiwick of Guernsey comprises three separate jurisdictions:

* [[Alderney]], including smaller surrounding uninhabited islands.
* [[Guernsey]], which includes also the nearby islands of Herm and Jethou, and other smaller uninhabited islands.
* [[Sark]], which also includes the nearby island of Brecqhou, and other smaller uninhabited islands.

[[File:Brecqhou from the air.JPG|thumb|[[Brecqhou]] island]]

The parliament of Guernsey is the [[States of Guernsey#States of Deliberation|States of Deliberation]], the parliament of Sark is called the [[Sark#Chief Pleas|Chief Pleas]], and the parliament of Alderney is called the [[States of Alderney]]. The three parliaments together can also approve joint Bailiwick-wide legislation that applies in those parts of the Bailiwick whose parliaments approve it.

Guernsey issues its own [[coin]]s and [[banknote]]s:

*[[Guernsey pound|Guernsey banknotes]]
*[[Coins of the Guernsey pound]]

These circulate freely in both Bailiwicks alongside [[Pound sterling|UK coinage]] and [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|English and Scottish banknotes]]. They are not [[Pound sterling#Legal tender and regional issues|legal tender]] within the UK.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leach |first=Robert |year=2011 |page=3 |url=http://robertleach.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Quick-guide-to-legal-tender-2.pdf |title=A Quick Guide to Legal Tender |website=robertleach.co.uk |accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>

There are no [[political party|political parties]] in any of the parliaments; candidates stand for election as [[independent (politics)|independents]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gk.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Guernsey |website=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref>

Guernsey has its own separate [[list of international license plate codes|international vehicle registration]]s (GBG – Guernsey, GBA – Alderney), [[List of Internet TLDs|internet domain]] ([[.gg]] – Guernsey), and [[ISO 3166-2]] codes, first reserved on behalf of the [[Universal Postal Union]] (GGY – Guernsey) and then added officially by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] on 29 March 2006. In any case the GBG on a numberplate is only put on the number plate of a car or motorbike at the request of the vehicle owner and is not compulsory, however a motorbike/scooter can have an identical number to a car, e.g. 5432 on 2 wheels and on 4 wheels.

[[File:Aerial view of fields in St Clement, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Saint Clement, Jersey]]]]

The [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]] consists of the island of Jersey and a number of surrounding uninhabited islands.

The parliament is the [[States Assembly]], the first known mention of which is in a document of 1497.<ref>{{cite book |title=Balleine's History of Jersey |first1=G.

Jersey issues its own coins and banknotes:

*[[Jersey pound|Jersey banknotes]]
*[[Coins of the Jersey pound]]

These circulate freely in both Bailiwicks alongside UK coinage and English and Scottish banknotes. They are not [[legal tender]] within the UK but are legal currency backed by deposits at the Bank of England.

There are a few [[political party|political parties]], as candidates generally stand for election as independents (but see ''[[List of political parties in Jersey]]'').

Jersey has its own separate [[List of international license plate codes|international vehicle registration]] (GBJ – Jersey), [[List of Internet TLDs|internet domain]] ([[.je]] – Jersey), and [[ISO 3166-2]] codes, first reserved on behalf of the [[Universal Postal Union]] (JEY – Jersey) and then added officially by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] on 29 March 2006.

==Isle of Man==
[[File:The Isle of Man.svg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Isle of Man]] located in the [[Irish Sea]]]]
{{Main|Isle of Man}}
{{see also|Politics of the Isle of Man|History of the Isle of Man|Noble and royal titles of the Isle of Man}}

The Isle of Man's [[Tynwald]] claims to be the world's oldest [[parliament]] in continuous existence, dating back to 979. (However, it does not claim to be the oldest parliament, as [[Iceland]]'s [[Althing]] dates back to 930.) It consists of a popularly elected ''[[House of Keys]]'' and an indirectly elected ''[[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]]'', which may sit separately or jointly to consider pieces of legislation, which, when passed into law, are known as "[[Act of Tynwald|Acts of Tynwald]]". Candidates mostly stand for election to the Keys as independents, rather than being selected by [[political parties]]. There is a Council of Ministers headed by a [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man|Chief Minister]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/government/council/council.xml |title=The Council of Ministers |website=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=29 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429122350/http://www.gov.im/government/council/council.xml |archivedate=29 April 2013}}</ref>

The Isle of Man issues its own coins and banknotes:
*[[Manx pound|Manx banknotes]]
*[[Coins of the Manx pound]]

These circulate freely on the island alongside British coinage (as well as coinage from the Channel Islands and Gibraltar) and English, Northern Irish and Scottish banknotes.

The Isle of Man, unlike the other Crown dependencies, has a [[Common Purse Agreement]] with the United Kingdom.

[[Isle of Man Post]] issues its own stamps and derives significant revenue from the sale of special issues to collectors.

The Isle of Man has its own separate [[List of international license plate codes|international vehicle registration]] (GBM – Isle of Man), [[List of Internet TLDs|internet domain]] ([[.im]] – Isle of Man), and [[ISO 3166-2]] codes, first reserved on behalf of the [[Universal Postal Union]] (IMN – Isle of Man) and then added officially by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] on 29 March 2006. In addition, since 2008 the Isle of Man has used the [[aircraft registration]] M-.

==Relationship with the British Crown==

In each Crown dependency, the monarch is represented by a [[Lieutenant Governor]], but this post is largely ceremonial. Since 2010 the Lieutenant Governors of each Crown dependency have been recommended to the Crown by a panel in each respective Crown dependency; this replaced the previous system of the appointments being made by the Crown on the recommendation of UK ministers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/07/06/105000-%E2%80%93-the-tax-free-reward-for-being-a-royal-rep/ |title=£105,000 – the tax-free reward for being a royal rep |website=This Is Jersey |date=6 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816020322/http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/07/06/105000-%E2%80%93-the-tax-free-reward-for-being-a-royal-rep/ |archivedate=16 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/2010/07/03/guernsey-will-choose-its-next-lt-governor/ |title=Guernsey will choose its next Lt-Governor |first=Thom |last=Ogier |date=3 July 2010 |website=This Is Guernsey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813220348/http://www.thisisguernsey.com/2010/07/03/guernsey-will-choose-its-next-lt-governor/ |archivedate=13 August 2011}}</ref> In 2005, it was decided in the Isle of Man to replace the Lieutenant Governor with a [[Crown Commissioner]], but this decision was reversed before it was implemented.

All "insular" legislation has to receive the approval of the "Queen in Council", in effect, the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20AttorneyGeneralTranscript%2020100329%20WM%20v1.pdf |title=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers |date=29 March 2010 |website=States of Jersey |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> Certain types of domestic legislation in the Isle of Man, however, may be signed into law by the Lieutenant Governor, using delegated powers, without having to pass through the Privy Council. In Jersey, provisional legislation of an administrative nature may be adopted by means of ''triennial regulations'' (renewable after three years), without requiring the assent of the Privy Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/Oct97/the_sources_of_jersey_Law.aspx |first=Richard |last=Southwell |title=The Sources of Jersey Law |date=October 1997 |website=Jersey Legal Information Board |accessdate=31 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331184657/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/Oct97/the_sources_of_jersey_Law.aspx |archivedate=31 March 2012}}</ref> Much legislation, in practice, is effected by means of [[secondary legislation]] under the authority of prior laws or Orders in Council.

===Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey===
[[File:La Reine Notre Duc 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|"La Reine, Notre Duc" (The Queen, Our Duke): title of a Diamond Jubilee exhibition at the Jersey Arts Centre in 2012]]
The Channel Islands are part of the territory annexed by the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in 933 from the [[Duchy of Brittany]]. This territory was added to the grant of land given in settlement by the King of France in 911 to the Viking raiders who had sailed up the Seine almost to the walls of Paris.

[[William the Conqueror]], Duke of Normandy, claimed the title [[King of England]] in 1066, following the death of [[Edward the Confessor]], and secured the claim through the [[Norman conquest of England]].

Subsequent marriages between Kings of England and French nobles meant that Kings of England had title to more French lands than the King of France. When the King of France asserted his feudal right of [[Jus patronatus|patronage]], the then-King of England, King [[John of England|John]], fearing he would be imprisoned should he attend, failed to fulfil his obligation.

In 1204 the title and lands of the Duchy of [[Normandy]] and his other French possessions were stripped from King [[John of England]] by the King of France. The Channel Islands remained in the possession of the King of England, who ruled them as Duke of Normandy until the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1259.

John's son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], renounced the title of Duke of Normandy by that treaty, and none of his successors ever revived it.  The Channel Islands continued to be governed by the Kings of England as French fiefs, distinct from Normandy, until the [[Hundred Years' War]], during which they were definitively separated from France.

At no time did the Channel Islands form part of the Kingdom of England, and they remained legally separate, though under the same monarch, through the subsequent unions of England with Wales (1536), Scotland (1707) and Ireland (1801). [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] reigns over the Channel Islands directly, and not by virtue of her role as monarch of the United Kingdom.  No specific title is associated with her role as monarch of the Channel Islands, however; she is popularly referred to (even on a Buckingham Palace website) as "Duke of Normandy"<ref name=page2601>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page2601.asp |title=Royal Insight |date=October 2003 |accessdate=23 July 2008 |website=The official website of the British Monarchy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215075152/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page2601.asp |archivedate=15 December 2008}}</ref> (not "Duchess")<ref name=page5744>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5744.asp |title=Royal Insight |date=January 2007 |accessdate=23 July 2008 |website=The official website of the British Monarchy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215075157/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5744.asp |archivedate=15 December 2008}}</ref> but this anachronistic title has no basis in law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/publications/jerseylawreview/June99/le_rouai.aspx |first=Paul |last=Matthews |title=Lé Rouai, Nouot' Duc |website=Jersey Legal Information Board |date=June 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003100557/http://www.jerseylaw.je/publications/jerseylawreview/June99/le_rouai.aspx |archivedate=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalstyle_uk.htm#Normandy |title=Royal Styles and Titles in England and Great Britain: Duke of Normandy |first=François R. |last=Velde |website=Heraldica |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> The monarch has been described, in Jersey, as the "Queen in right of Jersey",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Deputy%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504WM%20v1.pdf |title=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers |date=4 May 2010 |website=States of Jersey |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> and in legislation as the "Sovereign of the Bailiwick of Jersey" and "Sovereign in right of the Bailiwick of Jersey".<ref>{{cite web |title=Succession to the Crown (Jersey) Law |year=2013 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce\htm\LawFiles13%2fL-14-2013.htm |website=Jersey Legal Information Board |accessdate=24 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114173940/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2013%2FL-14-2013.htm |archivedate=14 January 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A unique constitutional position has arisen as successive monarchs have confirmed the [[Royal charters applying to the Channel Islands|liberties and privileges of the Bailiwicks]], often referring to the so-called ''Constitutions of King John'', a legendary document supposed to have been granted by King John in the aftermath of 1204. Governments of the Bailiwicks have generally tried to avoid testing the limits of the unwritten constitution by avoiding conflict with British governments.

Following the restoration of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], who had spent part of his exile in Jersey, the Channel Islands were given the right to set their own customs duties, referred to by the [[Jersey Legal French]] term as ''impôts''.

===Isle of Man===
In the [[Isle of Man]] the British monarch is [[Lord of Mann]], a title variously held by [[Norsemen|Norse]], [[Scotland|Scottish]] and English kings and nobles (the English nobles in [[feudality]] to the English Crown) until it was revested into the British monarchy in 1765. The title "Lord" is today used irrespective of the gender of the person who holds it.

==Relationship with the UK==
Crown dependencies have the international status of "territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible" rather than sovereign states.<ref name="International recognition"/> The relationship between the Crown dependencies and the UK is "one of mutual respect and support, i.e. a partnership".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/56we21.htm |title=Crown Dependencies – Justice Committee: Memorandum submitted by the Policy Council of the States of Guernsey |date=October 2009 |website=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>

Until 2001, responsibility for the UK government's relationships with the Crown dependencies rested with the [[Home Office]], but it was then transferred first to the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]], then to the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], and finally to the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]. In 2010 the Ministry of Justice stated that relationships with the Crown dependencies are the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government as a whole, with the Ministry of Justice holding responsibility for the constitutional relationship and other ministries engaging with their opposite numbers in the Crown dependencies according to their respective policy areas.<ref name="justice.gov.uk"/>

The British Government is solely responsible for defence and international representation<ref name="Briefing2"/> (although, in accordance with 2007 framework agreements,<ref name="FramewJersey">{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20InternationalIdentityFramework%2020070502.pdf |title=Framework for developing the international identity of Jersey |date=1 May 2007 |website=States of Jersey |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> the UK has elected not to act internationally on behalf of the Crown dependencies without prior consultation). The Crown dependencies are within the [[Common Travel Area]] and apply the same [[visa policy of the United Kingdom|visa policy]] as the United Kingdom, but each Crown dependency has responsibility for its own customs and immigration services.

Acts of the [[British Parliament]] do not usually apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, unless explicitly stated. UK legislation does not ordinarily extend to them without their consent.<ref name="justice.gov.uk"/> For a UK Act to extend otherwise than by an [[Order in Council]] is now very unusual.<ref name="Briefing2"/> When deemed advisable, Acts of Parliament may be extended to the islands by means of an Order in Council (thus giving the UK Government some responsibility for [[good governance]] in the islands). An example of this was the [[Television Act 1954]], which was extended to the Channel Islands, so as to create a local [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise, known as [[Channel Television]]. By constitutional convention this is only done at the request of the insular authorities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/crown/crwdep-legislation.htm |title=UK Legislation and the Crown Dependencies |website=[[Department for Constitutional Affairs]] |accessdate=31 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084313/http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/crown/crwdep-legislation.htm |archivedate=16 May 2008}}</ref> and has become a rare option (thus giving the insular authorities themselves the responsibility for good governance in the islands); the islands usually prefer nowadays to pass their own versions of laws giving effect to international treaties.

Westminster retains the right to legislate for the islands against their will as a last resort, but this is also rarely exercised, and may, according to legal opinion from the Attorney-General of Jersey, have fallen into [[desuetude]] — although this argument was not accepted by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. (The [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act|Marine, Etc., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]] was one recent piece of legislation extended to the Isle of Man against the wishes of Tynwald.)

The States of Jersey Law 2005 established that all Acts of the United Kingdom and Orders in Council were to be referred to the [[States of Jersey|States]], thus giving greater freedom of action to Jersey in international affairs.

As in England, but not the United Kingdom as a whole, the [[Church of England]] is the [[State religion|Established Church]] in the [[Isle of Man]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Gell |first=Sir James |authorlink=Sir James Gell |title=Memorandum Respecting the Ecclesiastical Courts of the Isle of Man... |url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol31/gell.htm |website=Isle of Man Online |accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=http://www.churchofengland.org.gg/about |website=Guernsey Deanery |publisher=Church of England |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>

In 2007–2008, each Crown Dependency and the UK signed agreements<ref name="FramewJersey"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=2174&p=0 |title=Framework for developing the international identity of Guernsey |date=18 December 2008 |website=States of Guernsey |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/cso/iominternationalidentityframework.pdf |title=Framework for developing the international identity of the Isle of Man |date=1 May 2007 |website=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> that established frameworks for the development of the international identity of each Crown Dependency. Among the points clarified in the agreements were that:
*the UK has no democratic accountability in and for the Crown Dependencies, which are governed by their own democratically elected assemblies;
*the UK will not act internationally on behalf of the Crown Dependencies without prior consultation;
*each Crown Dependency has an international identity that is different from that of the UK;
*the UK supports the principle of each Crown Dependency further developing its international identity;
*the UK recognises that the interests of each Crown Dependency may differ from those of the UK, and the UK will seek to represent any differing interests when acting in an international capacity; and
*the UK and each Crown Dependency will work together to resolve or clarify any differences that may arise between their respective interests.

The constitutional and cultural proximity of the Islands to the UK means that there are shared institutions and organisations. The [[BBC]], for example, has local radio stations in the Channel Islands, and also a website run by a team based in the Isle of Man (which is included in [[BBC North West]]). While the Islands now assume responsibility for their own post and telecommunications, they continue to participate in the [[Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom|UK telephone numbering plan]], and they have adopted [[Postal codes in the United Kingdom|postcode]] systems that are compatible with that of the UK.

The Crown dependencies, together with the United Kingdom, are collectively [[Terminology of the British Isles|known as]] the [[British Islands]]. Since the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] came into effect, they have been treated as part of the United Kingdom for [[British nationality law]] purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nisec2gensec/Britishoverseasterritories?view=Binary |title=[Withdrawn] Nationality instructions: Volume 2 |date=10 December 2013 |website=[[UK Border Agency]] |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> However, each Crown dependency maintains local controls over housing and employment, with special rules applying to British citizens without specified connections to that Crown dependency (as well as to non-British citizens).

==Relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations==
While their constitutional status bears some resemblance to that of the [[Commonwealth realms]], the Crown dependencies are not members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. They participate in the Commonwealth of Nations by virtue of their relationship with the United Kingdom, and participate in various Commonwealth institutions in their own right. For example, all three participate in the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]].

All three Crown dependencies regard the existing situation as unsatisfactory and have lobbied for change. The States of Jersey have called on the British Foreign Secretary to request that the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] "consider granting associate membership to Jersey and the other Crown Dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced stage of autonomy". Jersey has proposed that it be accorded "self-representation in all Commonwealth meetings; full participation in debates and procedures, with a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into discussions with those who are full members; and no right to vote in the Ministerial or Heads of Government meetings, which is reserved for full members".<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Affairs Committee: Written evidence from States of Jersey |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/114/114we22.htm |website=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>  The States of Guernsey and the Government of the Isle of Man have made calls of a similar nature for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth,<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Affairs Committee: The role and future of the Commonwealth |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/114/11410.htm |website=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Affairs Committee: Written evidence from the States of Guernsey |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/114/114we18.htm |website=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> The [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man]] has said: "A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the Island's international relationships"<ref>{{cite news |title=Isle of Man welcomes report on Commonwealth future |url=http://www.gov.im/lib/news/cso/isleofmanwelcome5.xml |accessdate=19 March 2013 |newspaper=Isle of Man Government |date=23 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302143313/http://www.gov.im/lib/news/cso/isleofmanwelcome5.xml |archivedate=2 March 2013 }}</ref>


==Relationship with the Common Travel Area==
All three Crown dependencies participate in an open borders area (also) comprising the United Kingdom and Ireland. Based on agreements that are legally binding,{{cn|date=September 2020}} the internal borders of the [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA) are subject to minimal controls, if any, and can normally be crossed by British and Irish citizens with minimal identity documents with certain exceptions. Under Irish law [[Manx people]] and Channel Islanders, who were not entitled to take advantage of the European Union's [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|freedom of movement]] provisions{{spaced ndash}}are exempt from immigration control and immune from deportation from Ireland.<ref>Per the provisions of the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/si/0097.html S.I. No. 97/1999 — Aliens (Exemption) Order, 1999] and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0022/print.html Immigration Act 1999].</ref> 

In May 2019 both the British and Irish government signed a memorandum of understanding in an effort to secure the rights of Irish and British citizens post-Brexit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-uk-and-ireland-on-the-cta|title=Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Ireland on the CTA|date=8 May 2019|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> The document was signed in London before a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, putting the rights of both countries' citizens, that are already in place under the Common Travel Area, on a more secure footing. The agreement, which is the culmination of over two years' work of both governments, means the rights of both countries' citizens are protected after Brexit while also ensuring that Ireland will continue to meet its obligations under EU law.  The agreement took effect on 31 January 2020 when the United Kingdom actually left the European Union. The maintenance of the CTA involves considerable co-operation on immigration matters between the British and Irish authorities.

==Relationship with the EU==
The Crown dependencies were neither member states nor associate members of the EU when the UK was a member of the EU.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Mut Bosque|first=Maria|date=2020|title=The sovereignty of the Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas Territories in the Brexit era|journal=Island Studies Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=151–168|doi=10.24043/isj.114|issn=1715-2593|doi-access=free}}</ref> The crown dependencies were part of the customs territory of the EU.<ref name=":0" /> They had free movement of agricultural goods to the EU.<ref name=":0" />

Certain aspects of membership of the [[European Union]] applied to the Crown dependencies, by association of the United Kingdom's defunct membership. For example, Article 355 (5)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) stated:

:''this Treaty shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972.'';

and by [[protocol (treaty)|Protocol]] 3 to the UK's Act of Accession to the Community:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/contents |title=European Communities Act 1972 |website=The National Archives |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>

<blockquote>An Act to make provision in connection with the enlargement of the European Communities to include the United Kingdom, together with (for certain purposes) the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and [[Gibraltar]]. [17 October 1972]"</blockquote>

Of the [[European Single Market#Four freedoms|Four Freedoms of the EU]], the islands took part in that concerning the movement of goods, but not those concerning the movement of persons, services or capital. The [[Channel Islands]] are outside the [[value-added tax|VAT]] area (as they have no VAT), while the Isle of Man is inside it.<ref name="vatcustoms">{{cite web |title=Article 6 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 (as amended) on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 347) |date=11 December 2006 |page=1 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0112:EN:NOT |website=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> Both areas are inside the customs union.<ref name="customs">{{cite web |title=Article 3(1) of Council Regulation 2913/92/EEC of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (as amended) (OJ L 302) |date=19 October 1992 |pages=1–50 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992R2913:EN:NOT |website=EUR-Lex |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>

Channel Islanders and Manx people are British citizens and hence [[citizenship of the European Union|European citizens]].<ref>s 1 of the ''British Nationality Act 1981'' grants citizenship to (most) people born in the 'United Kingdom'. s 50 of the Act defines the 'United Kingdom' to include the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</ref> However, they are not entitled to take advantage of the freedom of movement of people or services unless they are directly connected (through birth, descent from a parent or grandparent, or five years' residence) with the United Kingdom.<ref>Protocol 3 of the Treaty of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark (OJ L 73, 27 March 1972).</ref>

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] of the EU does not apply to the Crown dependencies. Their citizens never took part in elections to the [[European Parliament]].

===Brexit===
With the [[Brexit]] negotiations, the House of Lords has produced a report titled "Brexit: the Crown Dependencies", which states that the "UK Government must continue to fulfil its constitutional obligations to represent the interests of the Crown Dependencies in international relations, even where these differ from those of the UK, both during the Brexit negotiations and beyond." <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/136/136.pdf |title=House of Lords European Union Committee – Brexit: the Crown Dependencies |website=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=23 March 2017 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> In the [[Great Repeal Bill 2016|Great Repeal Bill]] [[white paper]] published on 30 March 2017 the UK government states "The Government is committed to engaging with the Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and the other Overseas Territories as we leave the EU."<ref name="GRBWP">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/604514/Great_repeal_bill_white_paper_print.pdf |title=Legislating for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union |website=[[Department for Exiting the European Union]] |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>{{rp|ch.5}}

The councils of both [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]] have announced they were exploring a status similar to Crown Dependencies as self governing islands aligned to the United Kingdom giving them financial and political autonomy in the event of Scottish Independence or unfavourable Brexit arrangements.<ref>https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18717880.opinion-mark-smith-reason-shetland-orkney-want-independence-holyrood-power-grab/</ref>
