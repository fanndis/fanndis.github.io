== Biography ==
[[File:Presidencia2014-5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Peng and [[Juliana Awada]], the [[First Lady of Argentina]], in the [[Quinta de Olivos]], [[Buenos Aires]], December 2018.]]
Peng Liyuan is a native of [[Yuncheng County]], [[Shandong province]].  Peng joined the [[People's Liberation Army]] in 1980, when she was 18 years old, and began as an ordinary soldier.  Because of her vocal talent, Peng later performed during frontline tours to boost troop morale during the [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts 1979–90|Sino-Vietnamese border conflicts]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ce.cn/xwzx/ylxk/dl/200407/01/t20040701_1165155.shtml |publisher = CE.cn |title= Peng Liyuan describes her own time in the army |date=1 July 2004 |access-date=28 May 2008|language=zh}}</ref>  Peng first performed nationally and came to fame during the earliest rendition of the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]] in 1982, when she performed ''On the Plains of Hope''.

Peng has been married to [[Xi Jinping]] for over 30 years.<ref name="First Lady" /> Together they have a daughter named [[Xi Mingze]] ({{lang|zh-hans|习明泽}}) born in 1992, nicknamed Xiao Muzi ({{lang|zh-hans|小木子}}).<ref name="Red Nobility">{{cite web |last=Staff Reporter |title=Red Nobility: Xi Jinping's Harvard daughter |url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120216000104&cid=1601&MainCatID=16 |work=Want China Times |access-date=7 November 2012 |date=16 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120214141/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1601&MainCatID=16&id=20120216000104 |archive-date=20 November 2012 }}</ref>

For the greater part of their relationship, Peng has enjoyed a very positive reputation within China, comparable to that of her politician husband.<ref name="First Lady" /> Since her husband became [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] (''de facto'' [[paramount leader]]) in November 2012,<ref name="First Lady" /> and [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] (''de jure'' [[head of state]]) in March 2013, the American press refers to her as the [[First Lady of China]].

Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.<ref name="First Lady" /> Xi was the son of famous Chinese revolutionary [[Xi Zhongxun]], and Peng's family obviously accepted the relationship with ease, due to his attitude.  After parental consent, the couple married on 1 September 1987 in [[Xiamen]], [[Fujian]].  Four days later, Peng Liyuan returned to [[Beijing]] to appear in the National Art Festival, and then immediately departed for the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to perform. Since that time, Xi and Peng have led largely separate lives, with Peng spending most of her time in Beijing, and her husband spending his time in Fujian and later in Zhejiang.

Peng is actively involved in politics, and is a member of the 11th National Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]].  Peng is a [[WHO Goodwill Ambassador]] for [[tuberculosis]] and [[HIV/AIDS]] since 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38609#.UWJk86Jgdc0 |publisher = un.org/ |title= UN health agency appoints Chinese singer as Goodwill Ambassador |date=3 June 2011}}</ref>

On 20 November 2014, [[Massey University]] in New Zealand conferred Peng an Honorary Doctorate in recognition of her international contributions to performing arts, health, and education.<ref name="massey.ac.nz">{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/news/article.cfm?mnarticle_uuid=890FFDCB-9172-8191-33ED-A935EAAE2283|title=Honorary doctorate for China's First Lady|date=18 November 2014|website=[[Massey University]]|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> Peng sang in a song-and-dance number in 2007 shown on Chinese television, 
that featured Tibetans thanking the Chinese military for liberating them.<ref>[http://world.time.com/2012/10/29/as-china-readies-for-transition-7-tibetan-self-immolations-in-7-days/ As China Readies for Transition, 7 Tibetan Self-Immolations in 7 Days], ''Time'', 29 October 2012.</ref>

== Controversy and criticism ==
Directly after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in June 1989, Peng Liyuan sang for the martial-law troops. A photo showing the scene in which Peng, wearing a green military uniform, sings to helmeted and rifle-bearing troops seated in rows on Beijing's [[Tiananmen Square]], was swiftly scrubbed from China's Internet before it could generate discussion online. However, the image — seen and shared by outside observers — revived a memory of the leadership's preference to suppress. The image was from the back cover of a 1989 issue of the ''People's Liberation Army Pictorial'', a publicly available military magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20130329/172742/|title=彭麗媛六四後舊照曝光 外媒：令中國尷尬的照片|date=29 March 2013|website=Apple Daily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216205521/http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20130329/172742/|archive-date=16 December 2013|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tw.news.appledaily.com/international/daily/20130330/34920550/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%A4%AB%E4%BA%BA%E8%A7%B8%E5%B1%A0%E6%AE%BA%E6%95%8F%E6%84%9F%E8%A9%B1%E9%A1%8C%E5%BD%AD%E9%BA%97%E5%AA%9B%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B%E5%8B%9E%E8%BB%8D%E7%85%A7%E9%96%83%E9%9B%BB%E5%88%AA%E9%99%A4|title=第一夫人觸屠殺敏感話題 彭麗媛六四勞軍照 閃電刪除|date=30 March 2017|website=Apple Daily|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2013/new/mar/30/today-int3.htm?Slots=All|title=中國第一夫人∕彭麗媛 遭爆高歌慰勞六四屠殺部隊|date=30 March 2013|website=Liberty Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216210245/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2013/new/mar/30/today-int3.htm?Slots=All|archive-date=16 December 2013|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref>

In June 2013, the American ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine's article ''Why Michelle Obama Shouldn't Meet With Peng Liyuan'', approved the [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]]'s choice not to meet with Peng Liyuan who allegedly sang in support of Chinese troops in Tiananmen Square in 1989, following a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|crackdown on protesters on 4 June]].
