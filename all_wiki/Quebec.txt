It is bordered to the west by the province of [[Ontario]] and the bodies of water [[James Bay]] and [[Hudson Bay]]; to the north by [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Ungava Bay]]; to the east by the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]; and to the south by the province of [[New Brunswick]] and the [[U.S. state|U.S. states]] of [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]]. Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division; only the territory of [[Nunavut]] is larger. 

Quebec is the [[Population of Canada by province and territory|second-most]] populous province of Canada, after Ontario.<ref>{{harv |Merriam|Webster|2003}}</ref> It is the only one to have a predominantly [[List of territorial entities where French is an official language|French-speaking]] population, with French as the sole [[official language]]. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the [[Saint Lawrence River]] between [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]], the capital. Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the [[Greater Montreal]] Area and the [[Island of Montreal]]. The island of Montreal houses most of the allophone and anglophone population, as well as most English-language institutions. The [[Nord-du-Québec]] region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by [[Indigenous peoples in Quebec|Aboriginal peoples]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=2499&Geo2=PR&Code2=24&Data=Count&SearchText=Nord-du-Qu%E9bec&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=24&B1=All&Custom=|title=Community highlights for Nord-du-Québec|year=2006|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=December 1, 2008}}</ref>

While the province's substantial [[natural resource]]s have long been the mainstay of its economy, sectors of the [[knowledge economy]] such as [[aerospace]], [[Information technology|information and communication technologies]], [[biotechnology]], and the [[pharmaceutical industry]] also play leading roles. The province's economic output was CA$439.3&nbsp;billion in 2018, almost 20 percent of the Canada's total [[gross domestic product]].

The climate around the major cities is four-seasons [[humid continental climate|continental]] with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers, but farther north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by [[tundra]] conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quebecoriginal.com/en/discover/people-of-quebec|title=Explore Québec|publisher=Québec Original|accessdate=October 2, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002183010/https://www.quebecoriginal.com/en/discover/people-of-quebec|archivedate=October 2, 2015|date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> Even in central Quebec, at comparatively southerly latitudes, winters are severe in inland areas.

[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive à Québec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|right|thumb|The arrival of [[Samuel de Champlain]], the father of [[New France]], on the site of [[Quebec City]]]]
The name "Québec", which comes from the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] or [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word ''kébec'' meaning "where the river narrows", originally referred to the area around [[Quebec City]] where the [[Saint Lawrence River]] narrows to a cliff-lined gap. Early variations in the spelling of the name included ''Québecq'' (Levasseur, 1601) and ''Kébec'' (Lescarbot, 1609).<ref>Afable, Patricia O. and Madison S. Beeler (1996). "Place Names".

The [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] was founded in the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] formally transferred the [[French colonial empire|French colony]] of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]<ref>"his Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants" – ''[[s:Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]'', 1763</ref> to Britain after the [[Seven Years' War]]. The proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 expanded the territory of the province to include the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Ohio River]] Valley and south of [[Rupert's Land]], more or less restoring the borders previously existing under French rule before the [[Conquest of 1760]].<ref name="Geographers1968">{{cite book|author=Canadian Association of Geographers|title=Canada: a Geographical Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA33|year=1968|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=33|id=GGKEY:E1DDKEKZ35S|isbn=9780458906000}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] ceded territories south of the Great Lakes to the United States.<ref name="PeirceCo1877">{{cite book|author1=Henry B.

The [[Saint Lawrence River]] has some of the world's largest sustaining inland Atlantic ports at Montreal (the province's largest city), [[Trois-Rivières]], and Quebec City (the capital). Its access to the Atlantic Ocean and the interior of North America made it the base of early [[French colonization of the Americas|French exploration and settlement]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since 1959, the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] has provided a navigable link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes. Northeast of Quebec City, the river broadens into the world's largest [[estuary]], the feeding site of numerous species of whales, fish, and seabirds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Saguenay-St. Lawrence National Park|url=http://www.greatcanadianparks.com/quebec/saguenp/index.htm|publisher=Digital Wizards (Ontario) Inc.|accessdate=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711123512/http://www.greatcanadianparks.com/quebec/saguenp/index.htm|archivedate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> The river empties into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].

The [[Saint Lawrence River]] with its [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence|estuary]] forms the basis of Quebec's development through the centuries. Other notable rivers include the [[Ashuapmushuan River|Ashuapmushuan]], [[Chaudière River|Chaudière]], [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]], [[Manicouagan River|Manicouagan]], [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]], [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]], [[Rupert River|Rupert]], [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]], [[Saint-François River|Saint-François]], and [[Saint-Maurice River|Saint-Maurice]].

===Topography===
[[File:Scotora2 PJC.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques-Cartier River]]]]
Quebec's highest point at {{formatnum:1652}} metres is Mont d'Iberville, known in English as [[Mount Caubvick]], located on the border with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the northeastern part of the province, in the [[Torngat Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=5968|title=Mont D'Iberville, Québec/Newfoundland|publisher=PeakBagger|date=November 1, 2004|accessdate=July 14, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807070459/http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=5968|archivedate=August 7, 2011}}</ref> The most populous [[Physical geography|physiographic]] region is the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]].

[[File:Automne-manche d'épée 592K -2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Autumn landscape of [[Gaspé Peninsula|Haute-Gaspésie]]]]
More than 95% of Quebec's territory lies within the [[Canadian Shield]].<ref name="naturalhistory"/> It is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the [[Laurentian Mountains]] in southern Quebec, the [[Otish Mountains]] in central Quebec and the [[Torngat Mountains]] near [[Ungava Bay]]. The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. [[Primary sector of the economy|Primary industries]] sustain small cities in regions of [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]], [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]], and [[Côte-Nord]].

[[File:Mont Tremblant village.jpeg|thumb|alt=|[[Mont Tremblant Resort]], [[Laurentian Mountains]]]]
The [[Labrador Peninsula]] is covered by the Laurentian Plateau (or [[Canadian Shield]]), dotted with mountains such as [[Otish Mountains]]. The [[Ungava Peninsula]] is notably composed of D'Youville mountains, Puvirnituq mountains and Pingualuit crater. While low and medium altitude peak from western Quebec to the far north, high altitudes mountains emerge in the [[Capitale-Nationale]] region to the extreme east, along its longitude. In the [[Labrador Peninsula]] portion of the Shield, the far northern region of [[Nunavik]] includes the [[Ungava Peninsula]] and consists of flat [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] inhabited mostly by the [[Inuit]]. Further south lie the [[subarctic]] [[taiga]] of the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] ecoregion and the [[Taiga|boreal forest]] of the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]], where [[spruce]], [[fir]], and [[Populus|poplar]] trees provide raw materials for Quebec's [[Pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]] and [[lumber]] industries. Although the area is inhabited principally by the [[Cree]], [[Naskapi]], and [[Innu people|Innu]] [[First Nations]], thousands of temporary workers reside at [[Radisson, Quebec|Radisson]] to service the massive [[James Bay Project|James Bay Hydroelectric Project]] on the [[La Grande River|La Grande]] and [[Eastmain River|Eastmain]] rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to the [[Laurentian Mountains|Laurentians]], a mountain range just north of the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]], that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.

The [[Chaudière-Appalaches|Appalachian]] region of Quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of Quebec. The [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] are actually a huge chain that extends from [[Alabama]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In between, it covers in Quebec near {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}}, from the Montérégie hills to the Gaspé Peninsula. In western Quebec, the average altitude is about 500 metres, while in the Gaspé Peninsula, the Appalachian peaks (especially the Chic-Choc) are among the highest in Quebec, exceeding 1000 metres.

===Vegetation===
[[File:Gaspé taiga.jpg|thumb|Taiga forest in Gaspé, Québec, Canada]]
Given the geology of the province and its different climates, there is an established number of large areas of vegetation in Quebec. These areas, listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are: the [[tundra]], the [[taiga]], the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] (coniferous), [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] and [[Deciduous]] forest.<ref name="naturalhistory">{{cite web|title=Natural History of Quebec|url=http://redpath-museum.mcgill.ca/Qbp/Natural%20History/nat_hist.html|work=A description of the natural history of the province|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=June 22, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185133/http://redpath-museum.mcgill.ca/Qbp/Natural%20History/nat_hist.html|archivedate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

On the edge of the [[Ungava Bay]] and [[Hudson Strait]] is the [[tundra]], whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of [[lichen]] with only less than 50 growing days a year. The tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of {{convert|-8|°C|°F}}. The tundra covers more than 24% of the area of Quebec.<ref name="naturalhistory"/> Further south, the climate is conducive to the growth of the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]], bounded on the north by the [[taiga]].
[[File:Ecoregions quebec map.svg|thumb|left|Different forest areas of Quebec]]
Not as arid as the [[tundra]], the [[taiga]] is associated with the sub-Arctic regions of the [[Canadian Shield]]<ref name="types veg">{{cite web|title=Types de végétations du Québec|url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/forets/connaissances/connaissances-inventaire-zones.jsp|work=Types of vegetation and climatic zones of Quebec|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=June 22, 2011|language=French|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827041242/http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/forets/connaissances/connaissances-inventaire-zones.jsp|archivedate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> and is characterized by a greater number of both plant (600) and animal (206) species, many of which live there all year. The [[taiga]] covers about 20% of the total area of Quebec.<ref name="naturalhistory"/> The [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in Quebec that straddle the [[Canadian Shield]] and the upper [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|lowlands]] of the province. Given a warmer climate, the diversity of organisms is also higher, since there are about 850 plant species and 280 [[vertebrate]]s species. The [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] covers 27% of the area of Quebec.<ref name="naturalhistory"/> The [[mixed forest]] is a transition zone between the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] and [[deciduous forest]]. By virtue of its transient nature, this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant (1000) and [[vertebrate]]s (350) species, despite relatively cool temperatures. The ecozone [[mixed forest]] covers 11.5% of the area of Quebec and is characteristic of the [[Laurentides|Laurentians]], the [[Chaudière-Appalaches|Appalachians]] and the eastern [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|lowlands]] forests.<ref name="types veg"/> The third most northern forest area is characterized by [[deciduous forest]]s. Because of its climate (average annual temperature of {{convert|7|°C|°F}}), it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species, including more than 1600 [[vascular plants]] and 440 [[vertebrate]]s. Its relatively long growing season lasts almost 200 days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of Quebec. Most of Quebec's population lives in this area of vegetation, almost entirely along the banks of the St. Lawrence. Deciduous forests cover approximately 6.6% of the area of Quebec.<ref name="naturalhistory"/>

On September 13, 1759, the British forces of General [[James Wolfe]] defeated those of French General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] on the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]] outside Quebec City. With the exception of the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], located off the coast of Newfoundland, France ceded its North American possessions to Great Britain through the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] in favour of gaining the island of [[Guadeloupe]] for its then-lucrative [[sugar cane]] industry.{{sfn |Hunter|1999| p=505-506}} The [[British Royal Proclamation of 1763]] renamed Canada (part of New France) as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]].

===Quebec Act===
{{Main|Quebec Act}}
[[File:Province of Quebec 1774.gif|right|thumb|The [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] in 1774]]
With unrest growing in the colonies to the south, which would one day grow into the [[American Revolution]], the British were worried that the French-speaking Canadians might also support the growing rebellion. At that time, French-speaking Canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and British immigration was not going well. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 French-speaking Canadians to the British crown, first Governor [[James Murray (Quebec governor)|James Murray]] and later Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] promoted the need for change. There was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the French-speaking Canadian subjects and those of newly arrived British subjects. These efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the [[Quebec Act]]<ref>{{cite web|last=BROWN FOULDS |first=NANCY |title=The Quebec Act |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-act/ |work=Effects and Consequences |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081944/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0006592 |archivedate=June 8, 2011 }}</ref> of 1774.

The Quebec Act provided the people of Quebec their first Charter of Rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the French language and [[French culture]]. The act also allowed the French speakers, known as Canadiens, to maintain French [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and sanctioned freedom of religion, allowing the Roman Catholic Church to remain, one of the first cases in history of state-sanctioned freedom of religious practice.<ref>W.J.Eccles France in America pp.&nbsp;233–34</ref>

===Effects of the American Revolution===
Although the [[Quebec Act]] was unrelated to the events in [[Boston Tea Party|Boston]] of 1773, and was not regarded as one of the [[Intolerable Acts|Coercive Acts]], the timing of its passage led British colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them. The Quebec Act offended a variety of interest groups in the British colonies. Land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a non-representative government. Many feared the establishment of Catholicism in Quebec, and that the French Canadians were being courted to help oppress British Americans.<ref>Ammerman, ''In the Common Cause'', 11–12.</ref>

[[File:Invasion of Quebec.tif|thumb|right|British troops defending Quebec from an American attack during the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]] in December 1775]]

On June 27, 1775, General George Washington and his [[Continental Army]] [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]] in an attempt to conquer Quebec. British reinforcements came up the St. Lawrence in May 1776, and the [[Battle of Trois-Rivières]] turned into a disaster for the Americans. The army withdrew to Ticonderoga.{{sfn |Lefkowitz|2008}} Although some help was given to the Americans by the locals, Governor Carleton punished American sympathizers, and public support of the American cause came to an end. In 1778, [[Frederick Haldimand]] took over for [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] as governor of Quebec.

The arrival of 10,000 Loyalists at Quebec in 1784 destroyed the political balance that Haldimand (and Carleton before him) had worked so hard to achieve. The swelling numbers of English encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government.<ref name="georgetown2">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=December 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027124041/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |archivedate=October 27, 2011}} See drop-down essay on "Early European Settlement and the Formation of the Modern State"</ref> To restore stability to his largest remaining North American colony, King George III sent Carleton back to Quebec to remedy the situation.<ref name="W.J.Eccles France in America p.246">W.J.Eccles France in America p.246</ref>

In ten years, Quebec had undergone a dramatic change. What worked for Carleton in 1774 was not likely to succeed in 1784. Specifically, there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many English people unwilling to reach a compromise with the 145,000 Canadiens or their colonial governor. The situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving.<ref name="W.J.Eccles France in America p.246"/>

====Separation of the Province of Quebec====
[[File:A Plan of the Inhabited Part of the Province of Quebec.jpg|thumb|A Plan of the Inhabited Part of the Province of Quebec, {{circa|1785}} by James Peachey. Peter Winkworth Collection. Library and Archives Canada, e000756679]]
Loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the British legal system they were
used to in the American colonies. The creation of Upper and Lower Canada in 1791 allowed most Loyalists to live under British laws and institutions, while the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain their familiar French civil law and the Catholic religion.<ref>name="uelac.org"</ref> Therefore, Governor Haldimand (at the suggestion of Carleton) drew Loyalists away from [[Quebec City]] and [[Montreal]] by offering free land on the northern shore of Lake Ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to George III. The Loyalists were thus given land grants of {{convert|200|acre|ha|0}} per person. Basically, this approach was designed with the intent of keeping French and English as far apart as possible. Therefore, after the separation of the Province of Quebec, [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] were formed, each with its own government.<ref name="W.J.Eccles France in America p.246"/>

===Rebellion in Lower Canada===

In 1837, residents of Lower Canada – led by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]] – formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to the unilateral control of the British governors.<ref>{{cite web|author=SWiSH v2.0 |url=http://cgi2.cvm.qc.ca/glaporte/1837.pl?cat=ptype&cherche=DOCUMENT |title=Les Patriotes de 1837@1838 |publisher=Cgi2.cvm.qc.ca |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706202410/http://cgi2.cvm.qc.ca/glaporte/1837.pl?cat=ptype&cherche=DOCUMENT |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}</ref> They made a Declaration of Rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination and a Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada in 1838.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_Lower_Canada|title=Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada|author=Nelson, Robert|publisher=Wikisource|date=February 1838|accessdate=February 21, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107082359/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_Lower_Canada|archivedate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and [[Upper Canada]]. An unprepared [[British Army]] had to raise [[militia]] force; the rebel forces scored a victory in [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|Saint-Denis]] but were soon defeated.

After the rebellions, [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was asked to undertake a study and prepare a [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|report]] on the matter and to offer a solution for the British Parliament to assess.<ref name="durham">{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=37606&PHPSESSID=qj23a0tmehl1lulfrlfrhk0c53|title=LAMBTON, JOHN GEORGE, 1st Earl of Durham|author=Ouellet, Fernand|publisher=Government of Canada|work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|accessdate=July 12, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805103634/http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=37606&PHPSESSID=qj23a0tmehl1lulfrlfrhk0c53|archivedate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> Following Durham's report,<ref name="durham"/> the British government merged the two colonial provinces into one [[Province of Canada]] in 1840 with the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]].<ref name="actunion">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/act-of-union/ |title=Act of Union |author=Monet, Jacques |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720023244/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0000029 |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}</ref> The two colonies remained distinct in administration, election, and law.

In 1848, Baldwin and LaFontaine, allies and leaders of the Reformist party, were asked by [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] to form an administration together under the new policy of [[responsible government]]. The French language subsequently regained legal status in the Legislature.<ref name="actunion"/>

===Canadian Confederation===
{{main|Canadian Confederation}}
In the 1860s, the delegates from the colonies of [[British North America]] (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland) met in a series of conferences to discuss self-governing status for a new confederation. The first [[Charlottetown Conference]] took place in [[Charlottetown]], Prince Edward Island, followed by the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] in Quebec City which led to a delegation going to London, England, to put forth a proposal for a national union.<ref>{{cite web|last=WAITE |first=P.B. |title=Canadian confederation |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0001842 |work=history of the formation of the Confederation |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607203333/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0001842 |archivedate=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>

As a result of those deliberations, in 1867 the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the [[British North America Acts]], providing for the Confederation of most of these provinces. The former [[Province of Canada]] was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of [[Ontario]] (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada). [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] joined Ontario and Quebec in the new [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The other provinces then joined Confederation, one after the other: [[Manitoba]] and the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1870, [[British Columbia]] in 1871, [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1873, [[Yukon]] in 1898, [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in 1905, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 1949 and finally [[Nunavut]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=Library and Archives Canada|title=Canadian Confederation|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-3000-e.html|work=List of the Provinces and Territories and their joining dates|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811093535/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-3000-e.html|archivedate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

===World War I and World War II===
When Great Britain declared war on August 4, 1914, Canada was automatically involved as a dominion. About 6,000 volunteers from Quebec participated on the European front. Although reaction to conscription was favourable in English Canada the idea was deeply unpopular in Quebec. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] did much to highlight the divisions between French and English-speaking Canadians in Canada.

During [[World War II]], the participation of Quebec was more important but led to the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] and opposition. Many Quebecers fought against the [[axis power|axis powers]] between 1939 to 1945 with the involvement of many francophone regiments such as [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]], le [[Régiment de la Chaudière]] and many more.

===Parti Québécois and national unity===
{{main|Parti Québécois|Quebec sovereignty movement}}
In 1977, the newly elected [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[René Lévesque]] introduced the [[Charter of the French Language]]. Often known as [[Bill 101]], it defined French as the only official language of Quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction.<ref>[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/preamble.html The Charter of the French Language – Preamble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402153735/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/preamble.html |date=April 2, 2007 }}, on the Web site of the ''Office québécois de la langue française'', Retrieved April 23, 2008.</ref>
[[File:René Lévesque BAnQ P243S1D865.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[René Lévesque]]]]
Lévesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 Quebec elections under a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. The party failed to win control of Quebec's National Assembly both times – though its share of the vote increased from 23 percent to 30 percent – and Lévesque was defeated both times in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] he contested.<ref>{{cite web|last=COMEAU |first=ROMBERT |title=Parti Québécois |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/parti-quebecois/ |work=History and Achievements |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806082957/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0006123 |archivedate=August 6, 2011 }}</ref> In the 1976 election campaign, he softened his message by promising a referendum (plebiscite) on [[sovereignty-association]] rather than outright separation, by which Quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones, such as a common currency, with Canada. On November 15, 1976, Lévesque and the Parti Québécois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of [[sovereignty-association]] was placed before the voters in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. During the campaign, [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised that a vote for the "no" side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the [[patriation]] of Canada's Constitution from the United Kingdom. The existing constitutional document, the [[British North America Act]], could only be amended by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] upon a request by the Canadian parliament.

Sixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition for sovereignty-association.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1980 Quebec Referendum|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/constitution/topics/1092-6040/|work=Facts and results|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation – CBC|accessdate=June 29, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531220955/http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/constitution/topics/1092-6040/|archivedate=May 31, 2008}}</ref> Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebecers voted against, and that French Quebecers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour and younger voters more in favour. After his loss in the referendum, Lévesque went back to Ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with Trudeau, his minister of Justice [[Jean Chrétien]] and the nine other provincial premiers. Lévesque insisted Quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments. The negotiations quickly reached a stand-still. Quebec is the only province not to have assented to the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/patriation-of-the-constitution/ |title=Constitution, Patriation of |last=Sheppard |first=Robert |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=September 23, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102145936/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0001869 |archivedate=January 2, 2010 }}</ref>

In subsequent years, two attempts were made to gain Quebec's approval of the constitution. The first was the [[Meech Lake Accord]] of 1987, which was finally abandoned in 1990 when the province of [[Manitoba]] did not pass it within the established deadline. ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] premier [[Clyde Wells]] had expressed his opposition to the accord, but, with the failure in Manitoba, the vote for or against Meech never took place in his province.) This led to the formation of the sovereigntist [[Bloc Québécois]] party in Ottawa under the leadership of [[Lucien Bouchard]],<ref>{{cite news|last=BUSTA & HUI, Ann|first=Shannon|title=Bloc Québécois through the years|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/bloc-qubcois-through-the-years/article2008669/|work=Timeline|location=Canada|accessdate=June 29, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509013937/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/bloc-qubcois-through-the-years/article2008669/|archivedate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> who had resigned from the federal cabinet. The second attempt, the [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992, also failed to gain traction. This result caused a split in the [[Parti libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party]] that led to the formation of the new [[Action démocratique du Québec|Action démocratique]] (Democratic Action) party led by [[Mario Dumont]] and [[Jean Allaire]].

On October 30, 1995, with the [[Parti Québécois]] back in power since 1994, a [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] on sovereignty took place.

===''Statut particulier'' ("special status")===
Given the province's heritage and the preponderance of French (unique among the Canadian provinces), there has been debate in Canada regarding the unique status (''statut particulier'') of Quebec and its people, wholly or partially. Prior attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to acknowledge Quebec as a "[[distinct society]]" – referring to the province's uniqueness within Canada regarding law, language, and culture – have been unsuccessful; however, the federal government under Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] would later endorse recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.<ref>The Constitutional Law Group, ''Canadian Constitutional Law'', Third Edition, Toronto: Edmond Montgomery Publications Limited, p. 1261.</ref>

The 2006 census counted a total aboriginal population of 108,425 (1.5 percent) including 65,085 [[First Nations|North American Indians]] (0.9 percent), 27,985 [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] (0.4 percent), and 10,950 [[Inuit]] (0.15 percent). There is a significant undercount, as many of the largest Indian bands regularly refuse to participate in Canadian censuses for political reasons regarding the question of aboriginal sovereignty. In particular, the largest [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Iroquois]] reserves ([[Kahnawake]], [[Akwesasne]] and [[Kanesatake]]) were not counted.

Nearly 9% of the population of Quebec belongs to a [[visible minority]] group. This is a lower percentage than that of [[British Columbia]], Ontario, [[Alberta]], and [[Manitoba]] but higher than that of the other five provinces. Most visible minorities in Quebec live in or near [[Montreal]].

Quebec is unique among the provinces in its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic population, though recently with a low [[church attendance]]. This is a legacy of colonial times when only Roman Catholics were permitted to settle in [[New France]]. The 2001 census showed the population to be 90.3 percent Christian (in contrast to 77 percent for the whole country) with 83.4 percent [[Catholic Church in Canada|Catholic]] (including 83.2 percent Roman Catholic); 4.7 percent [[Protestant]] Christian (including 1.2 percent [[Anglican]], 0.7 percent [[United Church of Canada|United Church]]; and 0.5 percent [[Baptist]]); 1.4 percent [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox Christian]] (including 0.7 percent [[Greek Orthodox]]); and 0.8 percent other Christian; as well as 1.5 percent Muslim; 1.3 percent Jewish; 0.6 percent [[Buddhist]]; 0.3 percent [[Hindu]]; and 0.1 percent [[Sikh]].

English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts.

Since the 1970s, languages other than French on commercial signs have been permitted only if French is given marked prominence. This law has been the subject of periodic controversy since its inception. The written forms of French place-names in Canada retain their [[French diacritics|diacritics]] such as accent marks over vowels in English text. Legitimate exceptions are '''Montreal''' and '''Quebec'''. However, the accented forms are increasingly evident in some publications. The ''Canadian Style'' states that '''Montréal''' and '''Québec''' (the city) must retain their accents in English federal documents.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Quebec}}

Quebec is at the centre of French-speaking culture in North America. Its culture is a symbol of a distinct perspective. [[Quebec nationalism]] has been one expression of this perspective. Quebec's culture blends its historic roots with its aboriginal heritage and the contributions of recent immigrants, as well as receiving a strong influence from English-speaking North America.

Montreal's cabarets rose to the forefront of the city's cultural life during the [[Prohibition]] era of Canada and the United States in the 1920s. The cabarets radically transformed the artistic scene, greatly influencing the live entertainment industry of Quebec.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bourassa |first1=A. G. |first2=J.

Life in the cafés and "terrasses" (outdoor restaurant terraces) reveals a Latin influence in Quebec's culture, with the [[théâtre Saint-Denis]] in Montréal and the [[Capitole de Québec]] theatre in Quebec City being among the principal attractions.

A number of governmental and non-government organizations support cultural activity in Quebec. The [[Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec]] (CALQ) is an initiative of the [[Ministry of Culture and Communications (Quebec)]]. It supports creation, innovation, production, and international exhibits for all cultural fields of Quebec. The [[Société de développement des entreprises culturelles]] (SODEC) works to promote and fund individuals working in the cultural industry. The [[Prix du Québec]] is an award given by the government to confer the highest distinction and honour to individuals demonstrating exceptional achievement in their respective cultural field.

===Society===
On February 8, 2007, Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] announced the setting up of a ''[[Bouchard-Taylor Commission|Commission tasked with consulting Quebec Society on the matter of arrangements regarding cultural diversity]]''. The Premier's press release<ref name="d'étude">{{cite web|url=http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.qc.ca/actualites/communiques/2007/fevrier/2007-02-08.asp|title=Le premier ministre énonce sa vision et crée une commission spéciale d'étude|author=Office of the Premier|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=February 8, 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2011|language=french|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827011200/http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.qc.ca/actualites/communiques/2007/fevrier/2007-02-08.asp|archivedate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> reasserted the three fundamental values of Quebec society:

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Quebec|Dance of Quebec}}
Traditional music is imbued with many dances, such as the [[jig]], the [[quadrille]], the [[Reel (dance)|reel]] and [[line dancing]], which developed in the festivities since the early days of colonization. Various instruments are more popular in Quebec's culture: harmonica (music-of-mouth or lip-destruction), [[fiddle]], [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]], [[jaw harp]] and [[accordion]]. The ''podorythmie'' is a characteristic of traditional Quebec music and means giving the rhythm with the feet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://revelsdc.org/canadiancd/article.html|title=Folk Song and Music in Quebec: a Brief Introduction, by Stephen D.

Being a modern cosmopolitan society, today, all types of music can be found in Quebec. From [[folk music]] to [[hip-hop]], music has always played an important role in Quebercers culture. From [[La Bolduc]] in the 1920s–1930s to the contemporary artists, the music in Quebec has announced multiple songwriters and performers, pop singers and crooners, music groups and many more. Quebec's most popular artists of the last century include the singers [[Félix Leclerc]] (1950s), [[Gilles Vigneault]] (1960s–present), [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]] (1970s–present) and [[Céline Dion]] (1980s–present).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repertoiredesartistesquebecois.org/index2.asp|title=Répertoire des artistes québécois|author=Donald Loignon|publisher=DLP multimédia|accessdate=July 6, 2011|language=french|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213504/http://www.repertoiredesartistesquebecois.org/index2.asp|archivedate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> The [[First Nations]] and the [[Inuit]] of Quebec also have their own traditional music.

Currently, the song ''[[Gens du pays]]'' is by far preferred by many Quebecers to be the national anthem of Quebec. The [[ADISQ|Association québécoise de l'industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo]] (ADISQ) was created in 1978 to promote the music industry in Quebec.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adisq.com/assoc-profil.html |title=Notre raison d'être, c'est la musique de votre quotidien |author=ADISQ |publisher=Association québécoise de l'industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718175149/http://www.adisq.com/assoc-profil.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}</ref> The [[Orchestre symphonique de Québec]] and the [[Orchestre symphonique de Montréal]] are respectively associated with the Opéra de Québec and the Opéra de Montreal whose performances are presented at the [[Grand Théâtre de Québec]] and at [[Place des Arts]].

===Literature and theatre===
{{Main| Literature of Quebec}}
From New France, Quebec literature was first developed in the travel accounts of explorers such as [[Jacques Cartier]], [[Jean de Brébeuf]], the [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Baron de La Hontan]] and [[Nicolas Perrot]], describing their relations with [[indigenous peoples]]. The ''Moulin à paroles'' traces the great texts that have shaped the history of Quebec since its foundation in 1534 until the era of modernity. The first to write the history of Quebec, since its discovery, was the historian [[François-Xavier Garneau]]. This author will be part of the current of patriotic literature (also known as the "poets of the country" and literary identity) that will arise after the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Patriots Rebellion]] of 1837–1838.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/patriote.htm |title=Littérature patriotique du Québec |publisher=Litterature-quebecoise.org |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |language=French |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727035037/http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/patriote.htm |archivedate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

Various tales and stories are told through oral tradition, such as, among many more, the legends of the ''[[Bogeyman]]'', the ''[[Chasse-galerie]]'', the ''Black Horse of Trois-Pistoles'', the ''Complainte de Cadieux'', the ''[[Marie-Josephte Corriveau|Corriveau]]'', the ''dancing devil of Saint-Ambroise'', the ''[[Édouard Beaupré|Giant Beaupré]]'', the ''monsters of the lakes [[Lake Pohenegamook|Pohénégamook]]'' and ''[[Lake Memphremagog|Memphremagog]]'', of ''[[Quebec Bridge]]'' (called the Devil's Bridge), the ''[[Rocher Percé]]'' and of ''Rose Latulipe'', for example.{{sfn |Dupont|2008}}

Many [[List of Quebec writers|Quebec poets]] and prominent authors marked their era and today remain anchored in the collective imagination, like, among others, Philippe Aubert de Gaspé, [[Octave Crémazie]], [[Honoré Beaugrand]], [[Émile Nelligan]], [[Lionel Groulx]], [[Gabrielle Roy]], [[Hubert Aquin]], [[Michel Tremblay]], [[Marie Laberge]], Fred Pellerin and [[Gaston Miron]]. The [[American Literary Regionalism|regional novel]] from Quebec is called ''Terroir'' novel and is a literary tradition<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/terroir.htm |title=Littérature du terroir québécois |publisher=Litterature-quebecoise.org |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |language=French |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034815/http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/terroir.htm |archivedate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> specific to the province. It includes such works as ''The Old Canadians'', ''[[Maria Chapdelaine]]'', ''[[Séraphin: un homme et son péché|Un homme et son péché]]'', ''Le Survenant'', etc. There are also many successful plays from this literary category, such as ''[[Les Belles-sœurs]]'' and ''Broue (Brew)''.

Among the theatre troupes are the [[Jean Duceppe|Compagnie Jean-Duceppe]], the ''Théâtre La Rubrique'' at the Pierrette-Gaudreault venue of the Institut of arts in Saguenay, the Théâtre Le Grenier, etc. In addition to the network of cultural centres in Quebec,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quebecvacances.com/centre-culturel |title=Centres culturels au Québec |publisher=Quebecvacances.com |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |language=French |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715134916/http://www.quebecvacances.com/centre-culturel |archivedate=July 15, 2011}}</ref> the venues include the [[Monument-National]] and the ''Rideau Vert'' (green curtain) Theatre in [[Montreal]], the ''Trident'' Theatre in [[Quebec City]], etc. The [[National Theatre School of Canada]] and the [[Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec]] form the future players.

Popular French-language contemporary writers include [[Louis Caron]], [[Suzanne Jacob]], [[Yves Beauchemin]], and [[Gilles Archambault]]. [[Mavis Gallant]], born in Quebec, lived in Paris from the 1950s onward. Well-known English-language writers from Quebec include [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Mordecai Richler]], and [[Neil Bissoondath]].

First influenced since the days of New France by Catholicism, with works from ''Frère Luc'' (Brother Luke) and more recently from [[Ozias Leduc]] and [[Guido Nincheri]], art of Quebec has developed around the specific characteristics of its landscapes and cultural, historical, social and political representations.<ref>''Art History in Quebec'', La collection du Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, 2004, 268 pages.</ref>

Thus, the development of Quebec masterpieces in painting, printmaking and sculpture is marked by the contribution of artists such as [[Louis-Philippe Hébert]], [[Cornelius Krieghoff]], [[Alfred Laliberté]], [[Marc-Aurèle Fortin]], [[Marc-Aurèle de Foy Suzor-Coté]], [[Jean Paul Lemieux]], [[Clarence Gagnon]], Adrien Dufresne, [[Alfred Pellan]], [[Jean-Philippe Dallaire]], [[Charles Daudelin]], [[Arthur Villeneuve]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[Paul-Émile Borduas]] and [[Marcelle Ferron]].

While many works decorate the public areas of Quebec, others are displayed in foreign countries such as the sculpture ''Embâcle'' (Jam) by Charles Daudelin on ''Québec Place'' in Paris and the statue ''Québec Libre!'' (free Quebec!) by [[Armand Vaillancourt]] in San Francisco.
The [[École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal|Montreal School of Fine Arts]] forms the [[List of Canadian artists|painters, printmakers and sculptors of Quebec]].

Various buildings reflect the architectural heritage that characterizes Quebec, such as religious buildings, city halls, houses of large estates, and other locations throughout the province.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Quebec}}
[[File:La Banquise Poutine.jpg|thumb|A classic [[poutine]] from [[La Banquise]] in Montreal]]
[[File:Schwartz smoked meat montreal.JPG|thumb |Montreal-style smoked meat from [[Schwartz's]] in Montreal]]
The traditional Quebecois cuisine descends from 16th century [[French cuisine]], the [[fur trade]] and a history of [[hunting]]. French settlers populating North America were interested in a new cuisine to confront the climate and the needs arising from the work of colonization. It has many similarities with Acadian cuisine. Quebec's cuisine has also been influenced by learning from [[First Nation]], by [[English cuisine]] and by [[American cuisine]]. Quebec is most famous for its [[Tourtière]], [[Pâté Chinois]], [[Poutine]], [[St. Catherine's taffy]] among others. "Le temps des sucres" is a period during springtime when many Quebecers go to the [[Sugar house|cabane à sucre]] for a traditional meal. Traditional dishes are also the star of "Le temps des fêtes", a period which covers the winter holidays. 

Quebec has produced beer since the beginning of colonization especially with the emergence of [[spruce beer]]. Quebec also produces a great number of high-quality wines including [[ice wine]] and [[ice cider]]. Because of the climate and available resources, it is only since the 1980s that these drinks can be produced in industrial quantities. Today there are nearly a hundred breweries and companies, including [[Unibroue]], [[Molson Coors]], [[Labatt]] and many others. 

Quebec has produced cheese for centuries. Most of the first cheeses were soft cheeses, but after the [[Conquest of New France]], hard cheese began to be created as well. The first cheese-making school in North America was established in Saint-Denis-de-Kamouraska in 1893. It was at this moment that the monks of La Trappe of Oka began to produce the famous [[Oka cheese]]. Today there are over 700 different cheeses in Quebec.

===Sports===
[[File:Boston vs. CH au Centre Bell 007.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Montreal Canadiens]] at the [[Bell Centre]]]]
Sports in Quebec constitutes an essential dimension of Quebec culture. The practice of sports and outdoor activities in Quebec was influenced largely by its geography and climate. [[Ice hockey]] remains the national sport. This sport, which was played for the first time on March 3, 1875, at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal and promoted over the years by numerous achievements, including the centenary of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], still raises passions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Canoe inc. |url=http://fr.canoe.ca/sports/nouvelles/hockey/canadiens/archives/2009/12/20091205-065501.html |title=Un anniversaire douloureux |publisher=Fr.canoe.ca |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> Other major sports include [[Canadian football]] with the [[Montreal Alouettes]], soccer with the [[Montreal Impact]], the [[Canadian Grand Prix|Grand Prix du Canada]] Formula 1 racing with drivers such as [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]], and professional baseball with the former [[Montreal Expos]]. During its history, Quebec has hosted several major sporting events; including the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], the Fencing World Championships in 1967, track cycling in 1974, and the [[Transat Québec-Saint-Malo]] race created for the first time in 1984.

Québec athletes have performed well at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] over recent years. They won 12 of [[Canada at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Canada's 29 medals]] at the most recent [[2018 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang (2018)]]; they won 12 of the [[Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics|27 Canadian medals]] in [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi (2014)]]; and 9 of the [[Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics|26 Canadian medals]] in [[2010 Winter Olympics|Vancouver (2010)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olympic.ca/2018/02/25/who-won-team-canadas-29-medals-in-pyeongchang/|title=Who won team canada's 29 medals in Pyeongchang|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314095047/https://olympic.ca/2018/02/25/who-won-team-canadas-29-medals-in-pyeongchang/|archivedate=March 14, 2018|date=February 25, 2018}}</ref>

In 1939, the [[government of Quebec]] unilaterally ratified its [[Coat of arms of Quebec|coat of arms]] to reflect [[History of Quebec|Quebec's political history]]: French rule (gold lily on blue background), British rule (lion on red background) and Canadian rule (maple leaves) and with Quebec's motto below "Je me souviens".<ref>[http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/ Justice Québec&nbsp;– Drapeauet et symboles nationaux] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009212247/http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/ |date=October 9, 2007 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> [[Je me souviens]] ("I remember") was first carved under the coat of arms of Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] façade in 1883. It is an official part of the coat of arms and has been the official licence plate motto since 1978, replacing "''La belle province''" (the beautiful province). The expression ''La belle province'' is still used mostly in tourism as a nickname for the province.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Flag-of-Quebec.jpg|thumb|upright|The '''[[Flag of Quebec|Fleurdelisé]]''' flying at [[Place d'Armes]] in Montreal]]
The fleur-de-lis, the ancient symbol of the [[French monarchy]], first arrived on the shores of the [[Gaspésie]] in 1534 with [[Jacques Cartier]] on his first voyage. When [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded [[Québec City]] in 1608, his ship hoisted the merchant flag of a white cross on a blue background. By 1758 at the [[Battle of Carillon]], the [[Flag of Carillon]] would become the basis of Quebec's desire to have its own flag. By 1903, the parent of today's flag had taken shape, known as the "''[[Fleurdelisé]]''". The flag in its present form with its 4 white "[[fleur-de-lis]]" lilies on a blue background with a white cross replaced the [[Union Jack]] on Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] on January 21, 1948.

===Other official symbols===

*An official tree, the [[yellow birch]] (''bouleau jaune'', ''merisier''), symbolizes the importance Quebecers give to the forests. The tree is known for the variety of its uses and commercial value, as well as its autumn colours.<ref name="Qsymbols"/>

In 1998 the [[Montreal Insectarium]] sponsored a poll to choose an official insect. The [[Limenitis arthemis|white admiral]] butterfly (''Limenitis arthemis'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/toile/info_insectes/fiches/fic_fiche08_amiral.htm |title=Amiral [Toile des insectes du Québec&nbsp;— Insectarium &#93; |publisher=.ville.montreal.qc.ca |date=May 29, 2001 |accessdate=July 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413163022/http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/toile/info_insectes/fiches/fic_fiche08_amiral.htm |archivedate=April 13, 2010 }}</ref> won with 32% of the 230&nbsp;660 votes against the spotted [[Coccinellidae|lady beetle]] (''Coleomegilla maculata lengi''), the [[ebony jewelwing]] [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculata''), a species of [[bumble bee]] (''Bombus impatiens'') and the six-spotted [[tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela sexguttata sexguttata'').

===Fête nationale (National Holiday)===
{{Main|National Holiday (Quebec)}}
In 1977, the [[Quebec Parliament]] declared June 24 to be Quebec's National Holiday. Historically June 24 was a holiday honouring French Canada's patron saint, [[St. John the Baptist]], which is why it is commonly known as ''La Saint-Jean-Baptiste'' (often shortened to ''La St-Jean''). On this day, the song "[[Gens du pays]]" by [[Gilles Vigneault]] is often heard and commonly regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem. The festivities occur on June 23 and 24 and are celebrated all over Quebec. In cities like [[Quebec City|Québec]] and [[Montreal|Montréal]], great shows are organized in the main public places (such as the Abraham plains, [[Quebec City|Québec]], or Maisonneuve Park, [[Montreal|Montréal]]) where several of the most popular Quebec artists relay each others{{clarify|date=September 2012}} until late at night.
