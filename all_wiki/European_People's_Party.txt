The EPP has been the largest party in the [[European Parliament]] since 1999 and in the [[European Council]] since 2002. It is also the largest party in the current [[European Commission]]. The [[President of the European Commission]] [[Ursula von der Leyen]] is from the EPP. Many of the [[founding fathers of the European Union]] were also from parties that later formed the EPP. Outside the EU the party also controls a majority in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]].

The EPP includes major centre-right parties such as the [[CDU/CSU]] of [[Germany]], [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] of France, [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|CD&V]] of Belgium, [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]] of Romania, [[Fine Gael]] of Ireland, [[National Coalition Party]] of Finland, [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] of Greece, [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] of Italy, the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) of Spain, the [[Civic Platform]] of Poland and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] of Portugal, but also the [[right-wing populist]] [[Fidesz]] of Hungary.

According to its website, the EPP is "the family of the political centre-right, whose roots run deep in the history and civilisation of the European continent, and [which] has pioneered the European project from its inception".<ref name="about">{{cite web |author=administrator |url=http://www.epp.eu/party.asp?z=5B |title=EPP &#124; European People's Party |publisher=Epp.eu |accessdate=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901101937/http://www.epp.eu/party.asp?z=5B |archivedate=1 September 2011  }}</ref>

The EPP was founded in Luxembourg on 8 July 1976 on the initiative of [[Jean Seitlinger]]; [[Leo Tindemans]], then [[Prime Minister of Belgium]], who became the first President of the EPP; and [[Wilfried Martens]], who later became both President of the EPP and Prime Minister of Belgium.

In the late 1990s the Finnish politician [[Sauli Niinistö]] negotiated the merger of the [[European Democrat Union]] (EDU), of which he was President, into the EPP. In October 2002 the EDU ceased its activities after being formally absorbed by the EPP at a special event in Estoril, Portugal. In recognition of his efforts Niinistö was elected Honorary President of the EPP the same year.

The EPP has had six Presidents:

== Platform and manifesto ==
[[File:A23A6062 (42165595065).jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Leo Varadkar]], [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] at an EPP summit in June 2018]]

===Political manifesto and platform===
During its Congress in Bucharest in 2012 the EPP updated its political platform after 20 years (since its Congress in Athens in 1992) and approved a [[political manifesto]] in which it summarised its main values and policies.

The manifesto highlights:
* Freedom as a central human right, coupled with responsibility
* Respect for traditions and associations
* Solidarity to help those in need, who in turn should also make an effort to improve their situation
* Ensuring solid public finances
* Preserving a healthy environment
* [[Subsidiarity]]
* Pluralist democracy and a [[social market economy]]

The manifesto also describes the EPP's priorities for the EU, including:
* European Political Union
* Direct election of the [[President of the European Commission]]
* Completion of the [[European Single Market]]
* Promotion of the family, improvements in education and health
* Strengthening of the common immigration and asylum policy, and integrating immigrants
* Continuation of enlargement of the EU, enhancement of the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] and special relationship frameworks for countries that cannot, or do not want to, join the EU
* Defining a true common [[EU energy policy]]
* Strengthening European political parties

===Electoral manifesto===
As a central part of its campaign for the [[European elections]] in 2009 the EPP approved its election manifesto at its Congress in Warsaw in April that year. The manifesto called for:
* Creation of new jobs, continuing reforms and investment in education, [[lifelong learning]], and employment in order to create opportunities for everyone.
*Avoidance of protectionism, and coordination of fiscal and monetary policies.
*Increased transparency and surveillance in financial markets.
*Making Europe the market leader in [[green technology]].
*Increasing the share of [[renewable energy]] to at least 20 per cent of the energy mix by 2020.;.
*Family-friendly flexibility for working parents, better child care and housing, family-friendly fiscal policies, encouragement of parental leave.
*A new strategy to attract skilled workers from the rest of the world to make Europe's economy more competitive, more dynamic and more knowledge-driven.

===The Fidesz crisis===
Controversy over the undermining of [[rule of law]] in Hungary by ruling party [[Fidesz]] and its leader [[Viktor Orbán]] caused a split in the EPP in the run-up of the [[2019 European Parliament election]].<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/fidesz-epp-european-peoples-party-viktor-orban-what-happens-next/ List of European conservative parties showing defections, wavering or coming out against Viktor Orbán] Retrieved 5 March 2019</ref> On one hand the EPP had been reluctant for years to address Fidesz's stance against the rule of law, expressed by the [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 7 proceedings of the European Parliament]]. On the other hand, European Commission President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], a prominent EPP-member, stated "I believe his [Fidesz’s] place is not in the European People’s Party".<ref>[https://berlinpolicyjournal.com/orban-vs-juncker-for-the-epps-future/ Orbán vs Juncker for the EPP’s future] Retrieved 5 March 2019</ref> Orbán's campaigns targeting billionaire [[George Soros]]<ref>[https://www.dw.com/en/viktor-orbans-campaign-against-george-soros-mercenaries/a-44954661 Orbán's campaign against George Soros] Retrieved 5 March 2019</ref> and Jean-Claude Juncker<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/juncker-hungarys-ruling-fidesz-doesnt-belong-in-epp/ Juncker: Hungary's ruling Fidesz doesn't belong in EPP] Retrieved 5 March 2019</ref> carried wide reverberations for Europe questioning the EPP's effort to install its lead candidate [[Manfred Weber]] as the next Commission president.<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-viktor-orban-love-affair-over-fidesz/ The end of Germany's Orbán affair] Retrieved 5 March 2019</ref>

After years of deferring a decision about the Fidesz issue,<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/european-people-party-manfred-weber-how-the-epp-lost-its-way/ How the EPP lost its way] Retrieved 27 March 2019.</ref> the EPP was eventually compelled to address the problem two months before the 2019 European elections, as 13 outraged member parties requested the Hungarian party's exclusion from the EPP due to its billboard campaign featuring Jean-Claude Juncker. 190 of the 193 EPP delegates decided on 20 March 2019 to partially suspend Fidesz membership. According to this, Fidesz is "until further notice" excluded from EPP meetings and internal elections, but remains in the [[European People's Party group]] of the [[European Parliament]]. Fidesz has not delivered on its earlier promise to leave the EPP in case of a penalty.<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/fidesz-meps-remain-in-the-epp-group-for-now/ Fidesz MEPs remain in the EPP for now] Retrieved 27 March 2019.</ref>

In February 2020 the EPP extended the suspension of Fidesz indefinitely.<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/epp-prolongs-suspension-of-hungarys-fidesz-indefinitely/ EPP prolongs suspension of Hungary's Fidesz indefinitely] Retrieved 7 February 2020.</ref>

On 2 April 2020 thirteen parties within the EPP have issued a joint statement aimed at Donald Tusk, asking him to expunge Fidesz from the party.<ref>[https://index.hu/kulfold/eurologus/2020/04/02/fidesz_kizarasat_keri_13_nepparti_tag_koronavirus_torveny// A Fidesz kizárását kéri a Néppárt 13 tagpártja] Retrieved 2 April 2020.</ref> Three days prior to this, the Hungarian parliament passed a law, declaring a state of emergency within Hungary for an indefinite time period and granting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the right to rule by decree. <ref>[https://www.dw.com/en/hungary-passes-law-allowing-viktor-orban-to-rule-by-decree/a-52956243// Hungary passes law allowing Viktor Orban to rule by decree] Retrieved 2 April 2020.</ref>

==Governance==
The EPP operates as an international non-profit association under Belgian law according to its by-laws, the Statutes of the European People's Party (''{{lang|fr|Statuts du Parti Populaire Européen}}''), originally adopted 29 April 1976.

===Presidency===
The Presidency is the executive body of the party. It decides on the general political guidelines of the EPP and presides over its Political Assembly. The Presidency is composed of the President, ten Vice-Presidents, the Honorary Presidents, the Secretary General and the Treasurer. The Chairperson of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the Presidents of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, and the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] (if they are a member of an EPP member party) are all ''ex officio'' Vice-Presidents.
[[File:Donald_Tusk_(6165309851)_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|250px|President of the EPP [[Donald Tusk]]]]

As of November 2019 the Presidency<ref>{{Cite web|title = EPP Presidency|url = http://www.epp.eu/structure/presidency/|website = European People's Party}}</ref> of the EPP is (Vice Presidents in the order of votes received at the EPP Congress in Zagreb):

===Political Assembly===
The Political Assembly defines the political positions of the EPP between Congresses, and decides on membership applications, political guidelines and the budget. The Political Assembly is composed of designated delegates from EPP member parties, associated parties, member associations and other affiliated groups. The Political Assembly meets at least three times a year.

===Congress===
The Congress is the highest decision-making body of the EPP. It is composed of delegates from member parties, EPP associations, [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]] MEPs, the EPP Presidency, national heads of party and government, and European Commissioners who belong to a member party, with the numbers of delegates being weighted according to the EPP's share of MEPs, and individual delegates being elected by member parties according to member parties' rules.{{sfn|Jansen|Van Hecke|2011|p=109}}

Under the EPP's statutes the Congress must meet once every three years, but it also meets normally during the years of elections for the European Parliament (every five years), and extraordinary Congresses have also been summoned. The Congress elects the EPP Presidency every three years, decides on the main policy documents and electoral programmes, and provides a platform for the EPP's heads of government and party leaders.

==Activities within the party==

===Summit===
EPP leaders meet for the EPP Summit a few hours before each meeting of the [[European Council]] in order to formulate common positions. Invitations are sent by the EPP President and attendees include, besides the members of the EPP's Presidency, all Presidents and Prime Ministers who are members of the European Council and belong to the EPP; the Presidents of the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Council]], as well as the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative for Foreign Affairs]], provided that they belong to the EPP; Deputy Prime Ministers or other ministers in those cases where the Prime Minister of a country does not belong to an EPP member party; and, where no EPP member party is part of a government, the leaders of the main EPP opposition party.

[[File:EPP Summit March 2011 (65).jpg|thumb|center|600px|Reunion Picture at 2011 Summit]]

===Ministerial meetings===
Following the pattern of the EPP Summit the party also organises regular EPP Ministerial meetings before each meeting of the [[Council of the European Union]], with ministers, deputy ministers, secretaries of state and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] in the specific policy field attending:
* General Affairs
* Foreign Affairs
* Economy and Finance
* Home Affairs
* Justice
* Defence
* Employment and Social Affairs
* Industry
* Agriculture
* Energy
* Environment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |title=EPP website |accessdate=23 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908152009/http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |archivedate=8 September 2011  }}</ref>

===Other activities===
The EPP also organises working groups on different issues and on an ad hoc basis, as well as meetings with its affiliated members in the [[European Commission]]. It also invites individual Commissioners to the EPP Summit meetings and to EPP Ministerial meetings.

Following amendments to the EU Regulation that governs [[Europarties]] in 2007, the EPP, like the other "Europarties", is responsible for organising a pan-European campaign for the [[European elections]] every five years. According to the [[Lisbon Treaty]], the parties must present candidates for [[President of the European Commission]], but the EPP had already done this by endorsing [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] for a second term in April 2009.

The year 2014 saw the first fully fledged campaign of the EPP ahead of the [[2014 European Parliament election|European elections of that year]]. The party nominated former Luxembourgish Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] as its candidate for President of the European Commission and led a pan-European campaign in coordination with the national campaigns of all its member parties.

== Activities within European institutions ==
As of December 2019, the EPP will hold the Presidency of the European Commission with [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (CDU).

The EPP also has other heads of state or government who do not normally take part in the [[European Council]] or EPP summits since that responsibility belongs to the other leaders of their countries: [[János Áder]] (Hungary, Fidesz), [[Sauli Niinistö]] (Finland, KOK).

===In the Council of Europe===
The Group of the EPP in the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]] defends freedom of expression and information, as well as freedom of movement of ideas and religious tolerance. It promotes the principle of subsidiarity and local autonomy, as well as the defence of national, social and other minorities. The EPP/CD Group is led by Aleksander Pociej, a member of the Polish [[Civic Platform]].

The EPP/CD group also includes members from parties that are not related to the EPP itself, including members of the [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] (Liechtenstein), the [[Progressive Citizens' Party]] (Liechtenstein), and the [[National and Democratic Union]] (Monaco).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/AssemblyList/Annuaire_02W_Groups.asp?GroupID=2 |title=PACE website |accessdate=21 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831222144/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/AssemblyList/Annuaire_02W_Groups.asp?GroupID=2 |archivedate=31 August 2012  }}</ref>

===In the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe===
The "EPP and like-minded Group" in the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) is the most active political group in that body. The Group meets on a regular basis and promotes the EPP's positions. The members of the EPP Group also participate in the election-monitoring missions of the OSCE.

The Group is chaired by [[Walburga Habsburg Douglas]] (Sweden), and its Vice-Presidents are [[Consiglio Di Nino]] (Canada), Vilija Aleknaitė Abramikiene (Lithuania), Laura Allegrini (Italy) and [[George Tsereteli]] (Georgia).

The Group also includes members of parties not related to the EPP, accounting for the "like-minded" part of its name. Among them are members of the [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] (Liechtenstein), the [[Union for the Principality]] (Monaco), the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] of the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the United States.

It is led by the German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] politician Karl Lamers, who is also the current President of the Assembly. The Group also included members of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the United States, but now they're members of [[European Conservatives and Reformists Party|Conservative Group]]
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP in the USA (26).jpg|thumb|right|250px|From left to right: López-Istúriz, McCain & Martens]]

===Relations with the United States===
The EPP has close relations with the [[International Republican Institute]] (IRI), an organisation funded by the U.S. government specially to promote democracy and democratisation. The EPP and the IRI cooperate within the framework of the European Partnership Initiative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iri.org/countries-and-programs/europe/european-partnership-initiative |title=European Partnership Initiative &#124; International Republican Institute |publisher=IRI |accessdate=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111082437/http://www.iri.org/countries-and-programs/europe/european-partnership-initiative |archivedate=11 November 2011  }}</ref>

===Global networks===
The EPP is the European wing of two global centre-right organisations, the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU) and the [[Christian Democrat International]] (CDI).

== Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies ==
{{main|Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies}}

Following the revision in 2007 of the EU Regulation that governs [[European political parties]], allowing the creation of European foundations affiliated to [[Europarties]], the EPP established in the same year its official foundation/think tank, the Centre for European Studies (CES). The CES includes as members all the major national think tanks and foundations affiliated to EPP member parties: the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] (CDU), the [[Hanns Seidel Foundation]] (CSU), the [[FAES|Foundation for Analysis and Social Studies]] (PP), the [[Constantinos Karamanlis Institute for Democracy]] (ND), the [[Jarl Hjalmarson Foundation]] (MOD), the [[Political Academy of the Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) and others. During the European Parliament election campaign in 2009 the CES launched a web-based campaign module, tellbarroso.eu, to support [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], the EPP's candidate for re-election as Commission President.

In 2014, to honour [[Wilfried Martens]] – the late President of the EPP who was also President of the CES – changed its name to [[Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies]] or Martens Centre.

The current President of the Martens Centre is former Slovak Prime Minister [[Mikuláš Dzurinda]].

The Budapest-based [[Robert Schuman Institute]] and the Luxembourg-based Robert Schuman Foundation are also affiliated with the European People's Party.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== EPP associations ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
{{update|date=September 2015}}
The EPP is linked to several specific associations that focus on specific groups and organise seminars, forums, publications and other activities.

===Small and Medium Entrepreneurs Europe (SME Europe)===
{{main|SME Europe}}
SME Europe is the official business organisation of the EPP, and serves as a network for pro-business politicians and political organisations. Its main objective is to shape EU policy in a more SME-friendly way in close cooperation with the SME Circle of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the [[Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (European Commission)|DG Enterprise]] and the pro-business organisations of the EPP's member parties. Its top priorities are to reform the legal framework for SMEs all over Europe, and to promote and support the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. SME Europe was founded in May 2012 by three Members of the European Parliament, [[Paul Rübig]], [[Nadezhda Neynsky]] and [[Bendt Bendtsen]].

===European Democrat Students===
{{main|European Democrat Students}}
European Democrat Students (EDS) is now the official students' organisation of the EPP, though it was founded in 1961, 15 years before the EPP itself. Led by Virgilio Falco, EDS has 40 member organisations, representing nearly 1,600,000 students and young people<ref>[http://thinkingeurope.eu/publications/students-right-way-european-democrat-students-1961-2011 Students on the Right Way: European Democrat Students 1961–2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203172838/http://thinkingeurope.eu/publications/students-right-way-european-democrat-students-1961-2011 |date=3 February 2014 }}. thinkingeurope.eu. Retrieved on 7 September 2013.</ref> in 31 countries, including [[Belarus]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Every year EDS hosts Summer and Winter "universities", and several seminars. It also regularly publishes a magazine, ''Bullseye'', and organises topical campaigns.

===European Seniors' Union===
Founded in [[Madrid]] in 1995 and led by Ann Hermans of the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|CD&V]], the European Seniors' Union (ESU) is the largest political senior citizens' organisation in Europe. The ESU is represented in 26 states with 45 organisations and about 500,000 members.

===European Union of Christian Democratic Workers===
The European Union of Christian Democratic Workers (EUCDW) is the labour organisation of the EPP, with 24 member organisations in 18 different countries. As the officially recognised EPP association of workers, the EUCDW is led by [[Elmar Brok]], [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. It aims at the political unification of a democratic Europe, the development of the EPP on the basis of Christian social teaching, and the defence of workers' interests in European policy-making.

===Women of the European People’s Party===
The Women of the European People's Party (EPP Women) is recognised by the EPP as the official association of women from all like-minded political parties of Europe. EPP Women has more than 40 member organisations from countries of the European Union and beyond. All of them are women's organisations of political parties that are members of the EPP. EPP Women is led by [[Doris Pack]].

===Youth of the European People’s Party===
{{main|Youth of the European People's Party}}
The Youth of the European People's Party (YEPP), led by Lídia Pereira, is the EPP's official youth organisation. It has 64 member organisations, bringing together between one and two million young people in 40 countries.

== Membership ==

Within the EPP there are three kinds of member organisations: full members, associate members and observers. Full members are parties from EU states. They have absolute rights to vote in all the EPP's organs and on all matters. Associate members have the same voting rights as full members except for matters concerning the EU's structure or policies. These associate members are parties from EU candidate countries and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] countries. Observer parties can participate in all the activities of the EPP, and attend the Congresses and Political Assemblies, but they do not have any voting rights.

A special status of "supporting member" is granted by the Presidency to individuals and associations. Although they do not have voting rights, they can be invited by the President to attend meetings of certain organs of the party.
