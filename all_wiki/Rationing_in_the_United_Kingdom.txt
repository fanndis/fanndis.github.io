At the start of the [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, the United Kingdom was importing 20 million [[long ton]]s of food per year, including about 70% of its cheese and sugar, almost 80% of fruit and about 70% of cereals and fats. The UK also imported more than half of its meat, and relied on imported feed to support its domestic meat production. The civilian population of the country was about 50 million.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Macrory |title=Annual Abstract of Statistics |number=146 |edition=2010 |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] | url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ctu/annual-abstract-of-statistics/no-146--2010-edition/annual-abstract-of-statistics.pdf |year=2010 |accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2020}} It was one of the principal strategies of the Germans in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] to attack shipping bound for Britain, restricting British industry and potentially starving the nation into submission.

To deal with sometimes extreme shortages, the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] instituted a system of rationing. To buy most rationed items each person had to register at chosen shops, and was provided with a ration book containing coupons. The shopkeeper was provided with enough food for registered customers. Purchasers had to present ration books with them when shopping so that the coupon or coupons could be cancelled as these pertained to rationed items.

In line with its [[Business as usual (policy)|business as usual]] policy during the [[First World War]], the government was initially reluctant to try to control the food markets.<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel J. |last=Hurwitz |title=State Intervention in Great Britain: Study of Economic Control and Social Response, 1914–1919 |isbn=978-1-136-93186-4 |year=2013 |pages=12–29}}</ref> It fought off attempts to introduce minimum prices in cereal production, though relenting in the area of control of essential imports (sugar, meat, and grains). When it did introduce changes, they were limited. In 1916, it became illegal to consume more than two courses while lunching in a public eating place or more than three for dinner; fines were introduced for members of the public found feeding the pigeons or stray animals.<ref>Ian Beckett, ''The Home Front 1914–1918: How Britain Survived the Great War'' (2006) p. 381</ref>

In January 1917, Germany started [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] to try to starve Britain into submission. To meet this threat, voluntary rationing was introduced in February 1917. Bread was subsidised from September that year; prompted by local authorities taking matters into their own hands, compulsory rationing was introduced in stages between December 1917 and February 1918 as Britain's supply of wheat decreased to just six weeks' consumption.<ref>John Morrow, ''The Great War: An Imperial History'' (2005)  p. 202</ref> To help the process, ration books were introduced in July 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar.<ref>Alan Warwick Palmer and Veronica Palmer, '' The chronology of British history'' (1992) pp. 355–356</ref> For the most part, rationing benefited the health of the country.

== The General Strike 1926 ==
The government made preparations to ration food in 1925, in advance of an expected [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]], and appointed Food Control Officers for each region. In the event, the Trades Unions of the London docks organized blockades by crowds, but convoys of lorries under military escort took the heart out of the strike, so that the measures did not have to be implemented.<ref>{{cite book |first=William Keith |last=Hancock |first2=Margaret |last2=Gowing |title=British War Economy |edition=rev. |year=1975 |series=History of the Second World War |volume=1 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |page=52 |oclc=874487495}}</ref>

[[File:Sample UK Childs Ration Book WW2.jpg|thumb|upright|Child's ration book, used during the Second World War]]
When the Second World War began in September 1939 petrol was the first commodity to be controlled. On 8 January 1940 bacon, butter and sugar were rationed. Meat, tea, jam, biscuits, [[breakfast cereals]], cheese, eggs, lard, milk, canned and dried fruit were rationed subsequently but not all at once. In June 1942 the [[Combined Food Board]] was set up by the United Kingdom and the United States to coordinate the world supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. Almost all foods apart from vegetables and bread were rationed by August 1942. Strict rationing inevitably created a [[black market]]. Almost all controlled items were rationed by weight but meat was rationed by price.

Fresh vegetables and fruit were not rationed, but supplies were limited. Some types of imported fruit all but disappeared. Lemons and bananas became unobtainable for most of the war; oranges continued to be sold, but greengrocers customarily reserved them for children and pregnant women who could prove their condition by producing their distinctive ration books. Other domestically grown fruit such as apples still appeared from time to time. However, sellers imposed their own restrictions so that customers were often not allowed to buy more than one apple each. Many grew their own vegetables, greatly encouraged by the highly successful [[Victory garden|"Dig for Victory"]] [[motivational]] campaign. In 1942 many children between ages five and seven years had become used to the wartime restrictions. When questioned about bananas, many did not believe such items existed.<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey.

Guinness Publishing {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}</ref> [[Game (food)|Game]] meat such as [[rabbit]] and [[Common Wood Pigeon|pigeon]] was not rationed but was not always available. Landed estate owners were able to enjoy game obtained on their property and share with their friends. A popular music-hall song, written 20 years previously but sung ironically, was "[[Yes! We Have No Bananas]]". During food rationing British biologists ate [[laboratory rat]]s.<ref name="Diamond2006">{{cite book |author=Jared M.

Most controversial was bread which was not rationed until after the war ended. The "[[national loaf]]" of wholemeal bread replaced the ordinary white variety to the distaste of most housewives who found it mushy, grey and easy to blame for digestion problems.<ref>{{cite book |first=Angus |last=Calder |title=The people's war: Britain 1939–45 |year=1992 |pages=276–77 |edition=New |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=978-0-7126-5284-1}}</ref> In May 1942, an order was passed that meals served in hotels and restaurants might not cost over five shillings per customer, might not be of more than three courses, and not more than one course might contain meat, fish or poultry. This was partly in response to increasing public concerns that "luxury" off-ration foodstuffs were being unfairly obtained by those who could afford to dine regularly in restaurants.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38329257 |work=Army News |place=Darwin, Australia |date=14 May 1942 |title=British food control |publisher=[[Trove]]}}</ref>

Fish was not rationed, but prices increased considerably as the war progressed. The government initially did not ration fish, for fishermen at risk from enemy attack had to be paid a premium for their catch in order to fish at all, but prices were controlled from 1941.<ref name="AgFish1946">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Fisheries in War Time: Report on the Sea Fisheries of England and Wales by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for the Years 1939–1944 Inclusive |publisher=H.M. Stationery Office |year=1946}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2020}} Like other non-rationed items, fish was seldom available in abundance. Supplies dropped to 30% of pre-war levels,<ref name="AgFish1946"/> and long queues built up at fishmongers and [[fish and chip shop]]s. Wartime fish and chips was often felt to be below standard because of the low-quality fat available for frying.

Although alcoholic beverages like wine and whisky were not rationed, all drinks except beer were scarce with many consumers self-rationing their own drinks cabinets. Beer in itself was considered a vital foodstuff as it was a morale booster. However, brewers had a shortage of labour due to many of their workers having been called up, making beer difficult to produce. Brewers also suffered the scarcity of the important imported barley in the beer-making process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allaboutbeer.com/article/beer-goes-to-war/|title=Beer Goes to War|website=All About Beer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref> Likewise the ban on importing sugar for brewing and racketing made beer strengths weaker as brewers watered it down. The shortage of labour additionally caused problems for many pubs and bars, with many newspapers in the early years having many column inches of job ads for pubs as their regular staff were called up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2019/02/12/What-did-pubs-do-during-World-War-1-and-World-War-2|title=How the pub survived the World Wars|last=morningadvertiser.co.uk|website=morningadvertiser.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>

As the war progressed, rationing was extended to other commodities such as [[clothing]], which was rationed on a points system. When it was introduced, on 1 June 1941, no clothing coupons had been issued. At first unused margarine coupons in ration books were valid for clothing. In the beginning the allowance was enough for about one new outfit per year; as the war progressed, the points were reduced until buying a coat used almost a year's clothing coupons. On 1 July 1942 the basic civilian petrol ration, announced on 13 March 1942, was abolished<ref name=suckingeggs/>{{page needed|date=September 2020}} ([[Ivor Novello]], a prominent British public figure in the entertainment industry, was sent to prison for four weeks for misusing petrol coupons). Henceforth vehicle fuel was only available to official users, such as the emergency services, bus companies and farmers. The priority users of fuel were always, of course, the armed forces.{{Original research inline|date=September 2020}} Fuel supplied to approved users was [[Fuel dye|dyed]], and use of this fuel for non-essential purposes was an offence.

Certain foodstuffs that the 1940s British consumer would find unusual, for example [[whale meat]] and canned [[Thyrsites atun|snoek]] fish from South Africa, were not rationed. Despite this, they did not prove popular.<ref name="kynaston" /><ref name="patten">{{cite book |first=Marguerite |last=Patten |author-link=Marguerite Patten |publisher=[[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]] |title=Feeding the Nation |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-600-61472-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2020}}

In addition to rationing, the government equalized the food supply through subsidies on items consumed by the poor and the working class. In 1942–43, £145&nbsp;million was spent on food subsidies, including £35&nbsp;million on bread, flour and oatmeal, £23&nbsp;&nbsp;million on meat and the same on potatoes, £11&nbsp;million on milk, and £13&nbsp;million on eggs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Keesing's Contemporary Archives''|volume=IV–V|date=June 1943|page=5,805}}</ref>

[[File:Members of the public enjoying a meal in one of the chain of British Restaurants established during the Second World War, London, 1943. D12268.jpg|thumb|A [[British Restaurant]] in London, 1943]]
Restaurants were initially exempt from rationing but this was resented, as people with more money could supplement their food rations by eating out frequently. In May 1942, the Ministry of Food issued new restrictions on restaurants:<ref>{{cite book |title=Keesing's Contemporary Archives |volume=IV |date=June 1942 |page=5,224}}</ref>
* Meals were limited to three courses; only one component dish could contain fish or game or poultry (but not more than one of these)
* In general, no meals could be served between 11:00&nbsp;p.m. and 5:00&nbsp;a.m. without a special licence
* The maximum price of a meal was 5 shillings ({{inflation|UK|0.25|1942|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}). Extra charges allowed for cabaret shows and luxury hotels.

About 2,000 new wartime establishments called [[British Restaurant]]s were run by local authorities in schools and church halls. Here a plain three-course meal cost only 9[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] ({{inflation|UK|0.0375|1942|fmt=eq|r=2|cursign=£}}) and no ration coupons were required. They evolved from the [[London County Council]]'s ''Londoners' Meals Service'', which began as an emergency system for feeding people who had been blitzed out of their homes. They were open to all and mostly served office and industrial workers.{{sfn|Home Front Handbook|p=78}}<ref name="hif">{{cite book |title=Sources for the History of London 1939–45: Rationing |chapter=5.

In December 1939, [[Elsie Widdowson]] and [[Robert McCance]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] tested whether the United Kingdom could survive with only domestic food production if U-boats ended all imports. Using 1938 food production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers one egg, {{convert|1|lb|g|-1|spell=in}} of meat and {{convert|4|oz|g|spell=in}} of fish a week; {{convert|1/4|imppt|ml|spell=in}} of milk a day; {{convert|4|oz|g|spell=in}} of margarine; and unlimited amounts of potatoes, vegetables and wholemeal bread. Two weeks of intensive outdoor exercise simulated the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months; the only negative results were the increased time needed for meals to consume the necessary calories from bread and potatoes, and what they described as a "remarkable" increase in [[flatulence]] from the large amount of starch in the diet. The scientists also noted that their [[faeces]] had increased by 250% in volume.{{r|dawes20130924}}

The results{{snd}}kept secret until after the war{{snd}}gave the government confidence that, if necessary, food could be distributed equally to all, including high-value war workers, without causing widespread health problems. Britons' actual wartime diet was never as severe as in the Cambridge study because imports from the United States avoided the U-boats,<ref name="dawes20130924">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/sep/24/fighting-fit-britain-second-world-war |title=Fighting fit: how dietitians tested if Britain would be starved into defeat |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 September 2013 |accessdate=25 September 2013 |last=Dawes |first=Laura}}</ref> but rationing improved the health of British people; infant mortality declined and life expectancy rose, excluding deaths caused by hostilities.

=== Non-food rations ===
====Clothing====
Clothing rationing was announced on 1 June 1941. A major cause was the increased need for clothing materials to be utilized for producing uniforms. By this point in the war, one fourth of the population was  wearing uniforms. Many of the female population who needed uniforms were part of the women's [[Auxiliary Forces|auxiliary forces]]. There were also a lot of volunteer services and organizations.  The materials to make [[tarpaulin]]s and tyres were heavily affected by this rationing. It also became difficult for civilians to get shoes and boots.  

Another major part of rationing was the implementation of a coupon system. There were 66 points for clothing per year; in 1942 it was cut to 48, in 1943 to 36, and in 1945 to 24. This system operated through a "points" system. Clothing was ranked and based on this ranking, civilians would be able to purchase clothing. Clothing rationing points could also be used for wool, cotton and household [[textile]]s. Before rationing [[lace]] and frills were popular on [[panties|knickers]] but these were soon banned so that material could be saved. The number of points that each piece of clothing would be valued at was determined by not only how much labor went into making it, but also how much material was used. A dress could run someone 11 coupons, whereas a pair of stockings only cost 2. Similarly, Men's shoes cost 7 tickets, whiles women's cost only 5. In 1945, an overcoat ([[wool]] and fully lined) was 18 coupons; a man's suit, 26–29 (according to lining); Children aged 14–16 got 20 more coupons.

When purchasing clothing not only did civilians need to have coupons, but they also had to purchase things with money. No points were required for [[second-hand]] clothing or fur [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], but their prices were fixed. People had extra points for work clothes, such as [[overall]]s for factory work.{{sfn|Home Front Handbook|pp=47–48}} Manual workers, civilian uniform wearers, diplomats, performers and new mothers also received extra coupons.

The civilian population was encouraged to repair and remake old clothes by pamphlets produced by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], with the slogan 'Make Do and Mend'.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clouting |first1=Laura |title=10 Top Tips for Winning at Make Do and Mend |url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/10-top-tips-for-winning-at-make-do-and-mend |website=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=8 May 2020 |date=11 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Make Do and Mend – 1943 |url=https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106365.html |website=British Library |accessdate=8 May 2020}}</ref>

From March to May 1942 [[utility clothing|clothing austerity measures]] were introduced which restricted the number of buttons, pockets and pleats (among other things) on clothes.<ref name="Home Front Handbook48">{{harvnb|Home Front Handbook|p=48}}.</ref>

Clothes rationing ended on 15 March 1949.

====Soap====
All types of soap were rationed. Coupons were allotted by weight or (if liquid) by quantity. In 1945, the ration gave four coupons each month; babies and some workers and invalids were allowed more.<ref name="Home Front Handbook48" /> A coupon would yield:
* {{convert|4|oz|0|abbr=on}} bar [[hard soap]]
* {{convert|3|oz|0|abbr=on}} bar [[toilet soap]]
* {{convert|1/2|oz|0|abbr=on}} No. 1 [[liquid soap]]
* {{convert|6|oz|0|abbr=on}} soft soap
* {{convert|3|oz|0|abbr=on}} [[soap flakes]]
* {{convert|6|oz|0|abbr=on}} powdered soap

====Fuel====
The [[Fuel and Lighting (Coal) Order 1941]] came into force in January 1942. [[Central heating]] was prohibited "in the summer months".<ref name="Home Front Handbook48" /> Domestic coal was rationed to {{convert|15|long cwt|sigfig = 4}} for those in London and the south of England; {{convert|20|long cwt|sigfig = 4}} for the rest (the southern part of England having generally a milder climate).<ref name="Home Front Handbook48"/> Some kinds of coal such as [[anthracite]] were not rationed, and in the coal-mining areas were eagerly gathered as they were in the [[Great Depression]] (see ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'').

====Paper====
[[Newspapers]] were limited from September 1939, at first to 60% of their pre-war consumption of [[newsprint]]. [[Paper]] supply came under the No 48 Paper Control Order, 4 September 1942 and was controlled by the [[Ministry of Production]]. By 1945 newspapers were limited to 25% of their pre-war consumption. Wrapping paper for most goods was prohibited.{{sfn|Home Front Handbook|pp=50–51}}

The paper shortage often made it more difficult than usual for authors to get work published. In 1944, [[George Orwell]] wrote:

{{quote|
In Mr [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]]'s recent pamphlet ''Publishing in Peace and War'', some interesting facts are given about the quantities of paper allotted by the Government for various purposes. Here are the present figures:
{{aligned table|class=wikitable|style=margin-left:1em
|Newspapers | 250,000 tons
|[[H.M. Stationery Office]] | 100,000 tons
|Periodicals | (nearly) 50,000 tons
|Books | 22,000 tons
}}

A particularly interesting detail is that out of the 100,000 tons allotted to the Stationery Office, the War Office gets no less than 25,000 tons, or more than the whole of the book trade put together. ... At the same time paper for books is so short that even the most hackneyed "classic" is liable to be out of print, many schools are short of textbooks, new writers get no chance to start and even established writers have to expect a gap of a year or two years between finishing a book and seeing it published.

==== Other products ====
Whether rationed or not, many consumer goods became difficult to obtain because of the shortage of components. Examples included [[razor blade]]s, [[baby bottle]]s, alarm clocks, frying pans and pots. Balloons and sugar for cakes for birthday parties were partially or completely unavailable. Couples had to use a mock cardboard and plaster [[wedding cake]] in lieu of a real tiered wedding cake, with a smaller cake hidden in the mock cake. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.1900s.org.uk/1940s50s-shortages-weddings.htm|title=Decorated wedding cakes in WW2 shortages|website=www.1900s.org.uk|access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref> Many fathers saved bits of wood to build toys for Christmas presents,<ref name="mackay2002">{{Cite book |title=Half the Battle: Civilian Morale in Britain during the Second World War |last=Mackay |first=Robert |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-7190-5893-7 |pages=112–113}}</ref> and [[Christmas trees]] were almost impossible to obtain due to timber rationing.<ref name="webley2003">{{cite book |last=Webley |first=Nicholas |title=A Taste of Wartime Britain |publisher=Thorogood |year=2003 |page=36 |isbn=1-85418-213-7}}</ref>

== Post-Second World War 1945-1954 ==
On 8 May 1945, the Second World War ended in Europe, but rationing continued. Some aspects of rationing became stricter for some years after the war. At the time this was presented as needed to feed people in European areas under British control, whose economies had been devastated by the fighting.<ref name="kynaston" /> This was partly true, but with many British men still mobilised in the armed forces, an austere economic climate, and a centrally-planned economy under the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]], resources were not available to expand food production and food imports. Frequent strikes by some workers (most critically dock workers) made things worse.<ref name="kynaston"/> A common ration book fraud was the ration books of the dead being kept and used by the living.<ref name=suckingeggs/>{{page needed|date=September 2020}}

=== Political reaction ===
In the late 1940s the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity and government bureaucracy. They used the dissatisfaction with the socialistic and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and build a political comeback that won the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]]. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during it.<ref>[[Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska]], "Rationing, austerity and the Conservative party recovery after 1945", ''Historical Journal'' (1994) 37#1 pp. 173–197</ref>

[[File:Food rationing ends.jpg|thumb|Food rationing ends Conservative poster]]

==== 1945 ====
* 27 May: Bacon ration cut from {{convert|4|to|3|oz|g}} per week. Cooking fat ration cut from {{convert|2|to|1|oz|g}} per week. Soap ration cut by an eighth, except for babies and young children.<ref>''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 23 May 1945, reprinted on page 34 of ''Daily Telegraph'' Saturday 23 May 2015</ref> The referenced newspaper article predicted that households would be grossly hampered in making food items that included [[pastry]].
* 1 June: The basic petrol ration for civilians was restored.<ref name="suckingeggs" />{{page needed|date=September 2020}}
* 19 July: In order to preserve the egalitarian nature of rationing, gift food parcels from overseas weighing more than {{convert|5|lb|abbr=on}} would be deducted from the recipient's ration.

==== 1946 ====
* Summer: Continual rain ruined Britain's wheat crop. Bread rationing started.

==== 1947 ====
* January–March: [[Winter of 1946–1947 in the United Kingdom]]: long hard frost and deep snow. Frost destroyed a huge amount of stored potatoes. Potato rationing started.
* Mid-year: A transport and dock strike, which among other effects caused much loss of imported meat left to rot on the docks, until the Army broke the strike. The basic petrol ration was stopped.<ref name="suckingeggs" />{{page needed|date=September 2020}}

==== 1948 ====
* 1 June: The [[Motor Spirit (Regulation) Act 1948]] was passed,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/policejl22&div=33&id=&page=|title=22 Police Journal 1949 Motor Spirit (Regulation) Act, 1948, The|journal=Police Journal|volume=22|pages=280|year=1949|last1=Mills|first1=T.

A private car driver could lose his driving licence for a year if red petrol was found in his car. A petrol station could be shut down if it sold red petrol to a private car driver. See [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1940–1959#1948|List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1940–1959: 1948]].
* June: The basic petrol ration was restored, at a third of its previous size.
* Bread came off ration.

==== Later ====
* May 1949: Clothes rationing ended. According to one author,<ref name="suckingeggs">{{cite book|title=Sucking Eggs|first=Patricia|last=Nicol|publisher=Vintage Books|place=London|year=2010|isbn=9780099521129}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2020}} this was because attempts to enforce it were defeated by continual massive illegality ([[black market]], unofficial trade in loose clothing coupons (many forged), bulk thefts of unissued clothes ration books).
* 23 February 1950: The [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] is fought largely on the issue of rationing. The Conservative Party campaigned on a [[manifesto]] of ending rationing as quickly as possible.<ref name="kynaston" /> The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] argued for the continuation of rationing indefinitely. Labour was returned, but with its majority badly slashed to 5 seats.
* 26 May 1950: Petrol rationing ended.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/26/newsid_2502000/2502691.stm|title=1950: UK drivers cheer end of fuel rations|accessdate=27 March 2009|date=26 May 1950}}</ref>
* 25 October 1951: [[1951 United Kingdom general election]]. The Conservatives came back into power.
* February 1953: Confectionery rationing ended.
* September 1953: Sugar rationing ended.
* 4 July 1954: Meat and all other food rationing ended in Britain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_3818000/3818563.stm|title=1954: Housewives celebrate end of rationing|date=1954-07-04|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>

Although rationing formally ended in 1954, cheese production remained depressed for decades afterwards. During rationing, most milk in Britain was used to make one kind of cheese, nicknamed Government Cheddar (not to be confused with the [[government cheese]] issued by the US welfare system).<ref name=CooksInfo>{{Cite web| url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/government-cheddar-cheese |title=Government Cheddar Cheese |work=CooksInfo.com |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> This wiped out nearly all other cheese production in the country, and some indigenous varieties of cheese almost disappeared.<ref name=CooksInfo/> Later government controls on milk prices through the [[Milk Marketing Board]] continued to discourage production of other varieties of cheese until well into the 1980s,<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2007/10/09/cool_britannia_rules_the_whey.html | title= Cool Britannia rules the whey  |last=Potter |first=Mich | publisher= [[Toronto Star]]  | date= 9 October 2007 | accessdate= 13 July 2011}}</ref> and it was only in the mid-1990s (following the effective abolition of the MMB) that the revival of [[List of British cheeses|the British cheese industry]] began in earnest.

== Suez Crisis 1956–1957 ==
Petrol rationing was briefly reintroduced in late 1956 during the [[Suez Crisis]] but ended again on 14 May 1957.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/14/newsid_2511000/2511733.stm |title=1957: Cheers as petrol rationing ended |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=14 May 1957 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> Advertising of petrol on the recently introduced [[ITV Network|ITV]] was banned for a period.

==Oil crises of 1973 and 1979==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}
Petrol coupons were issued for a short time as preparation for the possibility of petrol rationing during the [[Oil crisis of 1973|1973 oil crisis]]. The rationing never came about, in large part because increasing [[North Sea oil]] production allowed the UK to offset much of the lost imports. By the time of the [[1979 energy crisis]], the United Kingdom had become a [[Oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom|net exporter of oil]], so on that occasion the government did not even have to consider petrol rationing.
