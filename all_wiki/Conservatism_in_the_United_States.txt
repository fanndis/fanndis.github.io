As with all major American political parties, liberty is a core value. American conservatives generally consider [[individual liberty]]—within the bounds of American values—as the fundamental trait of democracy; this perspective contrasts with that of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[Social equality|equality]] and [[social justice]] and emphasize the need for state intervention to achieve these goals.<ref>Gregory L.

Like most American political ideologies, conservatism originates from [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], which rejected [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] and [[Monarchy|monarchical]] government and upheld the principles of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] ("that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness") and the [[United States Constitution]] (which established a [[federal republic]] under the [[rule of law]]). Conservative philosophy is also derived in part from the [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries, which advocated for ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics (i.e. [[economic freedom]] and [[deregulation]]).<ref name="google.com">[https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&lpg=PP1&dq=Modern%20Political%20Philosophy&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Modern Political Philosophy'' (1999), Richard Hudelson, pp. 37–38]</ref><ref>M.

While historians such as [[Patrick Allitt]] and political theorists such as [[Russell Kirk]] assert that conservative principles have played a major role in American politics and culture since 1776, they also argue that an organized conservative movement with beliefs that differ from those of other American political parties did not emerge in the United States until the 1950s.<ref name="Patrick Allitt 2009">Patrick Allitt, ''The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History'',  "before the 1950s there was no such thing as a conservative ''movement'' in the United States.", p. 2, Yale University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-300-16418-3}}</ref><ref name="Kirk, Russell 1953">Kirk, Russell.

[[Fiscal conservatives]] and [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarians]] favor [[small government]], ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economy, low income and corporate taxes, limited regulation, and [[free enterprise]]. [[Social conservatism in the United States|Social conservatives]] see traditional social values as threatened by [[secularism]]; they tend to [[School prayer in the United States|support prayer in public schools]], [[United States pro-life movement|oppose abortion]], and object to both [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil union|civil unions for same-sex couples]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Way We Live Now: On Language; Guns, God And Gays|author-link=William Safire|author=Safire, William|date=January 25, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-1-25-04-on-language-guns-god-and-gays.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>[http://projects.essex.ac.uk/ehrr/V3N1/Afshar.pdf Ahoura Afshar, "The Anti-gay Rights Movement in the United States: The Framing of Religion," ''Essex Human Rights Review'' (2006) 3#1 pp. 64–79]</ref><ref>Glenn Utter and Robert J.

According to [[Peter Viereck]], American conservatism is distinctive because it was not tied to a monarchy, landed aristocracy, established church, or military elite.<ref>Peter Viereck, ''Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill'' (1956), pp. 1–22.</ref> Instead American conservatives were firmly rooted in [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]], which European conservatives opposed. They are committed, says [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], to the belief in America's "superiority against the cold reactionary monarchical and more rigidly status-bound system of European society."<ref>{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Modern Free Society and Its Nemesis: Liberty Versus Conservatism in the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEl91MbLiO0C&pg=PA44|year=2008|publisher=Lexington Books|pages=44–45|isbn=9780739115169}}</ref>

=== Ideology and political philosophy ===
In terms of governmental economic policies, American conservatives have been heavily influenced by the [[classical liberal]] or [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] tradition as expressed by [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]] and a major source of influence has been the [[Chicago school of economics]]. They have been strongly opposed to [[Keynesian economics]].<ref>George H. Nash, ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America since 1945'' (2008) pp 446–55.</ref><ref>Johan Van Overtveldt, ''The Chicago School: how the University of Chicago assembled the thinkers who revolutionized economics and business'' (2007).</ref>

Traditional ([[Burkean]]) conservatives tend to be anti-ideological, and some would even say anti-philosophical,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhinet.org/burke.htm |title=The Value-Centered Historicism of Edmund Burke |publisher=[[National Humanities Institute]] |date=July 29, 2010 |access-date=January 6, 2012}}</ref> promoting, as [[Russell Kirk]] explained, a steady flow of "prescription and prejudice". Kirk's use of the word "prejudice" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.

There are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives—the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as [[opposition to abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]. Religious conservatives often assert that "America is a Christian nation" and call for laws that enforce [[Christian morality]].

Fiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, "unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation".<ref>Grover Cleveland, "The President's message, 1887" (1887) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4cApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=%22unnecessary+taxation+is+unjust+taxation%22+Grover+OR+Cleveland&hl=en&ei=wQnkTePyOOfeiAKJ0Y2TBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK online p. 37]</ref> A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a [[death tax]]. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of [[Ludwig von Mises]], believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that "[[free market]] economics" is the most efficient way to promote [[economic growth]].

Many modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism.<ref name="The Economist">{{cite journal|title=True believers|journal=The Economist

Through much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy. Thus it was the British Labour government—which embraced socialism—that pushed the Truman administration in 1945–1947 to take a strong stand against Soviet Communism.<ref>John Callaghan, "The Cold War and the March of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy", ''Contemporary British History,'' (2001) 15#3:1–25.

Social conservatives tend to strongly identify with American nationalism and patriotism. They often denounce anti-war protesters and support the police and the military. They hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor, duty, courage, loyalty, and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country.

Social conservatives are strongest in the South and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].<ref>Darren Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism'' (W.W. Norton & Company; 2010) shows how migrants to Southern California from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas provided evangelical support for social conservatism.</ref>

=== Fiscal conservatism and economic liberalism ===
{{main|Economic liberalism|Fiscal conservatism}}
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}
Fiscal conservatism is the economic and political policy that advocates restraint of progressive taxation and expenditure. Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as [[starve the beast]]. Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, "My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archive-date=November 20, 2004 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |access-date=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=March 15, 2005 |access-date=December 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The argument in favor of [[balanced budget]]s is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.

This belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement ''laissez-faire'' policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of "rights." The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:
<blockquote>[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref></blockquote>

The economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more [[economic freedom]]. [[Economic liberalism]] can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader [[small government]] philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with [[free-market]] or ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.

Insofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the [[classical liberal]] tradition in the vein of [[Adam Smith]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]].

Classical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.

Modern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the [[Burkean]] notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.

A belief in the importance of the [[civil society]] is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Tocqueville described this as "soft oppression".

[[File:Ronald Reagan TV Address 1981.ogv|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]], outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt)]]
While classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are "simply more productive" or "simply the right thing to do" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the "umbrella" of the conservative movement.

The archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century—the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government in Britain and the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the U.S.—both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.<ref>Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunhöffer (eds), ''Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique,'' [[Routledge]] (February 8, 2006), {{ISBN|0415460034}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiaxAx5l1QEC&pg=PA1 p. 1].</ref> To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%. Reagan also cut individual income-tax rates, lowering the maximum rate from 70% to 28%. He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.<ref>Steven F. Hayward, ''The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution 1980–1989'' (2009), p. 477.</ref> Reagan did not control the rapid increase in federal government spending or reduce the deficit, but his record looks better when expressed as a percent of the gross domestic product. Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%. This contrasts with statistics from 2004, when government spending was rising more rapidly than it had in decades.<ref>Chris Edwards, "Reagan's Budget Legacy," [http://www.cato.org/research/articles/edwards-040608.html ''CATO Institute'' June 8, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206213013/http://www.cato.org/research/articles/edwards-040608.html |date=December 6, 2010 }}</ref>

In the United States today, the word "conservative" is often used very differently from the way it is used in Europe and Asia. Following the American Revolution, Americans rejected the core ideals of European conservatism; those ideals were based on the [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], established churches, and powerful armies.

Conservatism in the United States is not a single school of thought.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Nash |first=George H|date=April 26, 2016 |title=The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America: Then and Now|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/434548/conservative-intellectuals-george-nash-traces-history |magazine=National Review |location=New York City |quote=Modern American conservatism is not, and has never been, monolithic.

In the 21st century United States, types of conservatism include:
* [[Christian right|Christian conservatism]], whose proponents are primarily interested in [[family values]]. Typical positions include the view that the United States was founded as a [[Christian nation]], that [[abortion debate|abortion]] is wrong, that there should be [[school prayer|prayer in state schools]], that [[intelligent design]] or [[creationism]] should be taught in schools alongside [[evolution]], and that marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman and not between two members of the same sex. Many attack the profanity and sexuality in the media and movies.<ref>see Steven Brint and Jean Reith Schroedel, eds., ''Evangelicals and Democracy in America, Volume II: Religion and Politics'' (Russell Sage Foundation, 2009) for scholarly studies</ref>  This faction strongly supported Reagan in the 1980 election. Nevertheless, they intensely oppose the Reagan's 1981 nomination of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to the Supreme Court because she supported a woman's right to abortion. She was confirmed anyway.<ref>Prudence Flowers, "'A Prolife Disaster': The Reagan Administration and the Nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor."

* [[Fiscal conservatism]], a form of conservatism that focuses on low taxes and restrained government spending.
* [[Libertarian conservatism]], a [[Fusionism|fusion]] with [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]]. This type emphasizes a strict interpretation of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], particularly with regard to [[Federalism in the United States|federal power]]. Libertarian conservatism is constituted by a broad, sometimes conflicted, coalition including pro-business social moderates, so-called "[[deficit hawk]]s", those favoring more rigid enforcement of [[states' rights]], individual liberty activists, and many of those who place their socially liberal ideology ahead of their fiscal beliefs. This mode of thinking tends to espouse ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and a critical view of the federal government, its surveillance programs and its foreign military interventions. Libertarian conservatives' emphasis on personal freedom often leads them to have social positions contrary to those of social conservatives, especially on such issues as marijuana, abortion and gay marriage. [[Ron Paul]] and his son [[Rand Paul]] have been influential proponents in the Republican presidential contests, while still maintaining many socially conservative values.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ronald Hamowy|title=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412965804}}</ref>
* [[Movement conservatism]], an inside term for conservatives and the [[New Right#United States|New Right]] in the United States. 
* [[Neoconservatism]], a modern form of conservatism that supports a more assertive, [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy, aimed at promoting democracy abroad. It is tolerant of an activist government at home, but is focused mostly on international affairs. Neoconservatism was first described by a group of disaffected liberals, and thus [[Irving Kristol]], usually credited as its intellectual progenitor, defined a ''neoconservative'' as "a liberal who was mugged by reality." Although originally regarded as an approach to domestic policy (the founding instrument of the movement, Kristol's ''[[The Public Interest]]'' periodical, did not even cover foreign affairs), through the influence of figures like [[Dick Cheney]], [[Robert Kagan]], [[Richard Perle]], [[Kenneth Adelman]] and (Irving's son) [[Bill Kristol]], it has become most famous for its association with the foreign policy of the [[George W. Bush]] administration in the [[Middle East]] that used aggressive military action to ostensibly promote democracy and protect American interests.<ref>{{cite book|author=Justin Vaïsse|title=Neoconservatism: The Biography of a Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3b7syYOqskC&pg=PA244|year=2010|publisher=Harvard UP|pages=244ff|isbn=9780674050518}}</ref><ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''Bush'', "Bush precipitated the deterioration of America's position abroad, led the United States in a $3 trillion dollar war in Iraq that cost more than four thousand American lives, ... and inspired young Muslims throughout the world to join the jihad.", Simon & Schuster; Reprint edition (July 18, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1476741208}}.</ref>
* [[Paleoconservatism]], in part a rebirth of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] arising in the 1980s in reaction to neoconservatism. It stresses tradition, especially Christian tradition and the importance to society of the traditional family. Some such as [[Samuel P.

* [[Social conservatism in the United States|Social conservatism]], a form of conservatism that focuses on the preservation of traditional moral values.
* [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|Traditionalist conservatism]], a form of conservatism in opposition to rapid change in political and social institutions. This kind of conservatism is anti-ideological insofar as it emphasizes means (slow change) over ends (any particular form of government).

== History ==
{{main|History of conservatism in the United States}}
In the United States there has never been a national political party called the Conservative Party.<ref>Michael Kazin et al. eds. ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) pp 117–28.</ref> Since 1962, there has been a small [[Conservative Party of New York State]]. During Reconstruction in several states in the South in the late 1860s, the former Whigs formed a Conservative Party. They soon merged into the state Democratic parties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack P.

All major American political parties support [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and the basic [[classical liberal]] ideals on which the country was founded in 1776, emphasizing liberty, the rule of law, the [[consent of the governed]], and that all men were created equal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Brigid C.|title=Power and Society: An Introduction to the Social Sciences|date=January 1, 2016|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=47–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYx6CgAAQBAJ&q=Power%20and%20Society%3A%20An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Social%20Sciences%20classical%20liberalism%20the%20least%20government%20is%20the%20best%20government&pg=PA47|access-date=March 30, 2016|isbn=9781337025966}}</ref> Political divisions inside the United States often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent polarization, starting with the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Arthur Aughey, Greta Jones, W. T. M. Riches, ''The Conservative Political Tradition in Britain and the United States'' (1992), p. 1: "[T]here are those who advance the thesis that American exceptionalism means [...] [but] there can be no American conservatism precisely because the American Revolution created a universally ''liberal'' society."</ref>

Historian [[Patrick Allitt]] expresses the difference between liberal and conservative in terms not of policy but of attitude:
<blockquote>Certain continuities can be traced through American history. The conservative 'attitude' [...] was one of trusting to the past, to long-established patterns of thought and conduct, and of assuming that novelties were more likely to be dangerous than advantageous.<ref>Patrick Allitt, ''The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History'' (Yale U.P. 2009), p. 278</ref></blockquote>

No American party has advocated European ideals of "conservatism" such as a monarchy, an established church, or a hereditary aristocracy. American conservatism is best characterized as a reaction against utopian ideas of progress.<ref>Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', p. 114, "Conservative ideas are, thus, more genuine and profound than many critics suggest, but such unity as they have is purely negative, definable only by its opposition and rejection of abstract, universal, and ideal principles..."</ref> [[Russell Kirk]] saw the American Revolution itself as "a conservative reaction, in the English political tradition, against royal innovation".<ref name="Russell Kirk 1953 p. 6, 63">Russell Kirk, ''The Conservative Mind'' (1950), pp. 6, 63.</ref>

=== John Adams ===
Political conservatives have emphasized an identification with the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] and the Constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Austin|title=That's Not what They Meant!: Reclaiming the Founding Fathers from America's Right Wing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Cx7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|year=2012|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=9–11|isbn=9781616146702}}</ref>  Historians of conservative political thought "generally label [[John Adams]] as the intellectual father of ''American'' conservatism."<ref>R.B.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2147740 online]</ref> Russell Kirk points to John Adams as the key Founding Father for conservatives, noting that "some writers regard him as America's most important conservative public man."<ref>Russell Kirk, "Adams, John" in John Frohnen, ed., ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' (2006) p 11</ref>  Historian [[Clinton Rossiter]] writes:
{{quote|Here was no lover of government by plutocracy, no dreamer of an America filled with factions and hard-packed cities. Here was a man who loved America as it was and had been, one whose life was a doughty testament to the trials and glories of ordered liberty. Here [...] was the model of the American conservative.<ref>Clinton Rossiter, ''Conservatism in America'' (1955) p 114.</ref>}}

Historian A. Owen Aldridge places Adams, "At the head of the conservative ranks in the early years of the Republic and Jefferson as the leader of the contrary liberal current."<ref>A. Owen Aldridge,  "John Adams: Pioneer American Conservative." ''Modern Age'' (2002) 44#3 pp 217–25.</ref> It was a fundamental doctrine for Adams that all men are subject to equal laws of morality. He held that in society all men have a right to equal laws and equal treatment from the government. However, he added, "no two men are perfectly equal in person, property, understanding, activity, and virtue."<ref>Aldridge, p 224</ref> [[Peter Viereck]] concluded: 
<blockquote>Hamilton, Adams, and their Federalist party sought to establish in the new world what they called a "natural aristocracy." [It was to be] based on property, education, family status, and sense of ethical responsibility. [... Their motive was liberty itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Viereck|title=Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5S0rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|year=1956|pages=89–90|isbn=9781351526425}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Veterans organizations ===
There been numerous large veterans organizations in American history, most notably the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], and the [[American Legion]]. Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946–1947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.<ref>Morten Bach, "None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945–1950," (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) [https://search.proquest.com/openview/15fb275644e81638d7f181805d0899c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y Excerpt]</ref> Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the ''American Legion Firing Line,'' a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the [[John Birch Society]] and antisemitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.<ref>Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'' (1999) pp  479–88.</ref>

The Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the [[John Birch Society]]. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan.  The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9–11, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.<ref>Timothy J Lynch, ed. ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Military and Diplomatic History'' (2013) 1: 38–40.</ref>

=== Bible reading and prayer ===
In 1962, the Supreme Court [[Engel v. Vitale]] decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 [[Abington School District v. Schempp]] decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the [[Christian Right|religious right]] and by 1980 were avid supporters of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=357|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref><ref>Adam Laats, "Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963."

President [[Ronald Reagan]] set the conservative standard in the 1980s. In the 2010s, the Republican leaders typically claim fealty to it.

=== Climate change ===
Modern conservative beliefs often include [[global warming denial]] and opposition towards government action to combat it, which conservatives contend would do severe economic damage and ultimately more harm than good even if one accepts the premise that human activity is contributing to climate change.<ref>Peter J. Jacques; Riley E. Dunlap; Mark Freeman, ''The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism'', Environmental Politics. v12 m3 (2008), pp. 349–385.</ref><ref>George H. Nash, ''Reappraising the Right: The Past and Future of American Conservatism'' (2009) p. 325.</ref>

=== Law and order ===
They support a strong policy of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to control crime, including long jail terms for repeat offenders. Most conservatives support the [[death penalty]] for particularly egregious crimes. The "law and order" issue was a major factor weakening liberalism in the 1960s.<ref>Michael W. Flamm, ''Law and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s'' (2005).</ref> From 2001 to 2008, Republican President [[George W. Bush]] stressed cutting taxes and minimizing regulation of industry and banking, while increasing regulation of education.<ref>Julian E. Zelizer, ed.

Bush: A First Historical Assessment]'' (2010) ch. 6.</ref> Conservatives generally advocate the use of American military power to fight terrorists and promote democracy in the Middle East.

=== Role of government ===
Conservative discourse generally promotes the view that government action is not the solution to problems such as poverty and inequality. In this view, government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce self-reliance. Most conservatives oppose [[affirmative action]] policies, that is, policies in employment, education, and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. Conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as "[[reverse discrimination]]".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schaefer|first=Richard T.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&q=%22reverse+discrimination%22&pg=PT64|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society|date=2008-03-20|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|language=en}}</ref>

Conservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work. However, conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations (especially faith-based charities) in helping the poor.

On the other hand, some conservatives tend to oppose free-market trade policies and support [[protectionism]] instead. They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Social issues ===
On social issues, many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles. They oppose abortion, same-sex marriage, civil unions, and anti-discrimination laws against homosexuals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony Stanford|title=Homophobia in the Black Church: How Faith, Politics, and Fear Divide the Black Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zu4aIFxQ7VwC&pg=PA101|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=101|isbn=9780313398698}}</ref> The libertarian faction tends to ignore these issues, instead focusing on fiscal and monetary policy. Business-oriented conservatives oppose the social conservatives if state laws limiting gay rights threaten to hurt business. The ''National Review'' reported in 2016 that, "as evangelical forces have become less unified...the influence of Right-leaning business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce has only grown."<ref>Elasina Plott, "Georgia Religious-Liberty Fight Reveals Christian Right's Weakened Influence," [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/433600/georgia-religious-liberty-bill-business-interests-beat-christian-right ''National Review''] April 4, 2016</ref><ref>Dale McConkey, "Whither Hunter's culture war?

== Electoral politics ==
According to a 2014 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] Poll, 38% of American voters identify as "conservative" or "very conservative," 34% as "moderate," 24% as "liberal" or "very liberal".<ref>{{cite web|author=Gallup, Inc.|title=U.S. Liberals at Record 24%, but Still Trail Conservatives|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx|work=Gallup.com}}</ref> These percentages were fairly constant from 1990 to 2009,<ref>Juliana Horowitz, "Winds of Political Change Haven't Shifted Public's Ideology Balance," [http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1042/winds-of-political-change-havent--shifted-publics-ideology-balance Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, press release November 25, 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707224129/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1042/winds-of-political-change-havent--shifted-publics-ideology-balance|date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> when conservatism spiked in popularity briefly<ref>Gallup, "U.S. Political Ideology Stable With Conservatives Leading" [http://www.gallup.com/poll/148745/Political-Ideology-Stable-Conservatives-Leading.aspx Gallup, August 1, 2011, online]</ref> before reverting to the original trend while liberal views on social issues reached a new high. Although, the study does show some distinction between the concentration of moderates and conservatives or liberals between the Republican and Democratic parties. Among Democrats, 44% are self-identified liberals, 19% as conservatives, and 36% as moderates. For Republicans 70% self-identified as conservative, 24% as moderate, and 5% as liberal.

Conservatism appears to be growing stronger at the state level. The trend is most pronounced among the "least well-off, least educated, most blue collar, most economically hard-hit states." according to ''Atlantic'' writer [[Richard Florida]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Florida|first1=Richard|year=2012|title=Why America Keeps Getting More Conservative|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/why-america-keeps-getting-more-conservative/252995/|journal=The Atlantic}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Florida|first1=Richard|year=2011|title=The Conservative States of America|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/03/the-conservative-states-of-america/71827/|journal=The Atlantic}}</ref>

In the United States, the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] has been the party of conservatism since the 1890s, although there was a strong Eastern liberal wing. Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], based in the South and strongly opposed to [[Civil Rights]], grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3–1 Democratic to 3–1 Republican between 1960 and 2000.

In addition, some American libertarians, in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes—for instance, further dismantling the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare system]] or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value. However, many libertarian think-tanks such as the [[Cato Institute]], and libertarian intellectuals such as [[David Boaz]] describe libertarianism as being "socially liberal and fiscally conservative."<ref name=Moseley>{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Daniel|title=What is Libertarianism?|journal=Basic Income Studies|date=June 25, 2011|volume=6|issue=2|page=2|ssrn=1872578|doi=10.1515/1932-0183.1215|s2cid=154364669}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Boaz|first=David|title=The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarian-vote-age-obama|work=Policy Analysis|publisher=Cato Institute|access-date=February 24, 2012|author2=David Kirby|date=January 21, 2010}}</ref>

=== Russell Kirk's principles of conservatism ===
[[Russell Kirk]] developed six "canons" of conservatism, which Gerald J. Russello described as follows:
# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]].
# An affection for the "variety and mystery" of human existence.
# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions.
# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked.
# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription.
# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.<ref>Russello, Gerald J., 1996, "The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk," ''Modern Age'' 38: 354–363. {{ISSN|0026-7457}}.</ref>

Kirk said that Christianity and [[Western culture|Western civilization]] are "unimaginable apart from one another"<ref>[http://www.robertsgriffin.com/ConservBookshelf.pdf Book Review] by Robert S. Griffin of Chilton Williamson Jr., ''The Conservative Bookshelf: Essential Works That Impact Today's Conservative Thinkers'', [http://robertsgriffin.com robertsgriffin.com].</ref> and that "all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief."<ref>Stephen Goode, [http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/news/pressroom/inthenews/other/books_faith.html Higher Education: Uniting the Great Books and Faith] (August 2, 2004), Thomas Aquinas College.</ref>

In later works, Kirk expanded this list into his "Ten Principles of Conservatism"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/ten-conservative-principles/|title=The Russell Kirk Center: Ten Conservative Principles by Russell Kirk|work=kirkcenter.org|date=March 19, 2007}}</ref> which are as follows:
# First, the conservative believes that there exists an enduring moral order.
# Second, the conservative adheres to custom, convention, and continuity.
# Third, conservatives believe in what may be called the principle of prescription.
# Fourth, conservatives are guided by their principle of prudence.
# Fifth, conservatives pay attention to the principle of variety.
# Sixth, conservatives are chastened by their principle of imperfectability.
# Seventh, conservatives are persuaded that freedom and property are closely linked.
# Eighth, conservatives uphold voluntary community, quite as they oppose involuntary collectivism.
# Ninth, the conservative perceives the need for prudent restraints upon power and upon human passions.
# Tenth, the thinking conservative understands that permanence and change must be recognized and reconciled in a vigorous society.

=== Courts ===
One stream of conservatism exemplified by [[William Howard Taft]] extols independent judges as experts in fairness and the final arbiters of the Constitution. In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.<ref>Lewis L. Gould, ''The William Howard Taft Presidency'' (2009) p. 175</ref><ref>Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p. 111.</ref>

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a liberal Democrat, did not attack the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the [[conservative coalition]]. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937–60.<ref>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) p. 525.</ref>

Conservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/conservatives-and-the-court|title=Conservatives and the Court|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref> A recent variant of conservatism condemns "judicial activism"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the [[Warren Court]] in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s attacks on the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1857.<ref>Graber and Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p114</ref><ref>Mark V. Tushnet, ''A Court Divided: The Rehnquist Court and the Future of Constitutional Law'' (2005) p. 338.</ref>

==== Originalism ====
{{main|Originalism}}
A more recent variant that emerged in the 1980s is [[originalism]], the assertion that the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted to the maximum extent possible in the light of what it meant when it was adopted. Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, [[strict constructionism]], which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former federal judge [[Robert Bork]] and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.<ref>Johnathan O'Neill, ''Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history'' (2005) pp. 7–11, 208.</ref>

==== Federalism ====
According to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:
<blockquote>The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.<ref>Center for the Study of Federalism, "U.S. Constitution'' (2017) [http://encyclopedia.federalism.org/index.php/U.S._Constitution online].</ref></blockquote>

From the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights has been a "Fig Leaf for conservatives":
<blockquote>Today's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. [...] The conservatives have shrunk the scope of the commerce clause, developed implied limitations on federal authority, and narrowly construed the Civil War amendments.<ref>Herman Schwartz, "The Supreme Court's federalism: Fig leaf for conservatives."

=== Modern media ===
Conservatives gained a major new communications medium with the [[Talk radio#History|resurgence]] of [[talk radio]] in the late 1980s. William G. Mayer, reports that "conservatives dominate talk radio to an overwhelming, remarkable degree."<ref>William G. Mayer,"Why talk radio is conservative." ''Public Interest'' 156 (2004): 86–103.</ref>  This dominance enabled them to spread their message much more effectively to the general public, which had previously been confined to the major [[Big Three television networks]].  Political scientists Jeffrey M. Berry and Sarah Sobieraj conclude that, "conservatives like talk radio because they believe it tells them the truth. Liberals appear to be much more satisfied with the mainstream media and are more likely to believe that it is accurate."<ref>Jeffrey M. Berry and Sarah Sobieraj, "Understanding the rise of talk radio." ''PS: Political Science & Politics'' 44#4 (2011): 762–767.</ref>

[[Rush Limbaugh]] proved there was a huge nationwide audience for specific and heated discussions of current events from a conservative viewpoint.

On the other hand, liberal critic [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that this phenomenon is more due to personal choice than some kind of discrimination or conspiracy, noting that, for example, vocations such as military officers are much more likely to be filled by conservatives rather than liberals.<ref>{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Ideas Are Not The Same As Race|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/ideas-are-not-the-same-as-race/|access-date=August 4, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 8, 2011}}</ref> Additionally, two studies published in the journal of the [[American Political Science Association]] have suggested that the [[Political views of professors in the United States|political orientations of college students' professors]] have little influence or "indoctrination" in terms of students' political belief.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Professors' Liberalism Contagious?

Against postmodern and liberal relativism, cultural conservatives have argued for values of universal truth and absolute standards of right and wrong."<ref>Kellner, ''Grand Theft 2000'' p. 140</ref>

Neoconservative historian [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] has energetically rejected postmodern academic approaches:
<blockquote>[Postmodernism in history] is a denial of the objectivity of the historian, of the factuality or reality of the past, and thus of the possibility of arriving at any truths about the past. For all disciplines it induces a radical skepticism, relativism, and subjectivism that denies not this or that truth about any subject but the very idea of truth—that denies even the ideal of truth, truth is something to aspire to even if it can never be fully attained.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gertrude Himmelfarb|title=The New History and the Old: Critical Essays and Reappraisals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CteYHa3bMLcC&pg=PA16|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=16|isbn=9780674013841}}</ref></blockquote>

Jay Stevenson wrote the following representative summary of postmodern literary studies of the sort that antagonize conservatives:
<blockquote>[In the postmodern period,] traditional literature has been found to have been written by "[[Western canon#Dead white men|dead white males]]" to serve the ''ideological'' aims of a conservative and repressive Anglo ''[[hegemony]]''. [...] In an array of reactions against the race, gender, and class biases found to be woven into the tradition of Anglo lit, multicultural writers and political literary theorists have sought to expose, resist, and redress injustices and prejudices. These prejudices are often covert—disguised in literature and other discourses as positive ideals and objective truths—but they slant our sense of reality in favor of power and privilege.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jay Stevenson|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to English Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00stev|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Alpha Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00stev/page/9 9]–10|isbn=9781592576562}}</ref></blockquote>

Conservative intellectuals have championed a "high conservative [[modernism]]" that insists that universal truths exist, and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths.<ref>Gerald J.

== Historiography ==
In recent years, historians have agreed that they need to rethink the role of conservatism in recent American history.<ref>Kim Phillips-Fein, "Conservatism: A State of the Field," ''Journal of American History'' (Dec 2011) 98#3 pp. 723–743, with commentary by Wilfred M. McClay, Alan Brinkley, Donald T. Critchlow, Martin Durham, Matthew D. Lassiter, and Lisa McGirr, and response by Phillips-Fein, pp. 744–773 [http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/3.toc online].</ref> An important new approach rejects the older consensus that liberalism was the dominant ethos. Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933–1938) and the Great Society (1964–1966).<ref name="Jefferson Cowie 2008">Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, "The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History," ''International Labor & Working-Class History,'' (2008) 74: 3–32.</ref> However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that "The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated. The movement was as fragile as the New Deal coalition that it replaced. [...] Policy change has thus proved to be much more difficult than conservatives hoped for."<ref>Julian E. Zelizer, "Rethinking the History of American Conservatism," ''Reviews in American History'' (2010) 38#2 pp. 367–392, quoting pp. 372, 379.</ref> Zelizer does find four areas where conservatives did make major changes, namely retrenchment of domestic programs, lowering taxes, deregulation, and opposition to labor unions. He concludes, "The fact is that liberalism survived the rise of conservatism."<ref>Zelizer, "Rethinking the History of American Conservatism," p. 379, quote p. 380.</ref>

=== American exceptionalism ===
{{main|American exceptionalism}}
American conservatives typically promote [[American exceptionalism]], the idea that the United States is inherently different from other nations and has a duty to take the lead in spreading democracy and free markets to the world.

Although the term does not necessarily imply superiority, many [[neoconservative]] and other American conservative writers have promoted its use in that sense.<ref>Lipset, ''American Exceptionalism'', pp. 1, 17–19, 165–174, 197</ref><ref>"In Defense of American Exceptionalism," ''The American Spectator'' "[http://spectator.org/archives/2011/03/03/in-defense-of-american-excepti#%20 the conditions American Exceptionalism provides] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018091727/http://spectator.org/archives/2011/03/03/in-defense-of-american-excepti#%20 |date=October 18, 2013 }}, allow us to enjoy the economic and social mobility that other countries envy" and "progressivism rejects American Exceptionalism".</ref> To them, the U.S. is like the biblical "[[City upon a Hill]]"—a phrase evoked by Puritan settlers in Massachusetts as early as 1630—and exempt from historical forces that have affected other countries.<ref>Harold Koh, "America's Jekyll-and-Hyde Exceptionalism", in Michael Ignatieff, ed.''American Exceptionalism and Human Rights'' (2005) p. 112.</ref>

Scholars have argued that British and European conservatism has little or no relevance to American traditions. According to political scientist [[Louis Hartz]], because the United States skipped the feudal stage of history, the American community was united by liberal principles, and the conflict between the "Whig" and "Democratic" parties were conflicts within a liberal framework.<ref>Louis Hartz, ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955), p. 17</ref> In this view, what is called "conservatism" in America is not European conservatism (with its royalty, landowning aristocracy, elite officer corps, and established churches) but rather 19th century [[classical liberalism]] with an emphasis on economic freedom and entrepreneurship.<ref>Rainer-Olaf Schultze et al., ''Conservative parties and right-wing politics in North America'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9bkFRFdl4bQC&pg=PA5&dq=intitle:Conservative+intitle:parties+intitle:and+intitle:right-wing+intitle:politics+intitle:in+intitle:North&hl=en&ei=yydJToz0C_H_sQLt-OWSCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 15 online]</ref> This is in contrast to the view that Burkean conservatism has a set of universal principles which can be applied to all societies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWgdn-U_kRcC&pg=PA1 |title=Arthur Aughey, et al., ''The conservative political tradition in Britain and the United States'' (1992), pp. 1–2 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |year=1992 |isbn=9780838635001 }}</ref> In ''The Conservative Mind'', Russell Kirk argued that the American Revolution was "a conservative reaction, in the English political tradition, against royal innovation".<ref name="Russell Kirk 1953 p. 6, 63"/> Liberal historian [[Richard Hofstader]] criticized modern American conservatives as "pseudo-conservatives" because their negative reaction to the policies of Harry Truman showed "dissatisfaction with American life, traditions and institutions" and because they had "little in common with the temperate and compromising spirit of true conservatism".<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics, and Other Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fbRN-7uyqAwC&pg=PA43|year=2008|publisher=Vintage Books|page=43|isbn=9780307388445}}</ref>

=== Scholarly views on the genetics and psychology of politics ===
In ''Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences''<ref>John R. Hibbing, Kevin B. Smith, John R. Alford, ''Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences'', Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0415535878}}.</ref> three respected scholars provide an in-depth psychological explanation of how a person's genetic makeup predisposes them to be liberal or conservative. The book provides telling examples of how people as erudite and thoughtful as William F. Buckley Jr., Gore Vidal, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson descend to insults, lawsuits, duels, and slander when they are unable to defend their positions by rational argument.

=== Clinton Rossiter's Giants ===
[[Clinton Rossiter]], a leading expert on American political history, published his history of ''Conservatism in America'' (1956) and also a summary article on "The Giants of American Conservatism" in ''American Heritage''.<ref>Rossiter, Clinton, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/giants-american-conservatism "The Giants of American Conservatism"], ''American Heritage'' 1955 6(6): 56–59, 94–96</ref> His goal was to identify the "great men who did conservative deeds, thought conservative thoughts, practiced conservative virtues, and stood for conservative principles". To Rossiter, conservatism was defined by the rule of the upper class. He wrote, "The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical." His "giants of American conservatism" were [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Elihu Root]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives "may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list".

Rossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls "a triumph of conservative statesmanship", Rossiter said conservatives may "take special pride" in [[James Madison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against [[Jacksonian democracy]] include [[Joseph Story]] and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] in Massachusetts; Chancellor [[James Kent]] in New York; [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] in Virginia.

In the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that [[Grover Cleveland]], Elihu Root, [[William Howard Taft]], and Theodore Roosevelt "were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy". In what Rossiter called the "Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History", the ''laissez-faire'' conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism—especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard K. Sherwin|title=Popular Culture and Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzkrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA462|year=2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=462|isbn=9781351553728}}</ref>

Writing in 1955, Rossiter suggests that [[Robert A. Taft]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] may someday be added to the list.
