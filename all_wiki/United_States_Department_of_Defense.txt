The Department of Defense is headed by the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]], a cabinet-level head who reports directly to the [[president of the United States]]. Beneath the Department of Defense are three subordinate military departments: the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], and the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]]. In addition, four [[United States Intelligence Community|national intelligence services]] are subordinate to the Department of Defense: the Defense Intelligence Agency ([[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]), the National Security Agency ([[National Security Agency|NSA]]), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency ([[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|NGA]]), and the National Reconnaissance Office ([[National Reconnaissance Office|NRO]]). Other [[List of Department of Defense agencies|Defense agencies]] include the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]), the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), the Defense Logistics Agency ([[Defense Logistics Agency|DLA]]), the Missile Defense Agency ([[Missile Defense Agency|MDA]]), the Defense Health Agency ([[Defense Health Agency|DHA]]), Defense Threat Reduction Agency ([[Defense Threat Reduction Agency|DTRA]]), the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency ([[Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency|formerly the DSS]]), and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency ([[Pentagon Force Protection Agency|PFPA]]), all of which are subordinate to the secretary of defense. Additionally, the Defense Contract Management Agency ([[Defense Contract Management Agency|DCMA]]) is responsible for administering contracts for the DoD. Military operations are managed by eleven regional or functional [[Unified combatant command]]s. The Department of Defense also operates several joint services schools, including the [[Eisenhower School]] (ES) and the [[National War College]] (NWC).

== History ==
{{See also|National Security Act of 1947|History of the United States military}}

Faced with rising tensions between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British government]], one of the first actions taken by the [[First Continental Congress]] in September 1774 was to recommend that the colonies begin defensive military preparations. In mid-June 1775, after the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the [[Second Continental Congress]], recognizing the necessity of having a national army that could move about and fight beyond the boundaries of any particular colony, organized the [[Continental Army]] on 14 June 1775.<ref>{{cite book| title=For the Common Defense: A Military History of the United States from 1607 to 2012| last1=Millett| first1=Allan R.| last2=Maslowski| first2=Peter| last3=Feis| first3=William B.| edition=3rd| year=2012| orig-year=1984| isbn=978-1451623536| publisher=The Free Press (a division of Simon & Schuster)| chapter=The American Revolution, 1763–1783|chapter-url=https://erenow.net/ww/a-military-history-of-the-united-states-1607-2012/3.php}}</ref><ref name="June 14">{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/birth.html |title=June 14th: The Birthday of the U.S. Army |publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History |date=14 June 2012 |accessdate=19 June 2014 |author=Maass, John R.}}</ref> This momentous event is commemorated in the U.S. annually as [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]].

=== The War Department and Navy Department ===
{{Main|United States Department of War|United States Department of the Navy}}

Upon the seating of the [[1st United States Congress|1st U.S. Congress]] on 4 March 1789, legislation to create a military defense force stagnated as they focused on other concerns relevant to setting up the new government. President [[George Washington]] went to Congress to remind them of their duty to establish a military twice during this time. Finally, on the last day of the session, 29 September 1789, Congress created the [[United States War Department|War Department]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/revolut/jb_revolut_army_1.html | title=Congress Officially Created the U.S. Military: September 29, 1789 | publisher=Library of Congress | accessdate=20 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg95b.pdf |title=Statutes at Large, Session I, Charter XXV |editor=Joe Carmel |date=n.d. |orig-year=Original Statute 1789 |website=Legisworks |access-date=28 January 2018 |quote=An Act to recognize and adapt to the Constitution of the United States the establishment of the Troops raised under the Resolves of the United States in Congress assembled, and for other purposes therein mentioned. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525180057/http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg95b.pdf |archive-date=25 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The War Department handled naval affairs until Congress created the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] in 1798. The secretaries of each of these departments reported directly to the president as cabinet-level advisors until 1949, when all military departments became subordinate to the Secretary of Defense.

=== National Military Establishment ===
[[File:Photograph of President Truman at his desk in the Oval Office, signing the National Security Act Amendments of 1949... - NARA - 200168.jpg|thumb|left|President Truman signs the National Security Act Amendment of 1949]]

After the end of World War II, President [[Harry Truman]] proposed the creation of a unified department of national defense. In a special message to Congress on 19 December 1945, the president cited both wasteful military spending and inter-departmental conflicts. Deliberations in Congress went on for months focusing heavily on the role of the military in society and the threat of granting too much military power to the executive.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hogan, Michael J.|title=A cross of iron: Harry S. Truman and the origins of the national security state, 1945–1954|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-79537-1|pages=37–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd4C3cY7Y7IC&pg=PA37}}</ref>

On 26 July 1947, Truman signed the [[National Security Act of 1947]], which set up a unified military command known as the "'''National Military Establishment'''", as well as creating the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], [[National Security Resources Board]], [[United States Air Force]] (formerly the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]]) and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The act placed the National Military Establishment under the control of a single [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]].<ref name="Polmar-2005-p17">{{cite book|author=Polmar, Norman|title=The Naval Institute guide to the ships and aircraft of the U.S. fleet|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59114-685-8|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MwyTX-iA2wC&pg=PA17}}</ref><ref name="nibley">{{cite web|url=http://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/Article/571293/james-v-forrestal/|title=James V.

Under the [[Department of Defense Reorganization Act]] of 1958 ({{USPL|85|599}}), channels of authority within the department were streamlined, while still maintaining the ordinary authority of the Military Departments to organize, train and equip their associated forces. The Act clarified the overall decision-making authority of the secretary of defense with respect to these subordinate Military Departments and more clearly defined the operational [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] over U.S. military forces (created by the military departments) as running from the president to the secretary of defense and then to the unified combatant commanders. Also provided in this legislation was a centralized research authority, the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]], eventually known as [[DARPA]]. The act was written and promoted by the Eisenhower administration and was signed into law 6 August 1958.

=== Financial discrepancies ===
{{see also|#Criticism}}
A day before the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] announced that the department was unable to account for about $2.3&nbsp;trillion worth of transactions. [[Reuters]] reported in 2013 that the Pentagon was the only federal agency that had not released annual audits as required by a 1992 law. According to Reuters, the Pentagon "annually reports to Congress that its books are in such disarray that an audit is impossible".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Paltrow |first1=Scot J. |last2=Carr |first2=Kelly |title=Reuters Investigates - Unaccountable: The Pentagon's bad bookkeeping |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part1 |accessdate=24 December 2019 |work=Reuters |date=2 July 2013}}</ref> By 2015, the discrepant funds had increased to $6.5&nbsp;trillion for the army alone.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leveck |first=Terrence |title=America's Missing Money |url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/americas-missing-money-15725.html |website=City Journal |accessdate=24 December 2019 |date=16 February 2018}}</ref>

== Organizational structure ==
{{Main|Organizational structure of the United States Department of Defense}}
{{See also|List of Department of Defense agencies}}
[[File:DoD Organization December 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Department of Defense organizational chart (December 2013)]]

The [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]], appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], is by federal law ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|113}}) the head of the Department of Defense, "the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to Department of Defense", and has "authority, direction, and control over the Department of Defense". Because the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] vests all military authority in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the president, the statutory authority of the secretary of defense is derived from their constitutional authorities. Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs, the secretary of defense, and the secretary's subordinate officials generally, exercise military authority.

The Department of Defense is composed of the Office of the Secretary of Defense ([[Office of the Secretary of Defense|OSD]]), the Joint Chiefs of Staff ([[Joint Chiefs of Staff|JCS]]) and the Joint Staff ([[Joint Staff|JS]]), Office of the Inspector General ([[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|DODIG]]), the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], the Military Departments ([[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] (DA), [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (DON) & [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] (DAF)), the [[List of Department of Defense agencies|Defense Agencies and Department of Defense Field Activities]], the [[National Guard Bureau]] (NGB), and such other offices, agencies, activities, organizations, and commands established or designated by law, or by the president or by the secretary of defense.

Department of Defense Directive 5100.01 describes the organizational relationships within the department, and is the foundational issuance for delineating the major functions of the department. The latest version, signed by former secretary of defense [[Robert Gates]] in December 2010, is the first major re-write since 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://odam.defense.gov/omp/Functions/Organizational_Portfolios/Evolution%20of%205100.1.html |title=Organizational and Management Planning |publisher=Odam.defense.gov |accessdate=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507124537/http://odam.defense.gov/omp/Functions/Organizational_Portfolios/Evolution%20of%205100.1.html |archive-date=7 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/510001p.pdf|title=Directives Division|website=www.dtic.mil}}</ref>

{{Main|Office of the Secretary of Defense}}
[[File:DoD Structure Jan2008.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|2008 OSD organizational chart{{update inline|date=March 2018}}]]

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is the secretary and his/her deputy's (mainly) civilian staff.

OSD is the principal staff element of the secretary of defense in the exercise of policy development, planning, resource management, fiscal and program evaluation and oversight, and interface and exchange with other U.S. government departments and agencies, foreign governments, and international organizations, through formal and informal processes. OSD also performs oversight and management of the Defense Agencies, Department of Defense Field Activities, and specialized [[Secretary of Defense-Empowered Cross-Functional Teams|Cross Functional Teams]].

==== Defense agencies ====
OSD also supervises the following Defense Agencies:

}}

==== National intelligence agencies ====
Several defense agencies are members of the [[United States Intelligence Community]]. These are national-level intelligence services that operate under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense but simultaneously fall under the authorities of the [[Director of National Intelligence|director of national intelligence]]. They fulfill the requirements of national policymakers and war planners, serve as [[Combat support agency|Combat Support Agencies]], and also assist non-Department of Defense intelligence or law enforcement services such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

The military services each have their own intelligence elements that are distinct from but subject to coordination, by national intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense. Department of Defense manages the nation's coordinating authorities and assets in disciplines of [[signals intelligence]], [[geospatial intelligence]], and [[measurement and signature intelligence]], and also builds, launches and operates the Intelligence Community's satellite assets. Department of Defense also has its own [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human intelligence]] [[Defense Clandestine Service|service]], which contributes to the CIA's human intelligence efforts while also focusing on military human intelligence priorities. These agencies are directly overseen by the [[Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence]].

The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the Department of Defense who advise the secretary of defense, the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the president on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (CJCS), [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (VCJCS), senior enlisted advisor to the chairman (SEAC), the Military Service chiefs from the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army]], [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[Chief of Naval Operations|Navy]], and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force]], in addition to the chief of [[National Guard Bureau]], all appointed by the president following [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/151-] 10 USC 151.

Following the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] in 1986 the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not have operational command authority, neither individually nor collectively, as the chain of command goes from the president to the secretary of defense, and from the Secretary of Defense to the [[Unified Combatant Command|commanders of the Combatant Commands]].<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C.]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C6.txt §&nbsp;162(b)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529014041/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C6.txt |date=29 May 2013}}</ref> Goldwater–Nichols also created the office of vice-chairman, and the chairman is now designated as the ''principal military adviser'' to the secretary of defense, the Homeland Security Council, the National Security Council and to the president.<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt §&nbsp;151(b)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312222255/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt|date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

# the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], within which the [[United States Army]] is organized.
# the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], within which the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] are organized.
# the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]], within which the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States Space Force]] are organized.

The Military Departments are each headed by their own secretary (i.e., [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] and [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]]), appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. They have the legal authority under [[Title 10 of the United States Code]] to conduct all the affairs of their respective departments within which the military services are organized.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|3013}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|10|5013}} and {{UnitedStatesCode|10|8013}}</ref> The secretaries of the Military Departments are (by law) subordinate to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]] and (by SecDef delegation) to the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|deputy secretary of defense]].

Secretaries of Military Departments, in turn, normally exercise authority over their forces by delegation through their respective service chiefs (i.e., [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]], [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]],  [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the Air Force]], and [[Chief of Space Operations]]) over forces not assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Command]].<ref name="Polmar, Norman 2005 20">{{cite book|author=Polmar, Norman|chapter=Defense Organization|title=The Naval Institute guide to the ships and aircraft of the U.S. fleet|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59114-685-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/navalinstitutegu0018polm/page/20 20]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MwyTX-iA2wC&pg=PA20|url=https://archive.org/details/navalinstitutegu0018polm/page/20}}</ref>

Secretaries of Military Departments and service chiefs do not possess operational command authority over U.S. troops (this power was stripped from them in the [[Defense Reorganization Act of 1958]]), and instead, Military Departments are tasked solely with "the training, provision of equipment, and administration of troops."<ref name="Polmar, Norman 2005 20" />

=== Unified Combatant Commands ===
[[File:GCCMAP 2019.png|thumb|350x350px|Combatant command areas of responsibility]]
A [[unified combatant command]] is a military command composed of personnel/equipment from at least two Military Departments, which has a broad/continuing mission.<ref>{{cite book|author=Watson, Cynthia A.|title=Combatant Commands: Origins, Structure, and Engagements|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=978-0-313-35432-8|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v183dxvXOa0C&pg=PA3}}</ref><ref name="ABA-p44">{{cite book|editor=Whitley, Joe D.|title=Homeland security: legal and policy issues|chapter=Unified Combatant Commands and USNORTHCOM|publisher=American Bar Association|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60442-462-1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJI54yr1ymQC&pg=PA44|display-editors=etal}}</ref>

These Military Departments are responsible for equipping and training troops to fight while the Unified Combatant Commands are responsible for actual operational command of military forces.<ref name="ABA-p44" /> Almost all operational U.S. forces are under the authority of a Unified Command.<ref name="Polmar, Norman 2005 20" /> The Unified Commands are governed by a [[Unified Command Plan]]—a frequently updated document (produced by the DoD), which lays out the Command's mission, geographical/functional responsibilities and force structure.<ref name="ABA-p44" />

During military operations, the chain of command runs from the president to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]] to the [[combatant commander]]s of the Combatant Commands.<ref name="Polmar, Norman 2005 20" />

{{Asof|2019}} the United States has eleven Combatant Commands, organized either on a geographical basis (known as "[[area of responsibility]]", AOR) or on a global, functional basis:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defense.gov/Our-Story/Combatant-Commands/|title=Combat Commands|website=US Department of Defense|access-date=January 14, 2020}}</ref>

The Department of Defense accounts for the majority of federal discretionary spending. In FY 2017 the Department of Defense budgeted spending accounted for 15% of the U.S. federal budget, and 49% of federal [[discretionary spending]], which represents funds not accounted for by pre-existing obligations. However, this does not include many military-related items that are outside the Defense Department budget, such as nuclear weapons research, maintenance, cleanup, and production, which is in the Department of Energy budget, Veterans Affairs, the Treasury Department's payments in pensions to military retirees and widows and their families, interest on debt incurred in past wars, or State Department financing of foreign arms sales and militarily-related development assistance. Neither does it include defense spending that is not military in nature, such as the Department of Homeland Security, counter-terrorism spending by the FBI, and intelligence-gathering spending by the NSA.

=== For FY2019  ===
The FY2019 Budget for the Department of Defense is approximately $686,074,048,000<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comptroller.defense.gov/portals/45/documents/defbudget/fy2019/fy19_green_book.pdf|title=FY 2019 PB Green Book}}</ref> (Including Base + Overseas Contingency Operations + Emergency Funds) in discretionary spending and $8,992,000,000 in mandatory spending totaling $695,066,000,000

[[Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)|Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller)]] [[David Norquist|David L. Norquist]] said in a hearing regarding the FY 2019 budget: "The overall number you often hear is $716 billion. That is the amount of funding for what is called national defense, the accounting code is 050, and includes more than simply the Department of Defense. It includes, for example, Department of Energy and others. That large a number, if you back out the $30 billion for non-defense agencies, you get to $686 billion. That is the funding for the Department of Defense, split between $617 billion in base and $69 billion in [[Overseas Contingency Operation|overseas contingency]]."{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The Department of Defense budget encompasses the majority of the National Defense Budget of approximately $716.0 billion in discretionary spending and $10.8 billion in mandatory spending for a $726.8 billion total. Of the total, $708.1 billion falls under the jurisdiction of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Committee on Armed Services]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] and is subject to authorization by the annual [[National Defense Authorization Act]] (NDAA). The remaining $7.9 billion falls under the jurisdiction of other congressional committees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IF10887.pdf|title=The FY2019 Defense Budget Request: An Overview}}</ref>

The Department of Defense is unique in that it is one of the few federal entities where the majority of its funding falls into the discretionary category. The majority of the entire federal budget is mandatory, and much of the discretionary funding in the budget consists of DoD dollars.

== Energy use ==
{{Main|Energy usage of the United States military}}
The Department of Defense was the largest single consumer of energy in the United States in 2006.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrews Anthony|title=Department of Defense Facilities: Energy Conservation Policies and Spending|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4379-3835-7|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2xbNsaxD4IC&pg=PA1}}</ref>

In FY 2006, the department used almost 30,000 gigawatt hours (GWH) of electricity, at a cost of almost $2.2 billion. The department's electricity use would supply enough electricity to power more than 2.6 million average American homes. In electricity consumption, if it were a country, the department would rank 58th in the world, using slightly less than [[Denmark]] and slightly more than [[Syria]] (CIA World Factbook, 2006).<ref name="Colonel Gregory J 2007">Colonel Gregory J. Lengyel, USAF, The Brookings Institution, Department of Defense Energy Strategy, August 2007.</ref>

The Department of Defense was responsible for 93% of all US government fuel consumption in 2007 ([[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]]: 52%; [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]: 33%; [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]]: 7%; other Department components: 1%).<ref name="Colonel Gregory J 2007" /> The Department of Defense uses {{convert|4600000000|USgal|L}} of fuel annually, an average of {{convert|12600000|USgal|L}} of fuel per day. A large Army division may use about {{convert|6000|USgal|L}} per day. According to the 2005 ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'', if it were a country, the Department of Defense would rank 34th in the world in average daily oil use, coming in just behind [[Iraq]] and just ahead of [[Sweden]].<ref>Colonel Gregory J.

== Criticism ==
In the latest [[Center for Effective Government]] analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the DoD earned 61 out of a possible 100 points, a D− grade. While it had improved from a failing grade in 2013, it still had low scores in processing requests (55%) and their disclosure rules (42%).<ref>[http://www.foreffectivegov.org/access-to-information-scorecard-2015/ Making the Grade: Access to Information Scorecard 2015] March 2015, 80 pages, [[Center for Effective Government]], retrieved 21 March 2016</ref>

In 2015, a Pentagon consulting firm performed an audit on the Department of Defense's budget. It found that there was $125 billion in wasteful spending that could be saved over the next five years without layoffs or reduction in military personnel. In 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' uncovered that rather than taking the advice of the auditing firm, senior defense officials suppressed and hid the report from the public to avoid political scrutiny.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/pentagon-buries-evidence-of-125-billion-in-bureaucratic-waste/2016/12/05/e0668c76-9af6-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html|title=Pentagon buries evidence of $125 billion in bureaucratic waste|last=Whitlock|first=Craig|date=5 December 2016|work=Washington Post|access-date=18 December 2017|last2=Woodward|first2=Bob|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>
