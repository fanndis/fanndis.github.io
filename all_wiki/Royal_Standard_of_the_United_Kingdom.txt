The '''Royal Standards of the United Kingdom''' refers to either one of two similar [[flag]]s used by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her capacity as Sovereign of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Crown dependencies]] and the [[British Overseas Territories]]. Two versions of the flag exist, one for general use in England, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Crown dependencies and the British Overseas Territories; and the other for use in Scotland.

Although almost universally called a standard, such flags when used in the United Kingdom are [[banner of arms|banners of arm]]s, as they comprise the [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]] of the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]]. Since the 1960s, Queen Elizabeth II has had several personal flags designed for her use as sovereign of certain [[Commonwealth realm]]s. These [[heraldic flag]]s are similar to those of the British "Royal Standard" in being banners of the nation's arms but feature a device found in the Queen's general personal flag (a blue disc containing a wreath of gold [[rose]]s encircling a crowned letter 'E')

The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is flown when the Queen is in residence in one of the royal palaces and on her car, ship or aeroplane.  It may be flown on any building, official or private, during a visit by the Queen, if the owner or proprietor so requests. It famously replaces the [[Union Flag]] over the [[Palace of Westminster]] when the Queen visits during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. The Royal Standard was flown aboard the royal yacht when it was in service and the Queen was on board. The only church that may fly a Royal Standard, even without the presence of the Sovereign, is [[Westminster Abbey]], a [[Royal Peculiar]].<ref name=buckingham/>

When the Queen visited the United States in 1991, she was provided with a Cadillac limousine that flew both her standard and the Stars and Stripes, an acknowledgement of the "special relationship" that exists between the two nations.<ref>{{cite web| title=Outbound State Visits Since 1952| url=https://www.royal.uk/sites/default/files/media/outbound_state_visits_since_1952_0.pdf| website=The Royal Household| accessdate=27 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Queen's Address to Congress Celebrates Mutual Respect| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/17/us/queen-s-address-to-congress-celebrates-mutual-respect.html| last=deWitt| first=Karen| date=17 May 1991| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| page=A10| url-access=subscription| accessdate=27 July 2020}}</ref>

The Royal Standard is flown at royal residences only when the sovereign is present. If the Union Flag flies above [[Buckingham Palace]], [[Windsor Castle]] or [[Sandringham House]], it signals that the Queen is not in residence. In 1934, King [[George V]] permitted his subjects in Scotland to display the ancient [[Royal Standard of Scotland]] as part of his silver jubilee.  Today, it flies above [[Holyrood Palace]] and [[Balmoral Castle]] when the Queen is not in residence.<ref name=scotland/>

When the Queen attends [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]], the Royal Standard flies from [[Victoria Tower]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Victoria Tower |url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palacestructure/victoria-tower/ |website=Parliament.UK |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>

Unlike the Union Flag, the Royal Standard is never flown at [[half-mast]], even after the [[demise of the Crown]], as there is [[The King is dead. Long live the King!|always a sovereign on the throne]].<ref name=buckingham>{{cite web| title=Royal Standard| url=https://www.royal.uk/royal-standard| website=The Royal Household| accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

Controversy arose regarding the lack of a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace following the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], in 1997.  The Queen was then in summer residence at Balmoral; and according to established custom, no flag was displayed over Buckingham Palace, as the monarch was not present.  The Queen proposed a compromise whereby the [[Union Flag]] would be flown at half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral.<ref name=diana>{{cite news| title=Blair Defends Royal Family Against Criticism| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/royal1.html| date=4 September 1997| work=[[BBC News]]| accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>   Since then, [[Flags at Buckingham Palace|the Union Flag has flown regularly in the Queen's absence]] and has been lowered to half-mast to mark several occasions such as the death of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]],<ref name=mum>{{cite news| title=Crowds Grieve for Queen Mother| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1902781.stm| work=BBC News| accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>  the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].<ref name=bombing>{{cite news| title=London bombings toll rises to 37| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4661059.stm| work=BBC News| accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>  {{cns|date=April 2019|text=The Union Flag was also flown at [[half-mast]] over Buckingham Palace as a mark of respect on the first anniversary of the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], on Bank Holiday, Monday, 31 August 1998.}}

== England, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Crown dependencies and the British Overseas Territories ==
[[File:Buckingham Palace - Royal Standard.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Standard flying above Buckingham Palace|255x255px]]

In [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], the [[Crown dependencies]] and the [[British Overseas Territories]], the flag is divided into four [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrants]]. The first and fourth quadrants represent the ancient [[Kingdom of England]] and contain three gold [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]]s, (or "[[Leopard (heraldry)|leopard]]s"), [[passant guardant]] on a red field; the second quadrant represents the ancient [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and contains a red lion [[Heraldry#Charges|rampant]] on a gold field; the third quadrant represents the ancient [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and contains a version of the gold [[harp]] from the [[coat of arms of Ireland]] on a blue field. The inclusion of the harp remains an issue for some in Ireland. In 1937 [[Éamon de Valera]], then [[Taoiseach]] asked Dominions Secretary [[Malcolm MacDonald]] if the harp quarter could be removed from the Royal Standard on the grounds that the Irish people had not given their consent to the Irish emblem being included. The request was denied and the harp remains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverirelandmedia.com/index.php?p=n&mr=1&id=128 |title=Media Factsheet: Queen Elizabeth II's State Visit to Ireland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324052408/http://www.discoverirelandmedia.com/index.php?p=n&mr=1&id=128 |archivedate=24 March 2012| publisher=Discover Ireland |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

The modern Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, apart from minor changes, (notably to the form of harp used to represent Ireland), dates to the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]. Earlier Royal Standards of the United Kingdom incorporated the Arms of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]] and of the [[Kingdom of France]], representing the title of [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] (later [[Kingdom of Hanover|King]]) of [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] and the theoretical [[English claims to the French throne|claim to the throne of France]], a claim [[Act of Union 1800|dropped in 1800]]).  The Hanoverian association terminated in 1837 with the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] who, [[Salic law|being a female]], could not accede to Hanover.

Famous Royal Standards of former [[British Monarchs]] include the ''Scotland Impaled'' Royal Standard of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the ''Hanover Quartered'' Royal Standards of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] to [[George III of Great Britain|George III]], and the ''Hanover crowned'' Royal Standards of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. The latter contained the Royal coat of arms of Hanover superimposed over what became the modern Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, although this particular standard's artistic representations of the banners of England, Ireland and Scotland in their respective quadrants was marginally different from the versions used today.

==Scotland==
[[File:Royal Standard Holyrood.PNG|thumb|Royal Standard flying above the Palace of Holyroodhouse.]]

In [[Scotland]] a separate version of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is used, whereby the red [[Lion Rampant]] of the Kingdom of Scotland appears in the first and fourth quadrants, displacing the three gold lions [[passant guardant]] of England, which occur only in the second quadrant. The third quadrant, displaying the gold harp of Ireland, remains unaltered from that version used throughout the remainder of the United Kingdom and overseas.

Other members of the Royal Family also use this Scottish version when in Scotland, with the only exceptions to this protocol being the consort of a queen regnant and the [[heir apparent]], the [[Duke of Rothesay]], each of whom has his own individual standard.

The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland differs from the current, traditional [[Royal Standard of Scotland]] in that the latter portrays the Lion Rampant in its entirety. As the banner of the [[Royal Coat of Arms of Scotland]], the Royal Standard of Scotland remains a personal banner of the monarch <ref>{{cite web| title=Days for Hoisting Flags on Buildings of the Scottish Government 2010| url=http://www.gov.scot/resource/doc/918/0097677.pdf| website=Scottish Government}}{{dead link|date=July 2020}}</ref> and, despite being commonly used as an unofficial second flag of Scotland, its use is restricted under an [[Act of Parliament|act]] passed in 1672 by the [[Parliament of Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Lyon King of Arms Act 1672| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1672/47/paragraph/p1| publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]| date=8 January 1995}}</ref>

The Royal Standard of Scotland is used officially at Scottish royal residences, when the monarch is not in residence, and by representatives of the Crown, including the [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]], [[Lord Lieutenant]]s in their lieutenancies, the [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], and [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]]. A variation of the Royal Standard of Scotland is used by the heir apparent to the [[King of Scots]], the Duke of Rothesay, whose personal Royal Standard is the Royal Standard of Scotland [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with an [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]-coloured [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points. (The banner of the Duke of Rothesay also features the same, displayed upon an inner shield).

==Heir to the Throne==
The direct heir to the Throne has several distinct standards and banners for use throughout the United Kingdom in representation of this position. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] currently has five standards at use for his various roles and titles.

|}

==Other members of the Royal Family==
Other members of the Royal Family have personal standards of their own. These are variants of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, (including that which is used in Scotland), defaced with a white label and either three points or pendants (for children of a sovereign), or five points (grandchildren of a sovereign). Traditionally all princes and princesses of royal blood (i.e. descendants of the sovereign) are granted arms on their 18th birthday, thus giving them a banner to fly from their residences.

The following members of the Royal Family have personal standards, listed according to the line of succession:

===Consorts of the British monarch===
[[Queen consort|Queens consort]] of the British monarch are granted arms based on the Royal Standard and their own personal arms from before their marriage, or the arms of their family. In Scotland, a queen consort will use the Scottish version of the Royal Standard. They do not have different standards for the Commonwealth realms that have their own Royal Standards.

Consorts of a [[queen regnant]] are not granted use of the British Royal Standard. They use standards based on their own family arms.

The fourth quarter, alludes to his title as Duke of Edinburgh, and includes a black and red castle which is also part of the city of Edinburgh's arms.

Other members of the Royal Family may use the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, but within an [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] border, (a white border with black "tails" representing the ermine fur). This standard is mainly used for the wives of British princes, or members of the Royal Family who have not yet been granted their own arms. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and more recently, [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]],<ref name="alice">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3984911.stm| title=Final Royal farewell to princess| date=5 November 2004| work=BBC News| accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=The coffin of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, is carried out...| url=http://www.gettyimages.com/license/51678230| website=Getty Images| accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> had this standard draped over their coffins at their funerals.

[[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], also enjoys the right to use this version of the Royal Standard although she rarely exercises it on her own.  She received a grant of arms on 17 July 2005, which, based on past practice, could form the basis for her own standard.<ref name="cornwall">{{cite web| url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/grants/item/73-coat-of-arms-of-hrh-the-duchess-of-cornwall| title=The Coat of Arms of HRH The Duchess of Cornwall| date=17 July 2005| publisher=[[College of Arms]]| accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>

The Royal Standard is reserved only for the monarch, and is the most used. Most famously it signals the [[Flags at Buckingham Palace|presence of the monarch at a royal residence]], and is also used on official vehicles, primarily the [[Bentley State Limousine]], but also on other road vehicles at home or abroad, often a [[Range Rover]]. The Royal Standard is also flown from [[Air transport of the Royal Family and government of the United Kingdom|aircraft]] and water vessels, including [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']] and [[MV Spirit of Chartwell|MV ''Spirit of Chartwell'']] <ref name="Mbiyu">{{cite news| url=http://www.demotix.com/news/1253713/diamond-jubilee-flotilla-adds-color-thames#media-1253714| title=Diamond Jubilee flotilla adds color on the Thames| last=Mbiyu| first=David| date=3 June 2012| publisher=Demotix.com| accessdate=2013-12-27}} {{dead link|date=April 2019}}</ref> during the [[Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant]].

The [[Prince Charles|Prince of Wales]] flies his standard at [[Clarence House]] in the same way the Royal Standard is used over Buckingham Palace, but other members of the family tend not to fly theirs from their respective residences (though this may be due to the fact that many share official London [[List of British royal residences|Residences]], as is the case at [[Kensington Palace]]).

Family members also do not use their standards on road vehicles, either privately or during official engagements (when more discreet cars are used, such as [[Jaguar XJ (X351)|Jaguar]]) or state occasions (when the Liveried cars of the [[Royal Mews]] are used), this seems reserved for the Queen only, although when [[Prince Philip]] travels alone at state occasions, his standard flies from the roof of his car, as seen with the funerals of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] (when the Queen Mother also flew her personal standard from her car) and that of the [[Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Mother]], also, when a visiting Head of State on a state visit uses a car from the Royal Mews, his/her own flag is displayed.<ref name="kuwait">{{cite news| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1LWYZtb2Pc| title=Pomp and ceremony for Amir of Kuwait| date=29 November 2012| newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location=London| via=YouTube| accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref><ref name="flikr">{{cite web| url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenjonbro/6390654283/| title=Bentley State Limousine| publisher=[[Flickr]]| author=kenjonbro| accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> That said, when abroad, the standards of members of the family may well be flown: examples include Prince Charles,<ref name="teacup">{{cite web| url=http://www.aliceandtheteacupblog.blogspot.com/2012_11_01_archive.html| title=A Brush With Royal-tea!
