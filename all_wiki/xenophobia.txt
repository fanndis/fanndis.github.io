As in most countries, many people in the U.S. continue to be xenophobic against other races. In the view of a network of scores of US civil rights and human rights organizations, "Discrimination permeates all aspects of life in the United States, and extends to all communities of color." Discrimination against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities is widely acknowledged especially in the case of Indians, Muslims, Sikhs as well as other ethnic groups.

Members of every major American ethnic and religious minority have perceived discrimination in their dealings with other minority racial and religious groups. Philosopher [[Cornel West]] has stated that "racism is an integral element within the very fabric of American culture and society. It is embedded in the country's first collective definition, enunciated in its subsequent laws, and imbued in its dominant way of life."<ref>{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Cornel |title=Prophesy Deliverance!: An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity |date=2002 |page=116}}</ref>

A number of discriminatory laws against [[Chinese Indonesian#Post-independence and New Order Era|Chinese Indonesians]] were enacted by the government of [[Indonesia]]. In 1959, President [[Sukarno]] approved [[PP 10/1959]] that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher [[food prices]] and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/02/24/qanda.t_2.php|title=Breaking News, World News & Multimedia|website=www.iht.com}}</ref>

(There are no laws within the Kingdom of Thailand which criminalize racial discrimination and the use of racist cliches which are known in the Western world.

Thailand's laws also include signage which promotes [[racial segregation]] which is just like the [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation which was practiced in the United States]] prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]] and the racial segregation which was practiced in [[South Africa]] under [[Apartheid]].){{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Asian attitudes with regard to skin tones have existed in Thailand for some time. The 20 million members of the [[Isan]] population for instance, many of whom are of [[Lao people|Laotian]] and [[Khmer people|Khmer]] descent, traditionally had darker skin and studies show that many of them consider themselves less desirable than those with lighter skin. [[Skin whitening]] products have proven increasingly popular in most of Asia, including Thailand and they are marketed in a way which promotes the beauty and desirability of light skin.<ref name="int-res">{{cite journal |url=https://www.int-res.com/articles/esep2013/13/e013p027.pdf |date=6 August 2013 |title=Thailand: beauty and globalized self-identity through cosmetic therapy and skin lightening |author=Napat Chaipraditkul |journal=Ethics in Science and Environmental Politics |volume=13 |pages=27–37 |doi=10.3354/esep00134 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>

==== Germany ====
{{Main|Racism in Germany}}
The period after Germany's loss of [[World War I]] led to the increased espousal of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and other forms of [[racism]] in the country's political discourse, for example, emotions which were initially expressed by members of the right-wing [[Freikorps]] finally culminated in the ascent of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi Party's racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against [[Jews]] and other non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]] represented the most explicit racist policies in twentieth century Europe. These laws deprived all Jews (including half-Jews and quarter-Jews) and all other non-Aryans of German citizenship. The official title of Jews became "subjects of the state". At first, the Nuremberg Race Laws only forbade racially mixed sexual relationships and marriages between Aryans and Jews but later they were extended to "[[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Black people|Negroes]] or their bastard offspring".<ref name="Burleigh1991">{{cite book |author=Michael Burleigh |title=The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 |date=7 November 1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39802-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 49] |url=https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 }}</ref> Such interracial relationships were known as "racial pollution" [[Rassenschande]], and they became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws.<ref name="Burleigh1991" /><ref>{{cite book |author=S.

==== Italy ====
{{Main|Racism in Italy}}
[[Anti-Roma]] sentiment exists in [[Italy]] and takes the form of hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed at Romani people. There's no reliable data for the total number of Roma people living in Italy, but estimates put it between 140,000 and 170,000. Many national and local political leaders engaged in rhetoric during 2007 and 2008 that maintained that the extraordinary rise in crime at the time was mainly a result of uncontrolled immigration of people of Roma origin from recent [[European Union]] member state Romania.<ref>Thomas Hammarberg, "Memorandum following the visit to Italy on 19–20 June 2008," the [[Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights]], CommDH(2008)18, para. 26, 28 July 2008</ref> National and local leaders declared their plans to expel Roma from settlements in and around major cities and to deport illegal immigrants. The mayors of Rome and Milan signed "Security Pacts" in May 2007 that "envisaged the forced eviction of up to 10,000 Romani people."<ref>[[Amnesty International]], The State of the World’s Human Rights 2008: Italy, POL 10/001/2008, June 2008, pp. 171-172</ref>

==== Netherlands ====
{{Further|Antisemitism in the Netherlands}}
In the early 2012 the Dutch right-wing [[Party for Freedom]] established an [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] (predominantly [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]]) and [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani]] website, where native [[Dutch people]] could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and other non-Germanic [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries. This led to commentaries involving [[hate speech]] and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/news/115208 Dutch far right opens anti-Polish hotline: ''"Did you lose your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian, or any other Central or Eastern European?

In the [[Netherlands]], antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys from [[Morocco|Moroccan]] descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: "Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!" According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]], the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], was said to have doubled compared to 2008.<ref name="nrc.nl">Berkhout, Karel.

==== Norway ====
{{Further|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that [[anti-semitism]] was common among Norwegian [[Muslim]]s. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students," and "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]." Additionally that "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews" and that it says in "the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews." Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew".<ref name="Jødiske barn blir hetset 2010">{{cite news |publisher=NRK |title=Nett-TV: Lørdagsrevyen 13.03.10 Jødiske barn blir hetset |date=March 13, 2010 |url=https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317183545/https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-date=March 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |language=no |access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref>

[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] who now live in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the ''haratin'' lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors.
