'''Kaduna''' is the state capital of [[Kaduna State]] in north-western [[Nigeria]], on the [[Kaduna River]]. It is a trade centre and a major transportation hub for the surrounding agricultural areas, with its rail and road junction. The population of Kaduna was at 760,084 as of the 2006 Nigerian census.

Rapid urbanization since 2005 has created an increasingly large population, now{{when|date=September 2020}} estimated to be around 1.3 million. Kaduna's name derives from the Hausa word ''kada'', for crocodile (''kaduna'' being the plural form).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://citiesintransition.net/fct-cities/kaduna/|title=Kaduna|website=The Forum for Cities in Transition|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word ''Kaduna'' is said to be a corruption of the Hausa word for “crocodiles”, ''Kadduna'' in the Hausa language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|title=Kaduna {{!}} Location, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> Another version of the name proposes a link to the [[Gbagyi language|Gbagyi]] word/name 'Odna', meaning 'river'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of the Gbagyi Language|last=Shekwo|first=Joseph Amali|publisher=Centre for Adult Education and Extension Services, Ahmadu Bello University|year=1979|location=Zaria}}</ref>

==History==
Kaduna was founded by [[British Empire|British]] colonists in 1900.<ref>Toyin Falola, Ann Genova, Matthew M. Heaton, ''Historical Dictionary of Nigeria'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 217</ref> It became the capital of Nigeria's former [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] in 1917,<ref>{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Banister |author2=Dan Cruickshank |title=Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture|year=1996|chapter=Africa|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn= 0-7506-2267-9|page=1466}}</ref> and retained this status until 1967. The first British governor of Northern Nigeria, Sir Frederick Lugard, chose the present site for development due to its proximity to the [[Lagos-Kano Railway]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|title=Kaduna|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref>
