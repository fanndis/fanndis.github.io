'''James Moore''' (c. 1650 – 1706) was the Irish-[[Kingdom of England|English]] governor of [[Province of Carolina|colonial Carolina]] between 1700 and 1703. He is best known for leading several invasions of [[Spanish Florida]] during [[Queen Anne's War]], including attacks in 1704 and 1706 which wiped out most of the [[Spanish missions in Florida]].<ref name="Doak2007"/> He captured and brought back to Carolina as slaves thousands of [[Apalachee|Apalachee Indians]].

==Early life==
Little is known of Moore's origins. During his life he was said to be a son of Roger Moore (also known as [[Rory O'Moore]] or Ruairí Óg Ó Mórdha), leader of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and that he had supposedly inherited his father's rebellious nature.<ref name="Heitzler2005-275"/> He first appears in the records of the [[Province of Carolina]] in 1675 representing Margaret Berringer Yeamans, widow of Sir [[John Yeamans]], before the colonial council. At about the same time he married her daughter by her first husband, also named Margaret.

==Political career==

In 1677, 1682, and 1683, Moore served on the colonial council. He played a leading role in a 1690 expedition into the Carolina back country, crossing the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to investigate possibilities of trade with the local Indian population. In 1698 he was elected to the colonial assembly, and was described as the right-hand-man of proprietor Sir John Colleton. The next year he was named chief justice of the colony, a post he held until he was named governor in 1700, replacing the deceased [[Joseph Blake (governor)|Joseph Blake]].
 
Moore was a leader of one of colonial South Carolina's political factions, called the "Goose Creek Men", after [[Goose Creek, South Carolina|Goose Creek]], an outlying area of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].<ref name="Heitzler2005-275">{{cite book|last=Heitzler|first=Michael James|title=Goose Creek, A Definitive History: Volume One, Planters, Politicians and Patriots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32l9iEyKUxkC&pg=PA275|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-055-6|page=275}}</ref>

In 1683 Moore was granted {{convert|2400|acre}} by the [[Lords Proprietor#Carolina|Lords Proprietors]]. He called his estate "Boochowee". Part of this land is known today as Liberty Hall Plantation.<ref name="Heitzler2005-275"/>

From 1691 Moore was the acknowledged leader of the Goose Creek Men, the main political opposition to the ruling "[[English Dissenters|Dissenter]]" faction. Moore's rise to governorship in 1700 signalled a major shift in the politics of the colony. The Dissenters contested Moore's "unjust election". But the Lords Proprietors saw to it that Moore remained governor, and they made it clear that the Dissenters were no longer in favor.<ref name="Edgar1998">{{cite book|last=Edgar|first=Walter B.|title=South Carolina: a history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFSbwGk2szgC&pg=PA93|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=1998|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-255-4|page=93}}</ref>

Between 1700 and 1703 Moore was the [[British Empire|British]] governor of Carolina, which was then in the process of dividing into the provinces of [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. During this period, he led a number of attacks from the Carolinas into [[Spanish Florida]]. He relied on allied Indian tribes, especially the [[Yamasee]] for most of his military force. On news of the outbreak of [[Queen Anne's War]] in 1702, he led 500 colonists, 300 native allies, and 14 small ships on an invasion of Spanish Florida along the coast, destroying the remaining Spanish missionary Indians of [[Guale]] and [[Mocama]], and devastating the lands around [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. While the town of St. Augustine was razed, its central fortress, [[Castillo de San Marcos]], where the Spanish and numerous allied Indians had taken refuge, [[Siege of St. Augustine (1702)|resisted Moore's siege]].<ref name="Doak2007">{{cite book|last=Doak|first=Robin|title=South Carolina 1540–1776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWASfc2EuawC&pg=PA48|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=14 August 2007|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4263-0066-0|page=48}}</ref><ref name="RowlandMoore1996">{{cite book|last1=Rowland|first1=Lawrence Sanders|last2=Moore|first2=Alexander|last3=Rogers|first3=George C.|title=The History of Beaufort County, South Carolina: 1514-1861|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjdhnfG0tYcC&pg=PA88|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=1996|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-090-1|pages=88–89}}</ref> The 1702 campaign was viewed as a disaster due to the failure to take the fortress and the expenses incurred, and Moore resigned his post.

In 1704, Moore led an expedition of 50 Englishmen and 1,000 [[Creek people|Creek]], Yamasee, and other allied Indians, into western Florida, leading to the [[Apalachee Massacre]]. The [[Apalachee]] were the last powerful Spanish-allied Indian nation in the region.  Their defeat in 1704 resulted in many Apalachee being enslaved and taken from Charleston to the West Indies.  Other Apalachee were relocated (some voluntarily, others not) to the [[Savannah River]] to live in semi-serfdom.  Another result of the defeat of the Apalachee was the collapse of the final defence of the Indians of Florida.  In the following years, Carolinian and Indian slave raiders virtually wiped out the Indian population of Florida all the way to the [[Florida Keys]].

Moore's defeat of the Apalachee in Spanish Florida was hailed as a major victory for Carolina, which had been fighting with the Spanish for control of the region for decades.  It also served to strengthen ties between various southeastern Indians and Carolina.  The [[Creek people]] and the [[Cherokee]]s became much more closely allied with Carolina. With these two Indian nations as strong allies, the English rose to a position of dominance over the French and Spanish in the American southeast.

Moore died in 1706 of a tropical disease, possibly [[yellow fever]].  He was significantly in debt. His son by the same name was elected to the same office in 1719 following the overthrow of the proprietary governor.

==Family==

Moore married Margaret Berringer, daughter of Lady Margaret Yeamans (by a previous marriage).<ref name="Heitzler2005-160">{{cite book|last=Heitzler|first=Michael James|title=Goose Creek, A Definitive History: Volume One, Planters, Politicians and Patriots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32l9iEyKUxkC&pg=PA160|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-055-6|pages=160, 272}}</ref> Their daughter, Mary Moore, married Job Howe, another of the "Goose Creek Men".<ref name="Heitzler2005-160"/> Altogether James and Margaret had ten children, many of whom moved to the [[Cape Fear (region)|Lower Cape Fear]] region, where they and their descendants became known as "The Family", the most powerful family in the region.<ref name="OlwellTully2006">{{cite book|last1=Olwell|first1=Robert|last2=Tully|first2=Alan|title=Cultures and identities in colonial British America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XqEkzVWNnkC&pg=PA60|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=2006|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8251-7|pages=60–61}}</ref>  Moore was the grandfather of [[American Revolutionary War]] [[Brigadier General]] [[James Moore (Continental Army officer)|James Moore]], and great-grandfather of [[Major General]] [[Robert Howe (soldier)|Robert Howe]].

The Moore family imported over 4,000 [[African slavery|slaves]] into the Carolinas, mostly for its own extensive plantations and farms in and around the Cape Fear area of what later became North Carolina. James Moore also had a house in Charleston and another in the Goose Creek area near Charleston.

Another Moore family descendant, [[Alfred Moore]], became a Justice of the [[US Supreme Court]].
