The '''MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health''' (commonly, '''MIT Jameel Clinic'''; previously, J-Clinic) is a [[Research institute|research center]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and health sciences, including disease detection, [[drug discovery]], and the development of [[medical device]]s. The MIT Jameel Clinic also supports the commercialization of solutions through grant funding.

Co-founded in 2018 by MIT and Community Jameel,<ref name=":1"/> the MIT Jameel Clinic is housed in the [[MIT Schwarzman College of Computing]]. The mission of the Jameel Clinic is to "revolutionize the prevention, detection, and treatment of disease", and it describes itself as "the epicenter of AI and healthcare at MIT".<ref>{{Cite web|title=J-Clinic {{!}} AI & Healthcare at MIT|url=https://www.jclinic.mit.edu/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=J-Clinic|language=en}}</ref>

=== Discovery of halicin ===
On February 19, 2020, the MIT Jameel Clinic's faculty leads for AI and life sciences, Professor [[Regina Barzilay]] and Professor [[James Collins (bioengineer)|James J. Collins]], published a paper in [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']] confirming the discovery—for the first time by [[deep learning]]—of [[halicin]], the first new [[antibiotic]] compound for 30 years, which kills over 35 powerful [[bacteria]], including [[Antimicrobial resistance|antimicrobial-resistant]] [[tuberculosis]], the superbug [[Clostridioides difficile (bacteria)|''C. difficile'']], and two of the [[World Health Organization]]'s top-three most deadly bacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stokes|first=Jonathan M.|last2=Yang|first2=Kevin|last3=Swanson|first3=Kyle|last4=Jin|first4=Wengong|last5=Cubillos-Ruiz|first5=Andres|last6=Donghia|first6=Nina M.|last7=MacNair|first7=Craig R.|last8=French|first8=Shawn|last9=Carfrae|first9=Lindsey A.|last10=Bloom-Ackermann|first10=Zohar|last11=Tran|first11=Victoria M.|date=2020-02-20|title=A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery|url=https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(20)30102-1|journal=Cell|language=English|volume=180|issue=4|pages=688–702.e13|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.021|issn=0092-8674|pmid=32084340}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Artificial Intelligence Yields New Antibiotic|url=https://betterworld.mit.edu/artificial-intelligence-yields-new-antibiotic/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=The MIT Campaign for a Better World|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Murgia|first=Madhumita|date=February 20, 2020|title=AI discovers antibiotics to treat drug-resistant diseases|work=Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e5bb4e4e-5332-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1|url-status=live|access-date=12 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-20|title=Powerful antibiotic discovered using machine learning for first time|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/20/antibiotic-that-kills-drug-resistant-bacteria-discovered-through-ai|access-date=2020-11-12|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marchant|first=Jo|date=2020-02-20|title=Powerful antibiotics discovered using AI|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00018-3|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/d41586-020-00018-3}}</ref>

=== AI Cures initiative ===
In 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the MIT Jameel Clinic launched the '''AI Cures''' initiative to apply AI techniques to the discovery of effective [[Management of COVID-19|therapeutics]] for the disease, and the development of medical devices. The AI Cures initiative is in partnership with the [[Patrick Joseph McGovern|Patrick J. McGovern Foundation]], the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), and the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home|url=https://www.aicures.mit.edu/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=AI Cures|language=en}}</ref>
