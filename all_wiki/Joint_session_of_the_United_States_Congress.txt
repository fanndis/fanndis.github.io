A '''joint session of the United States Congress''' is a gathering of members of the two chambers of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature of the [[federal government of the United States]]: the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Joint sessions can be held on any special occasion, but are required to be held when the [[President of the United States|president]] delivers a [[State of the Union]] address, when they gather to count and certify the votes of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] following a [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], or when they convene on the occasion of a [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]]. A joint meeting is a ceremonial or formal occasion and does not perform any legislative function; and no resolution is proposed or vote taken.

Joint sessions and meetings are usually held in the Chamber of the House of Representatives, and are traditionally presided over by the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House]]. However, the Constitution requires the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] (as [[president of the Senate]]) to preside over the counting of electoral votes.

== Counting electoral votes ==
The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] since 1804 has provided that the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], as President of the Senate, receives the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes, and then, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, opens the sealed votes. The [[Electoral Count Act]] of 1887 requires the votes to be counted during a joint session on January 6 following the meetings of the presidential electors.<ref>"The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted." [https://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html ''Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11-27''], National Archives and Records Administration</ref> The act also specifies that the president of the Senate presides over the session.<ref name=3USC15>{{usc|3|15}}, ''Counting electoral votes in Congress''</ref> The [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] now provides that the newly elected Congress counts the votes. Until 1936, the outgoing Congress counted the electoral votes.

The joint session to count electoral votes is held at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on January 6 in the Chamber of the House of Representatives.<ref name=3USC15 /> The sitting vice president is expected to preside, but in several cases the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]] has chaired the proceedings instead. The vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House]] sit at the podium, with the vice president in the seat of the speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order. Members of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided that the objection is supported by at least one member of each house of Congress. A successful objection will be followed by separate debate and votes on the objection in each chamber of Congress. 

Objections to the electoral vote count are rarely raised, and only two have successfully occurred since the current procedure was implemented by the Electoral Count Act, both initiated by Democrats.<ref name="CRS">{{cite web |title=Counting Electoral Votes: An Overview of Procedures at the Joint Session, Including Objections by Members of Congress |url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32717/12 |website=CRS Reports |publisher=Congressional Research Service |access-date=27 September 2020}}</ref> The first was in 1969 regarding the vote of [[faithless elector]] [[Lloyd W. Bailey]] of North Carolina, who was pledged to vote for [[Richard Nixon]] but instead voted for [[George Wallace]]. The objection by Maine Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] and Michigan Representative [[James G. O'Hara]] was subsequently defeated. The second was in 2005, when Ohio Representative [[Stephanie Tubbs Jones]] joined with California Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] to [[2004 United States presidential election in Ohio#Objection to certification of Ohio's electoral votes|object to the entire slate of electors from Ohio]] following controversies regarding voting in the state during the [[2004 United States presidential election]]. The objection was defeated by wide margins in the House and Senate.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |title=Bush carries Electoral College after delay - Jan 6, 2005 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/06/electoral.vote/ |access-date=27 September 2020 |work=www.cnn.com |agency=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=6 January 2005}}</ref>

Notably, Democratic members of the House attempted unsuccessfully to object to the certification of electoral votes from the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], with outgoing vice president and Democratic presidential candidate [[Al Gore]] overruling multiple objections to the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|controversial election count from Florida]] due to the lack of a senator signing on to any of them.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news |last1=Walsh |first1=Edward |last2=Eilperin |first2=Juliet |title=Gore Presides As Congress Tallies Votes Electing Bush |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/01/07/gore-presides-as-congress-tallies-votes-electing-bush/0461e40f-3317-4a7e-a1ad-2232aae304db/ |access-date=27 September 2020 |work=Washington Post |date=7 January 2001}}</ref> Similarly, in 2017, Democratic representatives attempted unsuccessfully to object to the electoral votes from multiple states after the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election.]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cornwell |first1=Susan |last2=Chiacu |first2=Doina |title=U.S. Congress certifies Trump's Electoral College victory |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-congress/u-s-congress-certifies-trumps-electoral-college-victory-idUSKBN14Q25R |access-date=27 September 2020 |work=Reuters |date=6 January 2017 |language=en}}</ref>

If there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer declares the result of the vote and states who is elected president and vice president. The senators then depart from the House Chamber.

== State of the Union ==
At some time during the first two months of each session, the president customarily delivers the State of the Union address, a speech in which an assessment is made of the state of the country, and the president's legislative agenda is outlined. The speech is modeled on the [[Speech from the Throne]], given by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]]. There is a major difference, in that the president is the principal author of his own State of the Union address, while the Speech from the Throne is customarily written by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]].

The Constitution of the United States requires that the president "shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union," but does not specify whether the information should be given in a speech or a written report. The first two presidents, [[George Washington]] and [[John Adams]], delivered the speech in person before both houses of Congress, but that practice was discontinued by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who considered it too monarchical and sent written reports instead. Written reports were standard until 1913, when [[Woodrow Wilson]] reestablished the practice of personally attending to deliver the speech. Since then, on a number of occasions presidents have presented a written report, usually for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php |title=State of the Union Addresses of the Presidents of the United States |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |access-date=2012-09-26}}</ref>

== Subjects of joint sessions and meetings ==
In addition to State of the Union addresses, inaugurals and counting of electoral votes, joint sessions or meetings usually fall into one of several topics.

=== Foreign dignitaries ===
[[File:Winston Churchill Address the US Congress.PNG|thumb|243px|right|Winston Churchill addresses Congress in 1943. Sitting behind him Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace]] and Speaker [[Sam Rayburn|Rayburn]].]]

Joint meetings have been held more than a hundred times to enable foreign [[Head of state|heads of state]] or [[head of government|heads of government]] to address Congress. Leaders of 48 countries have addressed Congress at a joint meeting: [[France]] leads the list with nine joint meeting addresses by heads of state or dignitaries. Other leading countries are: [[Israel]] (8), [[United Kingdom]] (8), [[Mexico]] (7), [[India]] (6), [[Italy]] (6), [[Ireland]] (6), [[South Korea]] (6), [[Germany]], including West Germany and unified Germany (5), [[Australia]] (4), [[Canada]] (3), [[Argentina]] (3), and the [[Philippines]] (3). [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Winston Churchill]] have each made three joint addresses to Congress, more than any other foreign dignitaries (Netanyahu: 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?73411-1/israel-prime-minister-speech |title=Video recording of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's July 10, 1996 address to Congress (C-SPAN.org)}}</ref> 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?299666-1/israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-address-joint-meeting-congresss |title=Video recording of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's May 24, 2011 address to Congress (C-SPAN.org)}}{{cite web|url=http://houselive.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=27&clip_id=5185  |title=Office of the Clerk, US House of Representatives)}}</ref> 2015;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?324609-2/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-address-congress |title=Video recording of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's March 3, 2015 address to Congress (C-SPAN.org) }}{{cite web  |url=http://houselive.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=11115  |title=Office of the Clerk, US House of Representatives  }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Churchill: 1941, 1943, 1952). [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]] addressed joint meetings of Congress on two occasions (1976 and 1994) as did [[Nelson Mandela]] of [[South Africa]]  (1990 and 1994).<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of the Clerk, US House of Representatives|url=http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/foreignleaders.aspx|publisher=Artandhistory.house.gov|access-date=2012-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041342/http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/foreignleaders.aspx|archive-date=2011-07-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The first foreign dignitary to address a joint session of Congress was Ambassador [[André Lefebvre de La Boulaye|André de La Boulaye]] of France who addressed a joint session on May 20, 1934 to memorialize the centennial anniversary of the death of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Foreign-Leaders/Joint-Sessions/ |title=Office of Art and Archives of the U.S. House of Representatives – Joint Meeting & Joint Session Addresses Before Congress by Foreign Leaders & Dignitaries |publisher=Artandhistory.house.gov |access-date=2015-09-25}}</ref> The first non-dignitary to address a joint meeting of Congress was [[Polish people|Polish]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] in 1989. [[Nelson Mandela]], then deputy president of the African National Congress addressed a joint meeting in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/foreignleaders.aspx |title=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives Art & History – Foreign Leaders & Dignitaries |publisher=Artandhistory.house.gov |access-date=2012-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041342/http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/foreignleaders.aspx |archive-date=2011-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Twice have joint meetings been attended by dignitaries from two countries: On September 18, 1978, when Congress was addressed by [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Menachem Begin]], and on July 26, 1994, when Congress was addressed by [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein of Jordan]] and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]].

[[John Howard]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister of Australia]], had originally been scheduled to address Congress on September 12, 2001, but his address was postponed due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] the previous day.  Howard's address was rescheduled for June 12, 2002 where he spoke about the attacks he had witnessed 9 months earlier. Howard was acknowledged with a standing ovation and describes the occasion as a "moving moment."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/ | title = The Howard Years, Episode 3: Commander-in-Chief| access-date = 24 Oct 2010 | date = 1 Dec 2010 | author = ABC Television}}</ref>

The most recent addresses by foreign dignitaries were given by [[President of France|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] on April 25, 2018, [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] on June 8, 2016, and [[Pope Francis]] on September 24, 2015.  The [[Pope]] did not address the joint session as a religious dignitary but as a head of state.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/pope-francis-address-joint-meeting-congress|title=Pope Francis to Address a Joint Meeting of Congress|date=2015-02-05|work=Speaker.gov|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>

All foreign heads of state and heads of government are presented officially to Congress in the same manner as the president during the [[State of the Union Address]] and are introduced by the speaker by [[Style (manner of address)|their diplomatic style of address]], followed by their name and respective office.

=== Presidential addresses ===
In addition to a State of the Union address, presidents address Congress on specific subjects. The first such speech was delivered by [[John Adams]] on the subject of [[U.S. relations with France]]. The most popular subjects for such addresses are [[Economy of the United States|economic]], [[Military of the United States|military]] and [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] issues.

In addition to bringing back the tradition of delivering a State of the Union address, [[Woodrow Wilson]] was the first president since John Adams to address Congress on specific topics.  He delivered 17 such speeches, more than any other president.

=== Military leaders ===
[[File:macarthurjustfadeaway.ogg|thumb|right|Closing words of MacArthur's final address to a joint meeting of Congress]]
Joint meetings are sometimes called to hear addresses by [[General (United States)|generals]], [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]], or other military leaders. Perhaps the most notable example is [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[s:MacArthur's Farewell Speech to Congress|farewell address]] to Congress. In concluding the speech he recalled an old army song which contained the line "old soldiers never die; they just fade away". He then said, "And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty. Good-bye".

=== Astronauts ===
Six times in the first years of the [[Space Age]], Congress jointly met to be addressed by [[astronaut]]s after their trips in space.

=== Memorials ===
Nine times, Congress has jointly met to hold a memorial service for a deceased president or former president. Congress has also met to memorialize Vice President [[James S. Sherman|James Sherman]] and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].

=== Anniversaries ===
Congress sometimes meets to mark the anniversary of a historical event or of a presidential birthday. The first such occasion was the centennial of George Washington's first inauguration in 1789. Congress has met to mark the centennial of the birth of each president since [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], with the exception of [[Lyndon Johnson]].

* The first occurrence of a ''joint session'' was on April 6, 1789 at [[Federal Hall]] in [[New York City]] during the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]], for the [[1788–89 United States presidential election|counting of electoral votes]].
* On December 8, 1941, the day after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|the attack on Pearl Harbor]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] delivered the "[[Infamy Speech]]" to a joint session of Congress.  Less than an hour later, Congress issued a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and officially brought the U.S. into [[World War II]].  This address is regarded as one of the most famous American [[Politics of the United States|political]] [[List of speeches|speeches]] of the 20th century.<ref>"[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/winter/crafting-day-of-infamy-speech.html FDR's "Day of Infamy" Speech: Crafting a Call to Arms]", ''Prologue'' magazine, US National Archives, Winter 2001, Vol. 33, No. 4.</ref>
* On March 15, 1965, President [[Lyndon Johnson]], after witnessing marchers beaten during the "Bloody Sunday" incident during the first [[Selma to Montgomery march]], called on Congress to write and pass a [[1965 Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act]]. During this speech Johnson used the words "We Shall Overcome".
* On September 20, 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] gave a speech before a joint session of Congress in response to the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/speeches/09.20.01.html |title=20 September 2001; Presidential address transcript |publisher=Presentialrhetoric.com |access-date=2012-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/166196-1|title=20 September 2001; Presidential address video |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |access-date=2012-09-26}}</ref>

===Joint meetings===
On December 18, 1874, [[Kalākaua]] was the first person in history received by the [[United States Congress]] in a joint meeting, in this case occurring in the [[President's Room]] of the United States Senate. This differs from a joint session of Congress, for which the United States Constitution requires a joint resolution, and is often used for formal addresses. Joint meetings of Congress are rare, and another one was not called until the 1900 Centennial of the Capital City.<ref>{{cite web |title=1st to Present Congress {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives |url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Joint-Sessions/All/ |website=history.house.gov |publisher=United States House of Representatives |access-date=September 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918221200/http://history.house.gov/Institution/Joint-Sessions/All/ |archive-date=September 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
