'''''The Phil Donahue Show''''', also known as '''''Donahue''''', <!-- do NOT change to "was" -->is<!-- remains as "is" per [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Lead paragraphs]] --> an American television [[talk show]] hosted by [[Phil Donahue]] that ran for 26 years on national television. Its run was preceded by three years of local broadcast on [[WDTN|WLWD]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], and it was broadcast nationwide between 1970 and 1996.

In 2002, ''Donahue'' was ranked 29th on ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine's list of the [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|50 greatest television shows of all-time]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
In 1967, [[Phil Donahue]] left his positions as news reporter and interviewer at [[WHIO (AM)|WHIO radio]] and [[WHIO-TV|television]] in Dayton to go into sales. He found he did not like it and took a position as newsman at another Dayton station WLWD (now [[WDTN]]). When the station’s ''Johnny Gilbert Show'' ended, the station kept the studio audience and Donahue became the creator and host of a new television program, ''Phil Donahue Show'' on WLWD (now [[WDTN]]), also in Dayton. His new program replaced ''The [[Johnny Gilbert]] Show'', when Gilbert left on short notice for [[Los Angeles]] for a hosting job. On November 6, 1967, Donahue hosted his first guest, [[atheism|atheist]] [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294869,00.html|title=Phil Donahue Dawns on Daytime|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}</ref><ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/foh23 Handbook of Texas Online: Madalyn Murray O'Hair (Note: this article mentioned that Donahue's show started in 1963, with Madalyn as guest.)]</ref> Though he would later call her message of atheism "very important", he also stated she was rather unpleasant and that, off-camera, she mocked him for being Catholic.<ref>{{cite video|people=Phil Donahue|title=Godless in America|medium=Documentary|date=2006}}</ref>

Initially, the program was shown only on other stations owned by the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] (which would later take the name of its parent [[Avco|Avco Company]]), which also owned WLWD.  But, on September 14, 1970, ''The Donahue Show'' entered nationwide [[Television syndication|syndication]].

Donahue relocated the show's home base to [[Chicago]] in 1974, first housing it at then-[[independent station]] [[WGN-TV]]. Around this time the show's popularity increased, and in the process it became a national phenomenon. When the Avco Company divested their broadcasting properties in 1976, [[Multimedia (media company)|Multimedia Inc.]] assumed production and syndication of the program, which was now known as simply ''Donahue''. In 1982, Donahue moved the show to [[CBS]]-owned [[WBBM-TV]] for its final years based in Chicago and the Midwest.

In 1984, ''Donahue'' introduced many viewers to [[hip-hop culture]], as a program featured [[breakdancing]] for the first time on national television, accompanied by a performance from the [[hip hop]] group [[UTFO]]. In 1985, Donahue left Chicago for [[New York City]] and began recording in Studio 8-G at [[NBC Studios (New York City)|30 Rockefeller Plaza]], the home of his New York affiliate [[WNBC-TV]]. Prior to the move, a month-long series of commercials heralded the move, and NBC's late-night talk host [[David Letterman]] would use portions of his national program counting down the days to Donahue's move with a huge calendar in his studio. One of the most talked-about incidents in ''Donahue''{{'}}s history came on January 21, 1985, soon after the show moved to New York. On this day's program, seven members of the audience appeared to faint during the broadcast, which was seen live in New York. Donahue, fearing the fainting was caused by both anxiety at being on television and an overheated studio, eventually cleared the studio of audience members and then resumed the show. It turned out the fainting "spell" was cooked up by media hoaxer [[Alan Abel]] in what Abel said was a protest against what he termed as poor-quality television.

In 1992, Donahue celebrated the 25th anniversary of his long-running television  program with an NBC special produced at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in New York, in which he was lauded by his talk-show peers. However, in many corners, he was seen as having been bypassed both by [[Oprah Winfrey]], whose [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|hugely successful national show]] was based in Donahue's former Chicago home base; and [[Sally Jessy Raphael]], whose talk show was distributed by Donahue's syndicator, Multimedia.

===The end of ''Donahue''===
The talk show field became increasingly saturated as the 1990s progressed. Many of these shows took an increasingly [[tabloid television|tabloid]] bent. Donahue shied away from this trend, continuing to take a "high-road" approach. These factors led to a marked decline in ratings. The show also lost support after Donahue expressed his feelings regarding the [[first Gulf War]]. In the fall of 1995, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-owned [[KGO-TV]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] dropped ''Donahue'' after carrying it for several years. Weeks later, New York's [[WNBC-TV]] also canceled it after airing it since 1977.<ref>[http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/aug/18/ny-station-removes-donahue/ Ny Station Removes ‘Donahue’]; August 18, 1995; ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]''</ref> ''Donahue'' was also evicted from its Rockefeller Plaza home, and relocated to new studios in Manhattan. ''Donahue'' was unable to find new outlets in the nation's largest and eighth-largest markets, and its ratings never recovered. Most stations either began dropping ''Donahue'' or moving it to late-night and early-morning time slots, causing a further loss of viewers.

After 29 years (26 of which in syndication) and nearly 7,000 shows, the final episode aired on September 13, 1996, culminating in what continues to be the longest continuous run of any syndicated talk show in U.S. television history.

===International success===

''Donahue'' was also broadcast in the [[UK]] on the ITV [[Night Network|Night Time]] line up in the late 1980s and early '90s, where it became cult viewing. After its success, Donahue made several shows in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] featuring some well-known celebrities from the country as guests, recorded mostly in [[London]] but notably one programme recorded in [[Manchester]], which had several members of the cast from the American [[sitcom]] ''[[Cheers]]'' and the Manchester-based [[soap opera]] ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Thames Television also broadcast a number of episodes during daytime for the London area only.
