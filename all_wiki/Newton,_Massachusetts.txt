'''Newton''' is a suburban city in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], United States. It is approximately {{convert|7|mi}} west of downtown [[Boston]] and is bordered by Boston's [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] and [[West Roxbury]] neighborhoods to the east and south, respectively, and by the suburb of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to the east, the suburbs of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] and [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] to the north, and [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]], [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], and [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]] to the west. Rather than having a single city center, Newton resembles a patchwork of thirteen villages. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Newton was 85,146, making it the eleventh largest city in the state.{{Citation needed lead|date=July 2019}}

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}
Newton was settled in 1630 as part of "the newe towne", which was renamed [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] in 1638. Roxbury minister [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] convinced the Native American people of Nonantum, a sub-tribe of the [[Massachusett (tribe)|Massachusett]] led by a [[sachem]] named [[Waban]], to relocate to [[Natick]] in 1651, fearing that they would be exploited by colonists.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAdow|first=Ron|title=The Charles River|year=1992|publisher=Bliss Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Marlborough, Mass|isbn=0-9625144-1-1|pages=171–174}}</ref> Newton was incorporated as a separate [[New England town|town]], known as Cambridge Village, on December 15, 1681, then renamed Newtown in 1691, and finally Newton in 1766.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritter |first=Priscilla R. |author2=Thelma Fleishman |title=Newton, Massachusetts 1679–1779: A Biographical Directory |year=1982 |publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society}}</ref> It became a city on January 5, 1874. Newton is known as ''The Garden City''.

In ''[[Reflections in Bullough's Pond]]'', Newton historian [[Diana Muir]] describes the early industries that developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in a series of mills built to take advantage of the water power available at [[Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts|Newton Upper Falls]] and [[Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts|Newton Lower Falls]].  Snuff, chocolate, glue, paper and other products were produced in these small mills but, according to Muir, the water power available in Newton was not sufficient to turn Newton into a manufacturing city, although it was, beginning in 1902, the home of the Stanley Motor Carriage Company, the maker of the [[Stanley Steamer]].

Newton, according to Muir, became one of America's earliest commuter suburbs. The [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Boston and Worcester]], one of America's earliest railroads, reached [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]] in 1834. Wealthy Bostonian businessmen took advantage of the new commuting opportunity offered by the railroad, building gracious homes on erstwhile farmland of [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]] hill and on Commonwealth street. Muir points out that these early commuters needed sufficient wealth to employ a groom and keep horses, to drive them from their hilltop homes to the station.

Further suburbanization came in waves. One wave began with the streetcar lines that made many parts of Newton accessible for commuters in the late nineteenth century. The next wave came in the 1920s when automobiles became affordable to a growing upper middle class. Even then, however, [[Oak Hill, Massachusetts|Oak Hill]] continued to be farmed, mostly market gardening, until the prosperity of the 1950s made all of Newton more densely settled.

The city has two symphony orchestras, the [[New Philharmonia Orchestra of Massachusetts]] and the Newton Symphony Orchestra.

Two of the 9/11 hijackers stayed in Newton the night before the attack. The hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 spent their last night in Newton's Park Inn, an economy motel across the street from the Chestnut Hill Mall and within walking distance of The Atrium.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spiegel |first1=Der |title=Inside 9-11: What Really Happened |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Publishing Group}}</ref>

Each April on [[Patriots' Day]], the [[Boston Marathon]] is run through the city, entering from [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] on [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]] (Washington Street) where runners encounter the first of the four infamous ''Newton Hills''. It then turns right onto [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] (Commonwealth Avenue) for the long haul into Boston. There are two more hills before reaching Centre Street, and then the fourth and most infamous of all, [[Boston Marathon#Heartbreak Hill|Heartbreak Hill]], rises shortly after Centre Street. Residents and visitors line the race route along Washington Street and Commonwealth Avenue to cheer the runners.

[[File:Union Street in Newton Centre.jpg|thumb|225px|Union Street, Newton Centre]]
Newton is a suburban city approximately seven miles from downtown Boston, in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], at {{Coord|42|20|16|N|71|12|36|W|type:city}} (42.337713, −71.209936).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The city is bordered by [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] and [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] on the north, [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]] and the [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] neighborhood of Boston on the south, [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] and [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]] on the west, and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and the [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]] neighborhood of Boston on the east.

From Watertown to Waltham to Needham and [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], Newton is bounded by the [[Charles River]]. The [[Yankee Division Highway]], designated [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] but known to the locals as Route 128, follows the Charles from Waltham to Dedham, creating a de facto land barrier. The portion of Needham which lies east of 128 and west of the Charles, known as the Needham Industrial Park has become part of a Newton commercial zone and contributes to its heavy traffic, though the tax revenue goes to Needham.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|18.2|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which {{convert|18.0|sqmi|km2|1}} is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2|1}} (0.82%) is water.

===Topography===
Newton has grown around a formation of seven hills. "The general features of Newton are not without interest. Seven principal elevations mark its surface, like the seven hills of ancient Rome, with the difference that the seven hills of Newton are much more distinct than the seven hills of Rome: [[Nonantum]] Hill, [[Waban]] Hill, [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], Bald Pate, [[Oak Hill, Massachusetts|Oak Hill]], Institution Hill and Mount Ida."<ref name="Smith">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=S.F.|title=History of Newton, Massachusetts, Town and City, from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time, 1630–1880|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofnewtonm1880smit#page/13/mode/1up|date=1880|publisher=The American Logotype Company|page=13|chapter=Chapter 1: History of Newton|website=bostonbasinhills.org|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref>

===Villages===
{{Main Article| List of villages in Newton, Massachusetts}}
Rather than having a single city center, Newton is a patchwork of thirteen villages, many boasting small downtown areas of their own. The 13 villages are: [[Auburndale, Massachusetts|Auburndale]], [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], [[Newton Centre, Massachusetts|Newton Centre]], [[Newton Corner, Massachusetts|Newton Corner]], [[Newton Highlands, Massachusetts|Newton Highlands]], [[Newton Lower Falls]], [[Newton Upper Falls]] (both on the [[Charles River]], and both former small industrial sites), [[Newtonville, Massachusetts|Newtonville]], [[Nonantum, Massachusetts|Nonantum]] (also called "The Lake"), [[Oak Hill, Massachusetts|Oak Hill]], [[Thompsonville, Massachusetts|Thompsonville]], [[Waban, Massachusetts|Waban]] and [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]]. [[Oak Hill Park]] is a place within the village of Oak Hill that itself is shown as a separate and distinct village on some [[city map]]s (including a map dated 2010 on the official City of Newton website),<ref>Newton's Geographic Information System: [http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/mis/gis/Maps/Villages.htm City of Newton, Massachusetts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222050806/http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/mis/gis/Maps/Villages.htm |date=February 22, 2012 }}</ref> and Four Corners is also shown as a village on some city maps. Although most of the villages have a post office, they have no legal definition and no firmly defined borders. This village-based system often causes some confusion with addresses and for first time visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtoncitizens.com/villages.shtml|title=The Villages of Newton, Mass.|work=newtoncitizens.com|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref>

===County===
Mismanagement of Middlesex County's public hospital in the mid-1990s left the county on the brink of insolvency, and in 1997 the Massachusetts legislature stepped in by assuming all assets and obligations of the county. The government of Middlesex County was officially abolished on July 11, 1997. The sheriff and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council or commission. However, communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.

These are the remaining elected officers for Middlesex County:

====Newton Junior College====
Newton Junior College, operated by the Newton Public Schools, opened in 1946 to serve the needs of returning [[veterans]] who otherwise would not have been able to continue their education due to the overcrowding of colleges and universities at that time. It used the facilities of Newton High School (now [[Newton North High School]]) until its own adjacent campus was built. It closed in 1976 due to declining enrollment and increased costs.<ref name='ccc'>{{cite web|url=http://closedcollege.bizland.com/massachusetts.htm|title=Massachusetts Closed Colleges|publisher=Closed College Consortium|accessdate=2007-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921153554/http://www.closedcollege.bizland.com/massachusetts.htm|archive-date=September 21, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The availability of such places as [[UMass Boston]] contributed to its demise. According to the city, its former campus is now "Claflin Park," a 25-unit multi-family development.

==Transportation==
Newton's proximity to Boston, along with its good public schools and safe and quiet neighborhoods, make it a very desirable community for those who commute to Boston or work in Newton's businesses and industries.

Newton is well-served by three modes of mass transit run by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]]: [[light rail]], [[commuter rail]], and bus service. The [[Green Line D branch]], (also known as the Riverside branch) is a light rail line running through the center of the city that makes very frequent trips to downtown Boston, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes away. The [[Green Line B branch]] ends across from [[Boston College]] on [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], virtually at the border of Boston's  [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] neighborhood and the City of Newton (an area which encompasses an unincorporated suburban village referred  to as [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]]). The [[Framingham/Worcester Line|MBTA Worcester commuter rail]], serving the northern villages of Newton that are proximate to Waltham, offers less frequent service to Boston. It runs from every half-an-hour during peak times to every couple of hours otherwise. The northern villages are also served by [[List of MBTA bus routes#501-599|frequent express buses]] that go to downtown Boston via the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] as well as Waltham.

Newton Centre, which is centered around the [[Newton Center (MBTA station)|Newton Centre MBTA station]], has been lauded as an example of [[transit-oriented development]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrain.org/unsprawl/2/|title=Newton Centre, Massachusetts : UnSprawl Case Study : Terrain.org|work=terrain.org|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref>

The [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 90]]), which basically follows the old [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] main line right-of-way, runs east and west through Newton, while [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] ([[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]]) slices through the extreme western part of the city in the Lower Falls area. [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] (Commonwealth Avenue), [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]] (Watertown Street west to West Newton, where it follows Washington Street west) and [[Massachusetts Route 9|route 9]] (Worcester Turnpike or Boylston Street) also run east and west through the city. Another major Boston (and Brookline) street, [[Beacon Street]], runs west from the Boston city line to Washington Street west of the hospital, where it terminates at Washington Street.

There are no major north–south roads through Newton: every north–south street in Newton terminates within Newton at one end or the other. The only possible exception is Needham Street, which is north–south at the border between Newton and [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], but it turns east and becomes Dedham Street, and when it reaches the Boston border, it goes south-east.

There are some north–south streets that are important to intra-Newton traveling.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Centre Street runs south from the Watertown town line to Newton Highlands, where it becomes Winchester Street and terminates at Nahanton Street. Walnut Street runs south from Newtonville, where it starts at Crafts Street, down to Newton Highlands, where it ends at Dedham Street.<ref>AAA Map of Boston, Massachusetts, including Arlington,&nbsp;...

* [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]] is a very popular park with residents of Newton, Brookline, and the Brighton section of Boston. Although completely within the Boston city limits, it is directly contiguous to the Newton city limits. Designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the designer of Central Park in New York City and the Emerald Necklace in Boston, the park offers beautiful views of the Boston skyline, and is framed by stately homes and the campus of Boston College. Although not generally used to supply water to Boston, the reservoir was temporarily brought back online on May 1, 2010, during a failure of a connecting pipe at the end of the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel.
* [[Bullough's Pond]] is an old mill pond transformed into a landscape feature when Newton became a suburban community in the late nineteenth century. It has been the subject of two books, ''Reflections in Bullough's Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England,'' by [[Diana Muir]], and ''Once Around Bullough's Pond: A Native American Epic,'' by Douglas Worth. It was long maintained by the city as an ice skating venue, but skating is no longer allowed. A scene from the 2008 remake of ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'' was filmed there.
* The city of Newton has designated several roads in the city as "scenic". Along with this designation come regulations aimed at curbing tree removal and trimming along the roads, as well as stemming the removal of historic stone walls.<ref>[http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/cdbg/Planning%20Board/documents/Final%20Scenic%20Roads%20Regulations.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320065850/http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/cdbg/Planning%20Board/documents/Final%20Scenic%20Roads%20Regulations.pdf |date=March 20, 2012 }}</ref> The city designated the following as scenic roads: Hobart Rd., Waban Ave., Sumner St., Chestnut St., Concord St., Dudley Rd., Fuller St., Hammond St., Valentine St., Lake Ave., Highland St., and Brookside Ave.<ref>[http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/Planning/Planning%20Board/documents/Pictures%20of%20Scenic%20Roads%20for%20Website.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320065853/http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/Planning/Planning%20Board/documents/Pictures%20of%20Scenic%20Roads%20for%20Website.pdf |date=March 20, 2012 }}</ref>
