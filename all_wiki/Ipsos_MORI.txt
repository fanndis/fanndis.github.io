==History==
In 1946, [[Mark Abrams]] formed a market research company called Research Services Ltd. (RSL). RSL operated until 1991 when it was acquired by [[Ipsos]], becoming Ipsos UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/news/2017/aug/30/cataloguing-update-mark-abrams-papers/|title=Cataloguing Update: The Mark Abrams Papers – Churchill College|website=www.chu.cam.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/2019-04/Ipsos-Reference-Document-2018.pdf</ref>

MORI (Market and Opinion Research International) was founded in 1969 by [[Robert Worcester]]. Robert Worcester stepped down from chairmanship of MORI in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jun/15/pressandpublishing.marketingandpr/print |title=Sir Bob quits Mori chairmanship |date=15 June 2005 |author=Rupert Jones |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-12-20 }}</ref> Ipsos announced it would acquire MORI in October 2005 for £88 million, and would merge it with Ipsos UK. The merged company was named Ipsos MORI.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/10/citynews.politics |title=French rival snaps up Mori |date=10 October 2005 |author=Julia Day |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-12-20 }}</ref>

==Methodology==
Ipsos MORI's research is conducted via a wide range of methodologies, using [[computer-assisted telephone interviewing]] (CATI), as well as face-to-face ([[Computer-assisted personal interviewing|CAPI]]) and Internet surveys. Many telephone surveys use a system called [[random digit dialing]] to interview a representative group of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iqcs.org/membercompanies/ipsos-mori/|title=Ipsos MORI – IQCS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/approached-us-telephone|title=Approached by us: Telephone &#124; Ipsos MORI|website=www.ipsos.com}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In May 2013, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Ipsos MORI had negotiated an agreement with the [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] mobile phone network to commercialise the data on that company’s 23 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1258380.ece |title=Switch on and you become a goldmine |date=12 May 2013 |author=Richard Kerbaj and Jon Ungoed-Thomas |newspaper=The Sunday Times |accessdate=11 August 2013 }}</ref>  The article stated that Ipsos MORI was looking to sell this data to the Metropolitan Police and other parties. The data included "gender, age, postcode, websites visited, time of day text is sent [and] location of customer when call is made". When confronted by the newspaper, the Metropolitan Police indicated that they would not be taking the discussions any further. Ipsos MORI defended their actions, stressing that the company only received anonymised data, without any personally identifiable data on an individual customer, and underlining that reports are only ever made on aggregated groups of more than 50 customers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/National/article1258476.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2013_05_11 |title=Secrets of 27m mobile phones offered to police |date=12 May 2013 |author=Richard Kerbaj and Jon Ungoed-Thomas |newspaper=The Sunday Times |accessdate=11 August 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/mobile-and-networking/123457043/ee-and-ipsos-mori-face-privacy-backlash-over-mobile-data-analysis |title=EE and Ipsos MORI face privacy backlash over mobile data analysis |date=13 May 2013 |author=Pete Swabey |work=Information Age |accessdate=11 August 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/newsevents/latestnews/1390/Ipsos-MORI-response-to-the-Sunday-Times.aspx |title=Ipsos MORI response to the ''Sunday Times'' |date=12 May 2013 |author= |publisher=Ipsos MORI |accessdate=11 August 2013 }}</ref>
