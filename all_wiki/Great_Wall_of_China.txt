The '''Great Wall of China''' ({{zh|t=萬里長城|s=万里长城|p=Wànlǐ Chángchéng|lit="Ten-Thousand Mile Long Wall"|first=t}}) is a series of [[fortifications]] that were built across the historical northern borders of [[ancient Chinese states]] and [[Imperial China]] as protection against [[Eurasian nomads|various nomadic groups]] from the [[Eurasian Steppe]].

In the 3rd century BC Shihuangdi (Qin Shi Huang), the first emperor of a united China (under the Qin dynasty), connected a number of existing defensive walls into a single system.

Collectively, they stretch from [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaodong]] in the east to [[Lop Lake]] in the west, from the present-day [[China–Russia border|Sino{{ndash}}Russian border]] in the north to [[Tao River]] (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the [[Mongolian steppe]].

The collection of fortifications known as the Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different names in both Chinese and English.

In [[Chinese historiography|Chinese histories]], the term "Long Wall(s)" ({{nowrap|<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> 長城,}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> 长城,}} ''Chángchéng'') appears in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', where it referred both to the separate great walls built between and north of the [[Warring States]] and to the more unified construction of the [[First Emperor]].{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=650}} The [[Chinese character]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|城}}}}, meaning city or fortress, is a [[phono-semantic compound]] of the [[earth radical|"earth" radical]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|土}}}} and phonetic {{lang|zh|{{linktext|成}}}}, whose [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''deŋ''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baxter|first=William H. &&nbsp;al.|url=http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/BaxterSagartOCbyMandarinMC2014-09-20.pdf|title=Baxter–Sagart Old Chinese Reconstruction, Version 1.1|publisher=University of Michigan|location=Ann Arbor|date=September 20, 2014|access-date=January 22, 2015}}</ref> It originally referred to the [[Chinese city wall|rampart]] which surrounded [[ancient Chinese urban planning|traditional Chinese cities]] and was used by extension for these walls around [[ancient Chinese states|their respective states]]; today, however, it is much more often the Chinese word for "city".<ref>See Lovell 2006, p. 25</ref>

The longer Chinese name "Ten-Thousand Mile Long Wall" ({{nowrap|<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> 萬里長城,}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> 万里长城,}} ''Wànlǐ Chángchéng'') came from Sima Qian's description of it in the ''Records'', though he did not name the walls as such. The {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;493 ''[[Book of Song]]'' quotes the frontier general [[Tan Daoji]] referring to "the long wall of 10,000 miles", closer to the modern name, but the name rarely features in pre-modern times otherwise.{{sfn|Waldron|1990|p=202|ps=. Tan Daoji's exact quote: "So you would destroy your Great Wall of Ten Thousand ''Li''!" (乃復壞汝萬里之長城) Note the use of the [[Chinese particles|particle]] [[wikt:之|之]] ''zhi'' that differentiates the quote from the modern name.}} The [[traditional Chinese mile]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|里}}}}, ''lǐ'') was an often irregular distance that was intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with terrain but was usually [[traditional Chinese units|standardized]] at distances around a third of an [[English mile]] (540&nbsp;m).<ref name="Winborn1994">{{cite book|author=Byron R.

However, this use of "ten-thousand" (''wàn'') is [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] in a similar manner to the Greek and English ''[[myriad]]'' and simply means "innumerable" or "immeasurable".<ref name=lindy>{{cite book|last=Lindesay|first=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9p2JgBPMBwC&pg=PA21|title=The Great Wall Revisited: From the Jade Gate to Old Dragon's Head|page=21|publisher=Wuzhou Publishing|location=Beijing|date=2007|isbn=978-7-5085-1032-3}}</ref>

Because of the wall's association with the First Emperor's [[Qin Shihuang#Historiography|supposed tyranny]], the [[list of Chinese dynasties|Chinese dynasties]] after [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] usually avoided referring to their own additions to the wall by the name "Long Wall".{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=651}} Instead, various terms were used in medieval records, including "frontier(s)" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|塞}}}}, ''Sài''),{{sfn|Lovell|2006|p=15}} "rampart(s)" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|垣}}}}, ''Yuán''),{{sfn|Lovell|2006|p=15}} "barrier(s)" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|障}}}}, ''Zhàng''),{{sfn|Lovell|2006|p=15}} "the outer fortresses" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|外|堡}}}},}} ''Wàibǎo''),{{sfn|Waldron|1990|p=49}} and "the border wall(s)" {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|邊|牆}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|边|墙}}}},}} ''Biānqiáng'').{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=651}} Poetic and informal names for the wall included "the Purple Frontier" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|紫|塞}}}},}} ''Zǐsài''){{sfn|Waldron|1990|p=21}} and "the Earth Dragon" {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|土|龍}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|土|龙}}}},}} ''Tǔlóng'').{{sfn|Waldron|1988|p=69}} Only during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing period]] did "Long Wall" become the catch-all term to refer to the many border walls regardless of their location or dynastic origin, equivalent to the English "Great Wall".{{sfn|Hessler|2007|p=59}}

The current English name evolved from accounts of {{nowrap|"the Chinese wall"}} from early modern European travelers.{{sfn|Hessler|2007|p=59}} By the 19th century,{{sfn|Hessler|2007|p=59}} "The Great Wall of China" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as "the Chinese wall".<ref name=lindy/>

Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.

[[Image:GreatWallOfHanDynasty.png|thumb|The Great Wall of the [[Han dynasty|Han]] is the longest of all walls, from Mamitu near [[Yumenguan]] to Liaodong]]
King Zheng of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the [[First Emperor]] of the [[Qin dynasty]] ("Qin Shi Huang") in 221&nbsp;BC.  Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states. To position the empire against the [[Xiongnu]] people from the north, however, he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier. "Build and move on" was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall, implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Empires in World History: Power and the Politics of Difference|last1=Burbank|first1=Jane|last2=Cooper|first2=Frederick|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=45}}</ref> Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while [[rammed earth]] was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands,{{sfn|Slavicek|Mitchell|Matray|2005|p=35}} if not up to a million, workers died building the Qin wall.{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=3}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulnoll.com/China/Tourism/history-Great-Wall-3-defense.html |title=Defense and Cost of The Great Wall | page= 3 |publisher=Paul and Bernice Noll's Window on the World  |access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> Later, the [[Han Dynasty|Han]],<ref name="mongolia">{{Cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0227/1224312436539.html|title=British researcher discovers piece of Great Wall 'marooned outside China'|last=Coonan |first=Clifford |date=February 27, 2012 |access-date=February 28, 2012 |work=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref> the [[Northern Dynasties]] and the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=653}} The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=653}} Non-Han dynasties also built their border walls: the [[Xianbei]]-ruled [[Northern Wei]], the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty|Liao]], [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]-established [[Western Xia]], who ruled vast territories over Northern China throughout centuries, all constructed defensive walls but those were located much to the north of the other Great Walls as we know it, within China's province of [[Inner Mongolia]] and in [[Mongolia]] itself.{{sfnm|Waldron|1983|1p=654|Haw|2006|2pp=52–54}}

===Ming era===
{{Main|Ming Great Wall}}
[[File:GreatWallChina4.png|thumb|The extent of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] and its walls]]
The Great Wall concept was revived again under the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] in the 14th century,{{sfn|Karnow|2008|p=192}} and following the Ming army's defeat by the [[Oirats]] in the [[Battle of Tumu]]. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the [[Mongol]]ian tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the [[Ordos Desert]], the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the [[Yellow River]].

Unlike the earlier fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth. Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on the wall.{{sfn|Szabó|Dávid|Loczy|2010|p=220}} As [[Mongol invasions|Mongol raids]] continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls. Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strong.{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=177}} [[Qi Jiguang]] between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall, faced sections of the ram-earth wall with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping to warn of approaching Mongol raiders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Great Wall at Mutianyu |url=http://great-wall.org/mutianyu.htm |publisher=Great Wall of China |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309091217/http://great-wall.org/mutianyu.htm |archive-date=March 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> During the 1440s–1460s, the Ming also built a so-called "Liaodong Wall". Similar in function to the Great Wall (whose extension, in a sense, it was), but more basic in construction, the Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the [[Liaodong]] province, protecting it against potential incursions by Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the [[Jianzhou Jurchens]] from the north. While stones and tiles were used in some parts of the Liaodong Wall, most of it was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides.{{sfn|Edmonds|1985|pp=38–40}}

Towards the end of the Ming, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the [[Manchu]] invasions that began around 1600. Even after the loss of all of [[Liaoning|Liaodong]], the Ming army held the heavily fortified [[Shanhai Pass]], preventing the Manchus from conquering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, after Beijing had already fallen to [[Li Zicheng]]'s rebels. Before this time, the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid, but this time it was for conquest. The gates at Shanhai Pass were opened on May 25 by the commanding Ming general, [[Wu Sangui]], who formed an alliance with the Manchus, hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from Beijing.{{sfn|Lovell|2006|p=254}} The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and eventually defeated both the rebel-founded [[Shun dynasty]] and the [[Southern Ming dynasty|remaining Ming resistance]], establishing the [[Qing dynasty]] rule over all of China.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|pp=1–2}}

Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and [[Dzungar–Qing Wars|Mongolia was annexed]] into the empire, so constructions on the Great Wall were discontinued. On the other hand, the so-called [[Willow Palisade]], following a line similar to that of the Ming Liaodong Wall, was constructed by the Qing rulers in Manchuria. Its purpose, however, was not defense but rather to prevent Han Chinese migration into Manchuria.<ref>Elliott, Mark C. "The Limits of Tartary: Manchuria in Imperial and National Geographies".

The North African traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], who also visited China during the [[Yuan dynasty]] c. 1346, had heard about China's Great Wall, possibly before he had arrived in China.{{sfn|Haw|2006|pp=54–55}} He wrote that the wall is "sixty days' travel" from Zeitun (modern [[Quanzhou]]) in his travelogue ''[[Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling]]''. He associated it with the [[Gates of Alexander|legend of the wall]] mentioned in the [[Qur'an]],<ref>''[[Qur'an]]'', XVIII: "The Cave". English translations hosted at [[:s:Main Page|Wikisource]] include [[:s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/18. The Cave|Maulana Muhammad Ali]]'s, [[:s:The Qur'an (Palmer)/Kahf|E.H. Palmer]]'s, and the [[:s:Quran (Progressive Muslims Organization)/18|Progressive Muslims Organization]]'s.</ref> which [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (commonly associated with [[Alexander the Great]]) was said to have erected to protect people near the land of the rising sun from the savages of [[Gog and Magog]]. However, Ibn Battuta could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that although there were remnants of the wall at that time, they were not significant.{{sfn|Haw|2006|pp=53–55}}

Soon after Europeans reached Ming China by ship in the early 16th century, accounts of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe, even though no European was to see it for another century. Possibly one of the earliest European descriptions of the wall and of its significance for the defense of the country against the "[[Tartars]]" (i.e. Mongols) may be the one contained in [[João de Barros]]'s 1563 ''Asia''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barros|first=João de|title=Ásia de João de Barros: Dos feitos que os portugueses fizeram no descobrimento dos mares e terras do Oriente|at=''3a Década'', pp.&nbsp;186–204 (originally Vol. II, Ch. vii)|volume=V|location=Lisbon|orig-year=1563|date=1777|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433082328869;seq=232|publisher=Lisboa}}</ref> Other early accounts in Western sources include those of [[Gaspar da Cruz]], [[Bento de Goes]], [[Matteo Ricci]], and Bishop [[Juan González de Mendoza]],{{sfn|Waldron|1990|pp=204–05}} the latter in 1585 describing it as a "superbious and mightie work" of architecture, though he had not seen it.<ref name=Lach>{{cite book|last=Lach|first=Donald F|title=Asia in the Making of Europe|volume=I|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|date=1965|page=769}}</ref> In 1559, in his work "A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions", Gaspar da Cruz offers an early discussion of the Great Wall.{{sfn|Waldron|1990|pp=204–05}} Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother [[Bento de Góis]] reached the northwestern [[Jiayu Pass]] from India.{{sfn|Yule|1866|p=579|ps=This section is the report of Góis's travel, as reported by [[Matteo Ricci]] in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'' (published 1615), annotated by [[Henry Yule]]).}} Early European accounts were mostly modest and empirical, closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall,{{sfn|Waldron|1990|pp=2–4}} although later they slid into hyperbole,{{sfn|Waldron|1990|p=206}} including the erroneous but ubiquitous claim that the Ming Walls were the same ones that were built by the First Emperor in the 3rd century&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Waldron|1990|p=206}}

When China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The [[Travelogue (literature)|travelogues]] of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.{{sfn|Waldron|1990|p=209}}

A formal definition of what constitutes a "Great Wall" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety.{{sfn|Hessler|2007|p=60}} The defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts, trenches and ditches, as well as individual fortresses.

=== Han Great Wall ===
Han fortifications starts from [[Yumen Pass]] and [[Yang Pass]], southwest of [[Dunhuang]], in [[Gansu]] province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu ({{nowrap|<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>  {{lang|zh|{{linktext|馬|迷途}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|马|迷途}}}},}} ''Mǎmítú'', {{nowrap|<small>[[Literal translation|l]]</small> "horses losing their way"}}) near Yumen Pass.

=== Ming Great Wall ===
The [[Jiayuguan (pass)|Jiayu Pass]], located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From Jiayu Pass the wall travels discontinuously down the [[Hexi Corridor]] and into the deserts of [[Ningxia]], where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at [[Yinchuan]]. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the [[Ordos Desert]] to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There at Piantou Pass {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|偏|頭|關}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|偏|头|关}}}},}} ''Piāntóuguān'') in [[Xinzhou]], [[Shanxi]] province, the Great Wall splits in two with the "Outer Great Wall" {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|外|長城}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|外|长城}}}},}} ''Wài Chǎngchéng'') extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into [[Hebei]] province, and the "Inner Great Wall" {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|內|長城}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|內|长城}}}},}} ''Nèi Chǎngchéng'') running southeast from Piantou Pass for some {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}}, passing through important passes like the [[Pingxing Pass]] and [[Yanmen Pass]] before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|四海|冶}}}}, ''Sìhǎiyě''),}} in Beijing's [[Yanqing County]].

The sections of the Great Wall around Beijing municipality are especially famous: they were frequently renovated and are regularly visited by tourists today. The [[Badaling]] Great Wall near [[Zhangjiakou]] is the most famous stretch of the Wall, for this is the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China, as well as the showpiece stretch for foreign dignitaries.{{sfn|Rojas|2010|p=140}} The [[Badaling]] Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Askhar |first1=Aybek |title=Limit placed on number of visitors to Great Wall |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201905/29/WS5ceddf96a3104842260be639.html |website=China Daily |access-date=10 August 2020}}</ref> South of Badaling is the [[Juyong Pass]]; when used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend China's capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is {{convert|7.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} wide.

One of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in [[Jinshanling]]. There it runs {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} long, ranges from {{convert|5|to|8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height, and {{convert|6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} across the bottom, narrowing up to {{convert|5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} across the top. Wangjing Lou {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|望|京|樓}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|望|京|楼}}}},}} ''Wàngjīng Lóu'') is one of Jinshanling's 67 [[watchtowers]], {{convert|980|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the [[Mutianyu]] Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for {{convert|2.25|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfn|Lindesay|2008|p=212}}

At the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the "First Pass [[Tianxia|Under Heaven]]". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the "Old Dragon Head". {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall ({{nowrap|<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{linktext|焦山|長城}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{linktext|焦|山|长城}},}} ''Jiāoshān Chángchéng''), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.travelchinaguide.com/china_great_wall/scene/hebei/jiaoshan.htm | title = Jiaoshan Great Wall | access-date =September 15, 2010 | work=TravelChinaGuide.com | quote = Jiaoshan Great Wall is located about {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Shanhaiguan ancient city.

Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from rammed earth, stones, and wood. During the Ming, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as tiles, [[lime (mineral)|lime]], and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth. Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use. Consequently, stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer [[:wikt:brim|brims]], and gateways of the wall. [[Battlement]]s line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and about {{convert|23|cm|abbr=on}} wide. From the parapets, guards could survey the surrounding land.{{sfn|Turnbull|2007|p=29}} Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall, including the ability to call reinforcements and warn [[garrisons]] of enemy movements, was of high importance. Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility. Wooden gates could be used as a trap against those going through. Barracks, stables, and armories were built near the wall's inner surface.{{sfn|Turnbull|2007|p=29}}

==Visibility from space==

===From the Moon===

The notion that the Wall can be seen from the moon, (385,000 km, 239,000 miles) is a well-known but implausible myth.

One of the earliest known references to the myth that the Great Wall can be seen from the [[moon]] appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary [[William Stukeley]]. Stukeley wrote that, "This mighty wall {{bracket|[[Hadrian's wall]]}} of four score miles [130&nbsp;km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the [[terrestrial globe]], and may be discerned at the Moon."<ref>''The Family Memoirs of the Rev. William Stukeley'' (1887) Vol. 3, p. 142. (1754).</ref> The claim was also mentioned by [[Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet|Henry Norman]] in 1895 where he states "besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon."<ref>Norman, Henry, ''The Peoples and Politics of the Far East'', p. 215. (1895).</ref> The issue of [[Martian canal|"canals" on Mars]] was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the moon also appears in 1932's ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' strip.<ref name="Ripley">"[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/uploaded_images/great-wall-ripleys-775778.jpg The Great Wall of China], Ripley's Believe It or Not, 1932.</ref>

The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the moon has been debunked many times<ref name="Debunked">[http://urbanlegends.about.com/b/2003/10/08/whats-visible-from-outer-space.htm Urban Legends.com website].

===From low Earth orbit===

The region pictured is {{convert|12|x|12|km|abbr=on|0}}.]]
A more controversial question is whether the Wall is visible from [[low Earth orbit]] (an altitude of as little as {{convert|100|mi|km|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}}). [[NASA]] claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects.<ref name=nasa>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/workinginspace/great_wall.html|title=NASA – Great Wall of China |publisher=Nasa.gov |access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref>

Veteran U.S. astronaut [[Eugene Cernan|Gene Cernan]] has stated: "At Earth orbit of {{convert|100|to|200|mi|km|-1|disp=sqbr}} high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye." [[Ed Lu]], [[Expedition 7]] Science Officer aboard the [[International Space Station]], adds that, "it's less visible than a lot of other objects. And you have to know where to look."

In October 2003, Chinese astronaut [[Yang Liwei]] stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. In response, the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between {{convert|160|and|320|km|mi|abbr=on|-1}}, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye.{{sfn|López-Gil|2008|pp=3–4}}

[[Leroy Chiao]], a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the [[International Space Station]] that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the ''[[China Daily]]'' later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.<ref name=Francis>Markus, Francis.
