'''''Roe v. Wade''''', 410 U.S. 113 (1973),<ref>{{ussc|name=Roe v.

''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped American politics, dividing much of the United States into [[United States abortion-rights movement|abortion rights]] and [[United States anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion]] movements, while activating [[grassroots]] movements on both sides.

The decision involved the case of a woman named [[Norma McCorvey]]{{mdash}}known in her lawsuit under the pseudonym "Jane Roe"{{mdash}}who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child. McCorvey wanted an abortion, but she lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. She was referred to lawyers [[Sarah Weddington]] and [[Linda Coffee]], who filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local [[district attorney]], [[Henry Wade]], alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] heard the case and ruled in her favor. Texas then appealed this ruling directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.

In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision ruling that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] provides a "right to privacy" that protects a pregnant woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. But it also ruled that this right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and protecting prenatal life.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(a)(i)}}{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} The Court resolved this [[balancing test]] by tying state regulation of abortion to the three [[Trimester (pregnancy)#Physiology|trimesters of pregnancy]]: during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all; during the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations; during the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exceptions for cases when they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} The Court classified the right to choose to have an abortion as "fundamental", which required courts to evaluate challenged abortion laws under the "[[strict scrutiny]]" standard, the highest level of judicial review in the United States.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}

==Background==

===History of abortion laws in the United States===
According to the Court, "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage." Providing a historical analysis on abortion, Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] noted that abortion was "resorted to without scruple" in Greek and Roman times.<ref>''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 130.</ref> Blackmun also addressed the permissive and restrictive abortion attitudes and laws throughout history, noting the disagreements among leaders (of all different professions) in those eras and the formative laws and cases.<ref>''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 131–36, 143.</ref> In the United States, in 1821, Connecticut passed the first state statute criminalizing abortion.

With the passage of the California Therapeutic Abortion Act<ref>California Health & Safety Code § 25950 ''et seq.''</ref> in 1967, abortion became essentially legal on demand in that state.  Pregnant women in other states could travel to California to obtain legal abortions—if they could afford to.  A flight from Dallas to Los Angeles was nicknamed "the abortion special" because so many of its passengers were traveling for that reason.  There were prepackaged trips known as the "non-family plan".<ref>See Karen Blumenthal, ''Jane Against the World: Roe v. Wade and the Fight for Reproductive Rights'', Roaring Brook Press, 2020.</ref>

=== History of the case ===
In June 1969, 21-year-old [[Norma McCorvey]] discovered she was pregnant with her third child. She returned to [[Dallas]], where friends advised her to falsely claim that she had been raped, incorrectly believing that Texas law allowed abortion in cases of rape and incest when it actually allowed abortion only "for the purpose of saving the life of the mother". She attempted to obtain an [[illegal abortion]], but found that the unauthorized facility had been closed down by the police. Eventually, she was referred to attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]].<ref>McCorvey, Norma and Meisler, Andy. ''I Am Roe: My Life, Roe V. Wade, and Freedom of Choice'' (Harper Collins 1994).</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Contemporary Cases in Women's Rights|last = Friedman Goldstein|first = Leslie|publisher = The University of Wisconsin|year = 1994|location = Madison|page = 15}}</ref> McCorvey would end up giving birth before the case was decided, and the child was put up for adoption.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Rourke |first1=Mary |last2=Reyes |first2=Emily Alpert |date=February 18, 2017 |title=Norma McCorvey, once-anonymous plaintiff in 'Roe vs. Wade,' dies at 69 |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-norma-mccorvey-snap-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref>

In 1970, Coffee and Weddington filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] on behalf of McCorvey (under the alias [[John Doe|Jane Roe]]). The defendant in the case was [[Dallas County District Attorney]] [[Henry Wade]], who represented the State of Texas. McCorvey was no longer claiming her pregnancy was a result of rape, and later acknowledged that she had lied about having been raped, in hope to circumvent a Texas law that banned abortions except when the woman's life is in danger.<ref>[[Richard Ostling]].

On June 17, 1970, a three-judge panel of the District Court, consisting of Northern District of Texas Judges [[Sarah T.

In addition, the court relied on Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]]'s 1965 concurrence in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''. The court, however, declined to grant an [[injunction]] against enforcement of the law.<ref>O'Connor, Karen.

==Issues before the Supreme Court==
===Oral arguments and initial discussions===
''Roe v. Wade'' reached the Supreme Court on appeal in 1970. The justices delayed taking action on ''Roe'' and a closely related case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', until they had decided ''[[Younger v. Harris]]'' (because they felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial jurisdiction) and ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'' (in which they considered the constitutionality of a [[Washington D.C.|District of Columbia]] statute that criminalized abortion except where the mother's life or health was endangered). In ''Vuitch'', the Court narrowly upheld the statute, though in doing so, it treated abortion as a medical procedure and stated that physicians must be given room to determine what constitutes a danger to (physical or mental) health. The day after they announced their decision in ''Vuitch'', they voted to hear both ''Roe'' and ''Doe''.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=77–79}}</ref>

Arguments were scheduled by the full Court for December 13, 1971. Before the Court could hear the oral arguments, Justices [[Hugo Black]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]] retired. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] asked Justice [[Potter Stewart]] and Justice Blackmun to determine whether ''Roe'' and ''Doe'', among others, should be heard as scheduled. According to Blackmun, Stewart felt that the cases were a straightforward application of ''Younger v. Harris'', and they recommended that the Court move forward as scheduled.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=80}}</ref>

In his opening argument in defense of the abortion restrictions, attorney Jay Floyd made what was later described as the "worst joke in legal history."<ref name="salon">Sant, Geoffrey. "[http://www.salon.com/2013/07/26/8_horrible_courtroom_jokes_and_their_ensuing_legal_calamity 8 horrible courtroom jokes and their ensuing legal calamities]", ''Salon.com'' (July 27, 2013): "The title of Worst Joke in Legal History belongs to one of history's highest-profile cases. Defending Texas's abortion restrictions before the Supreme Court, attorney Mr. Jay Floyd decided to open oral argument with a sexist joke.

Retrieved August 10, 2010.</ref> Appearing against two female lawyers, Floyd began, "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

He glared him down."<ref>{{harvnb|Malphurs|2010|p=48}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Garrow|1994|p=526}}</ref>

After a first round of arguments, all seven justices tentatively agreed that the Texas law should be struck down, but on varying grounds.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=81}}</ref> Burger assigned the role of writing the Court's opinion in ''Roe'' (as well as ''Doe'') to Blackmun, who began drafting a preliminary opinion that emphasized what he saw as the Texas law's vagueness.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1988|p=103}}</ref> (At this point, Black and Harlan had been replaced by Justices [[William Rehnquist]] and [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]], but they arrived too late to hear the first round of arguments.) But Blackmun felt that his opinion did not adequately reflect his liberal colleagues' views.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=81–88}}</ref> In May 1972, he proposed that the case be reargued. Justice [[William O. Douglas]] threatened to write a dissent from the reargument order (he and the other liberal justices were suspicious that Rehnquist and Powell would vote to uphold the statute), but was coaxed out of the action by his colleagues, and his dissent was merely mentioned in the reargument order without further statement or opinion.<ref>{{harvnb|Garrow|1994|p=556}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=89}}</ref> The case was reargued on October 11, 1972.

Flowers]] represented Wade."-->

===Drafting the opinion===
Blackmun continued to work on his opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again. Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s. After the Court heard the second round of arguments, Powell said he would agree with Blackmun's conclusion but pushed for ''Roe'' to be the lead of the two abortion cases being considered. Powell also suggested that the Court strike down the Texas law on privacy grounds. Justice [[Byron White]] was unwilling to sign on to Blackmun's opinion, and Rehnquist had already decided to dissent.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=93–95}}</ref>

Prior to the decision, the justices discussed the trimester framework at great length. Justice Powell had suggested that the point where the state could intervene be placed at viability, which Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] supported as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=96–97}}</ref> In an internal memo to the other justices before the majority decision was published, Justice Blackmun wrote: "You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical.

== Supreme Court decision ==
On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in favor of Norma McCorvey ("Jane Roe") that held that women in the United States have a fundamental right to choose whether or not to have abortions without excessive government restriction, and struck down Texas's abortion ban as unconstitutional. The decision was issued together with a companion case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', that involved a similar challenge to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s abortion laws.

===Opinion of the Court===
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, detail.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], the author of the majority opinion in ''Roe v. Wade'']]
Seven justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]]. The opinion recited the facts of the case, then dealt with issues of procedure and [[justiciability]] before proceeding to the main constitutional issues of the case.

==== Standing ====
The Court's opinion first addressed the legal issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]]. Under the traditional interpretation of these rules, Norma McCorvey's ("Jane Roe") appeal was moot because she had already given birth to her child and thus would not be affected by the ruling; she also lacked standing to assert the rights of other pregnant women.<ref>Abernathy, M. et al. (1993), ''[https://books.google.com/?id=tHhlYpWokFIC Civil Liberties Under the Constitution]''. U. South Carolina, p. 4. Retrieved February 4, 2007.</ref> As she did not present an "actual [[case or controversy]]" (a grievance and a demand for relief), any opinion issued by the Supreme Court would constitute an [[advisory opinion]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubAKAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62|title=Constitutional Law: Principles and Practice|last1=Hames|first1=Joanne Banker|last2=Ekern|first2=Yvonne|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-40122-5|pages=62|language=en}}</ref>

The Court concluded that the case came within an established exception to the rule: one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review".<ref>{{cite book |title=Federal Jurisdiction |series=Introduction to Law |first=Erwin |last=Chemerinsky |author-link=Erwin Chemerinsky |edition=4th |publisher=Aspen Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7355-2718-8 |page=132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgpGAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice [[Joseph McKenna]] in ''[[Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC]]''.<ref>{{ussc|name=Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission|volume=219|page=498|pin=|year=1911}}.</ref> Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna and noted that pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied."<ref>''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 125; see also {{harvnb|Schwartz|1988|pp=108–09}}</ref>

==== Abortion and right to privacy ====
After dealing with standing, the Court then proceeded to the main issue of the case: the constitutionality of abortion laws. It began with a historical survey of the legal status of abortion across [[Roman law]] and the [[Common law|Anglo-American common law]].{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} It also reviewed the developments of medical procedures and technology to perform abortions, which had only become reliably safe in the early 20th century.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}

After its historical survey, the Court introduced the concept of a constitutional "right to privacy" that was intimated in earlier cases involving parental control over childrearing (''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' and ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'') and reproductive autonomy with the use of contraception (''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'').{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} Then, "with virtually no further explanation of the privacy value",{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} the Court ruled that regardless of exactly which of its provisions were involved, the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of liberty covered a right to privacy that generally protected a pregnant woman's decision whether or not to abort a pregnancy.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}

The Court reasoned that outlawing abortions would infringe a pregnant woman's right to privacy for several reasons: having unwanted children "may force upon the woman a distressful life and future"; it may bring imminent psychological harm; caring for the child may tax the mother's physical and mental health; and because there may be "distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child".<ref>{{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}, quoting ''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 153.</ref> 

But the Court rejected the notion that this right to privacy was absolute. It held instead that the abortion right must be balanced against other government interests. The Court found two government interests that were sufficiently "compelling" to permit states to impose some limitations on the right to choose to have an abortion: first, protecting the mother's health, and second, protecting the life of the fetus.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}

{{Quote
|text=A State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. ...

The state of Texas had argued that total bans on abortion were justifiable because "life" begins at the moment of [[Fertilisation#Humans|conception]], and therefore its governmental interest in protecting prenatal life should apply to all pregnancies regardless of their stage.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} But the Court found that there was no indication that the Constitution's uses of the word "person" were meant to include fetuses, and so it rejected Texas's argument that a fetus should be considered a "person" with a legal and constitutional right to life.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} It noted that there was still great disagreement over when an unborn fetus becomes a living being.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, pp. 887–88}}

}}
The Court settled on the three [[Trimester (pregnancy)|trimesters of pregnancy]] as the framework to resolve the problem. During the first trimester, when it was believed that the procedure was [[Abortion#Safety|safer than childbirth]], the Court ruled that the government could place no restriction on a woman's ability to choose to abort a pregnancy other than minimal medical safeguards such as requiring a licensed physician to perform the procedure.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} From the second trimester on, the Court ruled that evidence of increasing risks to the mother's health gave the state a compelling interest, and that it could enact medical regulations on the procedure so long as they were reasonable and "narrowly tailored" to protecting mothers' health.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} Since the beginning of the third trimester was normally considered to be the point at which a fetus became viable under the level of medical science available in the early 1970s, the Court ruled that during the third trimester the state had a compelling interest in protecting prenatal life, and could legally prohibit all abortions except where necessary to protect the mother's life or health.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}

The Court concluded that Texas's abortion statutes were unconstitutional, and struck them down:
{{quote|A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|source=''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 164.}}

=== Concurrences ===
Several other members of the Supreme Court filed concurring opinions in the case. Justice [[Potter Stewart]] wrote a concurring opinion in which he stated that even though the Constitution makes no mention of the right to choose to have an abortion without interference, he thought the Court's decision was a permissible interpretation of the doctrine of [[substantive due process]], which says that the [[Due Process Clause]]{{'s}} protection of liberty extends beyond simple procedures and protects certain fundamental rights.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}}{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp:18.29(b)(i)}} Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote a concurring opinion in which he described how he believed that while the Court was correct to find that the right to choose to have an abortion was a fundamental right, it would be better to derive it from the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]{{mdash}}which states that the fact that a right is not specifically enumerated in the Constitution shall not be construed to mean that American people do not possess it{{mdash}}rather than through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}}{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp:18.29(b)(i)}} Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote a concurrence in which he wrote that he thought it would be permissible to allow a state to require two physicians to certify an abortion before it could be performed.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}}

Justices [[Byron White]] and [[William Rehnquist]] dissented from the Court's decision, and their dissents touched on points that would lead to later criticism of the ''Roe'' decision.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}

White's dissent was issued with ''Roe''{{'s}} companion case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', and describes his belief that the Court had no basis for deciding between the competing values of pregnant women and unborn children. He believed that the legality of abortion should "be left with the people and the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."<ref>{{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888}}, quoting ''Doe'', 410 U.S. at 222 (White, J., dissenting).</ref>
{{Quote
|text=I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant women and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the woman, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.

Rehnquist's dissent compared the majority's use of [[substantive due process]] to the Court's repudiated use of the doctrine in the 1905 case ''[[Lochner v. New York]]''.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} He elaborated on several of White's points, asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:
{{quote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.
|source=''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 174–76 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<ref name="Roe">''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 174–77 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Currie |first=David |title=The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888–1986|volume=2|page=470|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.economist.com/node/4134124 Rehnquist's legacy]", ''[[The Economist]]'' (June 30, 2005).</ref>}}

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Therefore, in his view, "the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKjOeBQIcc8C&pg=PA602|title=American Constitutional Law: Essays, Cases, and Comparative Notes|last1=Kommers|first1=Donald P.|last2=Finn|first2=John E.|last3=Jacobsohn|first3=Gary J.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-2687-7|language=en}}</ref>

Advocates of ''Roe'' describe it as vital to the preservation of [[women's rights]], personal freedom, bodily integrity, and privacy. Advocates have also reasoned that access to safe abortion and reproductive freedom generally are fundamental rights. Some scholars (not including any member of the Supreme Court) have equated the denial of abortion rights to compulsory motherhood, and have argued that abortion bans therefore violate the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]:

{{quote|When women are compelled to carry and bear children, they are subjected to 'involuntary servitude' in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment….[E]ven if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy, that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant.<ref name="Koppelman" />}}

=== Public opinion ===
{{See also|Abortion in the United States#Public opinion|l1=Abortion in the United States: Public opinion}}
Americans have been equally divided on the issue; a May 2018 [[Gallup poll]] indicated that 48% of Americans described themselves as "pro-choice" and 48% described themselves as "pro-life". A July 2018 poll indicated that only 28% of Americans wanted the Supreme Court to overturn ''Roe v. Wade'', while 64% did not want the ruling to be overturned.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx | title=Gallup: Abortion | publisher=[[Gallup poll]]| date=June 22, 2007 }}</ref>

A [[Gallup poll]] conducted in May 2009 indicated that 53% of Americans believed that abortions should be legal under certain circumstances, 23% believed abortion should be legal under any circumstances, and 22% believed that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. However, in this poll, more Americans referred to themselves as "Pro-Life" than "Pro-Choice" for the first time since the poll asked the question in 1995, with 51% identifying as "Pro-Life" and 42% identifying as "Pro-Choice".<ref>Saad, Lydia.

People who said they support abortion in all or most cases dropped from 54% in 2008 to 46% in 2009.<ref>[http://people-press.org/report/513/ "Public Takes Conservative Turn on Gun Control, Abortion Americans Now Divided Over Both Issues"], [[Pew Research Center]] (April 30, 2009).</ref>

In contrast, an October 2007 [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris]] poll on ''Roe v. Wade'' asked the following question:
{{quote|In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that states laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide. In general, do you favor or oppose this part of the U.S. Supreme Court decision making abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal?<ref name="Lowest" />}}

In reply, 56% of respondents indicated favour while 40% indicated opposition. The Harris organization concluded from this poll that "56 percent now favours the U.S. Supreme Court decision."

== Role in subsequent decisions and politics ==
Opposition to ''Roe'' on the bench grew when President Reagan, who supported legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied that there was any [[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]]: "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law. We've had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating."<ref>Reagan, Ronald. ''[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/62386e.htm Interview With Eleanor Clift, Jack Nelson, and Joel Havemann of the Los Angeles Times]'' (June 23, 1986). Retrieved January 23, 2007.</ref>

In addition to White and Rehnquist, Reagan appointee [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing in 1983 that the trimester-based analysis devised by the ''Roe'' Court was "unworkable."<ref>{{ussc|name=City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health|volume=462|page=416|pin=|year=1983}}.</ref> Shortly before his retirement from the bench, Chief Justice Warren Burger suggested in 1986 that ''Roe'' be "reexamined";<ref name="Thornburgh">{{ussc|name=Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|volume=476|page=747|pin=|year=1986}}.</ref> the associate justice who filled Burger's place on the Court—Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]—vigorously opposed ''Roe''. Concern about overturning ''Roe'' played a major role in the defeat of [[Robert Bork]]'s nomination to the Court in 1987; the man eventually appointed to replace ''Roe''-supporter Lewis Powell was [[Anthony Kennedy]].

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] used the rulings in both ''Roe'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' as grounds to find Canada's federal law restricting access to abortions unconstitutional. That Canadian case, ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', was decided in 1988.<ref>[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1988/1988rcs1-30/1988rcs1-30.html ''R. v.

=== ''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'' ===
{{Main|Webster v. Reproductive Health Services}}
In a 5–4 decision in 1989's ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule ''Roe'', because "none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution."<ref name="Webster">{{ussc|name=Webster v. Reproductive Health Services|volume=492|page=490|pin=|year=1989}}.</ref> In this case, the Court upheld several abortion restrictions, and modified the ''Roe'' trimester framework.<ref name="Webster"/>

In concurring opinions, O'Connor refused to reconsider ''Roe'', and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] criticized the Court and O'Connor for not overruling ''Roe''.<ref name="Webster"/> Blackmun—author of the ''Roe'' decision—stated in his dissent that White, Kennedy and Rehnquist were "callous" and "deceptive," that they deserved to be charged with "cowardice and illegitimacy," and that their [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] opinion "foments disregard for the law."<ref name="Webster"/> White had recently opined that the majority reasoning in ''Roe v.

=== ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' ===
{{Main|Planned Parenthood v. Casey}}

During initial deliberations for ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), an initial majority of five Justices (Rehnquist, White, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) were willing to effectively overturn ''Roe''. [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] changed his mind after the initial conference,<ref>{{cite news|last=Totenberg|first=Nina|author-link=Nina Totenberg|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1745254|title=Documents Reveal Battle to Preserve 'Roe'; Court Nearly Reversed Abortion Ruling, Blackmun Papers Show|publisher=NPR|work=Morning Edition|date=March 4, 2004|access-date=January 30, 2007}}</ref> and O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter joined Blackmun and Stevens to reaffirm the central holding of ''Roe'',<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=203–06}}</ref> saying, "Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. [...] These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."<ref>''Casey'', 505 U.S. at 851.</ref> Only Justice Blackmun would have retained ''Roe'' entirely and struck down all aspects of the statute at issue in ''Casey''.<ref name=Blackmun/>

Scalia's dissent acknowledged that abortion rights are of "great importance to many women", but asserted that it is not a liberty protected by the Constitution, because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally proscribed. Scalia concluded: "[B]y foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish."<ref>''Casey'', 505 U.S. at 1002 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</ref>

=== ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' ===
{{Main|Stenberg v. Carhart}}
During the 1990s, the state of [[Nebraska]] attempted to ban a certain second-trimester abortion procedure known as [[intact dilation and extraction]] (sometimes called partial birth abortion). The Nebraska ban allowed other second-trimester abortion procedures called [[dilation and evacuation]] abortions. Ginsburg (who replaced White) stated, "this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'."<ref name="Stenberg">{{ussc|name=Stenberg v. Carhart|volume=530|page=914|pin=958–59|year=2000}} ("The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.").</ref> The Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban by a 5–4 vote in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), citing a right to use the safest method of second trimester abortion.

Kennedy, who had co-authored the 5–4 ''Casey'' decision upholding ''Roe'', was among the dissenters in ''Stenberg'', writing that Nebraska had done nothing unconstitutional.<ref name="Stenberg"/> In his dissent, Kennedy described the second trimester abortion procedure that Nebraska was not seeking to prohibit, and thus argued that since this dilation and evacuation procedure remained available in Nebraska, the state was free to ban the other procedure sometimes called "partial birth abortion."<ref name="Stenberg"/>

The remaining three dissenters in ''Stenberg''—Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas—disagreed again with ''Roe'': "Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_43QFgpjjOgC&pg=PA128|title=Retreat from Injustice: Human Rights Law in Australia|last1=O'Neill|first1=Nicholas K.

Casey]]'' in 1992,<ref name=Atlantic>{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Emma|title=A New Supreme Court Challenge: The Erosion of Abortion Access in Texas|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/a-new-supreme-court-challenge-the-erosion-of-abortion-access-in-texas/415929/|access-date=January 26, 2016|work=Atlantic|date=November 13, 2015}}</ref><ref name="20160627Reuters">{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion-idUSKCN0ZC0JL|title=Supreme Court firmly backs abortion rights, tosses Texas law|last=Hurley|first=Lawrence|date=June 28, 2016|website=Reuters|access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name="20160627CNN">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/27/politics/supreme-court-abortion-texas/|title=Supreme Court strikes down Texas abortion access law|date=June 27, 2015|publisher=CNN|author= Ariane de Vogue, Tal Kopan and Dan Berman|access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref> the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision on June 27, 2016, swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain "admitting privileges" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions "facially" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]]—that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts and not the legislatures.<ref name="20160627SCOTUSDenniston">{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

=== Activities of Norma McCorvey ===
[[Norma McCorvey]] became a member of the anti-abortion movement in 1995; she supported making abortion illegal until shortly before her death in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39016181 |title=Roe v Wade: Woman in US abortion legal test case dies |website=bbc.co.uk |date=February 18, 2017}}</ref> In 1998, she testified to Congress:
{{quote|It was my pseudonym, Jane Roe, which had been used to create the "right" to abortion out of legal thin air. But Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee never told me that what I was signing would allow women to come up to me 15, 20 years later and say, "Thank you for allowing me to have my five or six abortions. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible." Sarah never mentioned women using abortions as a form of birth control. We talked about truly desperate and needy women, not women already wearing maternity clothes.<ref name="testimony"/>}}

As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas to have ''Roe v. Wade'' overturned. However, the [[Fifth Circuit]] decided that her case was moot, in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]''.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=McCorvey v. Hill |vol=385 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=846 |pinpoint= |court=5th Cir. |date=2004 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/385/846/582508/ |accessdate=May 17, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In a concurring opinion, Judge [[Edith Jones]] agreed that McCorvey was raising legitimate questions about emotional and other harm suffered by women who have had abortions, about increased resources available for the care of unwanted children, and about new scientific understanding of fetal development. However, Jones said she was compelled to agree that the case was moot.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} On February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]], and McCorvey's appeal ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In an interview shortly before her death, McCorvey stated that she had taken an anti-abortion position because she had been paid to do so and that her campaign against abortion had been an act. She also stated that it did not matter to her if women wanted to have an abortion and they should be free to choose.<ref name="LAT-20200519" /><ref name="WP-20200520" /><ref name="FRBS-20200519">{{cite news |last1=Porterfield |first1=Carlie |title='Roe Vs.

=== Activities of Sarah Weddington ===
After arguing before the Court in ''Roe v.

Generally, presidential opinion has been split between major party lines. The ''Roe'' decision was opposed by [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Gerald Ford]],<ref>Ford, Gerald.

President [[Jimmy Carter]] supported legal abortion from an early point in his political career, in order to prevent birth defects and in other extreme cases; he encouraged the outcome in ''Roe'' and generally supported abortion rights.<ref>Carter, James Earl.

Years later, he had written the foreword to a book, ''Women in Need'', that favored a woman's right to abortion. He had given private encouragement to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit, ''Doe v. Bolton'', filed against the state of Georgia to overturn its archaic abortion laws."</ref> ''Roe'' was also supported by President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>Clinton, Bill.

President [[Donald Trump]] has publicly opposed the decision, vowing to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/politics/abortion-roe-v-wade-supreme-court/index.html | title = The plan to overturn Roe v.

Further concerns were raised following the May 2019 Supreme Court 5–4 decision along ideological lines in ''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (2019)|Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt]]''. While the case had nothing to do with abortion rights, the decision overturned a previous 1979 decision from ''Nevada v. Hall'' without maintaining the ''[[stare decisis]]'' precedent, indicating the current Court makeup would be willing to apply the same to overturn ''Roe v. Wade''.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/opinion/roe-supreme-court.html | title = Supreme Court Liberals Raise Alarm Bells About Roe v.

=== State laws regarding ''Roe'' ===
[[File:Guttmacher Abortion Restrictions.SVG|thumb|upright=1.1|Since 2010 there has been an increase in state restrictions on abortion.]]

Several states have enacted so-called [[trigger law]]s which would take effect in the event that ''Roe v. Wade'' is overturned, with the effect of outlawing abortions on the state level. Those states include Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota.<ref name="Vestal">Vestal, Christine.

[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D71738F93BA35754C0A96F948260 "Louisiana Moves Against Abortion"], ''The New York Times'' (July 8, 1989).</ref>

Other states have passed laws to maintain the legality of abortion if ''Roe v. Wade'' is overturned. Those states include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada and Washington.<ref name="Vestal" />

The Mississippi Legislature has attempted to make abortion unfeasible without having to overturn ''Roe v. Wade''. The Mississippi law as of 2012 was being challenged in federal courts and was temporarily blocked.<ref>LZ Granderson [http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/11/opinion/granderson-mississippi-abortion/index.html?hpt=hp_c1 "Mississippi's end run around abortion"], ''[[CNN]]'' (July 12, 2012).</ref>

Alabama House Republicans passed a law on April 30, 2019 that will criminalize abortion if it goes into effect.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stracqualursi |first=Veronica |title=Alabama House passes bill that would make abortion a felony |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/politics/alabama-house-abortion-bill/index.html |website=CNN |access-date=May 2, 2019 |date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> It offers only two exceptions: serious health risk to the mother or a lethal fetal anomaly.

According to a 2019 study, if ''Roe v.
