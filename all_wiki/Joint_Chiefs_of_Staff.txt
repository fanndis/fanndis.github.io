The '''Joint Chiefs of Staff''' ('''JCS''') is the body of the most senior uniformed leaders within the [[United States Department of Defense]], which advises the [[president of the United States]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]], the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]] and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by [[statute]] and consists of a [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|chairman]] (CJCS), a [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|vice chairman]] (VJCS), the service chiefs of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army]], [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[Chief of Naval Operations|Navy]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[Chief of Space Operations|Space Force]], and the [[chief of the National Guard Bureau]].<ref name="armytimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2012/01/army-air-force-top-guard-officer-joins-joint-chiefs-010412w/ |title=Top Guard officer joins Joint Chiefs of Staff |work=Army Times |date=4 January 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/151- 10 USC 151].

Following the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] in 1986, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not have operational command authority, either individually or collectively, as the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] goes from the president to the secretary of defense, and from the secretary to the regional [[Unified Combatant Command|combatant commanders]].<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C.]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C6.txt §162(b)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529014041/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C6.txt |date=29 May 2013 }}</ref> Goldwater–Nichols also created the office of vice chairman, and the chairman is now designated as the principal military adviser to the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council, the National Security Council and the president.<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt §151(b)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312222255/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt |date=12 March 2013 }}</ref>

The [[#Joint_Staff|Joint Staff]] (JS) is a headquarters staff in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], composed of personnel from each of the six service branches, that assists the chairman and the vice chairman in discharging their responsibilities and is managed by the [[director of the Joint Staff]] (DJS).<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt §155] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312222255/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt |date=12 March 2013 }}</ref>

==Role and responsibilities==
[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff (31662768614).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Joint Chiefs of Staff, including the commandant of the Coast Guard but minus the vice chairman, in January 2017.]]
After the 1986 reorganization of the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] undertaken by the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]], the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not possess operational authority over troops or other units. Responsibility for conducting military operations goes from the [[President of the United States of America|president]] to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]] directly to the commanders of the [[Unified Combatant Command|unified combatant command]]s and thus bypasses the Joint Chiefs of Staff completely.

Today, their primary responsibility is to ensure personnel readiness, policy, planning and training of their respective services for the combatant commanders to utilize. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also act in an advisory capacity for the president of the United States and the secretary of defense. In addition, the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] acts as the chief military advisor to the president and the secretary of defense. In this strictly advisory role, the Joint Chiefs constitute the third-highest deliberatory body for military policy, after the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], which includes the president and other officials besides the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

While serving as the chairman or vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, chief of staff of the Army, commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of Naval Operations, chief of staff of the Air Force, or commandant of the Coast Guard, the salary is $15,583.20 a month,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/military_pay_scale.asp|title=2017 Military Pay Scale|publisher=Military Factory|date= May 2017}}</ref> regardless of cumulative years of service completed under section 205 of [[Title 37 of the United States Code|title 37]], [[United States Code]].

The [[United States Space Force|U.S. Space Force]] is headed by the chief of space operations, who reports directly to the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|secretary of the Air Force]]. Pursuant to {{USC|10|9082}}, the chief of space operations is not a statutory member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until 20 December 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s1790/BILLS-116s1790enr.pdf |title=National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 |url-status=live |accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref>

====Commandant of the Coast Guard====

==History==

===Joint Board===
[[File:Secretary of Defense Harold Brown with the Joint Chiefs of Staff member at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|257x257px|[[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]] and [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Charles Duncan Jr.|Charles W. Duncan Jr]] with [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff]] General [[George Scratchley Brown|George S. Brown]] and the other members of The Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon 1977.|alt=]]
As the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] grew in size following the [[American Civil War]], joint military action between the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] became increasingly difficult. The Army and Navy were unsupportive of each other at either the planning or operational level and were constrained by disagreements during the [[Spanish–American War]] in the [[Caribbean]] campaigns.<ref name="Millett">{{cite book |first=Allan R. |last=Millett |title=Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1980 |page=269 [para. 2] |isbn=0-02-921590-0 }}</ref><ref name=jcs>{{Cite web |title=Origin of Joint Concepts |url=http://www.jcs.mil/About/Origin-of-Joint-Concepts/ |publisher=Joint Chiefs of Staff |access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref> The Joint Army and Navy Board was established in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], comprising representatives from the military heads and chief planners of both the Navy's [[General Board]] and the Army's [[General Staff]]. The Joint Board acting as an "advisory committee" was created to plan joint operations and resolve problems of common [[interservice rivalry|rivalry]] between the two services.<ref name="Millett"/><ref name=jcs/>

Yet, the Joint Board accomplished little, as its charter gave it no authority to enforce its decisions. The Joint Board also lacked the ability to originate its own opinions and was thus limited to commenting only on the problems submitted to it by the [[United States Secretary of War|secretaries of war]] and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy]]. As a result, the Joint Board had little to no impact on the manner in which the United States conducted World War I.

After World War I, in 1919 the two secretaries agreed to reestablish and revitalize the Joint Board. The mission of the General Staff was to develop plans for mobilization for the next war; the U.S. was always designated "blue" and [[United States color-coded war plans|potential enemies were assigned various other colors]].<ref>{{cite book |page=26 |first1=John H. |last1=Bradley |first2=Thomas E. |last2=Griess |first3=Jack W. |last3=Dice |others=[[United States Military Academy]], Dept. of History |title=The Second World War: Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Square One |year=2002 |isbn=0-7570-0162-9 }}</ref>

This time, the Joint Board's membership would include the chiefs of staff, their deputies, and the chief of [[War Plans Division|war plans division]] for the Army and director of plans division for the Navy. Under the Joint Board would be a staff called the Joint Planning Committee to serve the board. Along with new membership, the Joint Board could initiate recommendations on its own initiative. However, the Joint Board still did not possess the legal authority to enforce its decisions.

===World War II===

King]], Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations; and Gen. [[George C. Marshall]], Chief of Staff of the United States Army.]]

U.S. president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] established the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] (CCS) during the 1942 [[Arcadia Conference]].<ref Name=WCP>{{cite book |title=United States Army in World War II – The War Department – Washington Command Post: The Operations Division; Chapter VI.

C. |pages=98–104 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/WCP/ChapterVI.htm#p98 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> The CCS would serve as the supreme military body for strategic direction of the joint U.S.–UK war effort.

The UK portion of the CCS would be composed of the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]], but the United States had no equivalent body. The Joint Board's lack of authority made it of little use to the CCS, although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, did give some guidance for the joint operations during World War II. The Joint Board had little influence during the war and was ultimately disbanded in 1947.

As a counterpart to the UK's Chiefs of Staff Committee in the CCS, and to provide better coordinated effort and coordinated staff work for America's military effort, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] proposed a "unified high command" in what would come to be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Modeled on the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, the JCS' first formal meeting was held on 9 February 1942, to coordinate operations between War and Navy Departments.<ref Name=WCP /><ref>{{cite book |title=United States Army in World War II – The War Department – Global Logistics and Strategy 1940–1943 |last=Leighton |first=Richard M. |author2=Robert W Coakley |year=1995 |publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.

Each of the members of the original Joint Chiefs was a four-star flag or general officer in his service branch. By the end of the war each had been promoted: Leahy and King to [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]]; Marshall and Arnold to [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]]. Arnold was later appointed to the grade of [[General of the Air Force]].

One of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's committees was the Joint Strategic Survey Committee (JSSC). The JSSC, "one of the most influential planning agencies in the wartime armed forces", was an extraordinary JCS committee that existed from 1942 until 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Stoler |title=From Continentalism to Globalism: General Stanley D.

Fairchild]], U.S. Army Air Force, 1942–?.

===National Security Act of 1947===
[[File:US Joint Chiefs of Staff Jul 1983.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Joint Chiefs of Staff and several combatant commanders gathered at the Pentagon on 1 July 1983.]]

With the end of World War II, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was officially established under the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. Per the National Security Act, the JCS consisted of a chairman, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|chief of staff of the Army]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|chief of staff of the Air Force]] (which was established as a separate service by the same Act), and the [[Chief of Naval Operations|chief of naval operations]]. The [[commandant of the Marine Corps]] was to be consulted on matters concerning the Corps, but was not a regular member; General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.]], Commandant in 1952–55, was the first to sit as an occasional member. The law was amended during the term of General [[Louis H. Wilson, Jr.]] (1975–79), making the commandant a full-time JCS member in parity with the other three DoD services.

The position of vice chairman was created by the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] of 1986 to complement the CJCS, as well as to delegate some of the chairman's responsibilities, particularly resource allocation through the [[Joint Requirements Oversight Council]] (JROC).

General [[Colin Powell|Colin L. Powell]] (1989–1993) was the first African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General [[Charles Q. Brown Jr.]] was the first African-American to be appointed as Chief of Staff  of the United States Air Force and the first African-American to lead any branch of the services. General [[Peter Pace]] (Vice Chairman 2001–2005; Chairman, 2005–2007) was the first Marine to serve in either position. No woman has ever served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

===National Defense Authorization Act of 2012===
A provision in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act added the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Guard historians called it the "most significant development" for the National Guard since the [[Militia Act of 1903]].<ref name="armytimes"/>

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is, by law, the highest-ranking military officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]],<ref name="CJCS">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/152-] 10 USC 152.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff have offices in [[the Pentagon]]. The chairman outranks all service chiefs,<ref name="head">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/152-#c] 10 USC 152(c).

On 20 July 1942, [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] became Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief (20 July 1942 – 21 March 1949). He was not technically the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Leahy's office was the precursor to the post of "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff". That post was established and first held by General of the Army [[Omar Bradley]] in 1949.

The current and 20th chairman is General [[Mark A. Milley]], who began his tenure on 30 September 2019.

===Vice Chairman===
{{Main|Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff}}

The position of [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] was created by the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] of 1986. The vice chairman is a four-star-[[General (United States)|general]] or [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] and, by law, is the second highest-ranking member of the U.S. Armed Forces (after the chairman). In the absence of the chairman, the vice chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He may also perform such duties as the chairman may prescribe. It was not until the National Defense Authorization Act in 1992 that the position was made a full voting member of the JCS.<ref>[http://www.jcs.mil/about_cjs.html About the Joint Chiefs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705063957/http://www.jcs.mil/about_cjs.html |date= 5 July 2006 }}</ref>

As of 2020, no Coast Guard officer has been appointed Chairman or Vice Chairman, but Coast Guard officers routinely serve on the JCS staff, including one [[vice admiral]] who was appointed to serve as J6 in 2016.
