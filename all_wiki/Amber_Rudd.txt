In July 2015, Craig Bennett of [[Friends of the Earth]] accused Rudd of hypocrisy in claiming to want to address climate change while at the same time, in his view, "dismantling an architecture of low-carbon policies carefully put together with cross-party agreement over the course of two parliaments".

In August 2017, Rudd replied to an email hoaxer posing as the recently appointed [[Downing Street Director of Communications]], [[Robbie Gibb]], revealing that "positive announcements" were imminent. The hoaxer used Rudd's public domain parliamentary email address but she replied using her private email, which is not secure.<ref>{{cite news |last=Booth |first=Robert |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/09/amber-rudd-latest-to-fall-victim-to-email-hoaxer-using-fake-account |title=Amber Rudd latest to fall victim to email hoaxer using fake account |work=The Guardian |date=9 August 2017 |access-date=10 August 2017}}</ref>

In September 2017 on ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', Rudd accused Foreign Secretary [[Boris Johnson]] of trying to undermine the Prime Minister, Theresa May, calling him a 'back-seat driver'. She said to Andrew Marr: "I don't want him (Boris) managing the Brexit process."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/amber-rudd-boris-johnson-brexit-latest-back-seat-driving-theresa-may-a7951196.html|title=Amber Rudd accuses Boris Johnson of 'back-seat driving' Brexit process|date=17 September 2017|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref>

On 3 October 2017, during the [[Conservative Party (UK) Conference|Conservative Party Conference]], it was reported that Rudd had hired Tory pollster [[Lynton Crosby]] to help her increase her majority in Hastings and Rye, amid speculation that she was planning to launch a bid for [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leadership of the party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rudd-hires-tory-pollster-amid-talk-of-bid-for-no-10-wnj52zd60|work=[[The Times]]|title=Amber Rudd hires Tory pollster Lynton Crosby amid talk of bid for leadership|first1=Lucy|last1=Fisher|first2=Francis|last2=Elliott|date=3 October 2017}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/oct/03/amber-rudd-lynton-crosby-pm-leadership-bid|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Send for Lynton!

In November 2017, after [[POTUS|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] retweeted 3 anti-Muslim videos from the far right group [[Britain First]], Rudd criticized Trump for promoting the content and argued that Britain First is a hateful organization. Rudd further went on that [[Anglo-American relations|relations between the U.S. and the U.K.]] are vital to the safety of both countries and have saved British lives.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diLTrhRCBQ8></ref>

On 29 April 2018, Rudd [[List of departures from the second May ministry|resigned as Home Secretary]] after misleading the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] on deportation targets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/29/home-secretary-amber-rudd-has-resigned-wake-windrush-scandal/|title=Amber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admits misleading Parliament on migration|last1=McCann|first1=Kate|last2=Mendick|first2=Robert|last3=Crilly|first3=Rob|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43944988|title=Amber Rudd resigns as home secretary|date=29 April 2018|publisher=BBC News|access-date=29 April 2018}}</ref> Later in the same day, [[Sajid Javid]] was appointed as Home Secretary.<ref name=":1" />

In September 2018, during an interview on BBC Two's [[Politics Live]], Rudd was asked if she planned a comeback, to which she replied that she was "not without ambition".<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45399684|title=Rudd: Why I quit over Windrush|date=3 September 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>

====Internet crackdown====
{{main|Internet censorship in the United Kingdom}}
In October 2017, Rudd announced a move by the Conservative government to crack down on what British citizens are permitted to view on the internet. Piloted as part of a campaign against "radicalisation", Rudd stated that the government would be tightening the law so that UK citizens repeatedly reading certain forbidden internet content could face up to 15 years in jail for looking at the websites. Rudd stated "I want to make sure those who view despicable [[terrorist]] content online, including [[jihadi]] websites, [[far-right]] propaganda and [[bomb-making]] instructions, face the full force of the law.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/03/amber-rudd-viewers-of-online-terrorist-material-face-15-years-in-jail|title=Amber Rudd: viewers of online terrorist material face 15 years in jail|date=3 October 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/terrorist-propaganda-criminal-offence-new-law-amber-rudd-streaming-watching-extremist-material-isis-a7979986.html|title=Watching terrorist propaganda online to become a criminal offence, says Tory Home Secretary Amber Rudd|date=3 October 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref>

====Rise in violent crime====
Rudd denied seeing a Home Office report saying cuts to the police force likely were a factor in rising violent crime. A section of the report states: "Since 2012–13, weighted crime demand on the police has risen, largely due to growth in recorded sex offences. At the same time officers’ numbers have fallen by 5% since 2014.  So resources dedicated to serious violence have come under pressure and charge rates have dropped. This may have encouraged offenders. [It is] unlikely to be the factor that triggered the shift in serious violence, but may be an underlying driver that has allowed the rise to continue". Rudd had denied that falling police numbers contributed to increased crime. [[Yvette Cooper]] wrote, "This is shocking. Surely Home Office officials sent the document to Home Sec, to junior ministers and to special advisors? Cant imagine a department withholding from decision makers the evidence & analysis it did for a new strategy. Something has gone very wrong in Home Office".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter|last2=Dodd|first2=Vikram|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/amber-rudd-home-office-violent-crime-report-leaked|title= Amber Rudd denies seeing leaked Home Office violent crime report|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 April 2018|access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

===Secretary of State for Work and Pensions===

On 16 November 2018, Rudd returned to the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] following the resignation of [[Esther McVey]] over opposition to Theresa May's [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill 2017–19|Draft Withdrawal Agreement]] and the [[Brexit negotiations]].

Following the resignation of [[Sarah Newton]], Rudd took on Newton's responsibilities as [[Minister for Disabled People]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/situations-vacant-struggle-to-fill-seats-of-power-left-empty-by-rebellious-mps-r72pn2dqp|title=Brexit: Struggle to fill seats of power left empty by rebellious MPs|last=Political&nbsp;Correspondent|first=Henry Zeffman|date=27 March 2019|work=The Times|access-date=3 April 2019|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

===Brexit===
Ahead of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 Brexit referendum]], Rudd supported the UK remaining in the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35616946|title=EU vote: Where the cabinet and other MPs stand|date=22 June 2016|access-date=5 March 2019|work=BBC News}}</ref>  From late 2018, Rudd said that a second referendum over [[Brexit]] might be appropriate.  Rudd said, 'Parliament has to reach a majority on how it's going to leave the European Union.  If it fails to do so, then I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues.'<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/19/tory-mps-resign-whip-no-deal-brexit-policy-anna-soubry-sarah-wollaston-nick-boles Tory MPs could resign whip if no-deal Brexit becomes primary focus] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

While in then Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, Rudd opposed [[no-deal Brexit]] commenting in March 2019 that it could cause 'generational damage' to the economy. However she withdrew her opposition to no-deal Brexit to retain her cabinet position in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's cabinet in July of that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/13/risks-of-no-deal-brexit-can-be-managed-by-government-says-rudd|title=Risks of no-deal Brexit can be managed by government, says Rudd|work=The Guardian|date=13 August 2019|access-date=29 August 2019|last=Walker|first=Peter}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Rowena|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/amber-rudd-drops-opposition-to-no-deal-brexit|work=The Guardian|date=11 July 2019|access-date=29 August 2019|title=Amber Rudd embraces no-deal Brexit as ministers pitch to Johnson}}</ref> In June, Rudd described the [[2019 British prorogation controversy|prorogation of parliament]] in order to deliver [[Brexit]] as a 'ridiculous suggestion', and that it was 'outrageous to consider proroguing Parliament.

On 7 September 2019 Rudd [[List of departures from the first Johnson ministry|resigned from the cabinet]] and surrendered the Conservative whip (became an independent MP). She cited her reason for resigning as she felt that the government's main objective was a no-deal Brexit over leaving with a deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49623727|title=Amber Rudd: Resignation letter in full|publisher=BBC News|date=7 September 2019|access-date=7 September 2019}}</ref>

===Local issues===
Rudd has been involved in the campaign for the Hastings fishing fleet. Her [[maiden speech]] advocated wholesale reform of the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] (CFP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Fairer deal for fishermen in maiden speech |url=http://amberrudd.co.uk/news/better-transport-a-fairer-deal-for-fishermen-in-maiden-speech/ |website=Amanda Rudd |access-date=30 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103080238/http://amberrudd.co.uk/news/better-transport-a-fairer-deal-for-fishermen-in-maiden-speech/ |archive-date=3 January 2013 }}</ref>

Rudd campaigned successfully for the construction of the [[A259 road#Bexhill to Hastings link road|Hastings to Bexhill Link Road]]. In early 2013, the Government gave the road the go-ahead for construction after ten years of campaigning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planningresource.co.uk/news/1176975 |title=Final funding approval for Bexhill-Hastings link road |publisher=Planningresource.co.uk |date=3 April 2013 |access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref> Rudd is now spearheading a campaign called Complete The Link to see the final stage of the road get funding for construction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Complete the Link | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322223357/http://amberrudd.co.uk/complete-the-link/ | archive-date = 22 March 2016 |url=http://amberrudd.co.uk/news/complete-the-link/ |website=Amber Rudd |access-date=30 March 2015 }}</ref> She has supported electrification of the [[Marshlink Line]] from Hastings to {{rws|Ashford International}}, which could result in extending [[High Speed 1]] and providing a high speed rail link from the constituency to Central London.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer |url=http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/local/renewed-calls-for-high-speed-train-services-at-rail-summit-1-6565080|title=Renewed calls for high speed train services at rail summit| work= [[Hastings & St. Leonards Observer|Hastings Observer]] |date=6 February 2015|access-date=8 March 2015}}</ref>

=== Standing down as MP ===
On 7 September 2019, Rudd confirmed that she would not be standing in [[Hastings and Rye]] because she did not want to divide loyalties in her constituency. However, she openly considered the possibility of standing in a London constituency, with [[Kensington]], [[Putney]] and [[Chelsea and Fulham]] touted as possible seats.<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2019/10/stepping-down-was-only-option-amber-rudd</ref> On 30 October 2019, Rudd announced in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' that she was not going to contest the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|upcoming general election]] even though Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] had asked her to stand again as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate, although Downing Street denied this. However, she added that she was "not finished with politics", opening the door to a possible return to Parliament.<ref name=":3" />

== Political controversies ==

=== Windrush scandal ===
{{main|Windrush scandal}}
In April 2018, it was reported that the British government had threatened the children of immigrants of the "[[Windrush generation]]" who arrived before 1973 with deportation if they could not prove their right to remain in the UK<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43792411|title=May apologises to Caribbean leaders|date=17 April 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref>—however, the relevant documentation had been destroyed.

Later still, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published leaked evidence that Rudd had known about targets: "The six-page memo, passed to the Guardian, says the department has set 'a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017–18' and indicates that 'we have exceeded our target of assisted returns'. It adds that progress has been made on a 'path towards the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the Home Secretary earlier this year'". The revelation contradicted Rudd's public pronouncements concerning what she was aware of the targets for enforcing the removal of immigrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/27/amber-rudd-was-told-about-migrant-removal-targets-leak-reveals|title=Amber Rudd was told about migrant removal targets, leak reveals|last1=Hopkins|first1=Nick|date=28 April 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=29 April 2018|last2=Stewart|first2=Heather}}</ref> The ''[[New Statesman]]'' said that the leaked memo gave, "in specific detail the targets set by the Home Office for the number of people to be removed from the United Kingdom. It suggests that Rudd misled MPs on at least one occasion.

=== Failure to declare conflict of interest ===
During her time as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, when she was expected to make a final decision on the construction of the [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station]], Rudd was criticised for not declaring a conflict of interest arising from her brother Roland's role as chairman and founder of [[Finsbury (public relations)|Finsbury]]; his lobbying firm represented a company that had a £100 million construction contract for the power plant, and the Register of Members' Financial Interests had recently introduced a new category of "family members engaged in lobbying".<ref name="Newsweek July 2016">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/amber-rudd-profile-who-britains-new-home-secretary-480338|title=Amber Rudd Profile: Who Is Britain's New Home Secretary?|last=Clarke-Billings|first=Lucy|date=14 July 2016|website=newsweek.com|publisher=[[Newsweek Media Group]]|access-date=29 April 2018}}</ref>

=== Orgreave ===
In October 2016, Rudd decided not to open an inquiry into the events at [[Battle of Orgreave|Orgreave]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984 miners' strike]], saying that there was "not a sufficient basis for me to instigate either a statutory inquiry or an independent review".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/battle-of-orgreave-home-secretary-to-announce-decision-on-public/|title=Amber Rudd declares there will be no inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave|last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|date=31 October 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=3 January 2017}}</ref> She failed to appear in Parliament to defend her decision, and was accused of having "cruelly misled" campaigners for justice in what they saw as her "bitter betrayal".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/absent-amber-rudd-accused-of-bitter-betrayal-over-orgreave|title=Absent Amber Rudd accused of 'bitter betrayal' over Orgreave|last1=Travis|first1=Alan|date=1 November 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 October 2019|last2=Halliday|first2=Josh|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== Plan to compel companies to disclose foreign workers ===
At the 2016 party conference, Rudd suggested that companies should be forced to disclose how many foreign workers they employ.<ref name=":2"/> The proposal was revealed as a key plank of a government drive to reduce net migration and encourage businesses to hire British staff. However, senior figures in the business world warned the plan would be a "complete anathema" to responsible employers, would be divisive, and would damage the UK economy because foreign workers were hired to fill gaps in skills that British staff could not provide.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers|title=Amber Rudd faces backlash from businesses over foreign workers|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=5 October 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>

===Unlawful detention and deportation of asylum seekers===
In August 2017, an emergency [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] hearing was held to examine Rudd's four-week delay in releasing an asylum seeker, who had been tortured in a Libyan prison, from a UK detention centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishlegal.com/2017/08/24/high-court-judge-criticises-amber-rudd-over-delay-in-release-of-torture-survivor/|title=High Court judge criticises Amber Rudd over delay in release of torture survivor|date=24 August 2017|work=Scottish Legal News|access-date=1 September 2017}}</ref> Concern was expressed that the Home Secretary failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay in releasing the man from detention.

In September 2017, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Rudd had authorised the deportation of Samim Bigzad to [[Kabul]], in breach of an earlier ruling banning her from doing so owing to the ongoing threat to his life from the [[Taliban]].<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/14/home-secretary-ignores-court-order-sends-asylum-seeker-kabul-samim-bigzad|title=Home secretary ignores court order and sends asylum seeker to Kabul|last=Taylor|first=Diane|date=14 September 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref> A High Court Judge found Rudd to be in [[contempt of court]] on three counts, after she ignored orders to return him to the UK.<ref name="theguardian.com" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lawcareers.net/Information/News/Amber-Rudd-in-contempt-of-court-for-ignoring-judges-order-not-to-deport-asylum|title=Amber Rudd in contempt of court for ignoring judge's order not to deport asylum seeker to Afghanistan|work=LawCareers.net|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/home-secretary-courts-amber-rudd-deport-samim-bigzad|title=If Amber Rudd can't explain why she defied the courts, she should go – Charles Falconer|last=Falconer|first=Charles|date=19 September 2017}}</ref> An unnamed immigration barrister advised ''[[the Independent]]'' newspaper that Rudd could be given a custodial sentence for defying the High Court's instructions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/samim-bigzad-deportation-afghanistan-asylum-seeker-amber-rudd-home-office-violate-court-order-kabul-a7959756.html|title=Samim Bigzad: Afghan asylum seeker at heart of case that 'could jail' Amber Rudd speaks out|last=Dearden|first=Lizzie|date=21 September 2017|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Bigzad was later returned to London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/18/samim-bigzad-asylum-seeker-deported-illegally-to-afghanistan-is-returned-to-uk|title=Asylum seeker thanks judges after return to UK from illegal deportation|access-date=13 January 2018}}</ref>

===Comments about Diane Abbott===
In a radio interview in March 2019, Amber Rudd attacked racist and misogynistic attacks against then [[Shadow Home Secretary]] [[Diane Abbott]] claiming that online abuse "is definitely is worse if you're a woman, it's worst of all if you're a coloured woman" and "I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, that's something we need to call out.".<ref name="coloured audio">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/mar/07/amber-rudd-refers-to-diane-abbott-as-coloured-during-interview-audio|title=Amber Rudd refers to Diane Abbott as 'coloured' during interview – audio|date=7 March 2019|website=The Guardian|access-date=7 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307192943/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/mar/07/amber-rudd-refers-to-diane-abbott-as-coloured-during-interview-audio|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Rudd was the target of criticism for her use of the term "coloured". Responding in a tweet, Abbott said the term was "an outdated, offensive and revealing choice of words". Rudd apologised for the remarks, calling it "clumsy language". However, former England footballer [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], a victim of racism in his career as a footballer, defended Rudd claiming that people were focusing on the wrong issue and that people should be praising Rudd for challenging racist abuse against black politicians.<ref>https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/shelagh-fogarty/john-barnes-amber-rudd-coloured-diane-abbott/</ref><ref name="coloured guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/07/amber-rudd-apologises-to-diane-abbott-for-calling-her-coloured|title=Amber Rudd apologises to Diane Abbott for calling her 'coloured'|date=7 March 2019|website=The Guardian|access-date=7 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307170828/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/07/amber-rudd-apologises-to-diane-abbott-for-calling-her-coloured|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
