The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of [[smallpox]], the near-[[Polio eradication|eradication of polio]], and the development of an [[Ebola vaccine]]. Its current priorities include [[communicable disease]]s, particularly [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Ebola]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]; [[non-communicable disease]]s such as heart disease and cancer; [[healthy eating|healthy diet]], nutrition, and [[food security]]; [[occupational health]]; and [[substance abuse]].

The WHA, composed of representatives from all 194 member states, serves as the agency's supreme decision-making body. It also elects and advises an Executive Board made up of 34 health specialists. The WHA convenes annually and is responsible for selecting the Director-General, setting goals and priorities, and approving the WHO's budget and activities. The current Director-General is [[Tedros Adhanom]], former Health Minister and Foreign Minister of Ethiopia, who began his five-year term on 1 July 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/tedros-director-general/en/ |title=Dr Tedros takes office as WHO Director-General |date=1 July 2017 |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=6 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418200413/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/tedros-director-general/en/ |archive-date=18 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The WHO relies on contributions from member states (both assessed and voluntary) and private donors for funding. As of 2018, it has a budget of over $4.2&nbsp;billion, a large part of which comes from voluntary contributions from member states.<ref name="Jan 24"/> Contributions are assessed by a formula that includes GDP per capita.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The [[International Sanitary Conferences]], originally held on 23 June 1851, were the first predecessors of the WHO. A series of 14 conferences that lasted from 1851 to 1938, the International Sanitary Conferences worked to combat many diseases, chief among them [[cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and the [[bubonic plague]]. The conferences were largely ineffective until the seventh, in 1892; when an International Sanitary Convention that dealt with cholera was passed.

Five years later, a convention for the plague was signed.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/62873/1/14549_eng.pdf |title=The scientific background of the International Sanitary Conferences, 1851–1938 |last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman |publisher=World Health Organization |year=1974 |access-date=3 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820070452/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/62873/1/14549_eng.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the [[Pan-American Sanitary Bureau]] (1902), and the {{lang|fr|[[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]]|italic=no}} (1907) were soon founded. When the [[League of Nations]] was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. After [[World War II]], the United Nations absorbed all the other health organizations, to form the WHO.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Michael |date=October 2002 |title=A brief history of the World Health Organization. |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=360 |issue=9340 |pages=1111–1112 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)11244-x|pmid=12387972 |s2cid=2076539 }}</ref>

===Establishment===
During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, [[Szeming Sze]], a delegate from the Republic of China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, [[Alger Hiss]], the Secretary General of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Sze and other delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health.<ref name="Pitt ULS">[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=Szeming%20Sze;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-ua90f141 Sze Szeming Papers, 1945–2014, UA.90.F14.1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101222750/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=Szeming%20Sze;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-ua90f141 |date=1 January 2017 }}, University Archives, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh.</ref> The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.<ref name="bmj1948">{{cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |jstor=25364565 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4570.302|pmc=1614381 }}</ref> The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946.<ref name=chronicle_1947>{{cite journal|title=The Move towards a New Health Organization: International Health Conference |journal=Chronicle of the World Health Organization |volume=1 |issue=1–2 |pages=6–11 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |year=1947 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809031008/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |df= }}</ref> It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.<ref name="shimkin">{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |jstor=1674843 |doi=10.1126/science.104.2700.281|pmid=17810349 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1016.3166 |bibcode=1946Sci...104..281S }}</ref> Its constitution formally came into force on the first [[World Health Day]] on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.<ref name=chronicle_1947/>

====Communicable diseases====
The 2012–2013 WHO budget identified five areas among which funding was distributed.<ref name="20123budget">{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013 |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617074331/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Two of those five areas related to [[communicable diseases]]: the first, to reduce the "health, social and economic burden" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in particular.<ref name="20123budget"/>

As of 2015, the World Health Organization has worked within the [[UNAIDS]] network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |publisher=WHO |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |year=2011 |page=5 |access-date=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171221/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |publisher=WHO |year=2011 |page=7 |access-date=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171221/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of [[malaria]] cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012, the WHO was to report as to whether [[RTS,S]]/AS01, were a viable [[malaria vaccine]]. For the time being, [[insecticide]]-treated [[mosquito net]]s and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are [[antimalarial drugs]] – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |title=Malaria Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527220008/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |archive-date=27 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between 1990 and 2010, WHO's help has contributed to a 40% decline in the number of deaths from [[tuberculosis]], and since 2005, over 46&nbsp;million people have been treated and an estimated 7&nbsp;million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply.

====Health policy====
WHO addresses government [[health policy]] with two aims: firstly, "to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches" and secondly "to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health".<ref name="20123budget"/>

The organization develops and promotes the use of evidence-based tools, norms and standards to support member states to inform [[health policy]] options. It oversees the implementation of the [[International Health Regulations]], and publishes a series of [[medical classification]]s; of these, three are over-reaching "reference classifications": the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases]] (ICD), the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF) and the [[International Classification of Health Interventions]] (ICHI).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf |title=Family of International Classifications: definition, scope and purpose |publisher=WHO |year=2007 |accessdate=27 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318230124/http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] (adopted in 1981),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241541601/en/ |title=International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302093154/http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241541601/en/ |archive-date=2 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (adopted in 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/fctc/about/en/index.html |title=About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111054/http://www.who.int/fctc/about/en/index.html |archive-date=19 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> the [[Health Human Resources#Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel|Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel]] (adopted in 2010)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf |title=WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |accessdate=27 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617072645/http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] and its [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children|pediatric counterpart]].

In terms of health services, WHO looks to improve "governance, financing, staffing and management" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy. It also strives to "ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies".<ref name="20123budget"/> WHO – working with donor agencies and national governments – can improve their use of and their reporting about their use of research evidence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hoffman S.J., Lavis J.N., Bennett S. | year = 2009 | title = The Use of Research Evidence in Two International Organizations' Recommendations about Health Systems | url = | journal = Healthcare Policy | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi = 10.12927/hcpol.2009.21005 | pmid = 20676252 | pmc = 2732656 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

====Digital Health====
On Digital Health topics, WHO has existing Inter-Agency collaboration with the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (the UN Specialized Agency for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]), including the Be Health, Be Mobile initiate and the ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health.

===Governance and support===
The remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself:<ref name="20123budget"/>
* "to provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda"; and
* "to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible, learning organization, enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively".

====Partnerships====
The WHO along with the [[World Bank]] constitute the core team responsible for administering the [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+).

In 2016, the World Health Organization drafted a global health sector strategy on HIV. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/hiv/strategy2016-2021/ghss-hiv/en/|title=Global health sector strategy on HIV, 2016–2021|website=World Health Organization|access-date=19 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918103307/http://www.who.int/hiv/strategy2016-2021/ghss-hiv/en/|archive-date=18 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> with interim targets for the year 2020. To make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Among the points made, it seems clear that although the prevalence of HIV transmission is declining, there is still a need for resources, health education, and global efforts to end this epidemic.

The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at the regional level, including important discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.<ref name="burci53">{{harvnb|Burci|Vignes|2004|pages=53–57}}.</ref>

Each region has a regional committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not full members. For example, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] attends meetings of the [[Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of World Health Organization|Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office]]. Each region also has a regional office.<ref name="burci53"/> Each regional office is headed by a director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never over-ruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small.<ref name="burci53"/> Since 1999, Regional directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term, and typically take their position on 1 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions|website=|publisher=WHO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011220426/http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=11 February 2012}}</ref>

Each regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the regional director, the regional committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]]. The regional committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The regional director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority – concomitantly with the WHO Director-General – of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Controversies==

=== IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 ===
[[File:Alexei Yablokov, Rosa Goncharova, Vassili Nesterenko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexey Yablokov]] (left) and [[Vassili Nesterenko]] (farthest right) protesting in front of the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland in 2008.]]
[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration on [[Chernobyl disaster]] day near WHO in [[Geneva]]]]
In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).  A selective reading of this document (clause 3) can result in the understanding that the IAEA is able to prevent the WHO from conducting research or work on some areas. The agreement states that the WHO recognizes the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The following paragraph adds:<ref name=":0" />

{{Cquote
| quote = whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, '''the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement'''.
}}

The nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including [[Women in Europe for a Common Future]] to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the [[Acute radiation syndrome|effects on human health of radiation]] caused by the use of [[nuclear power]] and the continuing effects of [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters]] in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]].

{{Cquote
| quote = 2. “2. In particular, and in accordance with the Constitution of the World Health Organization
and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its agreement with the
United Nations together with the exchange of letters related thereto, and taking into
account the respective co-ordinating responsibilities of both organizations, it is recognized
by the World Health Organization that the International Atomic Energy Agency has the
primary responsibility for encouraging, assisting and co- ordinating research and development and practical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses throughout the world
'''without prejudice to the right of the World Health Organization to concern itself with
promoting, developing, assisting and co-ordinating international health work, including
research, in all its aspects'''.”
}}

The key text is highlighted in bold, the agreement in clause 2 states that the WHO is free to perform any health-related work. Thus showing how the views of [[Alexei Yablokov]] and the other anti-nuclear activists who are opposed to the WHO's agreement with the IAEA is based on a very selective reading of the document.

By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information".<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36421914 ''WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011215015/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36421914/ |date=11 October 2017 }} Posted by NBC News</ref> Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Abelina A | year = 2011 | title = Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1) The research-based vaccine industry's perspective | url = http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | journal = Vaccine | volume = 29 | issue   =6| pages = 1135–1138 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.11.042 | display-authors = etal | pmid = 21115061 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009120413/http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | archivedate = 9 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===2013–2016 Ebola outbreak and reform efforts===
Following the [[2014 Ebola outbreak]] in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=SJ|last2=Røttingen|first2=JA|title=Split WHO in two: strengthening political decision-making and securing independent scientific advice|journal=Public Health Journal|date=February 2014|volume=128|issue=2|pages=188–194|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2013.08.021|pmid=24434035|s2cid=43679089}}</ref>

An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of "core capacity" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system.  At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100&nbsp;million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_21-en.pdf|title=Report of the Review Committee on the Role of the International Health Regulations (2005) in the Ebola Outbreak and Response|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519012647/http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_21-en.pdf|archive-date=19 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/21/408289115/who-calls-for-100-million-emergency-fund-doctor-swat-team|title=WHO Calls For $100 Million Emergency Fund, Doctor 'SWAT Team'|first1=Lawrence|last1=Gostin|publisher=NPR|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221100655/https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/21/408289115/who-calls-for-100-million-emergency-fund-doctor-swat-team|archive-date=21 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> of which it had received $26.9&nbsp;million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement).

The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities.  In comparison, billions of dollars have been spent by developed countries on the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic and 2015–16 Zika epidemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/25/479228380/who-aims-to-reform-itself-but-health-experts-arent-yet-impressed|title=WHO Aims To Reform Itself But Health Experts Aren't Yet Impressed|publisher=NPR|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131951/https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/25/479228380/who-aims-to-reform-itself-but-health-experts-arent-yet-impressed|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== IARC controversies ===
{{Further|International Agency for Research on Cancer}}
The WHO sub-department, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), has been criticized for the way it analyses the tendency of certain substances and activities to cause cancer and for having a politically motivated bias when it selects studies for its analysis. [[Ed Yong]], a British science journalist, has criticized the agency and its "confusing" category system for misleading the public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/why-is-the-world-health-organization-so-bad-at-communicating-cancer-risk/412468/|title=Beefing With the World Health Organization's Cancer Warnings|last=Yong|first=Ed|work=The Atlantic|access-date=29 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212124241/https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/why-is-the-world-health-organization-so-bad-at-communicating-cancer-risk/412468/|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Marcel Kuntz]], a French director of research at the&nbsp;[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]], criticized the agency for its classification of potentially carcinogenic substances.

=== Traditional medicine ===
WHO has been moving toward acceptance and integration of [[traditional medicine]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM). In 2022, the new [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], ICD-11, will attempt to enable classifications from traditional medicine to be integrated with classifications from [[evidence-based medicine]]. Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Renckens |first1=Cees N.M. |last2=Dorlo |first2=Thomas P.C. |authorlink1=Cees Renckens |date=September–October 2019 |title=Quackery at WHO: A Chinese Affair |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/2019/09/quackery-at-who-a-chinese-affair/ |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=39–43 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200301162812/https://skepticalinquirer.org/2019/09/cnn-reporters-awarded-balles-critical-thinking-prize-for-a-deal-with-the-devil/ |archive-date=1 March 2020 |access-date=1 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="CNN Chinese medicine gains">{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Katie |title=Chinese medicine gains WHO acceptance but it has many critics |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/health/traditional-chinese-medicine-who-controversy-intl/index.html |accessdate=15 April 2020 |work=CNN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414213628/https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/health/traditional-chinese-medicine-who-controversy-intl/index.html |archive-date=14 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The World Health Organization's decision about traditional Chinese medicine could backfire |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01726-1 |accessdate=15 April 2020 |work=Nature |date=5 June 2019 |pages=5 |language=en |doi=10.1038/d41586-019-01726-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200424141805/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01726-1 |archive-date=24 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> A WHO spokesman said that the inclusion was "not an endorsement of the scientific validity of any Traditional Medicine practice or the efficacy of any Traditional Medicine intervention."<ref name="CNN Chinese medicine gains"/>
