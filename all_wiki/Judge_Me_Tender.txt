The 464th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 23, 2010.

Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] drives [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] crazy when he starts spending too much time at home, and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] tries to comfort [[Santa's Little Helper]].<ref>{{tv.com episode|the-simpsons/judge-me-tender-1334248}}</ref>

The episode was written by [[Allen Glazier]] and [[Dan Greaney]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]]. The episode also features references to ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and its [[The End (Lost)|series finale]], [[Tiger Woods]], and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].

"Judge Me Tender" has received mixed reviews from critics with many criticizing the short and unfunny cameos of the ''American Idol'' judges except for [[Simon Cowell]].

They especially criticized [[Ellen DeGeneres]] since she had experience as a voice artist in an animated film called (''[[Finding Nemo]]''). The episode went down 14% from the [[The Bob Next Door|previous week's episode]] due to the competition of airing against the ''Lost'' clip show, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] participate at an "Ugliest Dog" contest in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]", entering [[Santa's Little Helper]]. At the contest, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] feels neglected because nobody wants to let him sit next to them ([[Agnes Skinner]] even sets the chair next to her on fire). Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, [[Krusty the Clown]], is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a [[clown]]. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much to the delight of the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a place to sit. During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of ''Satan's Little Helper'') as the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of the judges on ''[[American Idol]]'', since several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled.

Moe flies to [[Los Angeles]] and becomes a protégé of [[Simon Cowell]], who then explains all the details of his job, but before his first show, Cowell shows several clips of people (including Mr. Burns) who think the judgments of Moe are very offensive and became angry with him (with even the usually innocent and good-natured [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] talking so boldly about Moe that [[Profanity|most of his words have to be censored]]). Cowell warns him to not "become the mean judge, like I did", since he himself does not have many friends. He tries to be more positive, but when Cowell mocks his judgment of a contestant, he realizes that Cowell tricked him; angered, Moe threatens Cowell's life on air, but is apprehended by security and expelled from the building.

Meanwhile, Homer feels bored after Moe closed [[Moe's Tavern|his bar]] to judge competitions and decides to spend time with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]. After his presence at the house becomes too annoying, Marge decides to help him to find a new bar, but when this fails (due to the obnoxious customers), [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] advises Marge to put Homer in a round of [[golf]], where he will become too distracted to even bother her again. However, before the game begins, Marge meets an elderly man who tells her that he got addicted to golf and barely saw his family again. Marge then realises that she was going too far and stops Homer from playing, and they both end up having [[makeup sex]]. In the end, in the reopening of his tavern, Moe explains that he was put on trial and, as punishment for his sociopathic behavior, he is not only banned from California, but is also forbidden from ever judging anything again ''anywhere'' in the country (he cannot even express his opinion on how much beer a person should drink before driving). But fortunately for Moe, he is also forbidden from watching the [[Fox network]], something that he acknowledges as being a blessing in disguise, as this leads to an increase of the customers in his bar, including [[Rupert Murdoch]], who asks him to put on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]''.

===Critical reception===
Robert Canning of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 6.5, stating that it was "Passable" and criticized the fact that while many other episodes take funny jokes at [[Los Angeles]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s expense, the ones in this episode fell flat. Canning also said all the guest spots were too "wooden and unfunny", although he remarked that he liked the opening acts.<ref>Canning, Robert (May 24, 2010) http://tv.ign.com/articles/109/1092179p1.html''[[IGN]]'' Retrieved May 24, 2010</ref>

Sharon Knolle of [[TV Squad]] loved the main plot and C-plot, but said the subplot was too unoriginal and that the Tiger Woods joke was the only successful one. She also criticized the ending; "Too bad the episode ended on a lame joke at Jay Leno's expense. Not that he doesn't deserve it, but I'll bet the animated Rupert Murdoch was the only one laughing.".<ref name="tvsquad"/>

Emily VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a D. VanDerWerff said that watching "Judge Me Tender" in the same night as [[The End (Lost)|the ''Lost'' finale]] and ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode "[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]", both of which he praised as "deeply ambitious" television, "just drove home for me how tired this show is and how little it tries anymore".<ref>VanDerWerff, Emily(May 24, 2010) http://www.avclub.com/articles/judge-me-tenderyoure-the-best-man-cleveland-browns,41439/ ''[[The A.V.
