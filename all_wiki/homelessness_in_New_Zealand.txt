'''Homelessness in New Zealand''' has been linked to the general issue of lack of suitable housing.<ref name=increase>{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/300038/homelessness-'a-national-problem'|title=Homelessness 'a national problem'|publisher=Radio NZ}}</ref> The [[homeless]] population is generally measured through the country's [[New Zealand census|census]] and by universities and other academic centres. In 2009, urban homelessness (rough sleepers or improvised dwellings) were estimated at less than 300, while rural homelessness (improvised dwellings) was estimated between 500 and 1000. An additional 8,000–20,000 live in "temporary accommodation unsuited for long-term habitation (caravans, campgrounds, substandard housing and boarding houses)."<ref name=parliament>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLEcoRP14021/homelessness-in-new-zealand|title=Homelessness in New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|date=17 Jul 2014|accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref>  Homelessness in New Zealand has traditionally been reduced by the provision of [[state housing]], similar to Germany and other developed countries.

==Definitions and services==
Statistical authorities in New Zealand have expanded their definition of homelessness to include ‘people living in improvised shelters’, ‘people staying in camping grounds/motor camps’ and ‘people sharing accommodation with someone else’s household’.<ref>Busch-Geertsema, Volker. "Defining and measuring homelessness." ''Homelessness Research in Europe: Festschrift for Bill Edgar and Joe Doherty'' (2010): 19–39.</ref> Services representing the sector include the New Zealand Coalition to End Homelessness (NZCEH).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzceh.org.nz/|title=Home|publisher=New Zealand Coalition to End Homelessness}}</ref>

==History==
The issue is believed to have become increasingly visible in recent years.<ref name=increase/> Media in New Zealand have published an accusatory account of the presence of homeless people in public spaces, positioning homeless men as disruptive threats. Though community members have shown support though writing opinion pieces.<ref>Hodgetts, Darrin, Ottilie Stolte, Kerry Chamberlain, Alan Radley, Linda Nikora, Eci Nabalarua, and Shiloh Groot.

In late January 2019, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported rising housing prices to be a major factor in the increasing homelessness in New Zealand so that "smaller markets like [[Tauranga]], a coastal city on the [[North Island]] with a population of 128,000, had seen an influx of people who had left Auckland in search of more affordable housing. Average property values in Tauranga had risen to $497,000 from $304,000 in the last five years, and Demographia now rated it among the 10 least affordable cities in the world — along with famously expensive locales such as Hong Kong, San Francisco, Sydney and Vancouver, British Columbia."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/world/asia/new-zealand-housing-prices.html|title=New Zealand Vowed 100,000 New Homes to Ease Crunch.

In mid August 2019, the Associate Housing Minister [[Kris Faafoi]] and Social Development Minister [[Carmel Sepuloni]] announced that the Government would be launching a NZ$54 million program to tackle homelessness in New Zealand. This includes investing $31 million over the next four years for 67 intensive case managers and navigators to work with homeless people and a further $16 million for the Sustaining Tenancies Programme. This funding complements the Government's Housing First programme.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=Government announces $54 million to help keep people off the streets |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12259520 |accessdate=19 August 2019 |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Government's new $54m homelessness scheme long overdue, housing official admits |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/governments-new-54m-homelessness-scheme-long-overdue-housing-official-admits |accessdate=19 August 2019 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=18 August 2019}}</ref>
