Television has a long history in [[Ukraine]], with regular [[television]] broadcasting started during the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] years in 1951. However the first ever TV broadcast took place on 1 February 1939 in Kyiv. Since then TV broadcasting has expanded, particularly after the [[fall of Communism]] in 1989, and now there are many different channels and groups in the Ukrainian TV market.

== History ==
The first official broadcast took place in [[Kyiv]] on 1 February 1939.<ref name="television">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100820190441/http://1tv.com.ua/uk/about/history History of television in Ukraine]</ref> It was 40 minutes long and showed the portrait of [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].<ref name="television"/> After [[World War II]], on 6 November 1951, a Kyiv tele-centre made a debut with a ''live broadcasting'' of the patriotic movie "The Great Glow".<ref name="television"/> Next day the telecentre went on air again by broadcasting the solemn measures of celebrating the 34th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]].<ref name="television"/>

After the [[Orange Revolution]], Ukrainian television became more free.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news&#93;=30800 UKRAINIAN PARTIES SCRAMBLE FOR MEDIA, FOREIGN ALLIES, AHEAD OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (August 17, 2005)</ref> In February 2009 the National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting claimed that "political pressure on mass media increased in recent times through amending laws and other normative acts to strengthen influence on mass media and regulatory bodies in this sphere".<ref>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/179018.html National TV Council Claims Harder Political Pressure On Mass Media] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120919144704/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/179018.html |date=2012-09-19 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (February 6, 2009)</ref>

As of January 2009, [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]], [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] refused to appear in Inter TV-programmes "until journalists, management and owners of the TV channel stop destroying the freedom of speech and until they remember the essence of their profession - honesty, objectiveness, and unbiased stand".<ref name=owner>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/175978.html Inter TV Channel Denies Businessman Firtash's Being Among Shareholders Of Company] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130208214921/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/175978.html |date=2013-02-08 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (January 23, 2009)</ref>

In early March 2014, [[Crimea]] removed Ukraine-based TV channels ahead of its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation]] [[2014 Crimean referendum|referendum]].<ref name=BBC140313/> Later that month, the Ukrainian National Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting ordered measures against some Russian TV channels which were accused of broadcasting misleading information about Ukraine.<ref name=BBC140312/><ref name=NYT140305/> In February 2015 the law "On protection information television and radio space of Ukraine," banned the showing (on Ukrainian television) of "audiovisual works" that contain "popularization, propaganda, propaganda, any action of law enforcement agencies, armed forces, other military, military or security forces of an invader" was enacted.<ref name="D5216lrgtout"/> One year later Russian productions (on Ukrainian television) had decreased by 3 to 4 (times).<ref name="D5216lrgtout">{{in lang|uk}} [http://m.day.kiev.ua/uk/news/050216-za-rik-pokaz-rosiyskogo-media-produktu-vpav-u-3-4-razy-nacrada During the year, showing Russian media product fell to 3-4 - National Council], [[Den (newspaper)|Den]] (5 February 2016)</ref> 15 more Russian TV channels were banned in March 2016.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/324105.html TV broadcasting council removes 15 more Russian TV channels from adaptation list] [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (12 February 2016)</ref>

According to the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No.509 dated June 13, 2018, analogue broadcasting was disconnected on the territory of the Kirvograd region and Kyiv from July 31, 2018. The date of the switch-off of analogue broadcasting on the rest of Ukraine is August 31, 2018<ref>[http://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/509-2018-%D0%BF/ed20180627/paran2#n2 Decree of CMU]</ref>

== Digital television ==
In 2007 and 2008, experimental DVB-T broadcasts of few channels started in Kyiv and [[Odesa]]. Those turned out to be successful. Yet the [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] National Program is not approved by the government, thus the process is stuck. Because there are two versions of the program submitted: from the Ministry of Transport and Communications as well as from the State Committee of Television and Radio, there is no particular progress in 2008.

On 26 November 2008, the National Program of the Ministry was approved, but the final version and the public announcement of this fact is still on hold. Current version of the program does not take into notice any kind of Government financing, and the budget is to be private only, which will highly affect the TV industry and commercial broadcasters.

Besides there are 3rd parties, such as Television Industry Committee and National Association of Broadcasters which represent the communities of National and regional broadcasters respectively. Both organizations help the switchover not to affect the business of over 20 National and over 150 regional broadcasters.

The International Forum 'Digital Broadcasting in Ukraine' is the annual event that takes place in Kyiv, Ukraine. Its mission is to gather the most of international consultants and Ukrainian specialists to solve industry's problems in the DTT field. In 2008 the 2nd International Forum took place in Kyiv also. [[BBC]], [[Deloitte]] and the Ministry of Communications of Finland representatives share the vision of possible plan of DTT implementation in Ukraine, delivering the best experiences from UK, Finland, France and US. Still none was taken into notice yet. It is now confirmed<ref>http://mediasat.net.ua/content/news_all/5358/</ref><ref>http://mediasat.net.ua/content/news_all/5626/</ref> that Ukraine's national terrestrial TV network, which is scheduled to be launched in September 2011, will use the DVB-T2 standard for all four nationwide [[Free-to-air|FTA]] multiplexes, for both SD and HD broadcasts. Before settling for DVB-T2, Ukraine was testing both DVB-T/MPEG-2 and DVB-T/MPEG-4 options, and some experimental transmitters operating in those standards are still alive.

== Other technologies ==
Commercial [[MMDS]] digital TV services work in Kyiv and some other cities.

DVB-C services delivering premium channels (in addition to standard analogue channels) launched in cable networks of [[Kyiv]], [[Odesa]], [[Kremenchuk]], [[Poltava]], [[Donetsk]] and some other cities.

== Broadcasting ==
As of February 2019, television broadcasting in Ukraine is available in a colour digital format, via:

*[[digital TV]]
*[[satellite TV]]
* cable television ([[Volia]], regional operators)
* online services and IPTV (the most famous ones are Divan TV, Sweet TV, [[MEGOGO]], [[Handy TV]])

There is a choice between several free-to-air commercial broadcasters as well as the public broadcaster, the [[UA:PBC]]. In addition to its metropolitan asset, [[UA:First]] and an art station, [[Kultura (Ukrainian television channel)|UA:Culture]], the [[UA:PBC|PBC]] also owns regional stations in all regions of Ukraine.  A national parliamentary channel, Rada, is available too.

Commercial television is dominated by five major broadcasters: [[1+1 Media Group|1+1 media]], [[StarLightMedia]], Inter Media Group, [[Media Group Ukraine]] and Lux, which is the smallest Ukrainian major broadcaster. One of the main Ukrainian news channels, Channel 5, belongs to the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko.

Regional television in Ukraine consists primarily of independently owned networks not affiliated with major broadcasters in each region.

Subscription television consists of various providers. The largest providers are [[Kyivstar]], [[Viasat]] and [[Volia (ISP)|Volia]]. In remote areas, there are many small independent providers that provide either satellite or cable television services.

Community television launched in mid-2010s to broadcast [[Euromaidan]] protests. As of 2019, the sector is represented by [[Hromadske.TV|Hromadske.tv]] which is an Internet television station.
