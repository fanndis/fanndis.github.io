The '''Free City of Danzig''' ({{lang-de|Freie Stadt Danzig}}; {{lang-pl|Wolne Miasto Gdańsk}}) was a semi-[[autonomous]] [[city-state]] that existed between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the [[Baltic Sea]] port of Danzig (now [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) and nearly 200 towns and villages in the surrounding areas. It was created on 15 November 1920<ref>{{cite book| title = Danzig&nbsp;– Biographie einer Stadt| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ifeo6zdSMcC| date = February 2011| publisher = C.H.

As the Treaty stated, the region was to remain separated from post-World War I [[Germany]] (the [[Weimar Republic]]) and from the newly independent nation of the [[Second Polish Republic]] ("interwar Poland"), but it was not an independent state.<ref>{{cite book| title = Public International Law| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zd5nwF7o3_8C| date = 2010-07-21| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-203-84847-0| page = 199| last1 = Kaczorowska| first1 = Alina }}</ref> The Free City was under [[League of Nations]] protection and put into a binding [[customs union]] with Poland.

The percentage of votes later declined to about 3%.

Poland proceeded to build the city of [[Gdynia]] in 1921. This completely new port north of Gdansk was established on territory awarded in 1919. By 1933, the commerce passing through Gdynia exceeded that of Danzig.<ref name="ReferenceE"/> Notwithstanding this, Poland refused to relinquish trading and other rights awarded to it, further alienating the Danzigers.

By 1936, [[Senate of the Free City of Danzig|the city's senate]] had a majority of local [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] and agitation to rejoin Germany was stepped up.<ref>Levine, Herbert S., ''Hitler's Free City: A History of the Nazi Party in Danzig, 1925–39'' (University of Chicago Press, 1970), p. 102.</ref>

Due to German [[antisemitism]], persecution and oppression, many Jews fled. After the [[German invasion of Poland]] in 1939, the Nazis abolished the Free City and incorporated the area into the newly formed {{lang|de|[[Reichsgau]]}} of [[Danzig-West Prussia]]. The Nazis classified the Poles and Jews living in the city as [[Untermensch|subhumans]], subjecting them to discrimination, forced labor, and extermination. Many were sent to their deaths at [[Nazi concentration camps]], including nearby [[Stutthof]] (now [[Sztutowo]], Poland).<ref name="Blatman">{{cite book|author-link1=Daniel Blatman |last1=Blatman |first1=Daniel |title=The Death Marches, The Final Phase of Nazi Genocide |date=2011 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=978-0674725980 |pages=111–112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mT_A4ubQyXwC&pg=PA111}}</ref>

During the city's conquest by the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] in the early months of 1945, a substantial number of citizens fled or were killed. In 1945, the city officially became part of Poland in accordance with the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. In the period immediately after the war, many surviving Germans [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|were expelled]] to [[West Germany|West]] or [[East Germany]], while members of the pre-war Polish ethnic minority started returning and new Polish settlers began to come. Due to these events, Gdańsk suffered severe [[underpopulation]] and did not recover until the late 1950s.

==Establishment==

===Periods of independence and autonomy===

Danzig had an early history of independence. It was a leading player in the [[Prussian Confederation]] directed against the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Monastic State of Prussia]]. The Confederation stipulated with the Polish king, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], that the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]] would be invested with the role of head of state of western parts of Prussia ([[Royal Prussia]]). In contrast, [[Ducal Prussia]] remained a Polish fief. Danzig and other cities such as [[Elbląg|Elbing]] and [[Toruń|Thorn]] financed most of the warfare and enjoyed a high level of city autonomy. Danzig used the title ''Royal Polish City of Danzig''.

In 1569, when Royal Prussia's [[estates of the realm|estates]] agreed to incorporate the region into the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the city insisted on preserving its special status. It defended itself through the costly [[Siege of Danzig (1577)|Siege of Danzig]] in 1577 in order to preserve special privileges, and subsequently insisted on negotiating by sending emissaries directly to the Polish king.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pelczar|first=Marian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeY7AAAAMAAJ&q=batory+gda%C5%84sk|title=Polski Gdańsk|date=1947|publisher=Biblioteka Miejska|language=pl}}</ref> Danzig's location as a deep-water port where the [[Vistula river]] met the [[Baltic Sea]] had made it into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries as grain from [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] was shipped up the Vistula on barges to be loaded onto ships in Danzig, where it was shipped on to western Europe.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 211">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211</ref> As many of the merchants shipping the grain from Danzig were Dutch, who built Dutch-style houses for themselves, leading to other Danzigers imitating them, the city was thus given a distinctively Dutch appearance.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 211"/> Danzig become known as "the Amsterdam of the East", a wealthy seaport and trading crossroads that linked together the economics of western and eastern Europe, and whose location at where the Vistula flowed into the Baltic led to various powers competing to rule the city.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 211"/>

Although Danzig became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, Prussia was conquered by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1806, and in September 1807 Napoleon declared Danzig a semi-independent [[client state]] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], known as the [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Free City of Danzig]]. It lasted seven years, until it was re-incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1814, after Napoleon's defeat at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] ([[Battle of Nations]]) by a coalition that included Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The city remained part of Prussia until 1920, becoming part of the ''Reich'' in 1871.

Point 14 of U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] called for Polish independence to be restored and for Poland to have "secure access to the sea", a promise that implied that Danzig which occupied a strategic location where the Vistula river flowed into the Baltic sea, should become part of Poland.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 211"/> At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, the Polish delegation led by [[Roman Dmowski]] asked for Wilson to honor point 14 of the 14 Points by transferring Danzig to Poland, arguing that Poland would not be economically viable without Danzig and that since the city had been part of Poland until 1793, it was rightfully part of Poland anyway.<ref name="ReferenceB">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211.</ref> However, Wilson had promised that national self-determination would be the basis of the Treaty of Versailles. As 90% of the people in Danzig in this period were German, the Allied leaders at the Paris Peace Conference compromised by creating the Free City of Danzig, a city-state in which Poland had certain special rights.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 218">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 218.</ref> It was felt that including a city that was 90% German into Poland would be a violation of the principle of [[Self-determination|national self-determination]], but at the same time the promise in the 14 Points of allowing Poland "secure access to the sea" gave Poland a claim on Danzig, hence the compromise of the Free City of Danzig.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 218"/>

The Free City of Danzig was largely the work of British diplomacy as both the French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson supported the Polish claim to Danzig, and it was only objections from the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that prevented Danzig from going to Poland.<ref name="Rothwell, Victor pages 106-107">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 pages 106-107.</ref> Despite creating the Free City, the British did not really believe in the viability of the Free City of Danzig with Lloyd George writing at the time: "France would tomorrow fight for Alsace if her right to it were contested. But would we make war for Danzig?".<ref name="Rothwell, Victor pages 106-107"/> The Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] wrote in the summer of 1918 that the Germans had such a ferocious contempt for Poles that it was unwise for Germany to lose any territory to Poland even if morally justified as the Germans would never accept losing land to the despised Poles and such a situation was bound to cause a war.<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 11">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 11.</ref> During the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, the British consistently sought to minimize German territorial losses to Poland under the grounds that the Germans had such an utter contempt for the Poles together with the rest of the Slavic peoples that such losses were bound to deeply wound their feelings and cause a war.<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 11"/> For all the bitterness of the [[French–German enmity]], the Germans had a certain grudging respect for the French that did not extend to the Poles at all. During the Paris Peace Conference, a commission of inquiry chaired by a British historian, [[James Headlam-Morley]], investigating where the borders between Germany and Poland should be, started to research Danzig's history.<ref name="Overy, Richard page 2">Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 2.</ref> Upon discovering that Danzig had been a Free City in the past, Headlam-Morley came up with what he regarded as a brilliant compromise solution under which Danzig would become a Free City again that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland.<ref name="Overy, Richard page 2"/> As the British were opposed to Danzig becoming part of Poland and the French and the Americans to Danzig remaining part of Germany, Headlam-Morley's compromise of the Free City of Danzig was embraced.<ref name="Overy, Richard page 2"/>

The rural areas around Danzig were overwhelmingly Polish and the representatives of the Polish farmers around Danzig complained about being included in the Free City of Danzig, stating they wanted to join Poland.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>{{quotation needed|date=December 2018}} For their part, the representatives of the German population of Danzig complained about being severed from Germany, and constantly demanded that the Free City of Danzig be reincorporated into the ''Reich''.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 219">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 219.</ref> The Canadian historian [[Margaret MacMillan]] wrote that a sense of Danzig national identity never emerged during the Free City's existence, and the German population of Danzig always regarded themselves as Germans who had been unjustly taken out of Germany.<ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 219"/> The loss of Danzig did indeed deeply hurt German national pride and in the interwar period, German nationalists spoke of the "open wound in the east" that was the Free City of Danzig.<ref name="Overy, Richard page 16">Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 16.</ref> However, until the building of [[Gdynia]], almost all of Poland's exports went through Danzig, and Polish public opinion was opposed to Germany having a "choke-hold" on the Polish economy.<ref>Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 3.</ref>

The Free City of Danzig (1920–39) included the city of Danzig (Gdańsk), the towns of [[Sopot|Zoppot (Sopot)]], [[Oliwa|Oliva (Oliwa)]], [[Nowy Dwór Gdański|Tiegenhof (Nowy Dwór Gdański)]], [[Nowy Staw|Neuteich (Nowy Staw)]] and some 252 villages and 63 [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]], covering a total area of 1,966 square kilometers ({{nowrap|759 sq mi}}). The cities of Danzig (since 1818) and Zoppot (since 1920) formed independent cities (Stadtkreise), whereas all other towns and municipalities were part of one of the three rural districts (Landkreise), [[Danziger Höhe]], {{ill|Danziger Niederung|pl|Powiat Danziger Niederung}} (both seated in Danzig city) and {{ill|Großes Werder|de|Landkreis Großes Werder}}, seated in Tiegenhof.

In 1928, its territory covered 1,952&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> including 58 square kilometers of freshwater surface. The border had a length of 290.5&nbsp;km, of which the coastline accounted for 66.35&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite book

===Polish rights declared by Treaty of Versailles===
The Free City was to be represented abroad by Poland and was to be in a [[customs union]] with it. The German railway line that connected the Free City with newly created Poland was to be administered by Poland, as were all rail lines in the territory of the Free City. On November 9, 1920, a convention that provided for the Presence of a Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig was signed between the Polish government and the Danzig authorities. In article 6, the Polish government undertook not to conclude any international agreements regarding Danzig without previous consultation with the Free City's government.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 6, pp. 190–207.</ref>

A separate [[Polish Post Office (Danzig)|Polish post office]] was established, besides the existing [[Municipality|municipal]] one.

===League of Nations High Commissioners===

Unlike [[League of Nations mandate|Mandatory]] territories, which were entrusted to member countries, the Free City of Danzig (like the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]]) remained directly under the authority of the League of Nations. Representatives of various countries took on the role of High Commissioner:{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The League of Nations refused to let the city-state use the term of ''[[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic City]]'' as part of its official name; this referred to Danzig's long-lasting membership in the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref name="Matull">{{cite web |url=http://library.fes.de/breslau/pdf/a20715/a20715_07.pdf |title=Ostdeutschlands Arbeiterbewegung: Abriß ihrer Geschichte, Leistung und Opfer |first1=Wilhelm |last1=Matull |publisher=Holzner |year=1973 |page=419 |language=de}}</ref>

With the creation of the Free City in the [[aftermath of World War I]] a security police force was created on 19 August 1919. On 9 April 1920, a military style marching band, the ''Musikkorps'', was formed. Led by composer Ernst Stieberitz, the [[police band (music)|police band]] became well known in the city and abroad. In 1921, Danzig's government reformed the entire institution and established the ''[[Schutzpolizei]]'', or protection police.<ref name= DPOL>[http://www.danzig-online.pl/grenze/polizeie.html Police of Freie Stadt Danzig]</ref> Helmut Froböss became President of the Police (i. e. [[Chief of police|Chief]]) on 1 April 1921. He served in this capacity until the German [[annexation]] of the city.<ref name= DPOL />

The police initially operated from 12 precincts and 7 registration points. In 1926 the number of precincts was reduced to 7.<ref name= DPOL />

After the Nazi takeover of the Senate, the police were increasingly used to suppress free speech and political dissent.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/1862924/Działalność_policji_politycznej_w_Wolnym_Mieście_Gdańsku_w_latach_1920-1939_w_Policja._Kwartalnik_kadry_kierowniczej_Policji_4_2011_s._59-71 Policja.

By 1939, Polish-German relations had worsened and war seemed a likely possibility. The police began making plans to seize Polish installations within the city, in the event of conflict.<ref name= DP>[http://www.deutscheundpolen.de/ereignisse/ereignis_jsp/key=polnische_post_1939.html Danzig: Der Kampf um die polnische Post] (in German)</ref> Ultimately the Danzig police participated in the [[Invasion of Poland|September Campaign]], fighting alongside the [[SS Heimwehr Danzig|local SS]] and the German Army [[Defence of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|at the city's Polish post office]] and [[Battle of Westerplatte|at Westerplatte]].<ref name= DP /><ref name= DGW>Williamson, D.

Even though the Free City was [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|formally annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in October 1939, the police force more or less continued to operate as a law enforcement agency. The [[Stutthof concentration camp]], 35&nbsp;km east of the city, was run by the President of the police as an internment camp from 1939 until November 1941.<ref>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

The Free City's population rose from 357,000 (1919) to 408,000 in 1929; according to the official census, 95% were [[Germans]],<ref name="Mason 1946">{{cite book| last = Mason| first = John Brown| title = The Danzig Dilemma, A Study in Peacemaking by Compromise| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ORWrAAAAIAAJ| access-date = 2011-04-26| year = 1946| publisher = Stanford University Press| isbn = 978-0-8047-2444-9| page = <!--5, 11--> }}</ref>{{rp|5, 11}} with the rest mainly either [[Kashubians]] or [[Poles]].

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] required that the newly formed state have its own citizenship, based on residency. German inhabitants lost their [[German nationality law|German citizenship]] with the creation of the Free City, but were given the right to re-obtain it within the first two years of the state's existence. Anyone desiring German citizenship had to leave their property and make their residence outside the Free State of Danzig area in the remaining parts of Germany.<ref name="Versailles"/>

====Regional Synodal Federation of the Free City of Danzig====
[[File:Danzig-Marienkirche.jpg|thumb|The Lutheran Supreme Parish Church of St. Mary's in Danzig's [[Main City|Rechtstadt]] quarter]]
The mostly Lutheran and partially Reformed congregations situated in the territory of the Free City, which previously used to belong to the ''Ecclesiastical Province of West Prussia'' of the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] (EKapU), were transformed into the ''Regional [[Synod]]al Federation of the Free City of Danzig'' after 1920. The executive body of that ecclesiastical province, the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]] (est. 1 November 1886), was seated in Danzig. After 1920 it was restricted in its responsibility to those congregations within the Free City's territory.<ref>Those congregations in Polish-annexed West Prussia ([[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]]) merged into the new United Evangelical Church in Poland, which emerged from the old-Prussian ''Posen ecclesiastical province'', with its consistory seated in [[Poznań]].</ref> General Superintendent {{ill|Paul Kalweit|de}} (1920–1933) and Bishop {{ill|Johannes Beermann|de|Johannes Beermann (Bischof)}} (1933–1945) presided over the consistory, one after another.

Unlike the [[Second Polish Republic]], which opposed the cooperation of the {{ill|United Evangelical Church in Poland|pl|Ewangelicki Kościół Unijny w Polsce}} with EKapU, Volkstag and Senate of Danzig approved cross-border religious bodies. Danzig's Regional Synodal Federation&nbsp;— just as the regional synodal federation of the autonomous [[Klaipėda Region|Memelland]]&nbsp;— retained the status of an [[Ecclesiastical province#Evangelical State Church in Prussia|ecclesiastical province within EKapU]].<ref>In June 1922 the Senate of Danzig and the old-Prussian ecclesiastical executive, the {{ill|Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council|de|Evangelischer Oberkirchenrat (Preußen)}}, EOK), concluded a contract to that end. Cf. Adalbert Erler, ''Die rechtliche Stellung der evangelischen Kirche in Danzig'', Berlin: 1929, simultaneously Univ. of Greifswald, Department of Law and Politics, doctor thesis of 21 February 1929, pp. 36&nbsp;seqq.</ref>

After the German annexation of the Free City in 1939, the EKapU merged the Danzig regional synodal federation in 1940 into the Ecclesiastical Region of Danzig-West Prussia. This included the Polish congregations of the United Evangelical Church in Poland in the homonymous [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia]] and the German congregations in the [[West Prussia (region)|West Prussia governorate]]. Danzig's consistory functioned as an executive body for that region. With the flight and expulsion of most ethnically German Protestant parishioners from the area of the Free City of Danzig between 1945 and 1948, the congregations vanished.

In March 1945, the consistory had relocated to [[Lübeck]] and opened a refugee centre for Danzigers (Hilfsstelle beim evangelischen Konsistorium Danzig) led by Upper Consistorial Councillor {{ill|Gerhard M. Gülzow|de}}. The Lutheran congregation of [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk|St. Mary's Church]] could relocate its valuable [[parament]] collection and the [[presbyterian polity|presbytery]] granted it on loan to [[St. Anne's Museum Quarter, Lübeck#Chamber of paraments|St. Annen Museum]] in Lübeck after the war. Other Lutheran congregations of Danzig could reclaim their church bells, which the [[Wehrmacht]] had requisitioned as non-ferrous metal for war purposes since 1940, but which had survived, not yet melted down, in storage (e.g. {{ill|Glockenfriedhof|de}}) in the British zone of occupation. The presbyteries granted them usually to Northwestern German Lutheran congregations which had lost bells due to the war.

====Diocese of Danzig of the Roman Catholic Church====
{{main|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gdańsk#history|l1=Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gdańsk}}
[[File:Archikatedra Oliwska 01.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Oliwa Cathedral|Archcathedral of the Holy Trinity, Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Bernard]] in Oliva, Danzig]]
The 36 Catholic [[parish]]es in the territory of the Free City in 1922 used to belong in equal shares to the [[Bishopric of Culm (Chełmno)|Diocese of Culm]], which was mostly Polish, and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland]], which was mostly German. While the Second Polish Republic wanted all the parishes within the Free City to form part of Polish Culm, Volkstag and Senate wanted them all to become subject to German Ermland.<ref name="May 175">{{cite book| author = Georg May| title = Ludwig Kaas: der Priester, der Politiker und der Gelehrte aus der Schule von Ulrich Stutz| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 978-90-6032-197-3| page = 175 | year = 1981}}</ref> In 1922 the [[Holy See]] suspended the jurisdictions of both dioceses over their parishes in the Free State and established an [[exemption (church)|exempt]] [[apostolic administration]] for the territory.<ref name="May 175"/>

The first apostolic administrator was [[Edward O'Rourke]] who became [[Bishop of Danzig]] on the occasion of the elevation of the administration to an exempt diocese. He was naturalised as Danziger on the same occasion. In 1938 he resigned after quarrels with the Nazi-dominated Senate of Danzig on appointments of parish priests of Polish ethnicity.<ref name="db-thueringen.de">{{cite book |author2=Reimund Haas |author3=Karl Josef Rivinius |author4=Hermann-Josef Scheidgen| title = Ein aussichtsloses Unternehmen&nbsp;– Die Reaktivierung Bischof Eduard Graf O'Rourkes 1939| url = http://www.db-thueringen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-5265/SamerskiFsAdrianyi.pdf| year = 2000| publisher = Böhlau Verlag Köln Weimar| language = de| isbn = 978-3-412-04100-7| page = 378| last1 = Samerski| first1 = Stefan }}</ref> The senate also instigated the denaturalisation of O'Rourke, who subsequently became a Polish citizen. O'Rourke was succeeded by Bishop [[Carl Maria Splett]], a native from the Free City area.

Splett remained bishop after the German annexation of the Free City. In early 1941, he applied for admitting the Danzig diocese as member in Archbishop [[Adolf Bertram]]'s [[Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province]] and thus at the [[Fulda Conference#Fulda Conference of Bishops (till 1965)|Fulda Conference of Bishops]]; however, Bertram, also speaker of the Fulda conference, rejected the request.<ref name="Pietrzak 2001 p. 162">{{cite book |author1=Hans-Jürgen Karp |author2=Joachim Köhler| title = Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939–1989| year = 2001| publisher = Böhlau Verlag Köln Weimar| isbn = 978-3-412-11800-6| page = 162}}</ref> Any arguments that the Free City of Danzig had been annexed to Nazi Germany did not impress Bertram since Danzig's annexation lacked international recognition. Until the reorganization of the Catholic dioceses in Danzig and the formerly eastern territories of Germany the diocesan territory remained unaltered and the see exempt. However, with the replacement of Danzig's population between 1945 and 1948 by mostly Catholic Poles, the number of Catholic parishes increased and most formerly Protestant churches were taken over for Catholic services.

====Jewish Danzigers====

{{main|Jewish Community of Gdańsk#Free City of Danzig|l1=Jewish Community in the Free City of Danzig}}
Since 1883 most of the Jewish congregations in the later territory of Free State had merged into the Synagogal Community of Danzig. Only the Jews of [[Nowy Dwór Gdański|Tiegenhof]] ran their own congregation until 1938.

Danzig became a centre of Polish and Russian Jewish emigration to North America. Between 1920 and 1925 60,000 Jews emigrated via Danzig to the US and Canada. At the same time, between 1923 and 1929, Danzig's own Jewish population increased from roughly 7,000 to 10,500.<ref>{{cite book |title=Danzig: Geschichte einer Deutschen Stadt |first=Rüdiger |last=Ruhnau |publisher=Holzner Verlag |year=1971 |page=94 |language=de}}</ref> Native Jews and newcomers established themselves in the city and contributed to its civic life, culture and economy. Danzig became a venue for international meetings of Jewish organisations, such as the convention of delegates from Jewish youth organisations of various nations, attended by [[David Ben-Gurion]], which founded the [[World Union of Jewish Youth]] on 2 September 1924 in the Schützenhaus venue. On 21 March 1926 the ''Zionistische Organisation für Danzig'' convened delegates of [[Hechalutz]] from all over for the first conference in Danzig using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as common language, also attended by Ben Gurion.

With a Nazi majority in the Volkstag and Senate, anti-Semitic persecution and discrimination occurred unsanctioned by the authorities. In contrast to Germany, which exercised capital outflow control since 1931, emigration of Danzig's Jews was nonetheless somewhat easier, with capital transfers enabled by the Bank of Danzig. Moreover, the comparatively few Danzig Jews were offered easier refuge in safe countries because of favorable Free City migration quotas.

After the anti-Jewish riots of [[Kristallnacht]] of 9/10 November 1938 in Germany, similar riots took place on 12/13 November in Danzig.<ref name="Sodeikat">{{cite web |url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1966_2_2_sodeikat.pdf |title=Der Nationalsozialismus und die Danziger Opposition |first1=Ernst |last1=Sodeikat |publisher=[[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]] |year=1966 |page=139 ff |language=de}}</ref><ref name="TYM">{{cite book |author2=Vivian B.

The Free City was governed by the [[Senate#Alternative meanings|Senate]] of the Free City of Danzig, which was elected by the parliament ([[Volkstag]]) for a legislative period of four years. The official language was German,<ref name="Lemkin">{{cite book| title = Axis Rule in Occupied Europe| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y0in2wOY-W0C| date = 2008-06-30| publisher = The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.| isbn = 978-1-58477-901-8| page = 155| last1 = Lemkin| first1 = Raphael }}</ref> although the usage of Polish was guaranteed by law.<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://www.verfassungen.de/de/x/danzig/danzig22-index.htm Constitution of Danzig]</ref><ref>Matull, "Ostdeutschlands Arbeiterbewegung", p. 419.</ref> The political parties in the Free City corresponded with the political parties in [[Weimar Germany]]; the most influential parties in the 1920s were the conservative [[German National People's Party]], the [[Social Democratic Party of the Free City of Danzig]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]]. A [[Communist Party (Free City of Danzig)|Communist Party]] was founded in 1921 with its origins in the [[Spartacus League]] and the Communist Party of [[East Prussia]]. Several liberal parties and Free Voter's Associations existed and ran in the elections with varying success. A [[Polish Party]] represented the Polish minority and received between 3% ([[1933 Free City of Danzig parliamentary election|1933]]) and 6% ([[1920 Free City of Danzig Constituent Assembly election|1920]]) of the vote (in total, 4,358 votes in 1933 and 9,321 votes in 1920).<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/Danzig/Uebersicht_LTW.html Die Freie Stadt Danzig, Wahlen 1919–1935]</ref>

Initially, the [[Nazi Party]] had only a small amount of success (0.8% of the vote in [[1927 Free City of Danzig parliamentary election|1927]]) and was even briefly dissolved.<ref name="Matull"/> Its influence grew with the onset of difficult economic times and the increasing popularity of the Nazi Party in Germany proper. [[Albert Forster]] became the [[Gauleiter]] in October 1930. The Nazis won 50 percent of votes in the Volkstag elections of 28 May 1933, and took control of the Senate in June 1933, with [[Hermann Rauschning]] becoming President of the Senate of Danzig.

Rauschning was removed from his position by Forster and replaced by [[Arthur Greiser]] in November 1934.<ref name =Sodeikat/> He later appealed to the public not to vote for the Nazis in the [[1935 Free City of Danzig parliamentary election|1935 elections]].<ref name=Matull/> Political opposition to the Nazis was repressed<ref>{{cite book| title = The new UN peacekeeping| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0Rf9SE2YI-UC| date = 1995-02-15| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-12415-1| page = 94| last1 = Ratner| first1 = Steven R. }}</ref> with several politicians being imprisoned and murdered.<ref>Sodeikat, p.170, p. 173, Fn.92</ref><ref>Matull, "Ostdeutschlands Arbeiterbewegung", p. 440, 450.</ref> The economic policy of Danzig's Nazi-led government, which increased the public expenditures for employment-creation programs<ref>{{cite book |title=Meine Danziger Mission |first=Carl Jakob |last=Burckhardt |page=39 |language=de}}<br/>{{cite book |title=Die Juden der Freien Stadt Danzig unter der Herrschaft des Nationalsozialismus |first=Erwin |last=Lichtenstein |year=1973 |page=44 |language=de}}</ref> and the retrenchment of financial aid from Germany led to a devaluation of more than 40% of the [[Danzig gulden|Danziger Gulden]] in 1935.<ref name="Mason 1946"/><ref>{{cite book| title = Danzig&nbsp;– Biographie einer Stadt| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ifeo6zdSMcC| date = February 2011| publisher = C.H.

===Foreign relations===
Foreign relations were handled by the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1927, the Free City of Danzig sent a military advisory mission to [[Bolivia]]. The Bolivian government of [[Hernando Siles Reyes]] wanted to continue the pre-[[World War One]] German military mission but the Treaty of Versailles prohibited that. The German officers, including [[Ernst Röhm]], were transferred to the Danzig police force and then sent to Bolivia. In 1929, after problems with the mission, the British embassy handled the return of the German officers.<ref>{{cite journal |page=695 |author=Eleanor Hancock |title=Ernst Röhm versus General Hans Kundt in Bolivia, 1929—30?

The rights of the [[Second Polish Republic]] within the territory of the Free City were stipulated in the [[Treaty of Paris (1920)|Treaty of Paris]] of 9 November 1920 and the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] of 24 October 1921.<ref>{{cite book| title = Autonomy, Sovereignty and Self-Determination| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=28PEGfCDiZEC| date = 2011-10-12| publisher = University of Pennsylvania| isbn = 978-0-8122-1572-4| page = 375| last1 = Hannum| first1 = Hurst }}</ref> The details of the Polish privileges soon became a permanent matter of disputes between the local populace and the Polish State.

During the interwar period the Polish minority was heavily discriminated against by the German population, which openly attacked its members using racist slurs and harassment, and attacks against the Polish consulate by German students were praised by authorities.<ref>[http://www.rp.pl/artykul/55392-Mit-Gdanska--mit-Grassa.html?p=2 Mit Gdańska, mit Grassa Zdzisław Krasnodębski, Rzeczpospolita]</ref> In June 1932, a [[Danzig crisis (1932)|crisis]] broke out when the Polish destroyer [[ORP Wicher (1928)|ORP ''Wicher'']] was sent into Danzig harbour without the permission of the Senate to greet a visiting squadron of British destroyers.<ref>Wandycz, Piotr Stefan ''The Twilight of French Eastern Alliances'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988 page 237</ref> The crisis was resolved when the Free City granted more access rights to the Polish Navy in exchange for a promise to not the ''Wicher'' back into Danzig harbour.<ref>Wandycz, Piotr Stefan ''The Twilight of French Eastern Alliances'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988 page 237</ref>

After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, the Polish military doubled the number of 88 troops at Westerplatte in order to test the reaction of the new chancellor.

Until June 1933, the High Commissioner decided in 66 cases of dispute between Danzig and Poland; in 54 cases one of the parties appealed to the Permanent Court of International Justice.<ref>Hurst Hannum, p. 377.</ref> Subsequent disputes were resolved in direct negotiations between the Senate and Poland after both had agreed to abstain from further appeals to the International Court in the summer of 1933 and bilateral agreements were concluded.<ref>{{cite book| title = Wörterbuch des Völkerrechts; Aachener Kongress&nbsp;– Hussar Fall| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EBSE1BF_w2AC| date = 1960-05-01| publisher = de Gruyter Verlag| language = de| isbn = 978-3-11-001030-5| pages = 307, 309| last1 = Schlochauer| last3 = Mosler| last2 = Krüger| first1 = Hans J.| first2 = Herbert| first3 = Hermann }}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] of 1934, Danzig–Polish relations improved and [[Adolf Hitler]] instructed the local Nazi government to cease anti-Polish actions.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Baltic and the Outbreak of the Second World War| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4pKEQgAACAAJ| year = 1992| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-40467-9| page = 74 ff, 80| last1 = Hiden| last3 = Prazmowska| last2 = Lane| first1 = John| first2 = Thomas| first3 = Anita J.| author-link3 = Anita J. Prazmowska }}</ref>  In return, Poland did not support the actions of the anti-Nazi opposition in Danzig. The Polish Ambassador to Germany, [[Józef Lipski]], stated in a meeting with [[Hermann Göring]]<ref>Prazmowska, p. 80.</ref>
<blockquote>''"... that a National Socialist Senate in Danzig is also most desirable from our point of view, since it brought about a rapprochement between the Free City and Poland, I would like to remind him that we have always kept aloof from internal Danzig problems. In spite of approaches repeatedly made by the opposition parties, we rejected any attempt to draw us into action against the Senate. I mentioned quite confidentially that the Polish minority in Danzig was advised not to join forces with the opposition at the time of elections."''</blockquote>
When [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt|Carl J. Burckhardt]] became High Commissioner in February 1937, both Poles and Germans openly welcomed his withdrawal, and Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Józef Beck]] notified him not to "count on the support of the Polish State" in the case of difficulties with the Senate or the Nazi Party.<ref>Prazmowska, p. 81.</ref>

While the Senate appeared to respect the agreements with Poland, the "Nazification of Danzig proceeded relentlessly"<ref>Prazmowska, p. 85.</ref> and Danzig became a springboard for anti-Polish propaganda among the German and Ukrainian minority in Poland.<ref>Prazmowska, p. 83.</ref> The Catholic Bishop of Danzig, [[Edward O'Rourke]], was forced to withdraw after he had tried to implement four additional Polish nationals as parish priests in October 1937.<ref name="db-thueringen.de"/>

The German policy openly changed immediately after the [[Munich Conference]] in October 1938, when German Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] demanded the incorporation of the Free City into the Reich.<ref>{{cite book| title = Barbarism and Civilization| url = https://archive.org/details/barbarismciviliz00wass| url-access = registration| year = 2007| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-873074-3| page = [https://archive.org/details/barbarismciviliz00wass/page/279 279]| last1 = Wasserstein| first1 = Bernard }}</ref> The Polish ambassador to Germany, [[Józef Lipski|Jozef Lipski]], declined Ribbentrop's offer, saying that Polish public opinion would not tolerate the Free City joining Germany and predicated that if Warsaw allowed that to happen, then the ''Sanation'' military dictatorship that had ruled Poland since 1926 would be overthrown.<ref name="Overy, Richard page 16" />  On 24 March 1939, the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel [[Jozef Beck]], who was part of the triumvirate which ruled the ''Sanation'' regime and largely ran foreign policy on his own, told a meeting of the Polish cabinet that Poland should go to war if Germany made any attempt to alter the status of Danzig.<ref name="Overy, Richard page 16" /> Beck stated that Danzig "regardless of what it is worth as an object" had become a "symbol" in Poland that was so important that Poland should go to war over the issue.<ref name="Overy, Richard page 16" /> Aside from the possibility  that a revolution in Poland might overthrow the ''Sanation'' regime should it allow Danzig to be returned to Germany, Beck as part of his plans for a "Third Europe" (i.e. a block of Eastern European states under Polish leadership) had sought to develop economic relations with Sweden and Finland.<ref name="Prazmowska pages 394-408">Prazmowska, Anita "Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War" pages 394-408 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 402.</ref> Beck envisioned both Sweden and Finland joining the "Third Europe" block, and German plans to take back Danzig threatened to allow Germany a "choke-hold" on Poland's main link to the sea as the port facilities at Danzig were still better developed than those at Gdynia.<ref name="Prazmowska pages 394-408" /> [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]] on 29 March 1939 told the Danzig government the ''Reich'' would carry out a policy to the ''Zermürbungspolitik'' (point of destruction) towards Poland, saying a compromise solution was not wanted, and on 5 April 1939 told [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]] under no conditions was he to negotiate with the Poles.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937–39'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 560.</ref>

On 31 March 1939, the British Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], announced in the House of Commons a "guarantee" of Polish independence, stating that Britain would go to war with Germany if there was an attempt to end Polish independence, through Chamberlain pointedly excluded the borders of Poland from the "guarantee".<ref name="Overy, Richard page 16"/> In April 1939, High Commissioner Burckhardt was told by the Polish Commissioner-General that any attempt to alter its status would be answered with armed resistance on the part of Poland.<ref>Woodward, E.L., Butler, Rohan, Orde, Anne, editors, ''Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919–1939'', 3rd series, vol.v, [[HMSO]], London, 1952:25</ref> Beck had not abandoned hopes of negotiating a settlement with Germany.<ref name="Prazmowska pages 155-164">Prazmowska, Anita "Poland" pages 155-164 from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Robert Boyce and Joseph Maiolo, London: Macmillan, 2003 page 161.</ref> During the spring and summer of 1939 it was the aim of [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|British foreign policy]] to built a "peace front" embracing Britain, France, the Soviet Union and a number of other European states such as Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey with the aim of "containing" Germany.

Beck made it clear that he wanted no Polish-Soviet treaty to go along with the British-inspired "peace front" since an alliance with the Soviets would rule out any possibility of a settlement with Germany, which he still had hopes of reaching.<ref name="Prazmowska pages 155-164"/> Beck declined to have Polish diplomats take part in the talks between British, French and Soviet diplomats about having the Soviet Union join the "peace front", and during a visit to London in April 1939 he declined British offers to create a military alliance of Britain, Poland and Romania designed to block the ''Reich'''s offers to expand its influence in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Prazmowska pages 155-164"/> The Polish historian Anita Prazmowska wrote that Beck's refusal of the British offers of assistance was partly due to his "inflated sense of self-importance and the general overestimation of Poland's military potential" as he believed that Poland was one of the world's great powers that could defeat Germany on its own, but also due to his desire not have Poland join the anti-German "peace front" at a time when he still believed that he could settle the Danzig issue.<ref name="Prazmowska pages 155-164"/> During his visit to London on 4–6 April 1939 Beck told Chamberlain that any effort to include the Soviet Union in the "peace front" would cause the very war it was supposed to prevent, and wanted to exclude the Soviet Union from the "peace front" for that reason.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937–39'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 556.</ref> Before the Danzig crisis, the Polish General Staff had devoted far more time to planning a possible war with the Soviet Union rather than with Germany, and even after the Danzig crisis began, planning for a possible war with Germany went about in a rather haphazard and causal manner suggesting the Polish high command did not see war with Germany as very likely in 1939.<ref>Prazmowska, Anita ''Britain, Poland and the Eastern Front, 1939'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004 pages 90-92.</ref> On 5 May 1939, Beck in a speech broadcast on Polish radio stated that Poland wanted peace but that "peace...has its price, high but definable. We in Poland do not recognize the conception of peace at any price. There is only one thing..which is without price, and that is honor".<ref>Wandycz, Piotr "Poland and the Origins of the Second World War" pages 374-393 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 388.</ref>

All through the spring and summer of 1939 there was a massive media campaign in Germany demanding the immediate return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany under the slogan "Home to the ''Reich''!". However, the Danzig crisis was a just a pretext for war. Ribbentrop ordered Count [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]], the German ambassador to Poland, not to negotiate with the Poles over Danzig as it was always Ribbentrop's great fear that the Poles might actually agree to the Free City returning to Germany, thereby depriving the ''Reich'' out of its pretext for attacking Poland.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937–39'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 560–562 & 583–584</ref>  However, the German propaganda that all the ''Reich'' wanted was to bring Danzig home did some effect abroad. In April 1943, when mass grave of the Polish officers massacred by the [[NKVD]] in [[Katyn massacre|Katyn Wood]] was discovered, the Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] wrote in his diary that it was the Poles who caused the outbreak of the war in 1939 by refusing to give in to Hitler's demand that Danzig be allowed to rejoin Germany, and as such it was the Poles' own fault for the Katyn Wood massacre and everything else they had suffered since 1939.<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 108">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 108.</ref> The British historian Victor Rothwell described King's view that the Poles had caused their own suffering as one motivated by spite and his resentment at being pressured by public opinion into declaring war on Germany despite his own inclinations towards neutrality.<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 108"/> From distant [[New Zealand]], the Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]] offered to return [[Western Samoa Trust Territory|Western Samoa]], which had once been the colony of [[German Samoa]] together with the rest of the former German islands in the Pacific held by New Zealand, in exchange for Germany promising not to use violence to alter the status of Danzig.<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 108"/>

However, in 1938, the ''Reich'' government had first demanded autonomy for the [[Sudetenland]] region and after Prague had conceded the demand for autonomy, had laid claim to the Sudetenland. On 15 March 1939, Germany had occupied the [[Czechs|Czech]] part of [[Czechoslovakia|Czecho-Slovakia]], which had done immense damage to Hitler's claim that he was only trying to undo an "unjust" Treaty of Versailles by bringing all of the ethnic Germans "home to the ''Reich''". The British Foreign Secretary [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] late in August 1939 told [[Herbert von Dirksen]], the German ambassador in London:<blockquote>“Last year the German government put forward the demand for the Sudetenland on purely racial grounds; but subsequent events proved that this demand was only put forward as a cover for the annihilation of Czechoslovakia. In view of this experience… it is not surprising that the Poles and we ourselves are afraid that the demand for Danzig is only a first move towards the destruction of Poland’s independence”.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II'' University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1980 page 348.</ref></blockquote>

Tensions escalated into the [[Danzig crisis]] during the summer of 1939. F.M Shepard, the British consul in Danzig, reported that the Danzig Nazis were bringing arms from Germany and building fortifications.<ref>Prazmowska, Anita "Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War" pages 394-408 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 404.</ref>  In July 1939, the British government reluctantly extended its "guarantee" of Poland to the status of Free City of Danzig, stating a German attempt to take Danzig would be a ''casus belli''.<ref>Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 18.</ref> At the beginning of August, the Senate told Warsaw that henceforward the Free City would not longer recognize the authority of Polish customs officers in Danzig, which led Beck in response to warn that the Senate did not have the right to disregard the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and that the German government also did not have the right to speak for Danzig.<ref name="ReferenceC">Prazmowska, Anita "Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War" pages 394-408 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 406.</ref> Much to the chagrin of the [[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office|British Foreign Office]], Warsaw did not to consult Britain first when it issued a warning that the [[Polish Air Force]] would bomb Danzig if the authority of Polish customs officers continued to be ignored.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The Senate backed down while the British who were informed after the fact of the Polish decision to confront the Free City were thrown into panic over the possibility of an armed clash in Danzig plunging Europe into war.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The British ambassador to Poland, Sir [[Howard William Kennard]], sought in vain for a promise from Colonel Beck that Poland would take no action in Danzig without first obtaining British approval.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Beck disliked Kennard and kept him in the dark about what Poland would do if Danzig voted to rejoin Germany, but also about the state of German-Polish relations, much to the vexation of the Foreign Office.<ref>Prazmowska, Anita "Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War" pages 394-408 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 405.</ref>
[[File:Adolf Hitler addresses an audience in Danzig 03.jpg|thumb|left|Hitler gives a speech in Danzig on 19 September 1939]]
In the middle of August, Beck offered a concession, saying that Poland was willing to give up its control of Danzig's customs, a proposal which caused fury in [[Berlin]].<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 161">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 161.</ref> However, the leaders of the Free City sent a message to Berlin on 19 August 1939 saying: "''Gauleiter'' Forster intends to extend claims...Should the Poles yield again it is intended to increase the claims further in order to make accord impossible".<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 161"/> The same day a telegram from Berlin expressed approval with the proviso: "Discussions will have to be conducted and pressure exerted against Poland in such a way that responsibility for failure to come to an agreement and the consequences rest with Poland".<ref name="Rothwell, Victor page 161"/> On 23 August 1939, Albert Forster, the ''Gauleiter'' of Danzig, called a meeting of the Senate that voted to have the Free City rejoin Germany, raising tensions to the breaking point.<ref>Prazmowska, Anita "Poland" pages 155-164 from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Robert Boyce and Joseph Maiolo, London: Macmillan, 2003 page 163.</ref> The same meeting appointed Forster the Danzig State President, through this was due to Forster's long-running rivalry with [[Arthur Greiser]], a ''völkisch'' fanatic who regarded Forster as too soft on the Poles. Both the appointment of Forster as State President and the resolution calling for the Free City to rejoin the ''Reich'' were violations of the charter the League of Nations had given Danzig in 1920, and the matter should have been taken to the League of Nations's Security Council for discussion.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Since these violations of the Danzig charter would have resulted in the League deposing the Danzig's Nazi government, both the French and British prevented the matter from being referred to the Security Council.<ref>Prazmowska, Anita "Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War" pages 394-408 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 pages 406-407.</ref> Instead the British and French applied strong pressure on the Poles not to send in a military force to depose the Danzig government, and appoint a mediator to resolve the crisis.<ref name="ReferenceD">Prazmowska, Anita "Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War" pages 394-408 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 407.</ref> By late August 1939, the crisis continued to escalate with the Senate confiscating on 27 August 1939 stocks of wheat, salt and patrol that belonged to the Polish businesses that were in the process of being exported or imported via the Free City, an action that led to sharp Polish complaints.<ref>Watt, D.C. ''How War Came'', London: Heinemann, 1989 page 512.</ref> The same day, 200 Polish workers at the Danzig shipyards were fired without severance pay and their identification papers revoked, meaning that they legally could not live in Danzig anymore.<ref name="Watt, D.C. page 513">Watt, D.C.

''How War Came'', London: Heinemann, 1989 page 484.</ref> Upon anchoring in Danzig harbor, the ''Schleswig-Holstein'' ominously aimed its guns at the Polish Military Depot on the Westerplatte peninsula in a provocative gesture that further raised the tensions in the Free City.<ref name="ReferenceD"/>

At about 4:48am on 1 September 1939, the ''Schleswig-Holstein'' opened fire on the Westerplatte, firing the first shots of World War II.<ref>Watt, D.C. ''How War Came'', London: Heinemann, 1989 page 530.</ref>

World War II began with the [[Battle of Westerplatte|shelling of the Westerplatte]] on 1 September 1939.

By the end of the Second World War, nearly all the city had been reduced to ruins. On 30 March 1945, the city was taken by the [[Red Army]].

At the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] agreed that the city would become part of Poland.<ref>The History of Poland Since 1863 By Robert F.

The expulsion of the pre-war inhabitants started already before the decisions of the [[Potsdam conference]] of August 1945. From June to October an estimated number of 60,000 residents were expelled by Polish authorities, often units of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Polish State Security]] and the [[Milicja Obywatelska]] encircled certain areas and forced the inhabitants to make room for newly arrived Polish settlers. About 20,000 Germans left on their own and by late 1945 between 10,000 and 15,000 pre-war inhabitants remained.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gdansk.pl/wiadomosci/maj-1945-i-pozniej-tak-narodzil-sie-polski-gdansk-rozmowa,a,113891 |title=Wiosna 1945 - czas, gdy rodził się polski Gdańsk |first=Sylwia |last=Bykowska |date=13 May 2018 |publisher= City of Gdańsk|language=pl}}</ref>

=== Origin of the post-war population ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
During the Polish post-war census of December 1950, data about the pre-war places of residence of the inhabitants as of August 1939 was collected. In case of children born between September 1939 and December 1950, their origin was reported based on the pre-war places of residence of their mothers. Thanks to this data it is possible to reconstruct the pre-war geographical origin of the post-war population. The same territory which corresponded to pre-war Free City of Danzig was inhabited in December 1950 by:

At least 85% of the population as of December 1950 were post-war newcomers, but over 10% of inhabitants were still pre-war Danzigers (most of them members of pre-war Polish and Kashubian minorities in the Free City of Danzig). Another 25% came from neighbouring areas of [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919–1939)|pre-war Polish Pomerania]]. Almost 20% were Poles from areas of [[Kresy|former Eastern Poland]] annexed by the USSR (many from [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926–1939)|Wilno Voivodeship]]). Several percent came from the city of Warsaw, which had been [[Warsaw Uprising|largely destroyed in 1944]].
