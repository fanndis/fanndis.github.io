The '''Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Кабінет Міністрів України}}, ''Kabinet ministriv Ukrayiny''; shortened to '''CabMin'''), commonly referred to as the '''Government of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Уряд України}}, ''Uryad Ukrayiny''), is the highest body of state [[executive power]] in Ukraine.<ref name="s-116">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#Article_116 |title=Article 116 |accessdate=2007-12-23 |work=[[Wikisource]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325112013/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#Article_116 |archive-date=25 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As Cabinet of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR, it was formed on 18 April 1991, by the Law of Ukrainian SSR No.980-XII. [[Vitold Fokin]] was approved the first [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].

The Cabinet is a collegiate body consisting of the Cabinet's presidium composed of five individual and several [[Ukrainian ministries|ministries]] that are represented by their respective minister. Some ministries may be headed by members of the Cabinet presidium (Vice Prime Ministers). The presidium of Cabinet is composed of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] presiding over the Cabinet and assisted by his First Vice Prime and other Vice Prime ministers. The [[Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers (Ukraine)|Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers]] ensures the operations of the cabinet.

The current Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is the [[Shmyhal Government]] that was formed on 4 March 2020, led by [[Denys Shmyhal]].<ref name="btkpBermetHasty">{{cite news |last1=Talant |first1=Bermet |title=Hasty government reshuffle sows disquiet at home, abroad |publisher=Kyiv Post |date=6 March 2020 |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/hasty-government-reshuffle-sows-disquiet-at-home-abroad.html}}</ref>

==Scope==
The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as "central offices (organs) of executive authority": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).

The Cabinet is responsible to the [[President of Ukraine]] and is under the control and being held accountable to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament). It consists of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]], the First Vice-Prime Minister, three<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/86199/|title=Yanukovych dismisses Sivkovych and Slauta as vice-premiers}}</ref> Vice-Prime Ministers, and other [[Minister (government)|Ministers]], who head their assigned Ministries (departments). At one point of time there also was an institute of "state ministries" that was majorly abolished on 25 February 1992 by the Presidential Decree (#98). The [[Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers (Ukraine)|Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers]] (or Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers) supports the effective operation of the government.<ref name=MAG2KP241212>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yanukovych-is-appointing-new-cabinet-of-ministers-318086.html Yanukovych appoints new Cabinet of Ministers], [[Kyiv Post]] (24 December 2007)</ref> Structural part of the secretariat is also the office of the Prime Minister of Ukraine.

===Public relations===
Parts of Cabinet meetings are broadcast live on [[Ukrainian TV]].<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/67177/ First National Channel to broadcast governmental meetings], [[Kyiv Post]] (19 May 2010)</ref>

Since August 2016, Ukrainians can sign and submit [[electronic petition]]s to the Cabinet of ministers of Ukraine "to (assist with) the formation of the priorities of state policy and management decision-making".<ref name=opU29816>[http://www.unian.info/politics/1491296-ukrainians-can-submit-e-petitions-to-sabinet-from-aug-29.html Ukrainians can submit e-petitions to Cabinet from Aug 29], [[UNIAN]] (29 August 2016)</ref> To be considered, the petition must get at least 25,000 votes three months from the date of publication.<ref name=opU29816/> Ukraine authorities are on hold to tell for the next election

===Reforms and "optimizations"===
According to Oleksandr Zapadynchuk, the process of establishing of administrative system in already independent Ukraine started in spring of 1991 when there was created the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (in place of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR) and were appointed new members of government as well as formed new government office.<ref name=Zapadynchuk>Zapadinchuk, O.P. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20200924142511/http://academy.gov.ua/ej/ej13/txts/Zapadynchuk.pdf Optimization of the central executive authorities in the context of administrative reform]''.

==Duties and authority==
[[File:Kiev Cabinet of Ministers.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Government Building, Kiev|Government Building]], 12/2, [[Hrushevsky Street (Kiev)|Hrushevsky Street]], [[Kyiv]], [[Ukraine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/photogallery/gallerylist?gGroupId=12958356|title=Official CMU website. Building address.|date=March 2017}}</ref>]]The duties of the cabinet of ministers are described in the [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 116|Article 116]] of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]]. Members of the government (cabinet) are citizens of Ukraine, who have the right of vote, higher education, and possess the state language ([[Ukrainian language]]). The members of the government cannot have judgement against them that has not been extinguished and taken away in the established legal order. Members of the Cabinet and chief officers of central and local bodies of executive power may not combine their official activity with other work, except teaching, scholarly and creative activity outside working hours, and/or to be members of an administrative body or board of supervisors of an enterprise that is aimed at making profit. In case if a [[People's Deputy of Ukraine]] was appointed to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine he or she resigns as a member of parliament and his/hers letter of resignation is reviewed immediately at the next session of the [[Ukrainian parliament]].

At the sessions of the Cabinet may participate the [[President of Ukraine]] or his [[Representatives of the President of Ukraine|representative]]. During the plenary sessions of the Ukrainian parliament [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|People's Deputies of Ukraine]] have the ''Time of questions to the Government'' during which the whole Cabinet participates and answers to all queries of members of parliament.

;Authority
The Cabinet issues resolutions and orders that are mandatory for execution. Normative legal acts of the Cabinet, ministries, and other central bodies of executive power are subject to registration. Failure to register invalidates the act. (see [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 117|Article 117]]) The Cabinet also possesses the power of [[legislative initiative]] and may introduce its own [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s to the parliament (Verkhovna Rada). The members of Cabinet and deputy ministers may be present at the sessions of the parliament and participate in discussions. Every year no later than 15 September the Cabinet submits a bill on the State Budget of Ukraine to the Verkhovna Rada.

The sessions of the Cabinet are considered plenipotentiary if more than a half of the Cabinet's members participate in them. In case if a minister cannot participate at the sessions he or she may be replaced by a deputy with a consultative capacity. On propositions of other members of the Cabinet a consultative capacity may be awarded to other participants who allowed at the sessions of the Cabinet. Over the sessions presides the Prime Minister of Ukraine, while in his(hers) absent – the First Vice Prime Minister.

The decisions of the Cabinet are adopted by the majority of the Cabinet's composition. In case of votes equality the vote of the Prime Minister is considered to be decisive.

===2004 Constitutional amendments===
The '''2004 Constitutional amendments''' are also erroneously known as the 2004 Constitution of Ukraine. The following amendments were procedurally adopted however as amendments rather than as constitution which requires approval of 2/3 parliament.

Under the terms of [[s:Constitution of Ukraine, 2004#Article 83|Article 83 of Ukraine's Constitution]] a governing coalition needs to be formed by [[Political faction|factions]] (rather than by individuals) that represent a majority of the parliament ([[Verkhovna Rada]]), a "coalition of parliamentary factions" (Ukrainian: Коаліція парламентських партій).<ref>[http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/5913.html Excerpt from April 12 press conference, Responsibility.
