Because of the strength of his portfolio, [[Bobby Hillson]], the Head of the Masters course at St Martins, encouraged McQueen to enroll as a student.<ref>{{cite news |last=Frankel |first=Susannah |title=Louise Wilson: 'As much as I might decry the students, as much as they're a nightmare, it is a privilege to be among youth' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/louise-wilson-as-much-as-i-might-decry-the-students-as-much-as-theyre-a-nightmare-it-is-a-privilege-to-be-among-youth-2359127.html |accessdate=22 January 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=vogue>{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Michelle |title=Who's Who: Bobby Hillson |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/bobby-hillson |publisher=Vogue.co.uk |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> He received his master's degree in fashion design and his 1992 graduation collection was bought in its entirety by influential fashion stylist [[Isabella Blow]], who was said to have persuaded McQueen to become known as Alexander (his middle name) when he subsequently launched his fashion career.<ref name="BBCobit"/> Isabella Blow paved the way for Alexander McQueen using her unique style and contacts to help him.

It was during this period that McQueen relocated to [[Hoxton]], which housed other new designers, including [[Hussein Chalayan]] and [[Pauric Sweeney]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Blow |first=Detmar |title=Blow by Blow |year=2010 |publisher=It Books |location=NY |isbn=978-0-06-202100-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blowbyblowstoryo0000blow/page/58 58–60] |url=https://archive.org/details/blowbyblowstoryo0000blow/page/58 }}</ref> It was shortly after creating his second collection,"McQueen's Theatre of Cruelty", that McQueen met Katy England, his soon to be "right hand woman",<ref name="independent1">{{cite news |first=Melanie |last=Rickey |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/englands-glory-1280955.html |title=England's glory |work=The Independent |date=28 February 1997 |accessdate=24 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> when outside of a "high profile fashion show" trying to "blag her way in".<ref name="steampunkmagazine1">{{cite web |last=Bronte |first=Fabiana |url=http://www.steampunkmagazine.com/losing-lee-a-fashion-legend-bows-out/ |title=Losing 'Lee' – A Fashion Legend Bows Out |publisher=SteamPunk Magazine |accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref> He promptly asked her to join him for his third collection, "The Birds" at Kings Cross, as "creative director".<ref name="steampunkmagazine1"/> Katy England continued to work with McQueen thereafter, greatly influencing his work – his "second opinion".<ref name="independent1"/>

McQueen designed the wardrobe for [[David Bowie]]'s tours in 1996–1997, as well as the [[Union Jack]] coat worn by Bowie on the cover of his 1997 album ''[[Earthling (album)|Earthling]]''.

McQueen also collaborated with dancer Sylvie Guillem, director Robert Lepage and choreographer Russell Maliphant, designing wardrobe for theater show  "Eonnagata", directed by [[Robert Lepage]]. The film ''Sylvie Guillem, on the edge'' produced by French production company A DROITE DE LA LUNE, traces whole history of the creation of the show, from first rehearsals which took place in [[Quebec]] until world premiere which was held in 2008 at [[Sadler's Wells]] theatre in London.

McQueen's "bumsters" spawned a trend in low-rise jeans; on their debut they attracted many comments and debate.<ref name="BBCSixWays"/> Michael Oliveira-Salac, the director of Blow PR and a friend of McQueen's said, "The bumster for me is what defined McQueen."<ref name="BBCSixWays"/> McQueen also became known for using skulls in his designs. A scarf bearing the motif became a celebrity must-have and was copied around the world.<ref name="BBCSixWays"/>

McQueen has been credited with bringing drama and extravagance to the catwalk.<ref name="BBCSixWays"/> He used new technology and innovation to add a different twist to his shows and often shocked and surprised audiences. The silhouettes that he created have been credited for adding a sense of fantasy and rebellion to fashion.<ref name="BBCSixWays"/> McQueen became one of the first designers to use Indian models in London.<ref name="BBCSixWays"/>

===Givenchy appointment===
Upon arrival at Givenchy, McQueen insulted the founder by calling him "irrelevant". His first couture collection with Givenchy was unsuccessful, with even McQueen telling ''Vogue'' in October 1997 that the collection was "crap". McQueen toned down his designs at Givenchy, but continued to indulge his rebellious streak, causing controversy in autumn 1998 with a show which included double amputee model [[Aimee Mullins]] striding down the catwalk on intricately carved wooden legs.<ref name="TimesMcQueenProfile"/> This year also saw McQueen complete one of his most famous runway shows previewing Spring/Summer 1999, where a single model, [[Shalom Harlow]], graced the runway in a strapless white dress, before being rotated slowly on a revolving section of the catwalk whilst being sprayed with paint by two robotic guns.<ref>London Fashion Review – Alexander McQueen Profile [http://www.fashionreview.co.uk/alexander-mcqueen-fashion Alexander McQueen Timeline Profile (June 2011)]</ref> Givenchy designs released by Vogue Patterns during this period may be credited to the late designer.<ref>PatternVault blog (11 July 2011) [http://blog.pattern-vault.com/2011/07/11/alexander-mcqueen-for-givenchy-vogue-patterns-part-1 Alexander McQueen for Givenchy: Vogue Patterns, Part 1]</ref>

McQueen received press attention after the May 2007 suicide of international style icon [[Isabella Blow]]. Rumours were published that there was a rift between McQueen and Blow at the time of her death, focusing on McQueen's under-appreciation of Blow.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/fashion/10BLOW.html?ref=fashion |title=The Woman No Hat Could Tame |last=Horyn |first=Cathy |date=10 May 2007 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> In response to these rumours, McQueen told an interviewer:<ref name="Bridget Foley" />

{{quote|"It's so much bollocks. These people just don't know what they're talking about. They don't know me. They don't know my relationship with Isabella. It's complete bullshit. People can talk; you can ask her sisters&nbsp;... That part of the industry, they should stay away from my life, or mine and Isabella's life. What I had with Isabella was completely dissociated from fashion, beyond fashion."}}

===VOSS===
One of McQueen's most celebrated and dramatic catwalk shows was his 2001 Spring/Summer collection, named VOSS. The centre piece tableau that dominated the room was an enormous glass box. But because the room outside the box was lit and the inside of the box was unlit, the glass walls appeared as large mirrors, so that the seated audience saw only their own reflection. When the show began, lights came on inside the enormous glass case and revealed the interior to be filled with moths and, at the centre, a naked model on a chaise longue with her face obscured by a gas mask. The glass walls then fell away and smashed on the ground.

The model chosen by McQueen to be the centre of the show was the British writer [[Michelle Olley]]. (The show also featured [[Kate Moss]] and [[Erin O'Connor]]). McQueen said that the tableau was based on the [[Joel Peter Witkin]] image ''Sanitarium''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://denniscooper-theweaklings.blogspot.com/2010/03/justin-presents-alexander-mcqueen-kit.html |title=DC's: Justin presents ...

<blockquote>"The girl in the box was Michelle Olley. She modelled for me in a story I did called Sister Honey... She was a writer and I remember she wrote a great piece on being the Butterfly Girl in the middle of that (McQueen) Glass Box show. I was sat on the front row, inbetween Alexandra Schulman and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. It was probably one of the best pieces of Fashion Theatre I have ever witnessed."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://showstudio.com/forums/13973/20474/20488/msg |title=McQueen Spring/Summer 2001 Show |date=24 March 2007 |publisher=[[SHOWstudio.com]] |accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

Alexander McQueen later described his thoughts on the idea used during VOSS of forcing his audience to stare at their own reflection in the mirrored walls for over an hour:
<blockquote>"Ha! I was really pleased about that. I was looking at it on the monitor, everyone trying not to look at themselves. It was a great thing to do in the fashion industry—turn it back on them! God, I’ve had some freaky shows."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.style.com/stylefile/2010/02/mcqueen-the-showman/ |title=Fashion Shows: Fashion Week, Runway, Designer Collections |work=Vogue |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155228/http://www.style.com/stylefile/2010/02/mcqueen-the-showman/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 2011, Michelle Olley was asked by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York to contribute to their Alexander McQueen exhibition, ''[[Savage Beauty (exhibition)|Savage Beauty]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/about/ |title=About the Exhibition - Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty - The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York |website=metmuseum.org |accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref> She was interviewed by The Met about VOSS for the audio guide to the show. Olley's detailed diary/journal of modelling for McQueen—written between 18–27 September as the show was being planned and staged—was included in the Met Museum website coverage of the Savage Beauty exhibition.<ref name="voss"/> The VOSS diary relates details of the show and encounters with McQueen, ending with how Olley returned home after the show to find: <blockquote>"...a MASSIVE bouquet of flowers has arrived, with a note [from McQueen] saying, ''"Thank you for everything – you were beautiful! – Lee xxx"''<ref name="voss">[http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/michelle-olley-voss-diary/ Metropolitan Museum of Art, Alexander MqQueen show 'Savage Beauty': Michelle Olley 'VOSS' diary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505222105/http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/michelle-olley-voss-diary |date= 5 May 2012 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Accomplishments===
Some of McQueen's accomplishments included being one of the youngest designers to achieve the title "[[British Designer of the Year]]", which he won four times between 1996 and 2003;<ref name="GuardianMcQueen"/> he was also appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] and named International Designer of the Year by the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America|Council of Fashion Designers]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.handbag.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen-commits-suicide/v1 |title=Alexander McQueen dies |publisher=Handbag.com |first=Leisa |last=Barnett |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216021227/http://www.handbag.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen-commits-suicide/v1 |archivedate=16 February 2010 }}</ref>

December 2000 saw a new partnership for McQueen, with the [[Gucci]] Group's acquiring 51% of his company and McQueen's serving as Creative Director.<ref name="GuardianBoy"/> Plans for expansion included the opening of stores in London, Milan, and New York, and the launch of his perfumes Kingdom and, most recently, My Queen.

McQueen became one of several designers to participate in [[MAC Cosmetics|MAC]]'s promotion of cosmetic releases created by fashion designers. The collection was released on 11 October 2007 and reflected the looks used on the Autumn/Winter McQueen catwalk created by makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury. The inspiration for the collection was the 1963 [[Elizabeth Taylor]] movie ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', and thus the models sported intense blue, green, and teal eyes with strong black liner extended Egyptian-style. McQueen handpicked the makeup.

In 2000, McQueen had a [[marriage ceremony]] with his partner George Forsyth, a documentary filmmaker, on a yacht in [[Ibiza]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article7023593.ece |title=British fashion designer Alexander McQueen found dead at home |work=The Times |first=Philippe |last=Naughton |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2010 |location=London}}</ref> [[Kate Moss]] and [[Annabelle Neilson]] were [[bridesmaid]]s.<ref>{{citation |last=Paton |first=Elizabeth  |date=17 July 2018  |title=Annabelle Neilson, Muse of Alexander McQueen, Dies at 49 | newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/fashion/annabelle-neilson-dead.html}}</ref> The marriage was not official, as [[same-sex marriage in Spain]] was not legal at that time.

McQueen was an avid [[scuba diving|scuba diver]] and used his passion as a source of inspiration in his designs, including spring 2010's "Plato's Atlantis". Much of his diving was done around the Maldives.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/paris-fashion-week/6267046/Paris-Fashion-Week-Alexander-McQueen.html |title=Paris Fashion Week: Alexander McQueen |work=The Telegraph |first=Hilary |last=Alexander |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=11 February 2010 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129180553/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/paris-fashion-week/6267046/Paris-Fashion-Week-Alexander-McQueen.html |archivedate=29 January 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

McQueen had close relationships with the teams of designers he worked with and oversaw. His life was dedicated to his work, and his friend and colleague, Sebastian Pons described him as a workaholic. He held the work ethic of his colleagues to the same standard as himself, which ultimately created strife within his team, pushing Pons to quit his job and end his friendship with Lee.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

McQueen struggled with mental health issues. They worsened in the latter years of his life. His mental and physical well being were undoubtedly affected by the fast pace and high production volume of his work. His friends have commented on how before he died, he was no longer the jolly and chubby man they had known and loved; he was miserable and enslaved to his work. McQueen struggled greatly with the death of his mother on 2 February 2010. He never went to her funeral, as he was pronounced dead nine days later on 11 February 2010.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In asking for his remains to be interred in Kilmuir, looking over the sea in the north of Skye, Alexander McQueen has joined members of his clan going back over many generations.

==Final runway presentation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Alexander McQueen's last appearance on a fashion show was in Plato's Atlantis, presented during [[Paris Fashion Week]] on 6 October 2009. This Spring/Summer 2010 collection was inspired by the post-human manifesto featuring 46 full looks.

The show began with a video of Raquel Zimmerman lying naked on sand with snakes on her body. McQueen installed two large cameras on the runway, both of which moved back and forth,  documenting and broadcasting the entire show live on SHOWstudio. The inspiration for Plato's Atlantis was nature and the post-human movement depicted by sea-reptile prints. The fashion show and the collection addresses [[Darwinism|Charles Darwin's theory of evolution]]. as well as current global warming issues. The fantasy collection, named after Plato's island that sunk in the sea, envisaged a future where humans are forced to evolve from living on land to living in water in order to survive. The color scheme changed during the show from green and brown (land) to blue and acqua (ocean). The models exhibited an androgynous look (which represents McQueen's evolutionary themes), as well as possessing post-human characteristics. The prints shifted from reptilian to prints of water creatures such as jellyfish and stingrays. The collection's final silhouettes gave the models marine features while the McQueen's signature Armadillo shoe also transformed the appearance of the models' anatomic foot. Plato's Atlantis was yet another way in which McQueen fused fashion with technology.

==Final show==
At the time of Alexander McQueen's death, he had an eighty percent finished Autumn/Winter collection. 16 pieces of this collection were presented during [[Paris Fashion Week]] on 8 March 2010, to a select handful of fashion editors in a mirrored, gilded salon at the 18th-century Hôtel de Clermont-Tonnerre.

Fashion editors picked his final designs. Editors said the show was hard to watch because it showed how McQueen was obsessed with the afterlife. The clothes had a medieval and religious look. Basic colours that were repetitively used were red, gold and silver with detailed embroidery. His models were accessorised to show his love for theatrical imagery. "Each piece is unique, as was he", McQueen's fashion house said in a statement that was released with the collection.

After company owner Gucci confirmed that the brand would continue, McQueen's long-term assistant [[Sarah Burton]] was named as the new creative director of Alexander McQueen in May 2010.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/100527-sarah-burton-is-named-new-creative-.aspx |title=Burton For McQueen |author=Sarah Deeks |magazine=Vogue |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611130408/http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/100527-sarah-burton-is-named-new-creative-.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2010, Burton presented her first womenswear collection in Paris.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/show.aspx/full-length-photos/id,9981 |title=Alexander McQueen Spring/Summer 2011 collection |magazine=Vogue |accessdate=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102222851/http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/show.aspx/full-length-photos/id,9981 |archivedate=2 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
