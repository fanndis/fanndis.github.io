The '''Bangladesh Nationalist Party''' ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশ জাতীয়তাবাদী দল|Bangladesh Jātīyotābādī Dol}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''BNP''') is one of the major political parties of [[Bangladesh]]. It was founded on 1 September 1978 by former Bangladesh President [[Ziaur Rahman]] after the Presidential election of 1978, with a view to uniting the people with [[nationalism|nationalist]] ideology of the country. Since then, the BNP won the second, fifth, sixth and eighth national elections and two Presidential elections in 1978 and 1981. The party also holds the record of being the largest opposition in the history of parliamentary elections of the country, with 116 seats in the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|seventh national election of June 1996]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=www.ecs.gov.bd |url=http://www.ecs.gov.bd/MenuExternalFilesEng/125.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729230304/http://www.ecs.gov.bd/MenuExternalFilesEng/125.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-29 |access-date=2012-12-13}}</ref> It has currently 9 MPs in parliament after [[2018 Bangladeshi general election|2018 national election]].<ref>http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/news/4-bnp-mps-elect-enter-js-oath-1736482%3famp</ref>

==Ideology==
The party holds the ideology of [[Bangladeshi nationalism]] as its core concept and adopted a 19-point program which declared that "The sovereignty and independence of Bangladesh, golden fruits of the historic liberation struggle, is our sacred trust and inviolable right". The founding manifesto of the BNP claims that the people of Bangladesh want to "...see that all-out faith and confidence in the almighty Allah, democracy, nationalism and socialism of social and economic justice are reflected in all spheres of national life".

BNP and its student wing was the driving force in the 1990 uprising against the autocratic Ershad rule that culminated in the fall of the regime and the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh.{{sfn|Routledge|p=186}} [[Begum Khaleda Zia]], who served as the party's chairperson from 1983, was elected as the first woman [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]] and the second female Prime Minister of a [[Islam by country|Muslim majority]] country after Pakistan's [[Benazir Bhutto]].

Begum Khaleda Zia is the chairperson of the party, with [[Tarique Rahman]] as the senior vice-chairman and [[Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir]] as the secretary-general.

==History==
[[File:Ziaur Rahman 1979.jpg|thumb|Founder of the party President Ziaur Rahman]]

===JAGODAL===
On 22 February 1978, a new party, Jatiyatabadi Ganatantrik Dal (JAGODAL), was formed with Justice [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Abdus Sattar]] as the coordinator. Most of the prominent figures were from the advisory council that was running the country at that time. Jagadal was the first attempt to create a platform for the nationalists of the country. Major General (retd) M.Majid ul Haq, Professor [[Syed Ali Ahsan]], Shamsul Alam Chowdhury, [[A.Z.M. Enayetullah Khan]], [[M. Hamidullah Khan]], Jakaria Chowdhury, Professor Dr. M. R. Khan, and [[Saifur Rahman]] were prominent figures.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=98}} JAGODAL was dissolved on 28 August 1978 to consolidate its membership under the newly formed Jatiyatabadi Front.

===Jatiyatabadi Front===
On 1 May 1978 the Jatiyatabadi Front or Nationalist Front was formed with Ziaur Rahman as the chief of the front, which JAGODAL joined soon after its formation. A major portion of NAP (Bhashani) joined the front as well with [[Mashiur Rahman (politician from Rangpur)|Mashiur Rahman]]. [[Shah Azizur Rahman]] with some of his colleagues from [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]]. [[Kazi Zafar Ahmed]] and a faction of United Peoples Party, Maolana Matin with his Labour Party, and minority leader Rashraj Mandal with Tafsili Jati Federation also joined.

Ziaur Rahman was their candidate for the Presidential Election of 3 June 1978. Ziaur Rahman won the election, defeating [[M. A. G. Osmani]] of Ganatantrik Oikya Jote (United Democratic Alliance) which was backed by the Bangladesh Awami League.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=99}}

===Formation of BNP===
After the Presidential election of 1978 the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was established on 1 September.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=101}}

The constitution of the party was drafted in 21 days of the formation with 76 members with [[Ziaur Rahman]] as the chief convener, [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] as the Executive Secretary and Dr. [[A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury]] was appointed as the Secretary General.

Within a couple of months the central executive committee of Jubo Dal was declared with Abul Kashem and Saifur Rahman as the President and general secretary respectively. [[Mirza Abbas]] became the Dhaka unit President with Kamruzzaman Ayat Ali as the Secretary General.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=121–122}}

===1981–1982===
On 30 May 1981 the founder of the party President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in the Chittagong Circuit House by a small group of military officials. After the [[assassination of Ziaur Rahman]], large crowds started protesting in major cities like [[Dhaka]] and [[Chittagong]].{{sfn|Islam|p=162}} The funeral of Ziaur Rahman became a huge event with the participation of millions of people in Dhaka.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Branigin |first=William |date=3 June 1981 |title=Vast Crowds Mourn at Burial of Zia |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/06/03/vast-crowds-mourn-at-burial-of-zia/89b4bc88-ed0f-440c-a4f8-ef2e29970430/}}</ref>

In the [[1981 Bangladeshi presidential election]] [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Abdus Sattar]] was elected. He formed a National Security Council to involve the Bangladesh Armed Forces. Meanwhile, Vice-President Mirza Nurul Huda resigned from his post in March 1982.{{sfn|Islam|p=165}}

====Military coup d'état, 1982====
Army Chief [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] thwarted the elected government of Justice Sattar on 24 March 1982 and replaced him with Justice [[A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]]. The BNP was thrown out of power. Many of its leaders were imprisoned,{{sfn|Islam|p=162}} including former Minister S.A. Bari, Saifur Rahman, Habibullah Khan, Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, Atauddin Khan, Jamal Uddin Ahmed, K.M. Obaidur Rahman, Abul Hasnat, and Moudud Ahmed. 233 leaders of BNP were arrested from March to July 1982.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=190}}

[[File:Khaleda Zia former Prime Minister of Bangladesh cropped.jpg|thumb|Khaleda Zia is the current chairperson and leader of the party]]

====7-Party Alliance====
From 1983, Begum [[Khaleda Zia]] became the de facto decision maker of the party. Under her leadership the BNP formed a new anti-government alliance against the autocratic Ershad regime. It was named after the number of parties with it, 7-Party Alliance.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=198}}

BNP launched a massive anti-government movement after co-ordination with Awami League led 15-Party Alliance from September 1983.
The 7-Party Alliance arranged a mass gathering and called a nationwide strike on 1 November 1983. The strike was very successful. After that the alliance called to surround the Secretariat on 28 November 1983 along with the 15-Party Alliance.<ref name="Rono March 2010 429">{{cite book |last=Rono |first=Haider Akbar Khan |date=2010 |script-title=bn:শতাব্দী পেরিয়ে |title=Śatābdī pēriẏē |language=bn |publisher=Taraphadara prakashani |page=429 |isbn=984-779-027-2}}</ref> Thousands of BNP activists led by then Executive Secretary (later designated Office Secretary) [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] surrounded the secretariat building at Paltan and broke large hole of the southern corner of the boundary wall of the building. The police retaliated with indiscriminate firing of live bullets.<ref name="Rono March 2010 429" /> [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] was arrested on 3 November in the afternoon from his residence at Dhaka Cantonment. A ban on political activities was imposed that night and Begum Khaleda Zia was kept under house arrest. The illegal regime was severely shaken at the core. A long curfew and ban on politics was imposed.

On 29 February 1984, Ershad declared that the ban on politics would be lifted on 26 March and on 27 May both the Presidential and national election would be held. The 7-Party Alliance asked for the national election prior to the Presidential election. After the lifting of the ban, Khaleda Zia attended an extended meeting of the party on 1 April where she was made the acting Chairperson of the party. In May, the Chairperson Justice Sattar resigned and Khaleda Zia was made the Chairperson of the party.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=121–122}}

Under the leadership of Khaleda Zia, the first major step BNP took was to expel leaders like Shah Azizur Rahman, Moudud Ahmed, AKM Maidul Islam, Abdul Alim, and Barrister Sultan Ahmed Chowdhury from the party. These leaders formed a committee with Shah Aziz as the President and AKM Maidul Islam as the general secretary. This faction later joined the Jatiya Front and [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]].

====Attack on Begum Khaleda Zia====
On 23 September 1984 while addressing a rally in [[Bogra]], 10 or 12 handmade grenades were charged on the rally while some of them were aimed at the stage where Khaleda Zia was giving her speech.{{sfn|Rahman|p=unknown}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}} Khaleda Zia narrowly escaped injury while eleven of her party received severe injuries. A nationwide strike was called in protest at this attack on 22 and 27 December. The government imposed a ban on political activities on those days to foil the strike, but it was largely ignored. Two people including a student leader from Bangladesh, Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal, died when police fired on a crowd on 22 December.{{sfn|Rahman|p=unknown}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

====Upazila election 1985====

The government, amid protests, held upazila elections on 15 May 1985 in 251 [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|upazilas]] and on 20 May in 209. The election was marked by rigging, stuffing, snatching of ballots and electoral fraud. Ershad's newly formed Janadal got 190 candidates as victors. Though BNP was in trouble because of government repression, it got 46 of its leader as upazila chairmen while the Awami League fared worse with 41 upazila chairman.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=201–202}}

====Formation of student alliance====
In 1985, BNP's students wing [[Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal]] formed Shongrami Chatra Jote with Chatra League (Awranga), Chatra League (Pradhan) and five other student organisations and started its resistance against Ershad.

===General election 1986===
In March 1986, Ershad declared that a national election would be held on 26 April.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ziring |first=Lawrence |year=1992 |title=Bangladesh: From Mujib to Ershad: An Interpretive Study |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=189 |isbn=978-0-19-577420-7}}</ref> Both the 7-Party Alliance led by BNP and the 15-Party Alliance led by the Awami League declared a boycott of the election on 17 March. Both called a joint rally on 21 March and a nationwide strike on 22 March as the immediate program to thwart the forthcoming election.

The night before the nationwide strike on 22 March, the Awami League called a meeting of the 15-Party Alliance but Sheikh Hasina refused to take part in the meeting. In the meeting majority of the parties including the Awami League opined in favour of the election. General Khalilur Rahman of Awami League was maintaining close contacts with the army headquarters during the meeting that night. Sheikh Hasina was having discussion with General Khalil periodically.<ref name="Rono March 2010 429"/>

On the final hours of 21 March 1986, Sheikh Hasina announced that the Awami League and her alliance would participate in the election. Five parties of the alliance parted ways from the Awami League after the announcement and decided to boycott the election. BNP and the 7-Party Alliance with the newly formed 5-Party alliance of leftists started campaigning against the election while the Awami League and [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]] joined the election.

The election was largely boycotted. BNP Chairperson mobilised a large pool of political parties and their leaders behind her to boycott the election. Apart from the BNP led 7-Party Alliance and leftist 5-Party Alliance, 17 more parties including BNP (Shah Aziz), Samajbadi Dal (Nirmal Sen), Democratic League (Moshtaq), Democratic League (Oli Ahad), Islamic Democratic League, Islami Andolon (M. A. Jalil), Janata Party, Jatiya Ganatantrik Party, Labour Party (Maolana Matin), Muslim League (Kamruzzaman), Progatishil Ganatantrik Shakti and so on.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=140}}

Khaleda Zia reiterated that the BNP would participate only if:

# The fundamental rights are restored
# All political prisoners are released
# All convictions of politicians by the military courts are cancelled

The anti-election alliance under BNP called for a nationwide strike on election day. Unrest, voting fraud and malpractices marked the election day according to the opposition parties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/BANGLADESH_1986_E.PDF |title=Bangladesh |website=Inter-Parliament Union |date=3 June 1986 |p=23–25}}</ref> Both the Awami League and Jamaat-e-Islami conceded humiliating defeat in the election.<ref name="Rono March 2010 429"/>

In a joint declaration, the two alliances called for "Siege Dhaka" program on 10 November 1987. The government imposed a ban on public gatherings ahead of the program which was defied on the day, and during the program, the capital of the country virtually went under the control of the opposition alliances.<ref name="swarthmore">{{cite web |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/bangladeshis-bring-down-ershad-regime-1987-1990 |title=Bangladeshis bring down Ershad regime, 1987–1990 |date=18 November 2012 |author=Rosanna Kim |website=Global Nonviolent Action Database |publisher=Swarthmore College}}</ref> This incident infuriated the opposition and a nationwide protest was called on the following day. The government came hard handed and both Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina was put under house arrest on 11 October.<ref name="swarthmore"/> Both the parties and their partners in the movement declared frequent nationwide strikes for the next days till the end of the year.

====General election 1988====
BNP was determined about not to join poll under Ershad regime and decided to boycott the [[1988 Bangladeshi general election|general election of 1988]] after the abolishment of the previous parliament. The election was held on 3 March without the participation of any popular party or alliance rather a combined opposition was made led by ASM Abdur Rab. BNP called a nationwide on the Election Day and declared they would resist the election.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ruling Party Is Declared the Winner in Bangladesh |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/world/ruling-party-is-declared-the-winner-in-bangladesh.html |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=Reuters |date=6 March 1988}}</ref>

====Organizational reformations====
On the advice of Dr.  Badruddoza Chowdhury, BNP chief Begum Zia, on 21 June 1988, suspended the national standing committee and executive committee on the party for various reasons including the failures to strengthening the party of leaders. During this opportunity former military officers were also removed from leadership positions within the party. [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] was relieved from his post as Executive Secretary. On 3 July 1988 Barrister Abdus Salam Talukder, a distinguished lawyer, was assigned with the post of Secretary General of the party instead of KM Obaidur Rahman. Soon after the removal of Obaidur, he with Jamal Uddin Ahmed and Abul Hasnat formed a new party with the same name.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taslima Nasreen: The Daughter of Eternal Bangladesh on the run in India – 3 |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/8442 |newspaper=Asian Tribune |date=28 November 2007}}</ref> On 17 July of the same year, Shah Azizur Rahman dissolved the BNP faction with him and joined the party with his followers on 26 August. Barrister Abdus Salam Talukder restructured the BNP, making it a stronger political platform that thrived through the critical time to topple Ershad regime.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP recalls Salam Talukder |url=http://newagebd.net/44374/bnp-recalls-salam-talukder/ |newspaper=New Age |location=Dhaka |date=24 August 2014}}</ref>

===1990 Mass Uprising===
{{Main|1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh}}
The movement against Ershad started gaining momentum from October 1990. The BNP led 7-party alliance, the Awami League led 8-party alliance and the Leftist 5-party alliance started a movement to usurp Ershad from 10 October 1990 and declared a nationwide strike on that day. The strike claimed 5 lives, including the three BNP activists who were rallying in front of the central office of the Jatiya Party when the Jatiya Party cadres opened fire on the crowd.{{sfn|Khan|p=196}}

On 28 November, the opposition parties including BNP and its student wing defied the curfew and state of emergency and came out with large processions. The curfew and state of emergency was the last resort for Ershad that became ineffective by the end of November 1990.{{sfn|Khan|p=200}} On 3 December, the protests became more violent and many died. Bombs were hurled at the Sena Kalyan Sangstha building at Motijhil. From 27 November to 3 December, more than fifty protesters died.{{sfn|Khan|p=200}} On 4 December, the mass uprising took place and Ershad declared his resignation.

====Students movement====
Dhaka University Central Students Union (DUCSU) which has always been a centre of all popular movements in the history of Bangladesh came under the control of Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal after the election of 3 June 1990.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=217}}{{sfn|Rahman|p=81}}<ref name="Daily Observer">{{cite news |title=DUCSU Election Twenty three years of unbearable silence |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/01/24/2478.php |newspaper=Daily Observer |location=Dhaka |date=24 January 2014}}</ref> The Amanullah Aman-Khairul Kabir Khokan panel backed by Chatra Dal won all the posts and took the lead of the students' movement in the [[University of Dhaka]] campus.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=217}}<ref name="Daily Observer"/>

The series of student protests compelled the Ershad regime to think about a safe exit.{{sfn|Khan|p=198}}

====Solidarity of teachers====
On 7 December 1989, the BNP supported White panel of teachers got the highest number of Deans elected from their panel including Professor Anwarullah Chowdhury, Professor S M Faiz, Assistant Professor [[M. Anwar Hossain]] and Associate Professor [[Humayun Ahmed]].{{sfn|Ahmed|p=215}}

The pro-BNP White panel of teachers, which dominated the Dhaka University Teachers Association, declared an all-out movement against the Ershad regime in 1990. All the teachers decided to resign from their post on 29 November and confirmed their decision of not returning to classes until the fall of Ershad. The firm reaction from the teachers jeopardised the Ershad regime.{{sfn|Rahman|p=82}}

After the fall of Ershad, because of the commitment to the national interest the White panel of teachers won a decisive victory on 24 December 1990 in the election of Dhaka University Teachers Association once again with Professor Anwarullah Chowdhury as the President of the association with Professor M. Anwar Hossain as the general secretary.{{sfn|Ahmed|p=214}}

===Caretaker government (2006–2008)===
{{main|2006-2008 Bangladeshi political crisis}}
The military-backed government promised to tackle the longstanding problems of corruption, filing charges against more than 160 politicians, civil servants and businessmen in 2007.

The [[Bangladesh Election Commission]] invited Hafizuddin's faction, rather than Khaleda Zia's, to participate in talks, effectively recognising the former as the legitimate BNP. Khaleda Zia challenged this in court, but her appeal was rejected on 10 April 2008.<ref name="aljazeera10Apr2008">{{cite news |title=Bangladesh court rejects Zia appeal |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2008/04/2008525142259751359.html |work=Al Jazeera |date=10 April 2008}}</ref> After her release later that year, Zia was restored to her position as party leader.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP top brass hails decision on Tarique |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-54711 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=14 September 2008}}</ref>

In the [[2008 Bangladesh general election]], the 4-party alliance led by BNP won 33 seats out of 299 constituencies, of which the BNP alone got 30.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2023_08.htm |title=Bangladesh (Jatiya Sangsad) Elections in 2008 |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref>

===5th National Council, 2009===
After sanctions by the Election Commission, the party held country-wide events in order for local leaders to play an active role in the national party.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newstoday-bd.com/frontpage.asp?newsdate=11/27/2009#23065 |title=Changes to Come Through the Council] |work=The Daily News Today |location=Dhaka |date=27 November 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> The BNP National Council empowered re-elected party chairperson Khaleda Zia to pick other members for the National Executive Committee and Standing Committee.<ref name="thedailystar.net">{{cite news |last1=Liton |first1=Shakhawat |last2=Suman |first2=Rakib Hasnet |date=8 December 2009 |title=Tarique made powerful senior vice-chairman |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-116937 |newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> It elected her eldest son, Tarique Rahman, to the powerful post as Senior vice-chairman, in a "move apparently designed to smooth his path to the party helm."<ref name="thedailystar.net"/>

===Post-election campaigns (2012 – present)===
After several movements in a period of severe political unrest between 2012 and 2014 to prevent the ruling party holding the [[2014 Bangladeshi general election|10th general election]] in January 2014 without a neutral caretaker government, Khaleda led BNP and its allies in a boycott of the election. Incidents of violence were reported on polling day including bombing of election centres, which the BNP and its allies were accused of. Over 100 people were killed in the 2016 Union Parishad Election in violent clashes between Awami League and BNP supporters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Moinul Hoque |date=4 June 2016 |title=Bangladesh braces for final round of union council elections that have left over 100 dead |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2016/06/04/bangladesh-braces-for-final-round-of-union-council-elections-that-have-left-over-100-dead |newspaper=bdnews24.com}}</ref> In 2016 the BNP announced its new National Standing Committee, in which Khaleda retained her position as Chairperson. New members were recruited while some older members were removed, and various new strategies for party operation were formulated.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP's names 17 members of the policymaking Standing Committee |url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/08/06/bnp-announces-new-national-standing-committee |newspaper=bdnews24.com |date=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Mahmud |first1=Sumon |last2=Islam |first2=Monirul |date=7 August 2016 |title=BNP names members of its leaders' families in new committee |url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/08/07/bnp-names-members-of-its-leaders-families-in-new-committee |newspaper=bdnews24.com}}</ref> In May 2017 Khaleda revealed BNP's Vision 2030 to gain public support for the next general elections.<ref>{{citation |url=http://en.prothomalo.com/contents/uploads/media/2017/05/10/80959a92ce5e7fb45615e48005fa7ca4-BNP-s-Vision-2030.pdf |title=Vision-2030 Bangladesh Nationalist Party |website=Prothom Alo |date=10 May 2017}}</ref> However the ruling Awami League government denounced Vision 2030 as an act of plagiarism of Awami League's Vision 2021 which they used in the ninth general election, and claimed most of the targets in the Visions were fulfilled by Awami League, thus declaring BNP's Vision 2030 as unoriginal. BNP also announced it will hold processions to hold the 11th general elections under a neutral government. This renewed tensions between BNP and Awami League.

On 8 February 2018 Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman as per court verdict, were jailed for 5 and 10 years respectively due to involvement in the [[Zia Charitable Trust corruption case]]. While Tarique was on exile, Khaleda would be imprisoned on old Dhaka Central Jail on Nazimuddin Road. In protest BNP held nationwide demonstrations, which were foiled by well-prepared police force across the nation. A large number of BNP activists were arrested during clashes with the police during the protests against Khaleda's imprisonment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/khaleda-zia-orphanage-trust-corruption-case-verdict-on-way-to-special-court-dhaka-bangladesh-1531711 |title=Khaleda lands in jail for corruption |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=8 February 2018}}</ref>

After the jailing of chairperson [[Begum Khaleda Zia]], BNP expedited the process to forge a national unity with prominent leaders of the country. In October 2018, the party formally announced its joining of [[Jatiya Oikya Front]] with Dr. [[Kamal Hossain]] at its forefront.<ref>{{cite news |title=New alliance launched|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/greater-national-unity-todays-meeting-cancelled-1646452| newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

There was controversy in the run up to the elections surrounding the nomination of banned [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaati]] candidates under the BNP banner. In 2013 the hard-line, right-wing, Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami was banned from registering and therefore contesting in elections by the [[High Court of Bangladesh|High Court]], citing their charter in violation of the constitution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/08/2013819424198348.html|title=Bangladesh court declares Jamaat illegal |website=Al Jazeera|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/news/ec-scraps-jamaats-registration-1653415|title=EC scraps Jamaat's registration|date=30 October 2018|website=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> However 25 Jamaati candidates ran in the election, with 22 nominations for BNP and 3 running as independents.<ref name="dhakatribune.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/2018/11/28/jamaat-to-contest-election-under-bnp-s-symbol-in-25-constituencies|title=Jamaat to contest election under BNP’s symbol in 25 constituencies|date=28 November 2018|website=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-national-election-2018/25-jamaat-e-islami-candidate-valid-for-national-election-2018-1677853|title=25 Jamaat men stay in the race|date=24 December 2018|website=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> An investigation was launched but on 23 December the [[Bangladesh Election Commission|Election Commission]] Secretary Helaluddin Ahmed said they had examined the related law and "there is no scope for rejecting the Jamaat leaders' candidacy at this moment."<ref name=":0" /> On 26 December, just days before the election, Jatiya Oikya Front leader Kamal Hossain expressed his regret about Jamaat's involvement in the elections under his alliance, claiming "had I known [that Jamaat leaders will be given BNP tickets] I would not have been part of it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/2018/12/27/kamal-wouldn-t-have-been-part-of-this-had-i-known-about-jamaat|title=Kamal: Wouldn’t have been part of this had I known about Jamaat|date=27 December 2018|website=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> The media however had reported at the end of November that this was happening.<ref name="dhakatribune.com"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/jamaat-leader-shafiqur-rahman-become-bnp-candidates-national-general-election-1666312|title=25 Jamaat men awarded BNP nominations|date=29 November 2018|website=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref>
