{{History of Haiti}}

The '''2010 Haiti earthquake''' ({{lang-fr|Séisme de 2010 à Haïti}}; {{lang-ht|Tranblemanntè 12 janvye 2010 nan peyi Ayiti}}) was a [[disaster|catastrophic]] [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude 7.0&nbsp;M<sub>w</sub>]] earthquake, with an [[epicenter]] near the town of [[Léogâne]] ([[Ouest (department)|Ouest]]) and approximately {{convert|25|km}} west of [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]]'s capital. The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (21:53 [[UTC]]) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010.<ref name="USGS_Haiti" /><ref name='abc1' />

The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, [[Jacmel]] and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the [[National Palace (Haiti)|Presidential Palace]], the [[National Assembly of Haiti|National Assembly]] building, the [[Port-au-Prince Cathedral]], and the main jail.

Many countries [[humanitarian response by national governments to the 2010 Haiti earthquake|responded to appeals for humanitarian aid]], pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called "Hope for Haiti Now," raising US$58 million by the next day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McAlister|first=Elizabeth|year=2012|title=Soundscapes of Disaster and Humanitarianism: Survival Singing, Relief Telethons, and the Haiti Earthquake|journal=Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism|language=en|volume=16|issue=3 39|pages=22–38|doi=10.1215/07990537-1894078|issn=0799-0537|url=https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/div2facpubs/158}}</ref> Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in [[mass grave]]s.<ref name="pressassoc21jan" />

As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and [[looting]] and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors.

==Background==
The island of [[Hispaniola]], shared by Haiti and the [[Dominican Republic]], is [[seismology|seismically]] active and has [[List of earthquakes in Haiti|a history of destructive earthquakes]].  During Haiti's time as a French colony, earthquakes were recorded by French historian [[Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry|Moreau de Saint-Méry]] (1750–1819). He described damage done by an earthquake in 1751, writing that "only one [[masonry]] building had not collapsed" in Port-au-Prince; he also wrote that the "whole city collapsed" in the [[1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake]]. [[Cap-Haïtien]], other towns in the north of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and the [[Sans-Souci Palace]] were destroyed during an [[1842 Cap-Haïtien earthquake|earthquake on 7 May 1842]].<ref name="Prepetit" /> A [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|magnitude 8.0 earthquake]] struck the Dominican Republic and shook Haiti on 4 August 1946, producing a [[tsunami]] that killed 1,790 people and injured many others.<ref name="msnbc13012010" />

Haiti is the poorest country in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and is ranked 149th of 182 countries on the [[Human Development Index]].<ref name="hdrstats" /> The Australian government's travel advisory site had previously expressed concerns that Haitian [[emergency services]] would be unable to cope in the event of a major disaster,<ref name="smartraveller" /> and the country is considered "economically vulnerable" by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].<ref name="FAOcast" /> Haiti is no stranger to natural disasters. In addition to earthquakes, it has been struck frequently by tropical cyclones, which have caused flooding and widespread damage. The most recent cyclones to hit the island before the earthquake were [[Tropical Storm Fay (2008)|Tropical Storm Fay]] and Hurricanes [[Hurricane Gustav|Gustav]], [[Hurricane Hanna (2008)|Hanna]] and [[Hurricane Ike|Ike]], all in the summer of 2008, causing nearly 800 deaths.<ref name="Guard08112008" />

The quake occurred in the vicinity of the northern boundary where the [[Caribbean plate|Caribbean tectonic plate]] shifts eastwards by about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year in relation to the [[North American plate]]. The [[strike-slip fault]] system in the region has two branches in Haiti, the [[Septentrional-Oriente fault zone|Septentrional-Oriente fault]] in the north and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault in the south; both its location and [[focal mechanism]] suggested that the January 2010 quake was caused by a rupture of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault, which had been locked for 250&nbsp;years, gathering [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].<ref name="BBC130120101" /> However, a study published in May 2010 suggested that the rupture process may have involved slip on multiple blind thrust faults with only minor, deep, lateral slip along or near the main Enriquillo–Plantain Garden fault zone, suggesting that the event only partially relieved centuries of accumulated left-lateral strain on a small part of the plate-boundary system.<ref name="Hayes"/> The rupture was roughly {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} long with mean slip of {{convert|1.8|m}}.<ref name="colorado.edu" /> Preliminary analysis of the slip distribution found amplitudes of up to about {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} using ground motion records from all over the world.<ref name="USGSHaiti4" /><ref name="nagoya" />

A 2007 earthquake hazard study by C. DeMets and M. Wiggins-Grandison noted that the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2&nbsp;M<sub>w</sub> earthquake, similar in size to the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake]].<ref name="DeMets" /> Paul Mann and a group including the 2006 study team presented a hazard assessment of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system to the 18th Caribbean Geologic Conference in March 2008, noting the large strain; the team recommended "high priority" historical geologic rupture studies, as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding 40&nbsp;years.<ref name="18cgc" /> An article published in Haiti's ''[[Le Matin (Haiti)|Le Matin]]'' newspaper in September 2008 cited comments by geologist Patrick Charles to the effect that there was a high risk of major seismic activity in Port-au-Prince.<ref name="lematinhaiti" />

===Aftershocks===
[[File:Haiti 2010 history.svg|thumb|History of the main shock and aftershocks with magnitudes larger than 4.0, data from USGS<ref name="USGS database" />]]

The U.S. Geological Survey recorded eight [[aftershock]]s in the two hours after the main earthquake, with magnitudes between 4.3 and 5.9.<ref name="USGS database"/> Within the first nine hours, 32 aftershocks of magnitude 4.2 or greater were recorded, 12 of which measured magnitude 5.0 or greater; in addition, on 24 January, the US Geological Survey reported that there had been 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater since the main quake.<ref name="USGS database"/>

On 20 January, at 06:03 local time (11:03 [[UTC]]), the strongest aftershock since the earthquake,<ref name="CNN aftershock" /> measuring magnitude 5.9&nbsp;M<sub>w</sub>, struck Haiti.<ref name="NYT aftershock" /> USGS reported its epicenter was about {{convert|56|km|mi|abbr=on}} WSW of Port-au-Prince,<ref name="USGS database"/> which would place it almost exactly under the coastal town of [[Petit-Goâve]]. A UN representative reported that the aftershock collapsed seven buildings in the town.<ref name="AP aftershock" /> According to staff of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], which had reached Petit-Goâve for the first time the day before the aftershock, the town was estimated to have lost 15% of its buildings, and was suffering the same shortages of supplies and medical care as the capital.<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/haiti-earthquake-update-190110 Haiti earthquake: reaching victims outside the capital], International Committee of the Red Cross, 19 January 2010</ref> Workers from the charity [[Save the Children]] reported hearing "already weakened structures collapsing" in Port-au-Prince,<ref name="CNN aftershock"/> but most sources reported no further significant damage to infrastructure in the city. Further casualties are thought to have been minimal since people had been sleeping in the open.<ref name="AP aftershock"/> There are concerns that the main earthquake could be the beginning of a new long-term sequence: "the whole region is fearful"; historical accounts, although not precise, suggest that there has been a sequence of quakes progressing westwards along the fault, starting with an earthquake in the Dominican Republic in 1751.<ref name="future" />

===Tsunami===
The [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] issued a [[tsunami]] warning immediately after the initial quake,<ref name="AJC"/> but quickly cancelled it.<ref name="noaa1">{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/ptwc/messages/caribe/2010/caribe.2010.01.12.233517.txt|title=Tsunami Message Number 3|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=12 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063820/http://www.prh.noaa.gov/ptwc/messages/caribe/2010/caribe.2010.01.12.233517.txt| archivedate= 15 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Nearly two weeks later it was reported that the beach of the small fishing town of [[Petit Paradis]] was hit by a localised tsunami shortly after the earthquake, probably as a result of an underwater slide, and this was later confirmed by researchers.<ref name="BBCtsunami">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8536561.stm Lessons to be learned from Haiti's tsunami] BBC News, 25 February 2010</ref> At least three people were swept out to sea by the wave and were reported dead.

==Damage to infrastructure==
{{Main|Damage to infrastructure in the 2010 Haiti earthquake}}
[[File:Haiti Earthquake building damage.jpg|thumb|Damaged buildings in Port-au-Prince]]

===Essential services===
Amongst the widespread devastation and damage throughout Port-au-Prince and elsewhere, vital infrastructure necessary to respond to the disaster was severely damaged or destroyed. This included all hospitals in the capital; air, sea, and land transport facilities; and communication systems.

The quake affected the three [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (Doctors Without Borders) medical facilities around Port-au-Prince, causing one to collapse completely.<ref name='metroint' /><ref name="onehospital" /> A hospital in [[Pétion-Ville]], a wealthy suburb of Port-au-Prince, also collapsed,<ref name=HospitalCollapse/> as did the St. Michel District Hospital in the southern town of [[Jacmel]],<ref name="BBCNews8476185" /> which was the largest referral hospital in south-east Haiti.<ref name='unia' />

[[File:Earthquake damage in Jacmel 2010-01-17 4.jpg|thumb|left|Damaged buildings in Jacmel]]

The quake seriously damaged the [[control tower]] at [[Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport]].<ref name='nytimesdevastation' /> Damage to the [[Port international de Port-au-Prince|Port-au-Prince seaport]]<ref name="brannigan1" /> rendered the harbor unusable for immediate rescue operations; its [[container crane]] subsided severely at an angle because of weak foundations. [[Gonaïves]] seaport in northern Haiti remained operational.<ref name="brannigan1"/>

Roads were blocked with [[road debris]] or the surfaces broken. The main road linking Port-au-Prince with [[Jacmel]] remained blocked ten days after the earthquake, hampering delivery of aid to Jacmel. When asked why the road had not been opened, Hazem el-Zein, head of the south-east division of the UN [[World Food Programme]] said that "We ask the same questions to the people in charge...They promise rapid response. To be honest, I don't know why it hasn't been done. I can only think that their priority must be somewhere else."<ref name="BBCNews8476185"/>

There was considerable damage to communications infrastructure. The [[Public switched telephone network|public telephone system]] was not available,<ref name="AJC"/> and two of Haiti's largest [[cellular telephone]] providers, [[Digicel]]<ref name="indiaprwire20100114" /> and [[Comcel Haiti]],<ref name=st119 /> both reported that their services had been affected by the earthquake. [[BDSNi|Fibre-optic connectivity]] was also disrupted.<ref name="WSJ20100115" /> According to [[Reporters Sans Frontières]] (RSF), [[Radio Lumiere|Radio Lumière]], which broadcasts out of Port-au-Prince and reaches 90% of Haiti, was initially knocked off the air, but it was able to resume broadcasting across most of its network within a week. According to RSF, some 20 of about 50 stations that were active in the capital region before the earthquake were back on air a week after the quake.<ref name=rw125 />

===General infrastructure===
[[File:Haitian national palace earthquake.jpg|thumb|left|Large portions of the [[National Palace (Haiti)|National Palace]] collapsed]]
In February 2010 Prime Minister [[Jean-Max Bellerive]] estimated that 250,000 [[residential area|residences]] and 30,000 [[commercial building]]s were severely damaged and needed to be demolished.<ref name=age25/> The deputy mayor of Léogâne reported that 90% of the town's buildings had been destroyed.<ref name=bbc127 /> Many government and public buildings were damaged or destroyed including the [[Ministry of Justice (Haiti)|Palace of Justice]], the [[National Assembly of Haiti|National Assembly]], the [[Supreme Court of Haiti|Supreme Court]] and [[Port-au-Prince Cathedral]].<ref name="st20100114" /><ref name='obs1' /> The [[National Palace (Haiti)|National Palace]] was severely damaged,<ref name="fox20100112" /><ref name="tsr20100113" /> though [[President of Haiti|President]] [[René Préval]] and his wife [[Elisabeth Delatour Préval]] escaped without injury.<ref name="WP20100119" /><ref name=nytimes /> The Prison Civile de Port-au-Prince was also destroyed, allowing around 4,000 inmates to escape.<ref name=sherwell1-16/>

[[File:Haiti earthquake damage overhead.jpg|thumb|Léogâne, close to the earthquake epicenter]]
Most of Port-au-Prince's municipal buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged, including the City Hall, which was described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as, "a skeletal hulk of concrete and [[stucco]], sagging grotesquely to the left."<ref name=wp /> Port-au-Prince had no municipal petrol reserves and few city officials had working mobile phones before the earthquake, making communications and transportation very difficult.<ref name=wp/>

Minister of Education Joel Jean-Pierre stated that the education system had "totally collapsed".

Based on US Air Force logs documenting activity at the airport, the [[Associated Press]] largely disproved the claim that the US held up aid in favor of military flights. The US military initially gave priority to military units in order to secure the airport, distribute aid, and provide security, but after that, incoming relief flights were cleared or rejected on a first-come, first-served basis. According to a US Air Force captain who had coordinated flight schedules, nearly all groups sending aid insisted their shipment was urgent. Those flights that were rejected were diverted to the [[Dominican Republic]], and their cargoes were unloaded and taken to Haiti by land.<ref name="heraldsun airport">[http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/6401614/article-Haiti-flight-logs-detail-early-chaos]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>

At the peak of the relief efforts, the airport was in a state of chaos. Normally, the airport, with a single runway and 10 spaces for large planes, handled 20 flights a day. After the earthquake struck, hundreds of planes rushed to Haiti without designated landing times. On average, a plane would land or take off every two minutes. The situation was complicated by the lack of room on ramps for planes to unload their cargo, and some planes did not have enough fuel to leave.<ref name="heraldsun airport"/>

Prime Minister Bellerive announced that from 20 January, people would be helped to relocate outside the zone of devastation, to areas where they may be able to rely on relatives or better fend for themselves; people who have been made homeless would be relocated to the makeshift camps created by residents within the city, where a more focused delivery of aid and sanitation could be achieved.<ref name=miami1-18/> Port-au-Prince, according to an international studies professor at the [[University of Miami]], was ill-equipped before the disaster to sustain the number of people who had migrated there from the countryside over the past ten years to find work.<ref>Cave, Damien [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/world/americas/21scene.html?hp Exodus to Countryside Reverses Long Trend], ''The New York Times'', 21 January 2010</ref> After the earthquake, thousands of Port-au-Prince residents began returning to the rural towns they came from.<ref>Boyle, Christina [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_looking_for_any_way_out_thousands_flee_ravaged_capital.html Haiti earthquake: Thousands flee ravaged Port-au-Prince following powerful aftershock], ''Daily News'', 21 January 2010</ref>

The commission was critiqued by Haitian groups for lacking Haitian civil society representation and accountability mechanisms. Half the representation on the commission was given to foreigners who effectively bought their seats by pledging certain amounts of money. An international development consultant contracted by the commission was quoted as saying, "Look, you have to realize the IHRC [commission] was not intended to work as a structure or entity for Haiti or Haitians.

===Status of the recovery===
Six months after the quake as much as 98% of the rubble remained uncleared. An estimated 26&nbsp;million cubic yards (20&nbsp;million cubic meters) remained, making most of the capital impassable,<ref name="Katz 4A"/><!---hard copy differs from soft copy but is the same article reprinted from associated press---> and thousands of bodies remained in the rubble. The number of people in relief camps of tents and tarps since the quake was 1.6&nbsp;million, and almost no transitional housing had been built. Most of the camps had no electricity, running water, or sewage disposal, and the tents were beginning to fall apart. Crime in the camps was widespread, especially against women and girls. Between 23 major charities, US$1.1&nbsp;billion had been collected for Haiti for relief efforts, but only two percent of the money had been released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/national_world&id=7549631 |title=ABC Local |publisher=ABC |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/WN/haiti-earthquake-months-things-stand/story?id=11120059 |title=Haiti Six Months Later: Where Do Things Stand?|publisher=ABC News|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=12 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715055921/http://abcnews.go.com/WN/haiti-earthquake-months-things-stand/story?id=11120059| archivedate= 15 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> According to a [[CBS]] report, US$3.1&nbsp;billion had been pledged for humanitarian aid and was used to pay for field hospitals, plastic tarps, bandages, and food, plus salaries, transportation and upkeep of relief workers.

In many cases land ownership was never officially registered.

Haitian grassroots groups advocated for the government to fulfill the right to housing as designated in the Haitian constitution, and for donor governments to support this as well.

====2011====

In January 2011, one year after the quake, [[Oxfam]] published a report on the status of the recovery. According to the report, relief and recovery were at a standstill due to government inaction and indecision on the part of the donor countries. The report stated: 
<blockquote>"One year on, only five percent of the rubble has been cleared and only 15 percent of the required basic and temporary houses have been built. House building on a large scale cannot be started before the enormous amount of rubble is cleared. The government and donors must prioritize this most basic step toward helping people return home".<ref name=Standstill>[http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2011-01-06/year-indecision-leaves-haiti-recovery-standstill A year of indecision leaves Haiti’s recovery at a standstill] Oxfam International, 6 January 2011</ref></blockquote>
Robert Fox, executive director of [[Oxfam Canada]], said: 
<blockquote>"The dysfunction has been aided unabated by the way the international community has organized itself, where pledges have been made and they haven't followed through [and] where they come to the table with their own agendas and own priorities. Most donors provided funds for transitional housing but very little money for clearing rubble or repairing houses". Fox said that in many instances rubble removal "means it was [moved] off someone's property onto the road in front of the property".<ref>[http://www.canada.com/news/Haiti+reconstruction+standstill+says+Oxfam+report/4065941/story.html Haiti reconstruction at 'standstill,' says Oxfam report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115064133/http://www.canada.com/news/Haiti+reconstruction+standstill+says+Oxfam+report/4065941/story.html |date=15 January 2011 }} Canada.com, 5 January 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.oxfam.org/en/policy/haiti-progress-report-2010 Haiti Progress Report 2010] Oxfam International, 6 January 2011</ref></blockquote>

In a public letter co-authored with UNESCO head [[Irina Bokova]], Jean said, "As time passes, what began as a natural disaster is becoming a disgraceful reflection on the international community."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/haiti-raises-quake-death-toll-on-anniversary-1.1011363 |title=Haiti raises quake death toll on anniversary |date=12 January 2011 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=13 January 2011 }}</ref> The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, led by former US President [[Bill Clinton]] and Haitian Prime Minister [[Jean-Max Bellerive]], had been set up to facilitate the flow of funds toward reconstruction projects in April 2010, but as of January 2011, no major reconstruction had started.<ref name=Standstill/>

====2012====

In January 2012, two years since the quake, figures released by the United Nations show that of the nearly US$4.5 billion pledged for reconstruction projects in 2010 and 2011, only 43% has been delivered.<ref name="Goldberg">{{cite news| url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/haiti-earthquake-recovery_n_1197730.html | work=HuffPost| first=Eleanor | last=Goldberg | title=Haiti Earthquake Recovery: Where Did All The Money Go? (INFOGRAPHIC) | date=11 January 2012}}</ref> Venezuela and the US, which promised the major share of reconstruction funds, have disbursed only 24% and 30%, respectively. Japan and Finland are among the few donors to have fully met their pledges. The data shows that some crucial sectors face particularly large funding gaps. In 2010 and 2011, for example, donors disbursed just US$125 million of the US$311 million in grants allocated to agriculture projects, and only US$108 million of the US$315 million in grants allocated to health projects. Only 6% of bilateral aid for reconstruction projects has gone through Haitian institutions, and less than 1% of relief funding has gone through the government of Haiti.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2012/jan/12/haiti-earthquake-aid-money-data | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Claire | last=Provost | title=Haiti earthquake: Where has the aid money gone? | date=12 January 2012}}</ref>

"A lot of good work was done; the money clearly didn't all get squandered," but, "A lot just wasn't responding to needs on the ground. Millions were spent on ad campaigns telling people to wash their hands. Telling them to wash their hands when there's no water or soap is a slap in the face."<ref name="Goldberg"/>

The [[Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti]], Let Haiti Live, and the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] have recommended immediate changes to recovery efforts to ensure that critical human rights concerns are addressed. A report found that, "The conditions in the displaced persons camps are abysmal, particularly for women and girls who too often are victims of gender‐based violence". They call for more oversight of accountability of reconstruction plans, asking, "Why have only 94,000 transitional shelters been built to date despite a stated goal of 125,000 in the first year?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ijdh.org/archives/24151|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430020806/http://ijdh.org/archives/24151|url-status=dead|title=Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti » Blog Archive » Press Release: Two Years After The Earthquake, Where Did The Money Go?

On 25 August 2012, recovery was hampered due to [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)|Tropical Storm Isaac]] impacting Haiti's southern peninsula.

====2015====
In 2015, [[NPR]] and [[ProPublica]] investigated the disappearance of US$500 million donated to the American Red Cross for earthquake relief, earlier described by the charity as the result of "one of the most successful fundraisers ever". Despite the claims of the American Red Cross that 130,000 homes had been built, the investigation discovered that only six had been built. The investigation reviewed "hundreds" of pages of internal documents and interviewed "more than a dozen" former and current staff members, investigating the organization's claim that 4.5 million Haitians had been helped "back on their feet." Joel Boutroue, a Haitian government advisor, said that this number would cover "100 percent of the urban area", and observed that it would mean the Red Cross had served every city in Haiti. Numerous other claims did not hold up under investigation. NPR found that the project was riddled with "multiple staffing changes", bureaucratic delays and a language barrier, as many of the Red Cross officials spoke neither French nor Haitian Creole. General counsel for the American Red Cross, David Meltzer, provided investigators with the NGO's official statistics, but would not elaborate on them. The public affairs office of the Red Cross disputed NPR and ProPublica's claims in an email, and claimed that their investigative report could cause an international incident. By June the American Red Cross had transferred the rebuilding efforts to the Haitian Red Cross.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/03/411524156/in-search-of-the-red-cross-500-million-in-haiti-relief |title=In Search of the Red Cross' $500 Million in Haiti Relief |date=3 June 2015 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, the United Nations reported that 2.5 million Haitians were still in need of humanitarian aid.  U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Mourad Wahba said, "There are still about 55,000 people in camps and makeshift camps.  Many are still living in unsanitary conditions due to displacement caused by the earthquake.
