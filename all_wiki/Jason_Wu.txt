Obama bought four dresses from Wu early in the year, wearing one of them for a segment on ''[[Barbara Walters|Barbara Walters Special]]'' shortly before the November 2008 election, prompting many in the media to consider her his "career-launcher".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/runway/2008/12/01/the-michelle-obama-career-launcher-for-emerging-designer-jason-wu/|title=The Michelle Obama "Career-Launcher" for Emerging Designer Jason Wu|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan|date=2008-12-01|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref> She wore another dress, a custom-designed one-shoulder, floor-length white chiffon gown, at the inaugural balls on the night of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|first term inauguration]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/20/inauguration.balls/index.html|title=Obamas dance, celebrate at inaugural balls|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-01-21|author=Lisa Respers France and Mallory Simon}}</ref>
