The '''Defense Business Board''' was established in 2001<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-25 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717164811/http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=430 |archivedate=2015-07-17 |df= }}</ref> as a complement to broader transformation efforts in the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] from an overly burdensome [[bureaucracy]] to a more streamlined, effective organization. The Board consists of approximately twenty private sector executives with experience in business management. The purpose of the Board is to provide independent advice, which reflects an outside private sector perspective, on [[best practice|best business practices]] for application to the Department. The Board’s objective is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational support to the nation's warfighters.

The Board operates under the provisions of the [[Federal Advisory Committee Act]] of 1972, as amended, and follows a [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] approved charter available at the DoD Defense Business Board website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dbb.defense.gov/charters.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120142804/http://dbb.defense.gov/charters.shtml |archive-date=2012-01-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Board members, to include the Board’s Chairperson, are appointed annually by the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] and do not receive any payments for their services.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Jessica |title=Dean Van Slyke Appointed by US Secretary of Defense to Defense Business Board Task Force |url=https://news.syr.edu/blog/2020/05/27/dean-van-slyke-appointed-by-us-secretary-of-defense-to-defense-business-board/ |accessdate=27 May 2020 |work=SU News |date=27 May 2020}}</ref> The Chairs of the [[Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee|Defense Policy Board]] and the [[Defense Science Board]] serve as non-voting ''ex officio'' members of the Board. The Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] and the Comptroller General of the [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] serve as non-voting observers of the Board.

In October 2014, Deputy Secretary [[Robert O. Work]] instructed the Board to hire consultants from [[McKinsey & Company]] to identify wasteful spending.<ref name="WashPo">{{cite news|last1=Craig Whitlock|last2=Bob Woodward|title=Pentagon buries evidence of $125 billion in bureaucratic waste|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/pentagon-buries-evidence-of-125-billion-in-bureaucratic-waste/2016/12/05/e0668c76-9af6-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_pentagon-0655pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=5 December 2016|page=A1|author1-link=Craig Whitlock|author2-link=Bob Woodward}}</ref>  McKinsey discovered DoD was spending $134 billion, 23% of its total budget, on back-office work, and that the back-office bureaucracy staff of over one million people was nearly as great as the number of active duty troops.<ref name=WashPo/>  On January 22, 2015, the Board then voted to adopt a McKinsey plan to cut $125 billion in waste over five years.<ref name=WashPo/>

After Secretary [[Chuck Hagel]] was replaced by [[Ash Carter]] the next month, however, Deputy Secretary Work expressed he was concerned that the gain from any savings achieved would then be removed from the defense budget by Congress.<ref name=WashPo/>  Under Secretary [[Frank Kendall III]] argued that he could not achieve any efficiencies and, instead, that he needed to hire 1,000 more staff.<ref name=WashPo/>  Secretary Carter then replaced the Board chairman, classified the McKinsey results as secret, and removed the report from public websites.<ref name=WashPo/>

In 2016 the DBB provided the model for the [[Defense Innovation Advisory Board  ]] which was established by Defense Secretary Carter during the 2016 during [[RSA Conference|RSA cyber security conference]] in [[San Francisco]].

In December 2020, the outgoing Trump administration replaced the majority of the board with new appointees, including Trump allies [[Corey Lewandowski]] and [[David Bossie]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mehta|first=Aaron|date=2020-12-04|title=Defense Business Board members replaced with Trump loyalists|url=https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2020/12/04/defense-business-board-members-replaced-with-trump-loyalists/|access-date=2020-12-05|website=Defense News|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Macias|first=Amanda|date=2020-12-04|title=Trump loyalists Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie appointed to Pentagon business board|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/trump-loyalists-corey-lewandowski-and-david-bossie-appointed-to-pentagon-business-board.html|access-date=2020-12-05|website=CNBC|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-04|title=Pentagon installs 2 Trump allies on defense advisory board|url=https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-corey-lewandowski-christopher-shank-mark-esper-c8dce4c3855e4fb1037f51d7c571d2df|access-date=2020-12-05|website=AP NEWS}}</ref>
