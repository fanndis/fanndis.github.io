===Critical reception===
In her review for ''Soul 2'', Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressed, "His voice and interpretive skills are such, though, that most tracks fit him like a glove, to the point where, on Rose Royce's Wishing on a Star, his oak-aged vocal seems a better fit for the remorseful lyric than original singer Gwen Dickey's. He grew up with these 1970s hits, and evidently reveres them, but isn't cowed by them".<ref name="SealGuardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/16/seal-soul-2-review|title=Seal: Soul 2 – review |work=The Guardian|date=November 19, 2011|location=London|first=Caroline|last=Sullivan}}</ref> In his review, Mike Diver of the [[BBC]] expressed that "Seal has a voice that can melt icecaps has never been doubted by his detractors – the problems with his material post-Seal (II) went deeper, to a basic songwriting level. Here, freed of the weight of his own emotions, he soars on a sublime Wishing on a Star (which manages to borrow its smoky backing from Sade's Smooth Operator).<ref name="SealBBCReview">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/jr28|title=BBC – Music – Review of Seal – Soul 2|publisher=BBC|date=November 16, 2011}}</ref>
