==Controversies==
===2012 criminal and civil settlement===
====Overview====
In July 2012, GSK pleaded guilty in the United States to criminal charges, and agreed to pay US$3{{nbsp}}billion, in what was the [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|largest settlement]] until then between the Justice Department and a drug company. The US$3{{nbsp}}billion included a criminal fine of US$956,814,400 and forfeiture of US$43,185,600. The remaining US$2{{nbsp}}billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the [[False Claims Act]]. The investigation was launched largely on the basis of information from four whistleblowers who filed [[qui tam]] (whistleblower) lawsuits against the company under the False Claims Act.<ref name="USDOJJuly2012">[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-civ-842.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty and Pay $3 Billion to Resolve Fraud Allegations and Failure to Report Safety Data"], United States Department of Justice, 2 July 2012.{{pb}}

The charges stemmed from GSK's promotion of the anti-depressants Paxil ([[paroxetine]]) and Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]]) for unapproved uses from 1998 to 2003, specifically as suitable for patients under the age of 18, and from its failure to report safety data about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), both in violation of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. Other drugs promoted for unapproved uses were two inhalers, Advair ([[fluticasone/salmeterol]]) and Flovent ([[fluticasone propionate]]), as well as Zofran ([[ondansetron]]), Imitrex ([[sumatriptan]]), Lotronex ([[alosetron]]) and Valtrex ([[valaciclovir]]).<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/>

The settlement also covered reporting false best prices and underpaying rebates owed under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]], and kickbacks to physicians to prescribe GSK's drugs. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/> The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia.<ref>[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010.<p>

As part of the settlement GSK signed a five-year [[corporate integrity agreement]] with the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which obliged the company to make major changes in the way it did business, including changing its compensation programmes for its sales force and executives, and to implement and maintain transparency in its research practices and publication policies.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/> It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets.<ref name=Reuters17Dec2013>[http://sustainability.thomsonreuters.com/2013/12/17/gsk-stop-paying-doctors-major-marketing-overhaul "GSK to stop paying doctors in major marketing overhaul"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028041032/http://sustainability.thomsonreuters.com/2013/12/17/gsk-stop-paying-doctors-major-marketing-overhaul/ |date=28 October 2014 }}, Thomson/Reuters, 17 December 2013.</ref>

====Rosiglitazone (Avandia)====

[[File:Avandia 2mg oral tablet.jpg|thumb|[[Rosiglitazone]]]]
The 2012 settlement included a criminal fine of US$242,612,800 for failing to report safety data to the FDA about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), a [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] drug approved in 1999, and a civil settlement of US$657{{nbsp}}million for making false claims about it. The Justice Department said GSK had promoted rosiglitazone to physicians with misleading information, including that it conferred cardiovascular benefits despite an FDA-mandated label warning of cardiovascular risks.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/>

In 1999, [[John Buse]], a diabetes specialist, told medical conferences that rosiglitazone might carry an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction.<ref>[http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=883E903D-F973-4A74-8432-3C651C71B4B4 "The Intimidation of Dr. John Buse and the Diabetes Drug Avandia"], Committee on Finance, United States Senate, November 2007, pp. 2–4.</ref> GSK raised questions internally about the drug's safety in 2000, and in 2002, the company [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] an article in ''[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]'' describing a GSK funded clinical trial that suggested rosiglitazone might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk.<ref>[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010; for internal concerns, p. 2 and attachment E, pp.&nbsp;20–35; for ghostwriting, p. 3 and attachment H, pp. 58–109; for the ghostwriting, attachment I, p. 110ff; for cover letter to ''[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]'', attachment I, p.&nbsp;143; for the ghostwritten article, attachment I, pp.&nbsp;152–158.{{pb}}

There were concerns in the 2000s about the sugar and vitamin content of [[Ribena]], a [[blackcurrant]]-based [[syrup]] and [[soft drink]] owned by GSK until 2013. Produced in England by H.W. Carter & Co from the 1930s, the company's unbranded syrup was distributed to children as a source of [[vitamin C]] during World War II, which gave the drink a reputation as good for health. [[Beecham Group|Beecham]] bought H. W. Carter in 1955.<ref>

In 2001, the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) required GSK to withdraw its claim that Ribena Toothkind, a lower-sugar variety, did not encourage tooth decay.

===SB Pharmco Puerto Rico===
In 2010, the US Department of Justice announced that GSK would pay a US$150{{nbsp}}million criminal fine and forfeiture, and a civil settlement of US$600{{nbsp}}million under the False Claims Act. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001, to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5&nbsp;billion of products each year.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the case began in 2002, when GSK sent experts to fix problems cited by the FDA. The lead inspector recommended recalls of defective products, but they were not authorised; she was fired in 2003, and filed a whistleblower lawsuit. In 2005, federal marshals seized US$2{{nbsp}}billion worth of products, the largest such seizure in history. In the 2010 settlement SB Pharmco plead guilty to criminal charges, and agreed to pay US$150&nbsp;million in a criminal fine and forfeiture, at that time the largest such payment ever by a manufacturer of adulterated drugs, and US$600&nbsp;million in civil penalties to settle the civil lawsuit.<ref name=NYTPuerto/>
