==Career==

=== 1970s ===
He published his first magazine article in the ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' in 1974: a profile of [[Angela Atwood]], a neighbor of his family who helped kidnap [[Patricia Hearst]] as a member of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. Shortly afterward, he left the ''Times'' and became a contributing writer to the ''[[New Times Magazine|New Times]]'', a bi-weekly news magazine started by [[Jonathan Z. Larsen|Jon Larsen]] and [[George A. Hirsch|George Hirsch]]. Wolff's first book was ''White Kids'' (1979), a collection of essays.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Wolff launched Michael Wolff & Company, Inc., specializing in book-packaging. Its first project, ''Where We Stand'', was a book with a companion [[PBS]] series. The company's next major project was creating one of the first guides to the Internet, albeit in book form. ''Net Guide'' was published by [[Random House]].<ref>{{ASIN | 0440223903 }}</ref>

In the fall of 1998, Wolff published a book,  ''[[Burn Rate (book)|Burn Rate]]'', which recounted the details of the financing, positioning, personalities, and ultimate breakdown of Wolff's start-up Internet company, Wolff New Media. The book became a bestseller. In its review of Wolff's book ''Burn Rate'', ''[[Brill's Content]]'' criticized Wolff for "apparent factual errors" and said that 13 people, including subjects he mentioned, complained that Wolff had "invented or changed quotes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brillscontent.com/burn.shtml|title=The Truth About Burn Rate|date=October 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718061524/http://www.brillscontent.com/burn.shtml|archivedate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>

In August 1998, Wolff was recruited by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine to write a weekly column. Over the next six years, he wrote more than 300 columns <ref>[http://nymag.com/nymag/author_211/ Michael Wolff Archive – New York Magazine]. Nymag.com.

In 2004, when ''New York'' magazine's owners, [[RentPath|Primedia Inc.]], put the magazine up for sale, Wolff helped assemble a group of investors, including ''[[New York Daily News]]'' publisher [[Mortimer Zuckerman]], to back him in acquiring the magazine.<ref>Yglesias, Matthew.

In a 2004 cover story for ''[[The New Republic]]'', Michelle Cottle wrote that Wolff was "uninterested in the working press," preferring to focus on "the power players—the moguls" and was "fixated on culture, style, buzz, and money, money, money." She also noted that "the scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created—springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events," calling his writing "a whirlwind of flourishes and tangents and asides that often stray so far from the central point that you begin to wonder whether there is a central point."<ref>{{cite web|first=Michelle|last=Cottle|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/wolff-trapped|title=Wolff Trapped|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=August 29, 2004}}</ref>
