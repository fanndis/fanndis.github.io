'''Police brutality''' or '''excessive use of force''' by law enforcement can be legally defined as a [[civil rights]] violation, where [[law enforcement officer]]s exercise undue or excessive force against a subject. This may include, but is not limited to, physical or verbal harassment, physical or mental injury, property damage, and death.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Emesowum|first=Benedict|date=5 December 2016|title=Identifying Cities or Countries at Risk for Police Violence|journal=Journal of African American Studies|volume=21|issue=2|pages=269–281|doi=10.1007/s12111-016-9335-3|s2cid=151639366|issn=1559-1646}}</ref> In some countries, "the color of law" protects officers from ambiguous situations.<ref name="policechiefmagazine.org">Martinelli TJ.

== History ==
The term "police brutality" was first used in Britain in the mid-19th century, with ''[[The Puppet-Show]]'' (a short-lived rival to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'') complaining in September 1848:<blockquote>Scarcely a week passes without their committing some offence which disgusts everybody but the magistrates. Boys are bruised by their ferocity, women insulted by their ruffianism; and that which brutality has done, perjury denies, and magisterial stupidity suffers to go unpunished. [...] And "police brutality" is fast becoming one of our most "venerated institutions!"<ref>{{Cite magazine|magazine=The Puppet-Show |title=More Police Brutality |date=9 September 1848 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbMOAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA2-PA14 | volume=2 |issue=27 |page=14}}</ref></blockquote>

The first use of the term in the American press was in 1872, when the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Police Brutality: A Prisoner was shamefully beaten by Officers, he was Kicked and Pounded in a Cell ---Probably Fatally Injured|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=12 October 1872}}</ref> reported the beating of a civilian who was under arrest at the Harrison Street Police Station.

The origin of modern policing (based on the authority of the [[nation-state]]) can be traced back to 18th century [[France]], with [[Police#History|modern police departments]] being established in many nations by the 19th and early 20th centuries. Early records suggest that labor strikes were the first large-scale incidents of [[police brutality in the United States]], including events like the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912, the [[Ludlow massacre]] of 1914, the [[Steel strike of 1919|Great Steel Strike of 1919]], and the [[Hanapepe massacre]] of 1924.

In the United States, it is common for marginalized groups to perceive the police as [[oppression|oppressors]], rather than protectors or enforcers of the law, due to the statistically disproportionate number of minority incarcerations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Mary D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1-56510-262-0|pages=56–60|chapter=Civilian Oversight Is Necessary to Prevent Police Brutality}}</ref>

Hubert Locke wrote:

<blockquote>When used in print or as the battle cry in a [[black power]] rally, police brutality can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as "alley court"—the wanton vicious beating of a person in custody, usually while [[handcuffs|handcuffed]], and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the [[Police station|station house]].<ref>{{cite journal|volume=44|publisher=J.

<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Kingbeating.jpg|thumb|Screenshots of [[Rodney King]] lying down and being beaten by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers]] -->
In March 1991 members of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) beat an African American suspect, [[Rodney King]], during his arrest for drunk driving. A white civilian videotaped the assault. This incident led to extensive media coverage and criminal charges against several of the officers involved. In April 1992, hours after the four police officers involved were acquitted at trial, the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] commenced and resulted in 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing a federal trial, two of the four officers were convicted and received 32-month prison sentences. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles Police Department.

Data released by the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (2011) showed that from 2003 to 2009 at least 4,813 people died while being arrested by local police. Of the deaths classified as [[law enforcement]] homicides, there were 2,876 deaths; of those, 1,643 or 57.1% of the deaths were "people of color".<ref>{{cite web |last=Kappeler|first=Victor |title=Being Arrested can be Hazardous to your Health, Especially if you are a Person of Color |url=http://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/being-arrested-can-be-hazardous-your-health-especially-if-you-are-person-color}}</ref>

[[The Guardian]] reports that incidents of police brutality skyrocketed by 312% from 2011 to 2012 compared to 2001 to 2002, with only 1 in 100 cases leading to a conviction. There were also 720 deaths in police custody due to police action from 2011 to 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|date=22 August 2013|title=South Africa reports of police brutality more than tripled in the last decade|newspaper=[[the Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/south-africa-police-brutality-increase}}</ref>

In 2015, as a result of police officers being accused of crimes such as rape, torture, and murder, the cost of civil liabilities claims were so great that there was concern the costs would strain the South African Police Service national budget. The police commissioner at the time, Riah Phiyega, attributed the large number of claims "on a highly litigious climate".<ref>{{cite web|date=1 October 2015|title=Police Brutality on Rise in South Africa: Officers Accused of Killing, Raping Citizens|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/police-brutality-rise-south-africa-officers-accused-killing-raping-citizens-2122712}}</ref>

On 23 January 2017, [[2017 pro-jallikattu protests|a pro-jallikattu silent protest]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] turned violent. The [[National Human Rights Commission]] consolidated reports that the police used violent methods without prior warning, including beatings and damaging private property, to disperse protesters in [[Chennai]]. There were widespread social media reports of police setting vehicles on fire.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police excesses on jallikattu supporters in Chennai: NHRC issues notice to Tamil Nadu govt &#124; Chennai News - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/police-excesses-on-jallikattu-supporters-in-chennai-nhrc-issues-notice-to-tamil-nadu-govt/articleshow/56761447.cms|website=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=25 January 2017|title=Jallikattu: NHRC notice to Tamil Nadu government, police for 'excesses&#8217|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jallikattu-nhrc-notice-to-tamil-nadu-government-police-for-excesses/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jallikattu: Kamal Haasan, Others Tweet Video of Cop Setting An Auto on Fire|url=http://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/video-of-cop-setting-auto-on-fire-allegedly-in-chennai-goes-viral-1651853|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Ndtv.com}}</ref> The [[baton charge|Lathi Charge]] is very well known in India as an excessive use of force done by police during mass protests or riots.

==== Indonesia ====
[[Islamic extremists]] in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. In many cases they are either captured or killed. There are cases of police corruption involving hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists investigating these claims; one example occurred in June 2012 when Indonesian magazine ''[[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|Tempo]]'' had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on 31 August 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody; five people were killed and 34 injured. The police's history of violence goes back to the military-backed [[Suharto]] regime (1967–1998), when Suharto seized power during an alleged coup and instituted an [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966|anti-Communist purge]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cop killers|work=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17419881}}</ref>

Criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments are light, and Indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. [[Amnesty International]] has called on Indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing to ensure that they meet international standards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indonesia|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/indonesia-must-end-impunity-police-violence-2012-04-25|accessdate=2 October 2015|publisher=Amnesty International}}</ref>

==== Pakistan ====
{{see also|List of cases of police brutality in Pakistan}}
Pakistan's law enforcement is divided into multiple tiers including forces under provincial and federal government control. The law strictly prohibits any physical abuse of suspected or convicted criminals; however, due to deficiencies during the training process, there have been reported instances of suspected police brutality. Reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes.

A recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named Naqeebullah by an ex-officer named "Rao Anwar". Taking notice of the matter, the Supreme Court issued arrest and detention warrants in the case to arrest the accused.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==== Mainland China ====
Politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in China, notably with the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Associations such as [[Falun Gong]] have objected against the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and which are dispersed by riot police. Chinese protesters have been able to systematize powerful group mobilizations with the use of social media and informal mass communication like [[Twitter]] and its Chinese counterparts [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]].<ref>{{cite news|date=9 May 2012|title=Chinese censors block news on blind activist's escape – CNN.com|work=CNN|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-30/asia/world_asia_china-chen-internet_1_sina-weibo-chinese-censors-chen-guangcheng?_s=PM:ASIA|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614224358/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-30/asia/world_asia_china-chen-internet_1_sina-weibo-chinese-censors-chen-guangcheng?_s=PM:ASIA|archive-date=14 June 2012}}</ref>

In Xintang, Canton Province ([[Guangzhou]]), protests over allegations of corruption and abuse of power abound in the country - they are the principal cause of discontent in the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) the then-[[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]].  The Xintang region, Canton Province (Guangzhou), is an influential textile hub, attracting thousands of workers from all over the country, and what lit the fuse was a complaint of mistreatment against a pregnant migrant worker. Protests on 20 February{{what year|date=October 2020}} used a website to urge participants not to shout more anti-government slogans, but to go outside for a quiet walk in the places where they had been deciding to continue the protest. After a brutal police response, the authorities installed corrugated metal fences outside the restaurant and the home of dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Liu Xiaobo]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Hundreds of uniformed and plainclothes security officers and volunteers with red armbands, pre-emptively positioned in Wangfujing.

====Turkey====
[[File:Gezi Parkı Müdahale 2013-06-11 (46).jpg|thumb|A protester shows his wounded eye. Police brutality was one of the main issues arising from the [[2013 protests in Turkey]].]]
[[Turkey]] has a history of police brutality, including [[Torture in Turkey|the use of torture]] particularly between 1977 and 2002. Police brutality featured excessive use of tear gas (including targeting protesters with tear gas canisters),<ref>{{cite news|title=Tear gas as a dangerous weapon|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/07/aftermath-unrest-turkey}}</ref> pepper spray, and water cannons. Physical violence against protesters has been observed, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and [[International Workers' Day#Turkey|May Day demonstrations]]. The [[2013 protests in Turkey]] were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of [[Taksim Gezi Park]].

In 2012 several officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of the political activist [[Engin Çeber]].

The European Court of Human Rights has noted the failure of the Turkish investigating authorities to carry out effective investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement personnel during demonstrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=CASE OF İZCİ v.

====Austria====
In Vienna, there is an association made between Vienna's drug problem and the city's African migrants, which have led to African migrants being racially profiled.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reactions to Police Brutality|url=http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818090904/http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|archive-date=18 August 2016|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

There have been a number of highly publicized incidents in Austria where police have either tortured, publicly humiliated, or violently beaten people{{emdash}}in some cases to the point of death. While the most notorious of these incidents occurred in the late 1990s, incidents as recent as 2019 are being investigated by the Vienna Police Department for Special Investigations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://civicspacewatch.eu/austria-five-questions-on-possible-police-violence-in-vienna/|title=Freedom of assembly - AUSTRIA: Five questions on possible police violence in Vienna}}</ref>

=====Examples=====
; 24 April 1996:Nicola Jevremović, a Serbian Romani man, tried to pay a friend's parking fine and was harassed by police. He escaped and a group of 25 to 40 police officers entered his home without a warrant. The police officers violently beat him and his wife, Violetta Jevremović, in front of their children and then arrested the couple. The couple were made to wait outside for half an hour in front of their neighbours, allegedly to humiliate them. Nicola Jevremović was initially fined for a misdemeanor and found guilty in 1997 of "resisting arrest." Violetta Jevremović was found guilty of "suspicion of resisting arrest."<ref>{{cite web|title=Romani Couple Beaten by Police in Austria - ERRC.org|url=http://www.errc.org/article/romani-couple-beaten-by-police-in-Austria/1494|access-date=22 July 2016|website=www.errc.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Viennese Court Refuses to Counter Police Testimony - ERRC.org|url=http://www.errc.org/roma-rights-journal/viennese-court-refuses-to-counter-police-testimony|access-date=7 June 2020|website=www.errc.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cahn|first=Claude|url=http://www.errc.org/uploads/upload_en/file/00/26/m00000026.pdf#page=20|title=Divide and Deport: Roma & Sinti in Austria|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre|year=1996|isbn=963046988X|editor-last=Petrova|editor-first=Dimitrina|pages=19–23}}</ref>

===== Police accountability =====
There has been a notable lack of commitment to addressing the violation of civilians' rights in Austria, with Amnesty International reporting that in 1998-1999 very few people who committed a violation of human rights were brought to justice. This was worsened by the fact that many people who made a complaint against police were brought up on counter-charges such as resisting arrest, defamation, and assault.<ref name=":14" />

From 2014 to 2015, 250 accusations of police misconduct were made against officers in Vienna with none being charged, though 1,329 people were charged with "civil disorder" in a similar time period.<ref name=":16" /> The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)'s 2014 report included a number of complaints of police using excessive force with detainees and psychiatric patients. The culture of excusing police officers for their misconduct has continued into the present day, and any complaints of mistreatment are often met with inadequate investigations and judicial proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/europe/austria|access-date=22 July 2016|website=Amnesty International USA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Austria 2015/2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/austria/report-austria/|access-date=22 July 2016|website=www.amnesty.org}}</ref>

===== Actions to combat police officers brutality =====
Austria has legislation which criminalizes hate speech against anyone's race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.<ref name=":17">{{cite web|title=Austria 2015 Human Rights Report|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/253033.pdf|publisher=United States Bureau of Democracy and Labor}}</ref> Laws like this discourage discrimination, help with altering public perceptions of different ethnic and cultural groups, and subsequently reduce the number of racially motivated incidents of police brutality. Austria has a number of [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s that are trying to implement broad programs which encourage positive cross-cultural relations and more targeted programs such as racial sensitivity training for police. The Austrian police are formulating their own policies to prevent police brutality, and to make prosecuting police misconduct fairer.<ref name=":17" /> In January 2016, Austrian police forces started a trial of wearing body cameras to document civilian—police interactions.<ref>{{cite web|date=17 August 2015|title=Austria to test police body cameras|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150817/austria-to-test-police-body-cameras|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

However, it appears that incidents of police brutality are still occurring.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Amnesty international report : the state of the world's human rights.|publisher=Amnesty International|year=2016|isbn=978-0-86210-492-4|location=New York|pages=75|oclc=946693257}}</ref> Amnesty International suggested that more work needs to be done by the government to reduce negative stereotypes that lead to prejudice, racial profiling, hatred, and police brutality. One suggestion was to disband the ''Bereitschaftspolizei'', Vienna's riot police, as they have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality.<ref name=":16" /> Amnesty International also proposed that the Austria government adopt a National Action Plan against Racism, something which they had previously refused to do. Such a plan was required by the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action]].<ref name="amnestyusa1">{{cite web|title=Annual Report: Austria 2013|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-austria-2013|access-date=22 July 2016|website=Amnesty International USA}}</ref>

==== Belgium ====
[[Law of Belgium|Belgian law]] enforcement changed to two police forces operating on a federal and local level in 2001 after a three-tier police system. While the two services remain independent, they integrate for common training programs and recruitment. The change was prompted by a national parliamentary report into a series of paedophile murders which proved police negligence and severely diminished public confidence. Currently, approximately 33,000 local police and 900 civilians work across 196 regional police forces.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last1=Benoît|first1=Majerus|last2=Xavier|first2=Rousseaux|date=1 January 2004|title=The World Wars and their Impact on the Belgian Police Systems|language=en|hdl-access=free|hdl=10993/1824}}</ref>

The United Nations (UN) Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990) are replicated in Belgian law through The Criminal Code and the Police Functions Act.<ref name=":10" /> These principles dictate that use of force should be proportionate, appropriate, reported and delivered in a timely manner; however, the UN Human Rights Committee reported complaints of ill-treatment against property and people by police escalated between 2005 and 2011, most commonly involving assault against persons no longer posing danger.<ref name=":11">{{cite web|title=POLIS – Country Profiles of Participating and Partner States|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=8|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517164252/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=8|archive-date=17 May 2016|access-date=22 July 2016|website=polis.osce.org}}</ref> Belgian judicial authorities were found to also have failed to notify national police watchdog, Committee P, of criminal convictions against police, which is both a direct breach of Belgian judicial procedure and a failure to comply with Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<ref name=":11" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty bodies Search|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/TBSearch.aspx?Lang=En&CountryID=17&ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_radResultsGridChangePage=4|access-date=22 July 2016|website=tbinternet.ohchr.org}}</ref>

An extreme instance in January 2010 led to the death of Jonathan Jacob in Mortsel. He was apprehended by local Mortsel police for behaving strangely under the influence of amphetamines. Footage depicted eight officers from Antwerp police's Special Intervention Unit restraining and beating Jacob after he had been injected with a sedative sparked public outrage. Jacob died from internal bleeding following the incident, but police claimed they did not make any mistakes and "acted carefully, respecting the necessary precautions".<ref>{{cite web|date=22 February 2013|title=Police brutality video sends shock wave through Belgium|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.1555242|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2013, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) convicted Belgium of human rights violations in an appeal on the treatment of two brothers in custody who had been slapped by an officer.

==== Denmark ====
The [[Police of Denmark]] has a force of approximately 11,000 officers and they serve in the 12 police districts and the two Danish overseas territories.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Police: Organisation|url=https://www.politi.dk/en/About_the_police/organisation/|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=Politi}}</ref> The Danish Independent Police Complaints Authority ({{lang|da|Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed}}) (the Authority) handles the investigation of police misconduct allegations.<ref name="politiklagemyndigheden.dk">{{cite web|title=Independent Police Complaints Authority|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/english|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed}}</ref> Annual statistics released by the Authority revealed a reduction in the number of complaints against police from 2012 to 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adfaerdsklager|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/udgivelser-og-tal/politikredsstatistik/adfaerdsklager|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|language=da}}</ref> In 2012, the Authority received 726 conduct complaints from across Denmark; in 2015, the number of complains fell to 509, representing approximately 0.05 complaints per officer. A majority of complaints stem from general misconduct, such as traffic violations and unprofessional behaviour (e.g., swearing).<ref name="politiklagemyndigheden1">{{cite web|title=Arsberetning 2015|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/media/15820/a_rsberetning_2015_netversion.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2016|publisher=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed (Independent Police Complaints Authority)|language=da}}</ref>

However, the 2015 Annual Report identifies some instances where the Police of Denmark used excessive force.<ref name="politiklagemyndigheden1" /> For example, the Authority investigated a complaint made about alleged violence against an arrested person in Christianshavn on 15 March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Politiklagemyndigheden søger vidner til en episode på Christianshavn, hvor en polititjenestemand er anmeldt for vold|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser-nyheder/2016/4/politiklagemyndigheden-soeger-vidner-til-en-episode-paa-christianshavn,-hvor-en-polititjenestemand-er-anmeldt-for-vold|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|language=da}}</ref> Another investigation looked into the alleged use of force against a 16-year-old boy on 28 June 2016,<ref>{{cite web|title=Polititjenestemænd sigtet for vold begået mod en 16-årig dreng|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser-nyheder/2016/6/polititjenestemaend-sigtet-for-vold-begaaet-mod-en-16-aarig-dreng|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=Den Uafhængige Politkilagemyndighed|language=da}}</ref> which resulted in charges being laid against the two offending police officers from the Sydsjællands- and Lolland-Falster police department. Although examples of police brutality are not common, highly publicised incidents have been reported.

===== Examples =====
In 2002, 21-year-old Jens Arne Orskov Mathiason died while in police custody on the way to prison.<ref>{{cite web|date=15 June 2006|title=Denmark: Jens Arne Ørskov's death in custody: A mother's quest for justice|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/44c610894.html|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=refworld|publisher=Amnesty International|pages=1–6}}</ref> The incident raised concerns over the behaviour of the officers involved, the thoroughness of the subsequent investigation, and the willingness of the Director of Public Prosecutions to hold the officers accountable for their alleged failings. As a result, [[Amnesty International]] called for the establishment of new policies to investigate human rights violations and enforce compliance under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].<ref>{{cite web|date=15 June 2006|title=Denmark: Jens Arne Ørskov's death in custody: A mother's quest for justice|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/44c610894.html|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=refworld|publisher=Amnesty International|page=6}}</ref>

In August 2009, police in Copenhagen were heavily criticised for their response to an attempt to remove Iraqi refugees who were living in a city church.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|author1=Matthew Saltmarsh|author2=Catherine Contiguglia|date=14 August 2009|title=Raid in Denmark to Dislodge Iraqi Refugees Leads to Protests and Hunger Strike|agency=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/15/world/europe/15denmark.html|accessdate=18 July 2016}}</ref> Video allegedly showed the police using violence against the refugees and their supporters. Between 12,000 and 20,000 people subsequently protested against these actions.<ref name="nytimes.com" />

In 2012, the [[Courts of Denmark|Danish Court of Appeal]] concluded that the Danish Police had violated Article 3 (against abusive treatment and torture) and Articles 5, 10 and 11 (dealing with the right to liberty, the right to information about the accusation and the freedom of peaceful assembly) of the European Convention of Human Rights for the 2009 mass arrest made during protests at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite news|date=22 April 2012|title=Police found guilty of violating European Convention on Human Rights|agency=SocialistWorld.net|url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/5713|accessdate=18 July 2016}}</ref>

===== Prevention =====
In order to ensure that police are well-trained and to mitigate the risk of police brutality, police recruits undergo approximately three years of training; at the National Police College, recruits learn about police theory, the Road Traffic Act, criminal law, physical training, other legislation, first aid, radio communication, securing evidence, identifying drugs, preventing crime, management, human rights, and cultural sociology to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Police: How to become a police officer|url=https://www.politi.dk/en/About_the_police/admission/|accessdate=18 July 2016|website=Politi|publisher=Politi}}</ref> After this training period, recruits are promoted to the position of a police constable. By comparison, US police academies provide an average of 19 weeks of classroom instruction.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Paul Hirschfield|date=30 November 2015|title=Why American Cops Kill So Many Compared To European Cops|agency=Huffington Post|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-cops-lethal_us_565cde59e4b079b2818b8870|accessdate=18 July 2016}}</ref> The prolonged training in Denmark was observed to increase the ability of police to effectively de-escalate conflicts and enact their duties professionally and responsibly.

In order to keep police officers accountable and to ensure that they perform their duties in compliance with Danish, European and international laws, the Independent Police Complaints Authority has the power to handle criminal investigations against police officers and determine complaints of police misconduct.<ref name="politiklagemyndigheden.dk" /> This body is independent from both the police and prosecutors. For example, police

{{Quote|text="[...] may use force only if necessary and justified and only by such means and to such extent as are reasonable relative to the interest which the police seek to protect. Any assessment of the justification of such force must also take into account whether the use of force involves any risk of bodily harm to third parties."|author=''Act on Police Activities'' (2004)|source=<ref>{{cite web|author1=Frode Z. Olsen|title=The Use of Police Firearms in Denmark|url=https://www.politi.dk/NR/rdonlyres/20DE43AF-33F4-48C5-A710-6A58457E35D2/0/Engelskresum%C3%A9afendeligrapport.pdf|website=Politi|publisher=Politi|accessdate=18 July 2016|page=2|language=en|date=2008}}</ref>
}}

Therefore, police in Denmark are held to high standards and will face consequences if they breach their obligations to encourage compliance. Victims of police misconduct are encouraged to lodge a report with the Authority.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do you want to complain about the police?|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/media/6447/1._korr_pm_pjece_uk.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305062856/http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/media/6447/1._korr_pm_pjece_uk.pdf|archive-date=5 March 2016|accessdate=18 July 2016|publisher=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed (Independent Police Complaints Authority)|pages=1–14|language=en}}</ref>

==== Estonia ====
The [[Estonian Police]] force was temporarily dissolved in 1940 when [[Estonia]] lost its independence to the Soviet Union after it was occupied, before the Police Act passed in 1990 dissolved the Soviet [[militsiya]] and re-established it.<ref>{{cite web|title=POLIS – Country Profiles of Participating and Partner States|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816074034/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=16|archive-date=16 August 2016|access-date=22 July 2016|website=polis.osce.org}}</ref> In 2010, the Public Order Police, Police Board, Central Criminal Police, Border Guard, Citizenship and Migration Board merged into the Police and Border Guard Board.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estonia / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home – INTERPOL|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Estonia|access-date=22 July 2016|website=www.interpol.int}}</ref> It is the largest state agency in Estonia with over 5000 people in employment. The main objectives for this organisation are to maintain security and public order, crime prevention, detection and investigation, securing the European Union (EU) border, citizenship and identity documentation administration.

The Estonian Ministry of Justice reports that crime figures dropped by 10% from 2013 to 2015.<ref name=":9">{{cite web|title=Estonia 2015 Crime and Safety Report|url=https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=17447|access-date=22 July 2016|website=www.osac.gov}}</ref> They instruct that those who find themselves detained by the police should comply with their instructions and those who experience a language barrier are allowed to "request the presence of an interpreter and should not sign any documents or reports until they are confident that the documents contents are consistent with the details of the incident or the victim's statement".<ref name=":9" />

Incidents of police abuse are very rare. Although uncommon, powers are sometimes abused which leads to police brutality, such as the 2007 Bronze Soldier riots.

===== Bronze Night =====
{{See also|Bronze Night}}
[[File:Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, 2007.jpg|thumb|The Bronze Soldier of Tallinn in its new location]]The Bronze Night occurred from 26 to 29 April 2007, when riots broke out over the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn being relocated. The government wanted to relocate the statue and rebury the associated remains near the Tallinn Military Cemetery; the response was heavily negative among the country's [[Geographical distribution of Russian speakers|Russophone]] population, but for Estonians historically the Bronze Soldier served as a symbol of Soviet occupation and repression.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Anthony|title=The Memory Remains|url=http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Culture+%26+Living&articleid=a1230646924|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812073257/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Culture%2B&%2BLiving&articleid=a1230646924|archive-date=12 August 2010|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> For Russian citizens, it represented Soviet Russia's victory over Germany in World War II and their claim to equal rights in Estonia.
One Russian rioter was killed and other protesters were arrested. Due to the overcrowded detention centres many of the detainees were taken to cargo terminals in Tallinn's seaport. Then-chairman of the [[Constitution Party (Estonia)|Constitution Party]] Andrei Zarenkov stated "people were forced to squat for hours or lie on the concrete floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The police used plastic handcuffs which caused great pain. The police selectively beat the detainees including women and teenagers.

==== Finland ====
Historically, anti-communist police brutality was commonplace during the 1920s and 1930s following the [[Finnish Civil War]]. Some local sections of the secret police ([[Etsivä Keskuspoliisi]]) routinely beat up arrested communists.

In 2006 there were 7700 police officers in Finland.<ref name="uta.fi">{{cite web|title=Poliisien tekemät rikokset – normien valvojat normien rikkojina|url=http://tampub.uta.fi/handle/10024/93527|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> That police force was seen to be more law-abiding than firemen;<ref name="uta.fi" /> however, a few dozen cases each year involved police officers being convicted of crimes committed while on duty, 5 to 10 percent of the hundreds of similar crimes prosecuted annually. The number of these crimes were shown to increase annually.<ref name="uta.fi" /> Police officers are most often suspected of traffic related crimes (endangering road safety, vehicular collisions etc.) which constitute approximately 50% of all cases. These types of cases were the most likely to be dismissed before proceeding to the prosecutor for consideration.<ref name="uta.fi" /> The second highest category (approximately 20%) involving police is the use of excessive force which, with the exception of some off-duty petty assaults (which includes a slap on the cheek), proceed to the prosecutor without fail.<ref name="uta.fi" />

In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable lured a 16-year-old girl to his house by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence.<ref>{{cite web|date=3 February 2010|title=Poliisi raiskasi 16-vuotiaan – selvisi ehdollisella|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/poliisi-raiskasi-16-vuotiaan---selvisi-ehdollisella/art-1288335053979.html|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=Ilta-Sanomat}}</ref> In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki, inflicting bruises all over Pourak's body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull.

==== Germany ====
Germany is sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, though this has not stopped international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|date=14 January 2004|title=Document &#124; Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur23/001/2004/en/|accessdate=28 January 2017|publisher=Amnesty.org}}</ref> This does not however mean, that it is limited to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities, which due to a prevalent anti-non-foreigner sentiment in German mainstream media/government may be under-reported.

*'''2 June 1967''': [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot and killed by a policeman during a demonstration against the state visit of the Shah of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].
*'''28 May 1999''': Sudanese national Aamir Ageeb died of asphyxia during his forced deportation from Frankfurt. Prior to departure, Ageeb was forcibly restrained by tape and rope. During take-off, police officers allegedly forced his head and upper body between his knees.<ref name="ReferenceC" />
*'''8 December 2000''': Josef Hoss was accused by his neighbour (a police officer) of harbouring firearms; he was ambushed, beaten, and handcuffed near his home. He woke up in the police station with a cloth bag over his head and sustained multiple injuries that prevented him from working or being able to financially support his family. No firearms were found during the investigation.<ref name="ReferenceC" />
*'''May 2002''': Stephan Neisius was repeatedly kicked and hit by a group of police officers while he was handcuffed on the floor of a police station. He spent 13 days in hospital on life support before dying. Although the Cologne District Court convicted all six police officers of bodily harm resulting in death, none of the accused served prison sentences.<ref name="ReferenceC" />
*'''2012''': Teresa Z. called the police after a fight with her boyfriend got out of hand but was quickly arrested. She was punched by police officer Frank W. and received a broken nose and eye socket while in detention. Frank W. spent ten months in jail and was forced to pay a fine of 3,000 euros.<ref name="dw.com" />

As law enforcement is vested solely with the states of Germany, each state's police force (or "Land" police) follows a different system of law. Accordingly, there is an absence of a federal comprehensive register, compiling and publishing regular, uniform, and comprehensive figures on complaints about police ill-treatment.<ref name="ReferenceC" /> Even though Germany is bound to obligate its many international treaties and conventions, Amnesty International (2002) highlights the authorities failed to protect a range of human rights as guaranteed by international human rights law and standards.<ref name="ReferenceC" />
A study conducted in 2019 on police brutality in Germany found that it led to complaints in only 9%, and to trials in only 13% of the cases. The study was conducted by the Ruhr-University of Bochum and was the biggest study at the time to be conducted on police brutality in Germany. The study found that the low number of complaints was likely due to a low expectation of success.<ref>{{cite web|date=17 September 2019 |title=Polizeiliche Gewaltanwendungen aus Sicht der Betroffenen |url=https://kviapol.rub.de/images/pdf/KviAPol_Zwischenbericht.pdf |access-date=20 May 2020 |publisher=Körperverletzung im Amt durch Polizeibeamt*innen |pages=68–69}}</ref> Furthermore, most German states do not require their police force to carry identification, making it difficult for victims to lodge complaints against individuals.<ref>{{cite web |last=Plarre|first=Plutonia |date=19 April 2017 |title=Berliner Polizisten: Individuum zu sein ist keine Nachteil |url=https://taz.de/!5398584/ |via=taz.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Reuter|first=Markus |date=17 September 2019 |title=Nie Täter, immer Opfer: Die Polizei muss endlich lernen, mit Kritik umzugehen |url=https://netzpolitik.org/2019/nie-taeter-immer-opfer-die-polizei-muss-endlich-lernen-mit-kritik-umzugehen/}}</ref>

==== Greece ====
The Greek Police, known officially as the [[Hellenic Police]], assumed their current structure in 1984 as a result of merging the Gendarmerie (Chorofylaki) and the Urban Police Forces (Astynomia Poleon).<ref>{{cite web|title=Greece / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Greece|access-date=22 July 2016|website=www.interpol.int}}</ref> Composed of central and regional departments, the Hellenic Police have a relatively long history of police brutality. One of the first documented incidents dates back to 1976, where 16-year-old activist Sideris Isidoropoulos was killed by police while he put up campaign posters on a public building. In 1980, 20-year-old protester Stamatina Kanelopoulou died at the hands of the Greek police. He was beaten to death by police officers during a demonstration commemorating the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]]. The protests still occur to this day for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising. The protests are still commonly affected police brutality around the time of the event.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk">{{cite web|date=7 February 2013|title=Growing Police Brutality in Greece: The Hidden Face of the Crisis|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fragkiska-megaloudi/growing-police-brutality-in-greece_b_2636529.html|access-date=22 July 2016|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===== Increase =====
The level and severity of police brutality in Greece over the last few years have been profound. Due to the recent financial crisis, many austerity measures have been enforced, resulting in many individuals and families struggling to survive. Greek citizens opposed these austerity measures from the beginning and showed their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has significantly increased, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by the police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" />

In 2013 Greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be bank robbery suspects following their arrest. It was claimed that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. The media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, though the police's press release showed digitally manipulated photos of the four without injuries. The Greek minister of citizen protection{{emdash}}Nikos Dendias{{emdash}}supported the police and claimed that they needed to use Photoshop to ensure the suspects were recognisable.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" /> In October 2012, 15 anti-fascist protesters were arrested in Athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party "Golden Dawn". Victims claimed they were tortured while being held at the Attica General Police Directorate and stated that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters, and kept them awake with flashlights and lasers. Dendias countered by accusing the British newspaper that published the details of these crimes of libel. It was proven by forensic examination that the torture had in fact taken place. The two Greek journalists who commented on the Guardian report the next day were fired.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" />

===== Recent instances =====
Police brutality in Greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report, there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, attacked journalists, and subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, which took place on 17 November 2014.<ref name="thetoc.gr">{{cite web|date=21 November 2014|title=Amnesty International condemns Greek police brutality {{!}}thetoc.gr|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/amnesty-international-condemns-greek-police-brutality|access-date=22 July 2016|language=en-US}}</ref> Allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of unprovoked brutal force towards journalists documenting the demonstration and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Police allegedly sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range – in one instance a 17-year-old girl with asthma had been treated in the hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they laughed.<ref name="thetoc.gr" />

Video footage confirmed that on 13 November 2014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of Athens Polytechnic. Media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings.<ref name="thetoc.gr" /> Amnesty International called for action to prosecute those who were behind the assaults, stating that within the Greek police there is a culture of "abuse and impunity" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the root of the problem.<ref name="thetoc.gr" />

A German exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, stating his only reason for being there was that he was eating with other students. The student gave a horrifying description of the violence he endured and cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claimed that upon spotting him, about six police officers began assaulting him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police.<ref name="thetoc.gr" /> The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely injured individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.<ref name="thetoc.gr" />

====Examples====
*'''May 2011''': student Yannis Kafkas suffered an almost fatal head injury after a police officer hit him with a fire extinguisher. Kafkas spent 20 days in intensive care.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" />
*'''June 2011''': Manolis Kipraios, journalist, was covering protests against austerity measures when a member of the riot police fired a stun grenade at him and caused him to suffer from permanent hearing loss.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" />
*'''February 2012''': photojournalist Marios Lolos had to have surgery done after being beaten in the head by police at a protest. The day before this attack another journalist Rena Maniou was allegedly severely beaten by security forces. Dimitris Trimis, the head of The Greek Journalist Association (ESEA) broke his arm after he was violently pushed and kicked by police.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" />

There have been instances where protesters were used as human shields – a photo of a female protester in handcuffs ahead of policeman as people threw rocks at the police has gained considerable media attention.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" />

None of the cases of police brutality above resulted in any prosecution of police force members. One case that sparked nationwide riots was the death of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer in December 2008 during demonstrations in Athens. Unlike other cases, the police officer responsible was convicted of murder.<ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk" />

==== Hungary ====
{{Main|2006 protests in Hungary}}
In 2008 when Hungary's two law enforcement bodies, the police ([[Rendőrség]]) and the [[Border guard|Border Guards]] merged when the nation signed the [[Schengen Agreement]]; Border Guards became police officers. The police force in Hungary consists of the National Bureau of Investigation and the Operational Police, who respectively deal with investigating severe crimes and riot suppression. A third police group, Terrorelhárítási Központ, who deals mainly with counter-terrorism nationwide, also exists. 44,923 employees make up the Rendőrség force in Hungary. Brutality and corruption exist within Rendőrség.<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|title=Hungary: Police corruption, including complaints mechanisms available to report instances of corruption; police effectiveness, including response to complaints submitted by Roma (2013-June 2015)|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/55bf50df4.html|accessdate=28 January 2017|publisher=Refworld}}</ref>

The 1998 Human Rights Watch World Report revealed that the Roma minority in Hungary were continually discriminated against.<ref>{{cite web|title=HRW World Report 1999: Hungary:Human Rights Developments|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/worldreport99/europe/hungary.html|accessdate=28 January 2017|publisher=Hrw.org}}</ref> It was evident in the police force, with reports of police mistreatment and brutality.

The 2006 protests in response to Prime minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s speech where he said that the Socialist Party lied their way into office demonstrated the disproportionate measures police took particularly police brutality on non-violent civilians. Police threw gas grenades and used rubber bullets to shoot protesters. Protestors and non-violent civilians passing by were targeted, tackled, and injured by the police. Police broke the fingers of a handcuffed man and raided restaurants and bars to find radical demonstrators. Police brutality ranged from offensive language to physically attacking protesters. Reports show that brutality extended to bypassers, tourists, news reporters and paramedics.

===== Prevention =====
Hungarian Spectrum blogger Eva S. Bologh suggest that rather than acting reactively, Hungary should work to improve their police training programs and work to provide ongoing training and assessments to ensure that police officers in the Rendőrség, are competent and fair in their ethical judgements when it comes to the proportionality of a crime or situation and the use of force. The requirements to become a police officer in Hungary are to graduate from high school, pass a matriculation exam, and complete two years in the police academy.<ref name="hungarianspectrum.org">{{cite web|date=March 2009|title=The Hungarian police force – Hungarian Spectrum|url=http://hungarianspectrum.org/2009/03/01/the-hungarian-police-force/|accessdate=28 January 2017|publisher=Hungarianspectrum.org}}</ref> Compared to other countries around the world, the two-year program is shorter than Denmark's (3-year program), and longer than Australia's (33-week program) and the United States' (18 weeks).<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Role &#124; Police Members &#124; Victoria Police|url=http://www.policecareer.vic.gov.au/police/about-the-role/becoming-a-police-officer|accessdate=28 January 2017|publisher=Policecareer.vic.gov.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=18 March 2008|title=Police recruit training and academy summary|url=http://discoverpolicing.org/what_does_take/?fa=training_academy_life|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Discover Policing}}</ref> The current two-year program is quite lengthy, however time is not the issue. Most of what the Hungarian police academy teaches is academic theory and not much on practice.<ref name="hungarianspectrum.org" /> If practical work was given more attention in the Hungarian police academy, it is likely that the number of police brutality incidents will decrease.

==== Ireland ====
===== Northern Ireland (UK) =====
Police brutality has been a long-standing issue in Northern Ireland due to unsavoury police procedures used during [[the Troubles]] to obtain admissions of guilt. The Troubles in Northern Ireland lasted from 1968 until 2007, and were essentially a civil war between those who wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom (unionists/loyalists, predominantly Protestants) and those who did not (Irish nationalists/republicans, predominantly Catholics). During this time as many as 50,000 people were physically maimed or injured, some by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI, previously called Royal Ulster Constabulary).<ref>{{cite web|title=History - The Troubles|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/troubles|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Instances of Northern Irish Police brutality were confirmed by the 1978 report from the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which concluded that five interrogation techniques used by the police, which included wall standing, deprivation of food, drink or sleep, subjection to noise and forcing detainees to remain in the same position for hours, were instances of [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and degrading treatment]].<ref>{{cite web|date=12 September 2013|title=Document &#124; Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/EUR45/004/2013/en/|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Amnesty International}}</ref> Such brutality was not recognized by domestic courts until 2010, where 113 people, some of them minors, came forward to have their complaints heard.

At present Northern Ireland still faces policing issues, though not to the extent during the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police against children aged 14–18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which has led to a deep level of mistrust between the youth and the police.<ref>{{cite web|date=2003|title=Young people|url=http://conflictresearch.org.uk/reports/policing/NIPB-PONI-Young-People-April-2003.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2019|publisher=conflictresearch.org}}</ref> Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion.<ref>McVeigh, Robbie

===== Republic of Ireland =====
The Republic of Ireland's police force is called the [[Garda Síochána]] (Garda) and employs around 14,500 staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us - An Garda Síochána - Ireland's National Police Service|url=http://garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=5416|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=An Garda Síochána}}</ref> Ireland's criminal laws allow "reasonable force" to be used by the police with regard to all the circumstances, which eludes to officers actions being proportionate in the circumstances. Excessive use of force is unlawful, though section 76(7) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 allows the following considerations when deciding on what force is reasonable.
A person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh up the exact necessary action at the time or may act instinctively but honestly – in these instances, the use of force may be considered reasonable.<ref>{{cite web|date=23 October 2013|title=Police use of force|url=https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/public-order/core-principles-and-legislation/police-use-of-force/#the-criminal-law-act-1967-the-police-and-criminal-evidence-act-1984-common-law-and-the-criminal-justice-and-immigration-act-2008|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=College of Policing}}</ref>

This is acknowledged by the Garda, who state: "Unfortunately, even in the most civilised democratic jurisdictions, tragedies resulting from police use of force will continue to devastate families and communities".<ref>{{cite web|title=Incident info|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/GInspBarricadeIncidents.pdf/Files/GInspBarricadeIncidents.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2019|publisher=justice.ie}}</ref>

The use of force by Irish Police officers has been of international concern, when the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture reported on this issue in the Republic three times within a decade. Incidents that prompted this concern centred around the death of John Carty, a man suffering from mental illness who was shot and killed by police; the prosecution of seven Garda police members due to assaults on protesters in 2002 and in 2005; and a fifteen-year-old boy who died after spending time in Garda custody. Given this state of events, the Garda engaged independent Human Rights experts to conduct a review of the force who found numerous deficiencies. The government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. These include a new complaints procedure available against the Garda (Ombudsman Commission), disciplinary procedures and whistle-blowing protections.<ref>Conway, V & Walshe, D  'Current Developments in Police Governance and Accountability in Ireland [[Crime, Law and Social Change]], Published online, 9 February 2011.</ref>

==== Italy ====
The use of violence by police officers has been a major concern in Italy during the 2000s. Beatings and violence were used during demonstrations, and several murders were carried out during the 2000s.
The following incidents caused concern in the country:
*On 11 July 2001, 23-year-old student [[Death of Carlo Giuliani|Carlo Giuliani]] was killed by police officers when they opened fire on a group of protesters during the [[27th G8 summit#Protests|anti-globalization demonstration outside the July 2001 G8 summit]]. 25-year-old police officer Mario Placanica was considered to be responsible for Giuliani's death but was not charged. Placanica asserted that he was being used as a scapegoat to cover up for the responsible parties and that other officers caused Giuliani's death, shooting at Giuliani from a nearby location. Nobody was arrested for Giuliani's murder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2019/07/19/g8-di-genova-quello-che-lo-stato-non-dice-neppure-18-anni-dopo/5336982/|title=Blog &#124; G8 di Genova, quello che lo Stato non dice.

*On 11 July 2003, Marcello Lonzi, aged 29, was beaten and tortured to death in his cell. Lonzi was arrested in the city of [[Livorno]] four months prior, as he was suspected of carrying out an attempted theft. Although his death was considered to be caused by "a heart attack after a fall", signs of torture were found on his body. Nobody was arrested for Lonzi's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/mio-figlio-come-cucchi-morto-in-carcere-per-un-pestaggio-voglio-giustizia/|title=Mio figlio come Cucchi: morto in carcere per un pestaggio, voglio giustizia|website=Fanpage}}</ref>
*On 25 September 2005 in [[Ferrara]], at around 5 a.m., a woman called police claiming that she saw "a strange man walking around". The man, 18-year-old Federico Aldrovandi, who had spent the night in [[Bologna]] before returning to Ferrara, was stopped by four policemen. The four officers then began to beat and torture Aldrovandi, killing him at the scene. The officers were arrested and sentenced to three years and six months in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reti-invisibili.net/aldrovandi/|title=Federico Aldrovandi|website=www.reti-invisibili.net}}</ref>
*On 27 October 2007 in [[Trieste]], 34-year-old [[schizophrenic]] man Riccardo Rasman was launching firecrackers to celebrate his recent employment as a waste collector. Police was called by a resident as he heard suspected shots (which were the firecrackers' noise). Four police officers stormed the house, beating Rasman. The man was hit with iron objects and gagged. The officer pressed their knee on his neck and back, causing Rasman to die of [[asphyxia]]. The four officers were sentenced to just six months of prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimeblog.it/post/978/riccardo-rasman-ucciso-da-4-poliziotti-dopo-due-anni-il-processo|title=Riccardo Rasman: ucciso da 4 poliziotti, dopo due anni il processo|date=5 July 2008|website=Crimeblog.it}}</ref>
*On 14 October 2007 in [[Pietralunga]], 44-year-old carpenter Aldo Bianzino and his wife, Roberta Radici, were arrested for a handful of marijuana plants at their home. Bianzino stated that the plants were for personal use. When the couple arrived at a police station, they were separated. Two days later, an officer approached Radici in her cell and asked her if her husband has heart problems. Radici responded that Aldo never had health issues and was in good condition, and demanded to know why officer had asked her the question. The officer responded that Aldo Bianzino had been brought to the hospital in serious condition. Three hours later, Radici was freed from her cell and inquired as to when she could see Aldo. The officer callously responded: "after the autopsy." During Bianzino's autopsy, several signs of violence emerged, including broken ribs, damage to the liver and spleen, and several bruises. A policeman was sentenced in 2015 to a year in prison for lack of assistance. Roberta Ricci died of cancer in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/vittime-del-carcere-quando-aldo-bianzino-moriva-in-cella-con-il-fegato-spappolato/|title=Aldo Bianzino, arrestato per qualche piantina di cannabis e tornato a casa in una bara|website=Fanpage}}</ref>
*On 11 November 2007 near [[Arezzo]], a group of five friends, including 27-year-old Gabriele Sandri, were in a car headed to a football match between [[Inter Milan|Inter]] and [[S.S. Lazio]]. The five men, supporters of S.S. Lazio, were stopped by a car of [[Juventus]] supporters, and a fight erupted. Policeman Luigi Spaccarotella intervened and opened fire, killing Gabriele Sandri with a single gunshot wound to his neck.

*On 14 June 2008 in [[Varese]], Giuseppe Uva was stopped along with his friend Alberto Bigigoggero by two police officers, who demanded to see the two men's documents. Uva refused, angrily kicking at the door of a nearby house. Other police officers arrived at the scene and arrested Uva and Bigigoggero. Uva died the next morning. Signs of violence were on Uva's body, and Bigigoggero confirmed that Uva had been tortured. Attorney general Massimo Gaballo asked for ten years of imprisonment for each of the eight officers involved in Uva's death. However, none of the officers were charged. Uva's sister insisted that her brother was murdered, receiving support from [[Luigi Manconi]], who promised to fight for the truth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tg24.sky.it/cronaca/2019/07/08/morte-giuseppe-uva-cassazione-conferma-assoluzioni|title=Morte Uva, Cassazione conferma assoluzione poliziotti e carabinieri|first=Sky|last=TG24|website=tg24.sky.it}}</ref>
*On 15 October 2009 in [[Rome]], 31-year-old Stefano Cucchi was stopped by five policemen after they had seen him selling transparent packaging to a man in exchange for money. Cucchi was arrested and brought to a police station, where officers found cocaine and hashish in his pocket, along with medicine for [[epilepsy]], as Cucchi was affected by the disease. Cucchi was described by officers as "a homeless foreigner", but he was in fact an Italian who resided regularly at a home in Rome. Cucchi was beaten before his trial, which led him to walk with fatigue and with evident punch-inflicted injuries to his eyes. A week later, his condition worsened, as he continued to be tortured in custody, resulting in several fractures and a stay in the hospital. Cucchi died at the hospital on 22 October. Stefano's sister Ilaria became an activist since her brother's death, bringing national attention to the case and continuing to fight for justice. In 2019, two officers, Alessio di Bernardo and Raffaele d’Alessandro were sentenced to twelve years in jail for manslaughter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/italian-police-officers-jailed-12-years-2009-custody-death|title=Italian police officers jailed for 12 years over 2009 custody death|first=Lorenzo|last=Tondo|date=14 November 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>
*On 22 July 2020 in [[Piacenza]], seven [[Carabinieri]] were arrested after being accused of drug trafficking, receiving stolen goods, extortion, illegal arrest, torture, grievous bodily harm, embezzlement, abuse of office, and fraud.

==== Latvia ====
[[Latvia]] became an independent republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted [[Russian Empire|Russian Tsarist administration]]. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the [[State Police (Latvia)|Latvian police]] were underfunded and under-resourced. The [[Aizsargi|National Militia]] was created in response, consisting of a group of volunteers to protect public order.<ref>Melnis, E, Garonskis, A & Matvejevs, A 2006, 'Development of the Policing in Latvia', ''Jurisprudencija''</ref> Policing during this period was quite successful and was assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.

From 1940 to 1991, [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union]], and all previous regulations and practices were overruled by the Communist regime, which brought in the Soviet [[militsiya]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Melnis|first1=E|last2=Garonskis|first2=A|last3=Matvejevs|first3=A|year=2006|title=Development of the Policing in Latvia|journal=Jurisprudencija|volume=1|issue=79|pages=72–84}}</ref> Due to Soviet ideals on policing that considered criminals to be the enemy, a high level of institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. More significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on Marxist ideologies. During this time, an imbalance existed between police actions and citizens' rights. Despite the lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue, as illustrated by the case where the former nominal head of the militsiya (in practice - the secret police of [[Committee for State Security of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|the KGB of the Latvian SSR]]) [[Alfons Noviks]] was sentenced to life imprisonment in this time period for genocide against the Latvian people.<ref>Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 190.</ref>

In 1991, the independence of the state of Latvia was restored, which saw another change in the police system with the implementation of the ''Law on Police'' on 5 June. This restructured the police into State, Security, and Local Government levels. The ''Law on Police'' reiterated ethical requirements, where police officers were prohibited from performing or supporting acts relating to "torture or other cruel, inhuman or demeaning treatment or punishment". However, despite these reforms, issues regarding police brutality arose among the Russian population living in Latvia; in 1998, police forces were accused of dispersing a rally of predominately Russian pensioners through the use of excessive force and brutality.<ref>Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 192.</ref> This hostility towards Russians remained in the following years, and despite lack of official statistics, police brutality continued to be an issue after Latvia's independence.

In 2005, the [[Latvian Centre for Human Rights|Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies]] (LCHRES) found some instances of brutality and "severe abuse" within police authorities, especially on persons in custody.<ref>{{cite web|title=Latvia|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm|access-date=15 August 2019|website=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> Reports showed high levels of corruption within Latvian law enforcement authorities, with 42 members convicted of corruption offences between 2003 and 2004.<ref name="autogenerated2006">U.S Department of State: Diplomacy in Action, 2006, Latvia, accessed 19 July 2016 <nowiki>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm United States Department of State]</nowiki>.</ref> For the Latvian community, this meant that should an incident of police brutality occur, they may not have an independent body to report to nor is it guaranteed to be handled impartially without corruption.

Reports from Latvian prisons illustrate cases where police batons were used to inflict serious harm to inmates, including causing broken ribs, which often were not medically assessed for up to two days. To address levels of police brutality, LCHRES conducted a study where it set up an anonymous hotline.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Torture {{!}} Latvian Centre for Human Rights|url=http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/en/projects/prevention-of-torture/|access-date=15 August 2019|website=cilvektiesibas.org.lv}}</ref> During this four-day study, LCHRES received almost 300 calls and written complaints regarding police brutality and misconduct. This identifies fundamental flaws in the Latvian police authorities.

Since joining the [[European Union]] in 2004, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has assessed the Latvian criminal justice system a number of times. While the CPT gives appropriate authorities recommendations for improvements such as a review board for ill-treatment, they found that in 2011, Latvian authorities did not enact any of their 2007 recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Latvia should address ill-treatment by police and improve detention conditions|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/news-2013/-/asset_publisher/TEHtOeUO1Ozc/content/latvia-should-address-ill-treatment-by-police-and-improve-detention-conditions|access-date=15 August 2019|website=www.coe.int|language=en-GB}}</ref> Their 2011 report outlined some cases of police brutality within the prison system, with allegations such as punching, kicking and a few cases of misuse of police batons and excessively tight handcuffing. This was alleged to occur mostly while being apprehended or at the police station (including during questioning).

Despite the flaws within the Latvian Police system, CPT has found that the number of allegations for poor treatment is decreasing over the years. The Latvian Police force operates under the Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel, which states "a police officer shall use force, special facilities or weapon only in the cases stipulated by due course of law and to attain a legal aim. The use of spontaneous or ill-intentioned force, special facilities or weapon shall not be justified.",<ref>{{cite web|title=Valsts policija -|url=http://www.vp.gov.lv/?id=205&said=205&r=1|access-date=15 August 2019|website=www.vp.gov.lv}}</ref> recognising that the authorities are conscious of police brutality, and given more time, it is likely that the figures will continue to decrease.

==== Luxembourg ====
The Luxembourg Police force has 1,603 officers and is known as the "Grand Ducal Police". The Grand Ducal Police is the primary law enforcement agency in Luxembourg and has been operating since 1 January 2000, when the Grand Ducal Gendarmerie (previous Luxembourg military) merged with the police force.<ref>{{cite web|date=1 January 1958|title=Luxembourg &#124; Partners & Agreements &#124; Member States &#124; Europol|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/memberpage/luxembourg-779|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Europol}}</ref> Due to Luxembourg's relatively small population of approximately 500,000 people the Grand Ducal Police are in charge of several duties that are often separated by jurisdictions such as Border Control and Internal Military operations.<ref name="police.public.lu">{{cite web|date=22 April 2016|title=L'inspecteur de police - Portail de la Police Grand-Ducale - 1000 métiers en 1|url=http://www.police.public.lu/fr/police-se-presente/1000-metiers/inspecteur/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110204044/http://www.police.public.lu/fr/police-se-presente/1000-metiers/inspecteur/index.html|archive-date=10 January 2017|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Luxembourg police}}</ref>

Police brutality is not perceived to be a serious threat to society in Luxembourg. The European Union's 2014 Anti-Corruption report placed Luxembourg, along with Denmark and Finland, as having the lowest incidents of reported police brutality within the European Union.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-86_en.htm|title=Commission unveils first EU Anti-Corruption Report|publisher=European Commission|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> Due to many positive characteristics of their society, such as freedom of media, the encouragement of public participation in the legal system and transparency mechanisms, the public also have a deep trust in the Grand Ducal police force.

Laws in Luxembourg specifically distinguish between coercion and force in the 1973 Act on Regulating the Use of Force.<ref name="books.google.it">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGbNgL-m20AC|title=Schengen Investigated: A Comparative Interpretation of the Schengen ... - Chantal Joubert, Hans Bevers|date=3 June 1996|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-9041102669|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. However, this Act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers such as the use of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, reasonability, and measure in order to use force.<ref name="books.google.it" /> To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality, numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (the term used for a common officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station.<ref name="police.public.lu" /> By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training.<ref>{{cite web|date=25 May 2005|title=Victoria Police - Delivering a Safer Victoria|url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409041623/http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=2|archive-date=9 April 2013|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Victoria Police (Australia)}}</ref> The 2015 Human Right Report on Government practices by the United States indicated no cases of police brutality in Luxembourg, suggesting that the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.

Although police brutality is almost nonexistent in Luxembourg, there are effective procedures in place for the investigation and punishment of any potential misconduct by the Grand Ducal Police.

==== Malta ====
Malta's Police Force (MPF) is one of the oldest in Europe, with the Maltese government taking over the force in 1921 following the grant of self-governance. There are approximately 1,900 members in the Force.<ref>{{cite web|title=Malta police force|url=https://www.gov.mt/en/Services-And-Information/Business-Areas/Law%20Enforcement/Pages/Malta-Police-Force.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703125311/http://gov.mt/en/Services-And-Information/Business-Areas/Law%20Enforcement/Pages/Malta-Police-Force.aspx|archive-date=3 July 2016}}</ref>

Under the Police Act of 1961, Part V deals with the use of force, where"police officers may use such moderate and proportionate force as may be necessary [...]" (Article 96);<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Chapter 164|url=http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&itemid=8686}}</ref> however, according to Article 100, "It shall be considered as an offence against discipline if a police officer uses force for considerations extraneous to those permitted by law and the circumstances of the case".<ref name=":0" /> As such, Malta recognizes the illegality of police brutality and can prosecute offending officials on these grounds.

Malta is expected to abide by the 2001 European Code of Ethics as a member of the [[European Union]], where "the police may use force only when strictly necessary and only to the extent required to obtain a legitimate objective."<ref>{{cite web|title=Council of Europe|url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805e297e}}</ref>

Similarly, the Council of Europe (of which Malta is a member) follows the five principles developed by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], where definition 16 states that police officers "may use reasonable force when lawfully exercising powers".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hammarberg|first=Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights, Mandate 2006–2012, Thomas|title=Commissioner for Human Rights – Opinion of the Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, concerning independent and effective determination of complaints against the police|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&id=1417857&Site=COE&BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&BackColorIntranet=FDC864&BackColorLogged=FDC864&direct=true|access-date=18 July 2016|website=wcd.coe.int}}</ref>

In 2008, Lawrence Gonzi (The Minister for Justice and Home Affairs) called upon Martin Scicluna, a former civil servant and currently an expert on security issues at the Prime Minister's Office, to conduct an independent inquiry into 24 March 2008 police brutality incident. The inquiry required the investigation of "allegations of beatings carried out on detainees at Safi Detention Centre by members of the Detention Service on 24 March 2008 and to make any recommendations necessary in the light of [his] findings".<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=Report to the Maltese Government on the visit to Malta carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT)|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/mlt/2011-05-inf-eng.pdf}}</ref> Following the results of the inquiry of Mr. Scicluna, made public by the [[Government of Malta|Maltese Government]], it was concluded that "excessive force was used by Detention Service Personnel".<ref name=":1" />

Scicluna made recommendations that "appropriate [action] should be taken to reprimand the Detention Service officers involved in this operation and the relevant Senior NCOs for the acts of 25 excessive force used by some personnel in their charge".<ref name=":1" /> Simultaneously, Home Affairs Minister Carm Mifsud Bonnici said "95 percent of the members of the police force were doing their duties, but the remainder needed to be addressed",<ref>{{cite web|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|title=Police violence will not be tolerated – minister|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080706/local/cmb.215356|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> which led to the establishment of the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) to "maintain and safeguard the integrity of the Malta Police Force through an internal system of investigation that is objective, fair, equitable, impartial and just",<ref>{{cite web|title=Malta Police Force Portal|url=http://www.pulizija.gov.mt/en-us/internalaffairs.aspx|access-date=18 July 2016|website=www.pulizija.gov.mt}}</ref> where complaints or allegations on the use of force can be monitored and responded to.

Although Malta has attempted to tackle the police brutality through the implementation of independent systems such as the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU), the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] 2010 report on Malta's human rights found that "authorities detained irregular immigrants under harsh conditions for up to 18 months during the review of their protected status."<ref>{{cite web|title=Malta|url=http://m.state.gov/md154438.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719085153/http://m.state.gov/md154438.htm|archive-date=19 July 2016|access-date=18 July 2016|website=m.state.gov}}</ref> In addition, the 2013 [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] report found that although there were no government reports on the use of brutality in detention centers, on 2 December 2013 media reported the sentencing of two former prison guards to five years in prison and another two guards to three months in prison after finding them guilty of beating an escaped prisoner in 2008, illustrating the gradual development of the IAU in limiting the use of police brutality.<ref>{{cite web|title=MALTA 2013 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/220518.pdf}}</ref>

After the IAU was implemented, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|Human Rights Committee]] has raised questions on the use of force by state officials with respect to the countering of detention center riots, where police were accused of punching and striking detainees. An inquiry was consequently conducted in 2011 and 2012 following riots, resulting in criminal proceedings against the law enforcement officials responsible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Rights Committee considers report of Malta|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15167&LangID=E|access-date=18 July 2016|website=www.ohchr.org}}</ref> In addition, Giacomo Santini and Tina Acketoft (The Chairs of the Migration and Equality Committees of the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]]) expressed "grave concern at an increasing number of incidents of state violence against migrants and refugees". They called upon Maltese authorities to conduct a rapid investigation emphasising the need to forbid violence against migrants and refugees, whether by state parties or by individuals.<ref>{{cite web|title=PACE: News|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=4044&lang=2|access-date=22 July 2016|website=assembly.coe.int}}</ref>

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], in relation to the conditions of migrants in detention, recommended that the "State party take appropriate measures to improve detention conditions and refrain from resorting to excessive use of force to counter riots by immigrants in detention centers, and also to avoid such riot".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/A.66.18.pdf}}</ref>

The Malta Police Force issued a statement detailing what had happened, in which it claimed that Mr. Calleja acted aggressively, refused to take a breathalyser test, ignored police orders, and used foul language.

He was subsequently arrested and taken to a police squad car, but according to the police statement, he kicked the driver, tried to escape and banged his head repeatedly against the car window. The police added that he even spit blood at police officers and bit a constable's arm, tearing off part of his skin.

When asked to state his client's plea, Dr. Abela declared "absolutely not guilty," before accusing the police of grossly distorting the truth.

Mr. Calleja's nose was bandaged, and Dr. Abela presented a medical certificate showing that it had been broken as evidence.

The Netherlands is signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]<ref name="rightsinfo.org">{{cite web|date=19 April 2015|title=What Is The European Convention on Human Rights?|url=https://rightsinfo.org/the-rights-in-the-european-convention/|access-date=15 August 2019|website=RightsInfo|language=en-GB}}</ref> detailing the limits and responsibilities of police powers, and as such demonstrates a public commitment to the restricted legal use of police powers. These powers include the use of reasonable force to enable the effective discharge of duties, with the stipulation force be used proportionately and only as a last resort<ref name="rightsinfo.org" />

The police force of the Netherlands is divided into 25 regional forces and one central force. A Regional Police Board, made up of local mayors and the chief public prosecutor, heads each regional force, with a chief officer placed in charge of police operations. Police accountability procedures include mandatory reporting of any on-duty incident that requires the use of force. The Rijksrecherche is the national agency responsible for the investigation of serious breaches of police conduct resulting in death or injury. In 2007 the Rijksrecherche conducted 67 inquiries related to police officers, 21 of which were related to shootings.<ref>Lamboo, T 2010, "Police Misconduct: accountability of internal investigations" ''International Journal of Public Sector management,'' vol. 23, iss. 7, pp. 613-631.</ref>

While Dutch society has a history of support for liberal values, it has been subject to practicing racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. Van der Leun writes that suspicion and mistrust of some racial groups is evident and perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command.<ref name="Leun, J. P 2011">van der Leun, J.

A reflection on expanding preventative powers, ethnic profiling and a changing social and political context', ''Policing and Society'', Vol. 21, No. 4, December 2011.</ref> This trend in police behaviour has drawn comment from Amnesty International, where a 2015 report describes Dutch law enforcement officers as having a tendency to correlate suspicious criminal behaviour with specific ethnic characteristics, most notably those typical of persons of Moroccan heritage.<ref>Amnesty International 2015, 'Stop and Search Powers Pose Risk to Human Rights: Acknowledging and tackling ethnic profiling in the Netherlands', viewed online 19 July 2016 at {{cite web|title=Archived copy|url=https://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/amnesty_stopandsearchpowersposearisktohumanrights.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005115357/http://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/amnesty_stopandsearchpowersposearisktohumanrights.pdf|archive-date=5 October 2014|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Current political discourse in the Netherlands often supports the notion of inferiority of some cultures and is evidenced by the growth in support for far-right political ideologies in recent decades.<ref name="Leun, J.

A notable case in racial profiling and the use of police force occurred in June 2015 with the death of Aruban man Mitch Henriquez. Henriquez died of asphyxiation while in police custody after being suspected of carrying a firearm and being arrested at a music festival in [[The Hague]]. The first anniversary of his death in June 2019 provided a catalyst for protests against police brutality in The Hague, an area with a significant proportion of residents of non-European background. Eleven protesters were arrested for failing to comply with instructions from the Mayor to limit protest to certain areas of the city, which led some protesters to claim authorities were attempting to criminalize the right to peaceful protest. The five officers alleged to be involved in Hendriquez's death have been suspended but have yet to be charged.<ref>{{cite web|date=27 June 2016|title=Police chokehold death protesters blocked from Hague neighborhood|url=https://nltimes.nl/2016/06/27/police-chokehold-death-protesters-blocked-hague-neighborhood|access-date=15 August 2019|website=NL Times|language=en}}</ref>

===== History =====
A key factor influencing the levels of police brutality in [[Poland]] has been the move from a communist state to a democracy. Force was particularly used by the [[ZOMO]] squads, which were elite units of [[Citizens' Militia|Citizens' Militia (MO)]] during the [[Polish People's Republic]].<ref name="zomo-3">{{cite web|author=Michał Kępiński, pres.|date=2007|title=ZOMO|url=http://www.milicja.waw.pl/?zomo,3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141101/http://www.milicja.waw.pl/?zomo,3|archive-date=6 April 2015|accessdate=8 October 2013|work=Historia Milicji Obywatelskiej at Milicja.waw.pl|publisher=Fundacja Edukacji Historycznej}}</ref> As a result, the opposition branded ZOMO with the nickname "Communist [[Gestapo]]". It is argued that Poland's transition has resulted in a more transparent system, reducing levels of police brutality.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Krasnokutski|first=Shannon|date=2001|title=Human Rights in Transition: The success and Failure of Polish and Russian Criminal Justice Reform|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1469&context=jil|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal|volume=33|issue=1}}</ref> Although police brutality exists within Poland cases are much more likely to be handled by the criminal justice system with a greater chance for resolution through the courts.<ref name=":3" />

While there are still instances of police brutality, trust in the police has steadily increased in Poland from 62% to 75% between 2002 and 2008,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Tabitha|date=2009|title=The Distrust Paradox: Trust and Distrust in the Polish Online Press, Cross National Data Reports and Public Opinion Surveys 2002–2008|url=https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent/uuid:10615342-c372-4fd1-ac0f-71850ef328c2|journal=Thesis – University of North Carolina}}</ref> demonstrating the improvement in trust between the police and the general public.

Although there is a more open police force within Poland, many organizations still have issues against police brutality. The 2013 United States Department of State report on Poland raised several concerns of police brutality;<ref name=":2" /> The report cited a case of police officers using violence to acquire a confession for armed robbery in 2012,<ref name=":2" /> though it also noted that these police officers were eventually indicted for police brutality.<ref name=":2" />

===== Issues with sports fans =====
{{see also|2015 Knurów riots|1998 Słupsk street riots}}
In recent years one of the main sources of controversy concerning Polish police brutality has been the use of rubber bullets to disperse uncooperative crowds at sporting events.

In 1998, [[1998 Słupsk street riots|major riots]] occurred when a young basketball fan was killed by the police. In 2004, a man was killed and a woman injured in a riot when Polish police accidentally shot live ammunition instead of rubber bullets into the crowd after an association football game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Poland|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100578.htm}}</ref> [[2015 Knurów riots|Another set of riots]] occurred in 2015 in response to a [[pitch invasion]] during a football match.

===== Issues with Roma =====
The Polish police also have a history of police brutality within the [[Roma in Poland|Roma community]].<ref name=":5">{{cite web|title=OSCE Metting Statement on Roma in Poland|url=http://www.errc.org/article/osce-meeting-statement-on-roma-in-poland/285|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre}}</ref> There are multiple cases of police beatings and other discriminatory acts against the Roma by the police.<ref name=":5" /> The European Roma Rights Centre argues that investigations into police brutality cases are seldom carried out and that the police brutality against the Roma minority is systematic.<ref name=":5" />

One particular case of police brutality against the Romani people occurred in 1998 when the police took four Roma men to a field and beat them.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|title=Police Beat four Roma near Ciechocinek, Poland|url=http://www.errc.org/article/police-beat-four-roma-near-ciechocinek-poland/1558|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre}}</ref> The men that were beaten were hospitalised for broken bones and other injuries; they were charged with vulgar words and behavior in public.

==== Portugal ====
[[Portugal]] is ranked the fourth most heavily policed country in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Niall|date=24 November 2014|title=• Chart: The most heavily policed countries in the world|url=https://www.statista.com/chart/2987/the-most-heavily-policed-countries-in-the-world/|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Statista}}</ref> The police force is divided into five main organisations, with the [[Polícia de Segurança Pública]] (PSP) having the most prominent urban presence.<ref>{{cite web|date=20 October 1945|title=Police in Portugal|url=http://www.safecommunitiesportugal.com/police-in-portugal/|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Safe Communities Portugal}}</ref> The PSP has a diverse range of duties and responsibilities, which include protecting the rights of citizens and ensuring democratic legality.

The use of weapons by Portuguese police is permitted only when:

{{Quote|text=[...] absolutely necessary and when less dangerous means have proved ineffective, and provided that their use is proportionate to the circumstances.|author=Decreto-Lei No. 457/99 Art. 2(1) |source=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgdlisboa.pt/leis/lei_mostra_articulado.php?nid=1558&tabela=leis |title=::: DL n.º 457/99, de 05 de Novembro |publisher=Procuradoria-Geral Distrital de Lisboa |date= 1999-11-05|accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref> }}

This is restrictive on multiple counts; for example, police are not permitted to use their firearms when an offender is running away.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rodrigues|first1=Ezequiel|last2=Faria|first2=Paula|last3=Santos|first3=Agostinho|last4=Fraga|first4=Sílvia|year=2015|title=Police shootings against civilians in Portugal: Contextual, forensic medical and judicial characterization|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=33|pages=50–55|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2015.04.008|pmid=26048497|hdl-access=free|hdl=10216/114703}}</ref>

===== Football hooliganism =====
Portuguese police have adopted an aggressive position in combating football hooliganism. Despite their means being considered disproportionate, the police view the heavy-handed nature of their tactics as a necessary and successful approach towards protecting the community and maintaining social order.

In 2015, a viral video showed a Benfica fan being heavily beaten in front of his two children outside a football stadium. The footage, filmed by a local television station, showed Jose Magalhaes leaving the football match early with his children and elderly father before being confronted by police officers.<ref>{{cite news|date=19 May 2015|title=Portugal police filmed hitting football fan in front of children|newspaper=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32793901|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> Although the family appeared calm, Magalhaes was tackled to the ground by police and repeatedly hit with a metal baton, while his father was punched in the face twice.<ref>{{cite news|date=20 May 2015|title=Outrage in Portugal over police beating of man in front of his children |newspaper=The Guardian|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/outrage-in-portugal-over-police-beating-of-man-in-front-of-his-children|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> More police rushed to the scene to shield the children aged nine and thirteen.

A statement released by the PSP acknowledged the controversial incident and announced that an investigation was launched against the officer responsible for initiating the attack.<ref name="safecommunitiesportugal.com">{{cite web|title=Public Statement by PSP Police concerning football violence at Guimarães and Lisbon {{!}} Safe Communities Portugal|url=http://www.safecommunitiesportugal.com/public-statement-by-psp-police-concerning-football-violence-at-guimar%C3%A3es-and-lisbon/|access-date=15 August 2019|website=www.safecommunitiesportugal.com}}</ref> The officer was later suspended for 90 days by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Officer caught beating Benfica fan suspended for 90 days|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/officer-caught-beating-benfica-fan-suspended-for-90-days/35214|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=The Portugal News}}</ref>

The statement also defended policing the large crowds in the aftermath of the football match. Riot police had clashed with supporters the following day in Lisbon as fans celebrated Benfica's title victory. The harsh approach was described as sufficient, justified, and necessary to prevent social disorder from escalating.<ref name="safecommunitiesportugal.com" />

In a similar incident in 2016, another football club, Sporting Lisbon, complained about "barbaric" police assaults on their fans.<ref>{{cite web|date=19 May 2016|title=Sporting Lisbon complain of 'barbaric' assault by riot police on fans|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/sporting-cp/story/2876295/sporting-lisbon-complain-of-barbaric-assault-by-riot-police-on-fans|accessdate=29 January 2017|work=[[ESPN FC]]}}</ref>

===== Racism =====
{{Update|section|date=March 2020}}
There have been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality in Portugal.<ref name="bbc.comThey hate">{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=James|date=23 April 2015|title=They hate black people|newspaper=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32419952|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> In its 2015/2016 annual report on Portugal, Amnesty International condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portugal 2015/2016 &#124; Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/portugal/report-portugal/|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Amnesty International}}</ref>

Despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn between Portugal's colonial past and modern police racism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Andrew|date=29 May 1961|title=Portugal: A Determined Empire|journal=The World Today|volume=17|issue=3|pages=95–101|jstor=40394108}}</ref> According to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001; however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.<ref name="bbc.comThey hate" />

Racially-influenced police actions are illustrated by the violence in Cova de Moura, a low socio-economic area housing a significant migrant population. Notably, during an incident in February 2015, a young man named Bruno Lopes was aggressively searched and physically abused.<ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /> When bystanders protested the excessive force, police responded by firing shotguns loaded with rubber bullets at the witnesses.<ref name="bbc.comThey hate" />

On the same day, two human rights workers and five youth entered the [[Alfragide]] police station requesting information on Lopes' situation. Upon arrival, the group was allegedly attacked by police officers shouting racist slurs.<ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /> The policemen dragged and kept the young men in the police station, where they detained, mistreated, and mocked them for two days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reis|first1=Marta|title=Esquadra de Alfragide.

17 police officers from the Alfragide police station were eventually sent to trial on a variety of charges, including physical aggression, torture, document forging, and aggravated kidnapping.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Costa|first1=Cátia|title=Juíza leva a julgamento 17 dos 18 polícias acusados de agressões|url=https://www.sabado.pt/portugal/detalhe/juiza-leva-a-julgamento-17-dos-18-policias-acusados-de-agressoes?ref=DET_relacionadas_portugal|accessdate=1 November 2018|website=Sábado}}</ref><nowiki> {{Outdated}} As of October 2018, the trial is ongoing, with victims being heard in court.</nowiki><ref>{{cite web|last1=Henriques|first1=Joana|title=Os polícias davam socos, pontapés.

The [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI) has raised concerns about police mistreatment of minorities in Portugal in all of its reports on the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=ECRI - Country monitoring in Portugal|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/portugal|accessdate=1 November 2018|website=CoE}}</ref> In its fifth country report of 2018, ECRI mentions the Alfragide case in connection to the failure of IGAI ([[Inspeção-Geral da Admnisitração Interna|Inspeção-Geral da Administração Interna]]) or officers higher up in the chain of command to stop the abuses.<ref name="Council of Europe">{{cite book|url=https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-portugal/16808de7da|title=ECRI REPORT ON PORTUGAL (fifth monitoring cycle)|date=19 June 2018|publisher=Council of Europe|location=Strasbourg|page=26|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> IGAI is currently the body responsible for scrutinizing police activities in the country, but it is part of the Ministry of the Interior like the police forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apresentação|url=https://www.igai.pt/quem-somos/apresentacao|accessdate=1 November 2018|website=IGAI}}</ref> In its 2018 report, ECRI recommended that such work should be carried out by the country's [[Ombudsman]], an equality body, or by a new and (entirely) independent body that can be created for that purpose.<ref name="Council of Europe" />

Portuguese people of [[Romani people|Roma]] descent have also been victims of police harassment and brutality in the country. There are several examples publicized by the media: one case from 2007 involved a Roma man and his son. The two walked to the [[Nelas]] police station in [[Porto]] to get some information, but the police allegedly ended up abusing them. Two officers were convicted in 2011 for physically assaulting the father.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lusa|title=Dois agentes da PSP condenados por agressão a cigano|url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/norte/interior/dois-agentes-da-psp-condenados-por-agressao-a-cigano-1876502.html|accessdate=1 November 2018|website=Diário de Notícias}}</ref>

An example of police brutality occurred in 2012 is the night raid of a Roma camp site by the GNR ([[Guarda Nacional Republicana]]), in [[Cabanelas]], [[Vila Verde]]. Some of the people living in the camp, including children and women, were reportedly attacked by GNR officers. Six Roma that were detained in the operation allege that they were later tortured and humiliated in the GNR station of [[Amares]]; the GNR denied the accusations, while [[SOS Racismo]] promised to file a complaint against the force.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Silva|first1=Samuel|title=GNR acusada de "torturar" ciganos detidos numa rusga em Vila Verde|url=https://www.publico.pt/2012/09/27/local/noticia/gnr-acusada-de-torturar-ciganos-detidos-numa-rusga-em-vila-verde-1564830|accessdate=1 November 2018|website=Público}}</ref> A last remnant of overt institutional racism, in Portugal, is article 81 of GNR's regulation law, which provides for an increased policing of nomadic people, who in general are known to be mostly Roma; the regulation's constitutionality was unsuccessfully challenged in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mendes|first1=Maria|title=Identidades, Racismo e Discriminação: Ciganos da AML|date=2012|publisher=Caleidoscópio|isbn=978-989-658-160-2|location=Lisbon|pages=83, 84}}</ref>

==== Russia ====
Russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2012. More attention has been given to the frequency of police brutality shown on posted videos online. Then-president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] initiated reforms of the police force in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the Moscow police chief and centralising police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power among political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give [[due process]] to citizens. Proper investigations into police officials are still considered insufficient by Western standards.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cops for hire|work=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15731344}}</ref>

In 2012, Russia's top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. Human rights activists claim that Russian police use torture techniques to extract [[false confessions]] from detainees. Police regulations require officers to meet quotas for solved crimes, which encourages false arrests to meet their numbers.<ref>{{cite news|date=29 March 2012|title=Russian Police Charged With Torture in Deadly Rape, Death of Detainee|work=Huffington Post|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/russia-police-torture_n_1387421.html}}</ref>

==== Slovakia ====
Police brutality in Slovakia is systematic and widely documented, but is almost exclusively enacted on the Romani minority. The nation-state itself has particularly racist attitudes toward the Romani minority dating back to before the split of Czechoslovakia. It is widely known that the government practiced forced sterilisation of Romani women and the segregation of the Romani into walled-off settlements;<ref>{{cite news|date=20 October 2015|title=Slovakia Internationally Criticized For Forced Sterilisation, Police Impunity Against Roma|work=Romea|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/world/slovakia-internationally-criticized-for-forced-sterilization-police-impunity-for-brutality-against-roma-position-on-refugee}}</ref> these forms of discrimination has filtered down to the police force. Excessive use of force against the Romani minority by police has been publicly criticised by the United Nations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slovakia 2015/2016|work=Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/slovakia/report-slovakia/}}</ref> The police force has been repeatedly condemned by a number of organisations for lengthy pre-trial detention and its treatment of suspects in custody.<ref>Cox, T (2013) 'Reflections on 1989 in Eastern Europe'  p 227, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-317-98039-5}}</ref>

In 2001, a 51-year-old Romani man died as a result of abuse in police custody at the hands of the Mayor of Magnezitovce and his son who works as a police officer. The victim, Karol Sendrei, was allegedly chained to a radiator and fatally beaten after being forcefully removed from his home.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comparative Criminology|work=San Diego State University|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/slovakia.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415144947/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/slovakia.html|archive-date=15 April 2016}}</ref>
While the mayor's son was immediately removed from the police force and the mayor was suspended from his position, the latter was reinstated 4 months later. In response to this incident, the Minister for Internal Affairs attempted to establish new measures to prevent police brutality by including mandatory psychological testing for law enforcement and better training around the effective use of coercion. However, police brutality toward the Roma minority remains a serious issue.

Video footage shot by law enforcement officers in 2009 shows 6 Romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, and slap each other. It is alleged that the boys were then set upon by [[police dog]]s, with at least two sustaining serious injuries. Officers attempted to justify their behaviour on the grounds that the boys were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen; however, [[cruel]], [[inhuman or degrading treatment]] by police, regardless of whether a crime has been suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law.<ref>{{cite news|date=29 April 2016|title=Slovakia: Roma exclusion and the dark side of democracy|work=Open Democracy|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/bernard-rorke/slovakia-roma-exclusion-and-dark-side-of-democracy}}</ref> The 10 law enforcement officers involved have since been acquitted after the judge ruled the video inadmissible in court as it was obtained illegally. As the footage was the main piece of evidentiary support for the crime, without it a conviction could not be passed down.<ref>{{cite news|date=28 February 2016|title=Slovakia: Scandalous verdict acquits police of torturing Romani children|work=Romea|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/slovakia-scandalous-verdict-acquits-police-of-torturing-romani-children}}</ref>

Human rights watchdog organisations have raised concerns around police selectivity in making recordings of raids after a raid in the settlement of Vrbica in 2015; the police claimed to have not thought the settlement would be problematic; this raid involved 15 men being seriously injured.<ref>{{cite news|date=15 July 2015|title=Slovak ombud says police raid on Roma settlement was unnecessary|work=Romea|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/world/slovak-ombud-says-police-raid-on-roma-settlement-was-unnecessary}}</ref>

It is often the experience of the Roma in regards to pressing charges for police brutality, a counter charge is often threatened by law enforcement in an attempt to pressure the alleged victim into dropping the charges.

[[File:Demonstration in front of the headquarters of the Spanish National Police in Barcelona.png|thumb|[[2017 Catalan general strike]] against police brutality]]
Spanish police developed a global reputation for brutality after images of clashes between demonstrators and police were spread on social networks and international news in 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police Brutality Accusations as protests span Spain|url=https://www.rt.com/news/spain-valencia-protests-violence-931/|accessdate=22 June 2016|website=RT News}}</ref> Two notable demonstrations were the ones that occurred in Barcelona on 27 May 2011, and in Madrid on 25 September 2012.

In spite of public outrage, the Spanish government did not make any attempt to reform policing and police mistreatment of the public; the opposite happened instead: in July 2016, new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code were enforced which limited the right to freedom of assembly and gave police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a "lack of respect" towards them.<ref name="amnesty.org" /> The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability.<ref name="amnesty.org" /> Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 and as much as €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spain's New Public Safety Law Has Its Challengers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/europe/spains-new-public-safety-law-has-its-challengers.html?_r=1|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> Amnesty International identifies three main areas of concern about police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and inappropriate use of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and poor treatment of detainees in police custody.<ref name="amnesty.org" />

Amnesty International and ACODI (Acción Contra la Discriminación) have both called out Spain for racial profiling and ethnic discrimination.<ref name="https">{{cite web|title=Spain: Discrimination condoned by the authorities|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2011/12/spain-discrimination-condoned-authorities/|accessdate=22 June 2016|website=Amnesty International}}</ref><ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org">{{cite web|title=Case Watch: Challenging Police Abuse in Spain|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/case-watch-challenging-police-abuse-spain|accessdate=22 June 2016|website=Open Society Foundations}}</ref>
ACODI documented 612 cases of racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising that many of these did not lead to official complaints because victims feared police retaliation or believed their complaints would be ignored.<ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org" /> This belief is not unfounded; in 2005, Beauty Solomon, an African American immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against Spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault. In spite of eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the Spanish Courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence.<ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org" /> Solomon then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that Spain had violated Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention of Human Rights. They also condemned Spain for failing to investigate both Solomon's assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers.<ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Beauty Solomon vs. Spain, discrimination based on race, gender and social status|url=http://www2.womenslinkworldwide.org/wlw/new.php?modo=detalle_proyectos&dc=26&lang=en|accessdate=22 June 2016|website=Women's Link Worldwide}}</ref>

Under Spanish law the police have the right to check the identity of anyone in a public space when there is a security concern. however, African and Latin American immigrants are most frequently targeted, often without a legitimate security concern. "People who do not 'look Spanish' can be stopped by police as often as four times a day," said Izza Leghtas, an Amnesty International researcher.<ref name="https" />

==== Sweden ====
{{POV section|date=April 2020}}
Since the REVA (Legally Certain and Efficient Enforcement) project had been applied in Sweden in an attempt to deport illegal immigrants, it had exposed the brutal and illegal methods used by police. Officers have been shown to harass and racially profile non-white Swedes who often live in segregated suburbs. The marginalised such as the poor, homeless, people of colour, users of illicit drugs, and the mentally ill are facing Sweden as a Police State. This has resulted in social disobedience with ordinary people in Sweden updating others on Twitter and Facebook on the whereabouts of police.<ref name="counterpunch.org">{{cite web|title=Swedish police racism and resistance|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/19/Swedish-police-racism-and-resistance|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

===== Examples =====
In 2013 police shot a man in his own home in front of his wife in the town of {{Clarify|text=Husby|reason=Which Husby?|date=March 2020}}. The police alleged the man had been wielding a machete and threatening them with it. The Stockholm riots were set off after the Husby shooting, where more than 100 cars were torched. When the police showed up they had stones thrown at them. People said the police called them "monkeys" and used batons against them in the clash.<ref>{{cite news|date=22 May 2013|title=Riots grip Stockholm suburbs after police shooting – BBC News|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22622909|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

In another incident in 2013, an African-born Swede was refused entry into a local club in [[Malmö]] for wearing traditional African clothes. The police picked him up and in the process of his arrest broke his arm and locked him in a cell for nearly six hours with no medical aid. Socially excluded groups have been targeted and the result of police investigations often mean the police officers are not deemed to be at fault.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sweden punishes its rioters and its police very differently|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/27/sweden-punishes-rioters-police-stockholm-riots|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

==== United Kingdom ====
{{see also|#Northern Ireland (UK)}}
In 2015 the [[United Kingdom]] employed approximately 126,818 police officers in the 43 police forces of England, Wales and the [[British Transport Police]], the lowest number since March 2002.<ref name="gov.uk">{{cite web|title=Police workforce, England and Wales: 31 March 2015|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2015/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2015|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Home Office}}</ref>

===== Legislation and treaties =====
The 1967 Criminal Law Act, the 2008 Common Law and the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act, and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) set out the law and acceptable use of force in the UK. The use of unnecessary physical force is in principle an infringement of ECHR Article 3.<ref>{{cite web|date=23 October 2013|title=Police use of force|url=https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/public-order/core-principles-and-legislation/police-use-of-force/|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=College of Policing}}</ref> The use of force should be "reasonable" in the circumstances. Physical force is considered appropriate if:
*it is absolutely necessary for a purpose permitted by law, and
*the amount of force used is reasonable and proportionate
This requires a consideration of the degree of force used. Any excessive use of force by a police officer is unlawful and an officer could be prosecuted under criminal law.

===== Findings and statistics =====
Since 2004/05, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) published complaint statistics reports for England and Wales. In the 2014/15 annual report, the IPCC reported that there were 17 deaths in or following police custody and only one fatal police shooting from 2014 to 2017.<ref>{{cite web|date=23 July 2015|title=Annual report on deaths during or following police contact in 2014/15 published &#124; Independent Police Complaints Commission|url=https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/annual-report-deaths-during-or-following-police-contact-201415-published|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Independent Police Complaints Commission}}</ref> These figures more than doubled when the IPCC was first erected. The annual report for 2015/16 was published on 26 July 2016.

===== Public dissatisfaction and discrimination =====
Despite an average reduction in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following contact with the police was falling and that there was a greater willingness to file a complaint.<ref name="ipcc.gov.uk" /> The Metropolitan Police, who operate in some of the most ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 at 6,828 claims. However, young people and people from black or minority ethnic groups were much less likely to come forward with complaints.<ref name="ipcc.gov.uk" />

In recent years, [[Chile]]'s police force [[Carabineros de Chile]] has been under investigation because of various cases of power abuse and police brutality, particularly towards students participating in riots for better education and the indigenous [[Mapuche]] people; countless cases of violence were enacted on this group for allegedly committing crimes; it was later discovered that some Carabineros officers were responsible for these crimes and blamed Mapuches.

One of the recent cases involving the Mapuche was [[Camilo Catrillanca]]'s death. The first reports of his death came from the Carabineros who claimed that Camilo shot at a police officer and others while being investigated for allegedly stealing 3 cars. The Carabineros special forces team '''Comando Jungla''' was in the [[Araucanía Region]] searching for terrorists. After seeing Camilo "attacking" policemen with a gun in an attempt to escape, the Carabineros shot Camilo in the head and killed him. It was later discovered that this was not what happened; a partner of the police officer that killed Camilo showed the video of the policeman killing him while he drove a tractor. Carabineros was asked why they did not have a recording of the officer being shot at by Camilo. The institution responded the officer destroyed the SD card because it had private photos and videos of his wife; most people were not satisfied with the answer. The policeman was later discharged and prosecuted.<ref>[[Rodrigo Acuña]].

Police officers are legally permitted to [[Use of force in law enforcement|use force]], and their superiors and the public expect them to do so. [[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]] writes in regards to dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people{{who|date=July 2020}} working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|author2=Fyfe, James D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1-56510-262-0|pages=45–55|chapter=Community-Oriented Policing Would Prevent Police Brutality}}</ref>

There are many reasons as to why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. It is thought that psychopathy makes some officers more inclined to use excessive force than others. In one study, police psychologists surveyed officers who had used excessive force. The information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the [[Bad apples|bad apple]] stereotype. These include personality disorders; previous traumatic job-related experience; young, inexperienced, or authoritarian officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles; and officers with personal problems. Schrivers categorized these groups and separated the group that was the most likely to use excessive force.<ref>Scrivner, 1994: 3–6</ref> However, this "bad apple paradigm" is considered by some to be an "easy way out". A broad report commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it "a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faults – behavioural, psychological, background factors, and so on, rather than addressing systemic factors."<ref name="RCMP Review">{{cite web|last=Loree|first=Don|title=Corruption in Policing: Causes and Consequences; A Review of the Literature|work=Research and Evaluation Community, Contract and Aboriginal Policing Services Directorate|publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|year=2006|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/PS64-27-2006E.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2007 }}</ref> The report continues to discuss the systemic factors, which include:
* Pressures to conform to certain aspects of "police culture", such as the [[Blue Code of Silence]], which can "sustain an oppositional criminal subculture protecting the interests of police who violate the law"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15614260290011309|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|title=Corruption and the Blue Code of Silence|journal=Police Practice and Research|volume=3|year=2002|page=7|issue=1|s2cid=144512106}}</ref> and a "'we-they' perspective in which outsiders are viewed with suspicion or distrust"<ref name="RCMP Review" />
* Command and control structures with a rigid hierarchical foundation ("results indicate that the more rigid the authoritarian hierarchy, the lower the scores on a measure of ethical decision-making" concludes one study reviewed in the report);<ref>{{cite journal|last=Owens|first=Katherine M. B.|author2=Jeffrey Pfeifer|title=Police Leadership and Ethics: Training and Police Recommendations|journal=The Canadian Journal of Police and Security Services|volume=1|page=7|year=2002|issue=2}}</ref> and
* Deficiencies in internal accountability mechanisms (including internal investigation processes).<ref name="RCMP Review" />

The use of force by police officers is not kept in check in many jurisdictions by the issuance of a [[use of force continuum]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Stetser|first=Merle|title=The Use of Force in Police Control of Violence: Incidents Resulting in Assaults on Officers|year=2001|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing L.L.C.|location=New York|isbn=978-1-931202-08-4}}</ref> which describes levels of force considered appropriate in direct response to a suspect's behavior. This power is granted by the government, with few if any limits set out in [[statutory law]] as well as [[common law]].

Violence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression. Police brutality is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends (terrorism) and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).

Studies show that there are officers who believe the legal system they serve is failing and that it is their duty to pick up the slack. This is known as "vigilantism", where the officer involved may think the suspect deserves more punishment than what they may have to serve under the court system.<ref>Chevigny, P. (2008). "Police Brutality", In Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict. oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology, 2008.</ref>

During high-speed pursuits of suspects, officers can become angry and filled with adrenaline, which can affect their judgment when they finally apprehend the suspect. The resulting loss of judgment and heightened emotional state can result in inappropriate use of force. The effect is colloquially known as "high-speed pursuit syndrome."<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Mullen |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/04/05/EDITORIAL9376.dtl |title=The high-speed chase syndrome |work=SFGate |date=5 April 1996 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref>

=== Effects of police brutality in the United States ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}
{{POV section|date=March 2020}}
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2020}}
Police brutality is the misuse of power by police force to intentionally harm individuals.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} The excessive force imposed by police officers has significantly increased over the past decade and caused social misinterpretations of the role that police officers play in the community.

In 2015, the percentage of people who have confidence in the police hit its lowest since 1993 at 52 percent.<ref name="ReferenceD">Citation error.

Democrats' confidence in police dropped to 42% from 2017–2018 compared with 2012–2013, a larger change than for any other subgroup. Over the same period, Independents' (51%) and Republicans' (69%) confidence in police has not changed.<ref name="ReferenceD"/> The number of black people that trust the police in 2017–2018 averaged 30 percent, well below the national average of 53% and much lower than for any other subgroup.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

==== Firearms usage ====

Individual state statutes and police department policies generally say that police officers are legally allowed to shoot in the instance that they feel the need to protect their lives or an innocent life{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} or to prevent the suspect from escaping and posing a dangerous threat to bystanders in society.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} The Supreme Court Decision of [[Tennessee v. Garner]] made it possible to shoot a fleeing suspect only if they may cause harm to innocent people to prevent officers from shooting every suspect that tries to escape.

==== Stereotypes ====

Lorie Fridell, Associate Professor of Criminology at University of South Florida states that "racial profiling was the number one issue facing police [in the 1990s]", which led her to two conclusions: "bias in policing was not just a few officers in a few departments and, overwhelmingly, the police in this country are well-intentioned." The country as a whole sets stereotypes as well as biases against black Americans which inevitably leads to social misinterpretation of the safety of Americans when a black person is present.<ref name="BBC News">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32740523|title=Why do US police keep killing black men?|date=26 May 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=23 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

An experiment done in 2014 conducted on white undergraduate female students suggests that there is a higher degree of fear of racial minorities which gives reason for authorities to believe racial minorities are dangerous, leading to many minority-related shootings. The experiment supports the theory of dehumanization and lack of empathetic concern for minorities displayed by citizens of the racial majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-41947-001|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Justice for Jamar Response Action (22627979078).jpg|thumb|Protest march in response to the [[Shooting of Jamar Clark|Jamar Clark shooting]], Minneapolis, Minnesota]]
Incidents resulting in high profile deaths of innocent black men like Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and Freddie Gray in Baltimore demonstrate to the black community that they can no longer trust the police force.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} As a result of this lack of trust in police officers, the black society created many social organizations, such as the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement founded in 2013.

While the Justice Department reported that Cleveland police officers used "excessive deadly force, including shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive, and retaliatory force, including Tasers, chemical sprays, and their fists" on the victim, there was no real repercussions from their actions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hines|first=Sandra|date=21 September 2017|chapter=Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality|publisher=Policy Press|doi=10.1332/policypress/9781447327868.003.0019|isbn=9781447327868|title=Why Detroit Matters}}</ref>

[[File:Protest march against police violence - Justice for George Floyd (49941871086).jpg|thumb|right|Protesters in [[Minneapolis]] on 26 May 2020, the day after the [[killing of George Floyd]]]]
In a report released concerning the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], the Justice Department admitted to the Ferguson's police department's pattern of racial bias. The department argued that it is typically an effort to ticket as many low-income black residents as possible in an attempt to raise local budget revenue through fines and court fees. The Justice Department explained police encounters could get downright abusive when the person being questioned by the police officers becomes disrespectful or challenges their authority.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The Department of Justice also released a statement that confronted police officers' susceptibility to implicit bias: One of the things they looked was "threat perception failure", where an officer may believe that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case. These failures were observed to occur more frequently when the suspect was black.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 2017, there were 1,147 deaths accounted for by police, of which in 13 cases police officers were charged with a crime. 640 of the deaths caused by police officers that year were responses to non-violent offenses and no crime was reported. 149 people killed by the police were unarmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://policeviolencereport.org/|title=2017 Police Violence Report|website=policeviolencereport.org|language=en|access-date=23 October 2018}}</ref>

He was later dismissed for [[gross misconduct]].<ref>{{cite news|title = Ian Tomlinson case: PC Simon Harwood sacked for gross misconduct|date = 17 September 2012|url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/17/simon-harwood-sacked-gross-misconduct|last = Walker|first = Peter|newspaper = The Guardian|accessdate = 6 August 2013}}</ref>
* In Serbia, police brutality occurred in numerous cases during protests against [[Slobodan Milošević]], and has also been recorded at protests against governments since Milošević lost power.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The most recent case was recorded in July 2010, when five people, including two girls, were arrested, handcuffed, beaten with clubs, and mistreated for one hour.

*In Brazil, incidents of police violence have been very well-reported and Brazil has one of the highest prevalences of police brutality in the world today.
*South Africa from apartheid to today has had incidents of police brutality, though police violence is not as prevalent as during the apartheid years.
*There have been several instances of police brutality towards protesters in the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests]].

== Investigation ==
In [[England and Wales]], an independent organization known as the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) investigates reports of police misconduct. They automatically investigate any deaths caused by, or thought to be caused by, police action.

A similar body known as the [[Police Investigations and Review Commissioner]] (PIRC) operates in Scotland. In Northern Ireland the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]] has a similar role to that of the IPCC and PIRC.

In Africa, there exist two such bodies: one in South Africa and another one in Kenya known as the Independent Policing Oversight Authority.

In the United States, more police are wearing body cameras after the [[death of Michael Brown]]. The US Department of Justice has made a call to action for police departments across the nation to implement body cameras into their departments so further investigation will be possible.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department|date=2015}}</ref>

== Measurement ==
Police brutality is measured based on the accounts of people who have experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases, as there is no objective method to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. In 1985, only one out of five people thought that police brutality was a serious problem. Police brutality is relative to a situation: it depends on if the suspect is resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bureau of Justice Statistics|title=Use of Force|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=703|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about the police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jefferis|first1=Eric|last2=Butcher|first2=Fredrick|last3=Hanley|first3=Dena|title=Measuring perceptions of police use of force|journal=Police Practice and Research|date=2012|volume=13|issue=6|pages=81–96}}</ref>

== Independent oversight ==
Various community groups have criticized police brutality. These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent civilian review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.

Umbrella organizations and justice committees usually support those affected. [[Amnesty International]] is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. The stated objective of the organization is "to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated".

Tools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite news|title=YouTube.com prompts police beating probe |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |agency=Associated Press |last=Veiga |first=Alex |date=11 November 2006 |accessdate=12 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130233223/https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |archive-date=30 November 2006 }}</ref>

Civilians have begun independent projects to monitor police activity in an effort to reduce violence and misconduct. These are often called "Cop Watch" programs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Policing the Police: Civilian Video Monitoring of Police Activity|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/group/global-minds/article/643/|publisher=[[The Global Journal]]|last=Krupanski|first=Marc|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>
