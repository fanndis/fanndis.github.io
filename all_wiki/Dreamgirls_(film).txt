==Plot==
<!--Do not add extra content to this plot summary. You are free to revise/reword it, but plot summaries are not to exceed 700 words on Wikipedia-->
In 1962 [[Detroit, Michigan]], young car salesman Curtis Taylor Jr. meets a black [[girl group]] known as "The Dreamettes", which consists of lead singer Effie White and backup singers Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson, at an R&B amateur talent show at the Detroit Theatre. Curtis presents himself as The Dreamettes' new manager and arranges for the girls to become backup singers for [[Chitlin' Circuit]] R&B star Jimmy "Thunder" Early.

Curtis soon starts his own record label, Rainbow Records, out of his Detroit car dealership, and appoints Effie's brother, C.C., as his head songwriter. When their first single fails after a white pop group releases a [[cover version]], Curtis, C.C., and their producer Wayne turn to [[payola]] to make "Jimmy Early & The Dreamettes" mainstream pop stars. Offstage, Effie becomes infatuated with Curtis while the married Jimmy begins an affair with Lorrell.

Jimmy's manager, Marty Madison, grows weary of Curtis' plans to make his client more pop-friendly and walks out. When Jimmy bombs in front of an all-white [[Miami Beach]] [[supper club]] audience, Curtis sends Jimmy out on the road alone, keeping The Dreamettes behind to headline in his place. Feeling that Effie's plus-sized figure and distinctive voice will not attract white audiences, Curtis appoints Deena - who is slimmer, more conventionally attractive, and has a more basic, generic, and marketable voice - to be the new lead singer and renames the group "The Dreams".

With the aid of new songs and a new image, Curtis and C.C. transform The Dreams into a top-selling mainstream pop group. By 1965, however, Effie begins acting out, particularly when Curtis' affections also turn towards Deena. Curtis eventually drops Effie from the group, hiring his secretary Michelle Morris to take her place beginning with their 1966 [[New Year's Eve]] debut in [[Las Vegas]] as "Deena Jones & the Dreams." Despite Effie's defiance and desperate appeal to Curtis, he, C.C., and The Dreams leave her behind and forge ahead to stardom.

By 1973, Effie has become an impoverished [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] mother living in Detroit with her daughter Magic. Struggling to restart her career in music, she hires Marty as her manager and begins performing at a local club. Meanwhile, with Deena Jones & the Dreams superstars and Rainbow having moved to [[Los Angeles]] and now the biggest pop business in the country, Curtis attempts to produce a film about [[Cleopatra]] starring an unwilling Deena, who is now his wife.

The following year, Jimmy, who has descended into drug addiction due to Curtis' preoccupation with Deena, along with the rejection of the charity single he recorded, has a breakdown during Rainbow Records' tenth-anniversary television special. Curtis promptly drops him from the label and Lorrell ends their affair. Sometime later, C.C., who feels Curtis is undermining the [[artistic merit]] of his songs by making them into [[disco music]], quits the label, only for everyone to then learn that Jimmy has unexpected died from a [[heroin]] overdose, much to Lorrell's dismay.

Disillusioned by Jimmy's death and Curtis' cold reaction to the news, C.C. travels to Detroit and reconciles with Effie, for whom C.C. writes and produces a comeback single. Just as the record begins gaining local radio play, Curtis uses payola to force radio stations to play The Dreams' [[disco]] cover of the song. The plan falls apart, however, when Deena, angry over how Curtis controls her career, finds evidence of his schemes and contacts Effie, who arrives in Los Angeles with C.C., Marty, and a lawyer.

Deena and Effie reconcile, with Effie revealing to Deena that Curtis is Magic's father, while Curtis agrees to give Effie's record national distribution in order to avoid being reported to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Having been inspired by Effie's victory and realizing Curtis' true character, Deena leaves him to make it on her own.

By 1975, The Dreams give a final farewell performance at the Detroit Theater and invite Effie onstage for the final song. As the concert ends, Curtis notices Magic in the front row and realizes she is his daughter.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
Since the 1980s and 1990s, several different attempts have been made to produce a film adaptation of ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]]'', a Broadway musical loosely based upon the story of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]], which won six [[Tony Awards]] in 1982. [[David Geffen]], the stage musical's co-financier, retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'' and turned down many offers to adapt the story for the screen. He cited a need to preserve the integrity of ''Dreamgirls'' stage director [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]]'s work after his death in 1987.<ref name="DavidGeffen">Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006). "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06342/744656-254.stm After 'Dreamgirls', Geffen says goodbye to movies]". ''The Wall-Street Journal''. Retrieved on December 9, 2006</ref> That same year, Geffen, who ran his [[Warner Bros.]]-associated [[The Geffen Film Company|Geffen Pictures]] film production company at the time, began talks with Broadway lyricist and producer [[Howard Ashman]] to adapt it as a star vehicle for [[Whitney Houston]], who was to portray Deena. The production ran into problems when Houston wanted to sing both Deena and Effie's songs (particularly "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"), and the film was eventually abandoned.<ref name="EarlyMovieVers">Hill, Jeremy.

When Geffen co-founded DreamWorks in 1994 and dissolved Geffen Pictures, the rights to ''Dreamgirls'' remained with Warner Bros. Warner planned to go ahead with the film with director [[Joel Schumacher]] and screenwriter [[Tina Andrews]] <ref name="newmusic" /> in the late 1990s, following the success of [[Touchstone Pictures]]'s [[Tina Turner]] biopic ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]''. Schumacher planned to have [[Lauryn Hill]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Fugees' Lauryn Hill Eyed For "Dreamgirls"|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429235/19980716/fugees.jhtml|work=MTV.com|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=17 May 2010|date=16 July 1998}}</ref> portray Deena and [[Kelly Price]] play Effie. After Warner's [[Frankie Lymon]] biopic ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' failed at the box office, the studio shut down development on ''Dreamgirls''.<ref name="EarlyMovieVers" />

DreamWorks' ''Dreamgirls'' adaptation came about after the film version of the Broadway musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' was a success at both the box office and the [[Academy Awards]]. Screenwriter and director [[Bill Condon]], who wrote ''Chicago''{{'}}s screenplay, met producer [[Laurence Mark]] at a Hollywood holiday party in late 2002, where the two discussed a long-held "dream project" of Condon's&nbsp;– adapting ''Dreamgirls'' for the screen.<ref name="radio">{{Cite episode| title = "Dreamgirls" with Writer/Director Bill Condon| url = http://www.kcet.org/socal/cinema_series/dreamgirls-with-writerdirector-bill-condon.html| series = KCET Cinema Series| network = [[PBS]]| station = [[KCET]]| location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]| airdate = 2006-12-06| minutes = 2:34| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110621232320/http://www.kcet.org/socal/cinema_series/dreamgirls-with-writerdirector-bill-condon.html| archivedate = June 21, 2011| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The two had dinner with Geffen and successfully convinced him to allow Condon to write a screenplay for ''Dreamgirls''.<ref>Ulmer, James (Sept. 10, 2006).

===Stage to script changes===
While much of the stage musical's story remains intact, a number of significant changes were made. The Dreams' hometown—the setting for much of the action—was moved from [[Chicago]] to Detroit, the real-life hometown of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]].<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> The roles of many of the characters were related more closely to their real-life inspirations, following a suggestion by Geffen.<ref name="DavidGeffen" />

Warner Bros. had retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'', and agreed to co-produce with DreamWorks. However, after casting was completed, the film was budgeted at $73 million and Warner backed out of the production. Geffen, taking the role of co-producer, brought Paramount Pictures in to co-finance and release ''Dreamgirls''. During the course of production, Paramount's parent company, [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]], would purchase DreamWorks, aligning the two studios under one umbrella (and giving the senior studio US distribution rights on behalf of DreamWorks).<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> The completed film had a production budget of $75 million, making ''Dreamgirls'' the most expensive film with an all-black starring cast in cinema history.<ref name="MostExpensive">Gottfried, Marvin (2007).

Following the success of the Cannes screening, DreamWorks and Paramount began a widespread "[[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]]" advertisement campaign, raising several eyebrows by demoting Jennifer Hudson to consideration for Best Supporting Actress and presenting Beyoncé Knowles as the sole Best Actress candidate, as opposed to having both compete for Best Actress awards. By contrast, the actresses who originated Hudson's and Knowles' roles on Broadway, Jennifer Holliday and [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]], respectively, were both nominated for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress, with Holliday winning the award.<ref name="HudsonSupporting" /> The presentation of Knowles over Hudson as the sole Best Actress candidate had interesting parallels with the film itself.<ref name="HudsonSupporting" />

''Dreamgirls'' received eight 2007 [[Academy Award]] nominations covering six categories, the most of any film for the year, although it was not nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], or either of the lead acting categories.

To give the story more exposure for the upcoming film release, DreamWorks and the licenser of the original play, The Tams-Witmark Music Library, announced that they would pay the licensing fees for all non-professional stage performances of ''Dreamgirls'' for the calendar year of 2006. DreamWorks hoped to encourage amateur productions of ''Dreamgirls'', and familiarize a wider audience with the play. As a result, more than fifty high schools, colleges, community theaters, and other non-commercial theater entities staged productions of ''Dreamgirls'' in 2006, and DreamWorks spent up to $250,000 subsidizing the licensing.<ref>Olsen, Mark (Dec. 12, 2006).
