'''Jonathan Earl Franzen''' (born August 17, 1959) is an American [[novelist]] and [[essay]]ist. His 2001 novel ''[[The Corrections]]'', a sprawling, satirical family drama, drew widespread critical acclaim, earned Franzen a [[National Book Award]], was a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] finalist, earned a [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and was shortlisted for the [[International Dublin Literary Award]]. His novel ''[[Freedom (Jonathan Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'' (2010) garnered similar praise and led to an appearance on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] alongside the headline "[[Great American Novel]]ist".<ref name="macm">{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/Freedom-1|title=Freedom: A Novel|publisher=Macmillan|access-date=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref name=millions_time_franzen_cover/>

Franzen has contributed to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine since 1994. His 1996 ''[[Harper's]]'' essay "[[Why Bother? (essay)|Perchance to Dream]]" bemoaned the state of contemporary literature. [[Oprah's Book Club|Oprah Winfrey's book club]] selection in 2001 of ''The Corrections'' led to a much publicized feud with the talk show host.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/magazine/jonathan-franzen-is-fine-with-all-of-it.html?fallback=1&recId=16YsVsd2REcNBVyQbI3Quym49J9&geoContinent=NA&geoRegion=NY&recAlloc=random&geoCountry=US&blockId=signature-journalism-vi&action=click&module=editorsPicks&pgtype=Article&region=Footer|title=Jonathan Franzen Is Fine With All of It|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en|quote=During a series of interviews, Franzen expressed ambivalence about Oprah’s endorsement — that it might alienate male readers, who he very much was hoping would read his book; that the “logo of corporate ownership” made him uneasy; that he had found a few of her choices in the past “schmaltzy” and “one-dimensional.” Oprah disinvited him from her show in response, and Franzen was rebuked on all sides for his ingratitude and his luck and his privilege. He quickly became as famous for dissing Oprah as he was for writing a great book.}}</ref> In recent years, Franzen has become recognized for his opinions on everything from social networking services such as [[Twitter]] ("What happens to the people who want to communicate in depth, individual to individual, in the quiet and permanence of the printed word?";<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/07/jonathan-franzen-calls-twitter-irresponsible|title=Jonathan Franzen: 'Twitter is the ultimate irresponsible medium'|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2012-03-07|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> "the actual substance of our daily lives is total electronic distraction"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/our-distraction-franzens-kraus-project/#!|title=Our Distraction: Franzen's Kraus Project - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}</ref>) to the impermanence of [[e-book]]s ("All the real things, the authentic things, the honest things, are dying off.")<ref>{{Cite book|title=Freedom|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|publisher=Farrar Straus & Giroux|year=2010|isbn=978-0-374-15846-0|pages=218}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Alison|last=Flood|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/30/jonathan-franzen-ebooks-values|title=Jonathan Franzen warns ebooks are corroding values|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2012-01-30}}</ref> and the self-destruction of America.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Sarfraz|last1=Manzoor|first2=Alex|last2=Healey|first3=Michael|last3=Tait|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2010/oct/25/jonathan-franzen-freedom|title=Jonathan Franzen: 'America is almost a rogue state'|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2010-10-25}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Franzen was born in [[Western Springs, Illinois]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://contemporarylit.about.com/cs/authors/p/franzen.htm|title=Jonathan Franzen Biography – Bio of Jonathan Franzen|work=Contemporary Literature}}</ref> the son of Irene (née Super) and Earl T.

Franzen grew up in an old neighborhood, on 83 Webster Woods Drive in [[Webster Groves, Missouri|Webster Groves]], a suburb of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and graduated from [[Swarthmore College]] with a degree in German in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x30498.xml|title=Jonathan Franzen '81 First Living American Novelist on Time Cover in Decade|work=Swarthmore|access-date=2010-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805/http://www.swarthmore.edu/x30498.xml|archive-date=2012-08-05}}</ref> As part of his undergraduate education, he studied abroad in Germany during the 1979–80 academic year with [[Wayne State University]]'s [[Junior Year in Munich]] program.

Franzen was married in 1982 and moved with his wife to [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] to pursue a career as a novelist.

==Early novels==
''[[The Twenty-Seventh City]]'', published in 1988, is set in Franzen's hometown, St. Louis, and deals with the city's fall from grace, St. Louis having been the "fourth city" in the 1870s. This sprawling novel was warmly received and established Franzen as an author to watch.<ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1992/01/20/terra-not-so-firma.html Laura Shapiro, "Terra Not So Firma," Newsweek, January 20, 1992.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725102157/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1992/01/20/terra-not-so-firma.html |date=July 25, 2012 }} (Shapiro: "A huge and masterly drama of St. Louis under siege, gripping and surreal and overwhelmingly convincing." Shapiro also noted The Twenty-Seventh City's "brilliance," and the author's "prodigious gifts," concluding, "The news that he is at work on a third [novel] is welcome indeed."]</ref> In a conversation with novelist [[Donald Antrim]] for ''[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb Magazine]]'', Franzen described ''The Twenty-Seventh City'' as  "a conversation with the literary figures of my parents' generation[,] the great sixties and seventies Postmoderns.",<ref>Antrim, Donald. [http://bombsite.com/issues/77/articles/2437 "Jonathan Franzen"]. ''[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb Magazine]]''. Fall 2001. Retrieved 2011-07-27.</ref> adding in a later interview "I was a skinny, scared kid trying to write a big novel. The mask I donned was that of a rhetorically airtight, extremely smart, extremely knowledgeable middle-aged writer."<ref name="theparisreview.org">{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6054/the-art-of-fiction-no-207-jonathan-franzen|title=Jonathan Franzen, The Art of Fiction No. 207|work=The Paris Review|author=Stephen J. Burn|date=Winter 2010}}</ref>

''[[Strong Motion]]'' (1992) focuses mainly on a [[dysfunctional family]], the Hollands, and uses [[Seismology|seismic]] events on the American East Coast as a metaphor for the quakes that occur in family life (as Franzen put it, "I imagined static lives being disrupted from without—literally shaken. I imagined violent scenes that would strip away the veneer and get people shouting angry moral truths at each other."<ref name="theparisreview.org"/>). A 'systems novel', the key 'systems' of ''Strong Motion'' according to Franzen are "... the systems of science and religion—two violently opposing systems of making sense in the world."<ref name="theparisreview.org"/> The novel was not a financial success at the time of its publication. Franzen subsequently defended the novel in his 2010 Paris Review interview, remarking "I think they [critics and readers] may be overlooking ''Strong Motion'' a little bit."<ref name="theparisreview.org"/>

Franzen taught a fiction-writing seminar at [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] in the spring of 1992 and 1994:
{{Quote
|text= On that first day of class, Franzen wrote two words on the blackboard: “truth” and “beauty,” and told his students that these were the goals of fiction. Haslett describes Franzen’s classroom manner as “serious.” “He meant what he said and didn’t suffer fools gladly.” But this seriousness was leavened by a “great relish for words and writing,” adds Kathleen Lawton-Trask ’96, a 1994 workshop student who is now a writer and high school English teacher. “People who teach fiction workshops aren't always starry-eyed about writing, but he was. He read our stories so closely that he often started class with a rundown of words that were not used quite correctly in stories from that week’s workshop. (I still remember him explaining to us the difference between cement and concrete.) At the same time, he was eminently supportive and sympathetic; I don't remember those corrections ever feeling condescending.”<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wachter |first=Paul |date=April 2011 |title=Six Degrees of Jonathan Franzen

For the 1992 class, Franzen invited [[David Foster Wallace]] to be a guest judge of the workshop pieces.

==''The Corrections''==

Franzen's ''The Corrections'', a novel of social criticism, garnered considerable critical acclaim in the United States, winning both the 2001 [[National Book Award for Fiction]]<ref name=nba2001>

In September 2001, ''The Corrections'' was selected for [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Oprah's Book Club|book club]]. Franzen initially participated in the selection, sitting down for a lengthy interview with Oprah and appearing in [[B-roll]] footage in his hometown of St. Louis (described in an essay in ''How To Be Alone'' titled "Meet Me In St. Louis"). In October 2001, however, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' printed an article in which Franzen expressed unease with the selection. In an interview on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Fresh Air]]'', he expressed his worry that the Oprah logo on the cover dissuaded men from reading the book:

{{quote|I had some hope of actually reaching a male audience and I've heard more than one reader in signing lines now at bookstores say "If I hadn't heard you, I would have been put off by the fact that it is an Oprah pick. I figure those books are for women. I would never touch it." Those are male readers speaking. I see this as my book, my creation.<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Gross|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1131456|title=Novelist Jonathan Franzen|work=Fresh Air|publisher=NPR|date=October 15, 2001}}</ref>|}}

Soon afterward, Franzen's invitation to appear on Oprah's show was rescinded. Winfrey announced, "Jonathan Franzen will not be on the Oprah Winfrey show because he is seemingly uncomfortable and conflicted about being chosen as a book club selection. It is never my intention to make anyone uncomfortable or cause anyone conflict. We have decided to skip the dinner and we're moving on to the next book."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/08/jonathan_franzen_s_the_corrections_and_oprah_winfrey_s_book_club.html|title=Corrections|last=Kachka|first=Boris|date=2013-08-05|work=Slate|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>

These events gained Franzen and his novel widespread media attention. ''The Corrections'' soon became one of the decade's best-selling works of literary fiction. At the National Book Award ceremony, Franzen said "I'd also like to thank Oprah Winfrey for her enthusiasm and advocacy on behalf of ''The Corrections''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_jfranzen.html|title=National Book Awards Acceptance Speeches: Jonathan Franzen|work=[[National Book Foundation]]|year=2001|access-date=2007-04-04}}</ref>

Following the success of ''The Corrections'' and the publication of ''[[The Discomfort Zone]]'' and ''[[How to Be Alone (book)|How to Be Alone]]'', Franzen began work on his next novel. In the interim, he published two short stories in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': "Breakup Stories", published November 8, 2004, concerned the disintegration of four relationships; and "Two's Company", published May 23, 2005, concerned a couple who write for TV, then split up.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/jonathan_franzen/search?contributorName=jonathan%20franzen&page=1&sort=publishDateSort%20desc,%20score%20desc&queryType=parsed|title=jonathan franzen: Contributors|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2010-03-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607083522/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/jonathan_franzen/search?contributorName=jonathan%20franzen&page=1&sort=publishDateSort%20desc,%20score%20desc&queryType=parsed|archive-date=2011-06-07}}</ref>

In 2011, it was announced that Franzen would write a multi-part television adaptation of ''The Corrections'' in collaboration with ''[[The Squid and the Whale]]'' director [[Noah Baumbach]] for HBO.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Neal|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/noah-baumbach-developing-jonathan-franzens-the-cor,61383/|title=Noah Baumbach developing Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections as HBO series|work=A.

[[File:Jonathan Franzen at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|Franzen at the 2008 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]
On June 8, 2009, Franzen published an excerpt from ''Freedom'', his novel in progress, in ''The New Yorker''. The excerpt, titled "Good Neighbors", concerned the trials and tribulations of a couple in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. On May 31, 2010, a second excerpt — titled "Agreeable" — was published, also in ''The New Yorker''.<ref name="Agreeable">{{citation |url= https://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/05/31/100531fi_fiction_franzen |publisher= The New Yorker |title=Agreeable |author= Jonathan Franzen |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref>

On October 16, 2009, Franzen made an appearance alongside David Bezmozgis at the ''New Yorker Festival'' at the Cedar Lake Theatre, reading a portion of his forthcoming novel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/festival/schedule/index/friday#bezmozgis|title=Festival |work=The New Yorker|date=2009-01-07|access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref><ref name="northbynorthwestern1">{{cite news|url=http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2009/11/55140/the-franzen-interface/|title=The Franzen Interface|work=North by Northwestern|access-date=2010-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714194929/http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2009/11/55140/the-franzen-interface/|archive-date=July 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sam Allard, writing for North By Northwestern about the event, said that the "...material from his new (reportedly massive) novel" was "as buoyant and compelling as ever" and "marked by his familiar undercurrent of tragedy". Franzen read "an extended clip from the second chapter."<ref name="northbynorthwestern1"/>

On September 9, 2010, Franzen appeared on ''[[Fresh Air]]'' to discuss ''Freedom'' in the wake of its release. Franzen has drawn what he describes as a "feminist critique" for the attention that male authors receive over female authors—a critique he supports. Franzen also discussed his friendship with [[David Foster Wallace]] and the impact of Wallace's suicide on his writing process.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129747555|title=Franzen On The Book, The Backlash, His Background|work=Fresh Air|publisher=NPR|date=2010-09-09|access-date=2010-09-10}}</ref>

''Freedom''  was the subject of a highly unusual "recall" in the United Kingdom starting in early October 2010.  An earlier draft of the manuscript, to which Franzen had made over 200 changes, had been published by mistake.  The publisher, [[HarperCollins]], initiated an exchange program, but thousands of books had been distributed by that time.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Alison|last1=Flood|first2=Rowenna|last2=Davis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/01/jonathan-franzen-freedom-uk-recall|title=Jonathan Franzen's book Freedom suffers UK recall|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2010-10-01}}</ref>

While promoting the book, Franzen became the first American author to appear on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine since [[Stephen King]] in 2000.

In an interview with ''Portland Monthly'' on December 18, 2012, Franzen revealed that he currently had "a four-page, single-spaced proposal" for a fifth novel he was currently working on,<ref name="portlandmonthlymag.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/arts-and-entertainment/books-and-talks/articles/q-and-a-with-jonathan-franzen-january-2013|title=Q&A: Jonathan Franzen|work=portlandmonthlymag.com|access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref> although he went on to suggest that while he had a proposal there was no guarantee that what was proposed would make the final cut, saying of similar proposals for previous novels, "I look at the old proposals now, and I see the one part of them that actually got made into a book, and I think, 'How come I couldn't see that? What is all this other stuff?'".<ref name="portlandmonthlymag.com"/> Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding "I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me."<ref name="portlandmonthlymag.com"/> In October 2014, during a discussion at [[Colgate University]], Franzen read a "self-contained first-person narrative" that is part of a novel that he hoped will be out in the summer of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Jessica|title=Author Jonathan Franzen visits Colgate as part of Living Writers course|url=http://news.colgate.edu/2014/10/author-jonathan-franzen-visits-colgate-as-part-of-living-writers-course.html/|website=Colgate University|access-date=3 November 2014}}</ref>

On November 17, 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' Artsbeat Blog reported that the novel, titled ''Purity'', would be out in September.<ref name="artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com">{{cite web|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|title=New Jonathan Franzen Novel, 'Purity,' Coming in September|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/new-jonathan-franzen-novel-purity-coming-in-september/|website=Colgate The New York Times Blog|access-date=17 November 2014}}</ref> Jonathan Galassi, president and publisher of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, described ''Purity'' as a multigenerational American epic that spans decades and continents. The story centers on a young woman named Purity Tyler, or Pip, who doesn't know who her father is and sets out to uncover his identity. The narrative stretches from contemporary America to South America to East Germany before the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|collapse of the Berlin Wall]], and hinges on the mystery of Pip's family history and her relationship with a charismatic 
hacker and whistleblower.<ref name="artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com"/>

In 2016, ''[[Daily Variety]]'' reported that the novel was in the process of being adapted into a 20-hour limited series for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] by [[Todd Field]] who would share writing duties with Franzen and the playwright [[Sir David Hare]]. It would star [[Daniel Craig]] as Andreas Wolf and be executive produced by Field, Franzen, Craig, Hare & [[Scott Rudin]].<ref>{{cite news|first= Elizabeth|last= Wagmeister|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/purity-showtime-daniel-craig-scott-rudin-1201753115|title=Showtime Lands Daniel Craig, Scott Rudin Limited Series 'Purity'|work=Daily Variety|year=2016}}</ref>

However, in a February 2018 interview with ''[[The Times]]'' London, Hare said that, given the budget for Field's adaptation (170 million),  he doubted it would ever be made, but added "It was one of the richest and most interesting six weeks of my life, sitting in a room with Todd Field, Jonathan Franzen and Daniel Craig bashing out the story. They're extremely interesting people."<ref>{{cite news|first=Dominic|last=Maxwell|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-hare-i-am-sick-to-death-of-hearing-about-the-need-for-strong-women-as-protagonists-83scsqlsv|title=David Hare: 'I am sick to death of hearing about the need for strong women as protagonists'

''Purity'' was a relative commercial disappointment compared to Franzen's two previous novels, selling only 255,476 copies, compared to 1.15 million copies of ''Freedom'' and 1.6 million copies of ''The Corrections''.<ref name="NYTimesMag">Brodesser-Akner, Taffy (June 26, 2018).

== ''A Key to All Mythologies'' ==
On November 13, 2020, Franzen's publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux announced the publication of Franzen's new novel, ''Crossroads,'' the first volume in a trilogy titled ''A Key to All Mythologies.'' <ref>{{Cite web|title=New Franzen Novel Set for October 2021|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/84894-new-franzen-novel-set-for-next-october.html|access-date=2020-11-15|website=www.publishersweekly.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|url=https://www.facebook.com/fsgbooks/posts/10158203505803052|access-date=2020-11-15|website=www.facebook.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-13|title=Briefs: New Books From Franzen and Bridges, Chronicle Expands In Games and Toys|url=https://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2020/11/briefs-new-books-from-franzen-and-bridges-chronicle-expands-in-games-and-toys/|access-date=2020-11-15|website=Publishers Lunch|language=en-US}}</ref>

Jacket copy for ''Crossroads'' reads: "It’s December 23, 1971, and the Hildebrandt family is at a crossroads. The patriarch, Russ, the associate pastor of a suburban Chicago church, is poised to break free of a marriage he finds joyless— unless his brilliant and unstable wife, Marion, breaks free of it first. Their eldest child, Clem, is coming home from college afire with moral absolutism, having taken an action that will shatter his father. Clem’s sister, Becky, long the social queen of her high-school class, has veered into the era’s counterculture, while their younger brother Perry, fed up with selling pot to support his drug habit, has firmly resolved to be a better person. Each of the Hildebrandts seeks a freedom that each of the others threatens to complicate.
Universally recognized as the leading novelist of his generation, Jonathan Franzen is often described as a teller of family stories. Only now, though, in ''Crossroads'', has he given us a novel in which a family, in all the intricacy of its workings, is truly at the center.

By turns comic and harrowing, a tour-de-force of interwoven perspectives and sustained suspense, ''Crossroads'' is the first volume of a trilogy, ''A Key to All Mythologies'', that will span three generations and trace the inner life of our culture through the present day. Complete in itself, set in a historical moment of moral crisis, and reaching back to the early twentieth century, ''Crossroads'' serves as a foundation for a sweeping investigation of human mythologies, as the Hildebrandt family navigates the political, intellectual, and social crosscurrents of the past fifty years.
Jonathan Franzen’s gift for wedding depth and vividness of character with breadth of social vision has never been more dazzlingly evident than in ''Crossroads''."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Crossroads: A Novel {{!}} Jonathan Franzen {{!}} Macmillan|url=https://us.macmillan.com/crossroadsanovel/jonathanfranzen/9780374181178|access-date=2020-11-15|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Other works==
[[File:Jonathan Franzen 1.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Franzen, 2010]]
In 1996, while still working on ''The Corrections'', Franzen published a literary manifesto in Harper's Magazine entitled ''[[Why Bother? (essay)|Perchance to Dream]]''. Referencing manifestos written by Philip Roth and [[Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast|Tom Wolfe]], among others, Franzen grappled with the novelist's role in an advanced media culture which seemed to no longer need the novel. In the end, Franzen rejects the goal of writing a great [[social novel]] about issues and ideas, in favor of focusing on the internal lives of characters and their emotions. Given the huge success of ''The Corrections'', this essay offers a prescient look into Franzen's goals as both a literary and commercially minded author.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/1996/04/0007955|title=Perchance to dream: In the age of images, a reason to write novels|work=Harper's|year=1996}}</ref>

In 2002, Franzen published a critique of the novels of [[William Gaddis]], entitled "[[Mr. Difficult]]", in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  He begins by recounting how some readers felt ''The Corrections'' was spoiled by being too high-brow in parts, and summarizes his own views of reading difficult fiction.  He proposes a "Status model", whereby the point of fiction is to be Art, and also a "Contract model", whereby the point of fiction is to be Entertainment, and finds that he subscribes to both models.  He praises ''[[The Recognitions]]'', admits that he only got halfway through ''[[J R]]'', and explains why he does not like the rest of Gaddis's novels.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/09/30/020930fa_fact_franzen|title=Mr. Difficult|work=[[The New Yorker]]|year=2002}}</ref>

In 2004 Franzen published "The Discomfort Zone", a personal essay about his childhood and family life in Missouri and his love of [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. [[Susan Orlean]] selected it for the subsequent volume of ''[[The Best American Essays]]''.<ref name="resources">{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Lisa |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/print/html?reqURI=/apc/members/courses/teachers_corner/180039.html |title=Resources for Graphic Novels |work=AP Central |access-date=2015-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083624/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/print/html?reqURI=%2Fapc%2Fmembers%2Fcourses%2Fteachers_corner%2F180039.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>

Since ''The Corrections'' Franzen has published ''[[How to Be Alone (book)|How to Be Alone]]'' (2002), a collection of essays including "Perchance To Dream", and ''[[The Discomfort Zone]]'' (2006), a memoir. ''How To Be Alone'' is essentially an apologia for reading, articulating Franzen's uncomfortable relationship with the place of fiction in contemporary society. It also probes the influence of his childhood and adolescence on his creative life, which is then further explored in ''The Discomfort Zone''.

In September 2007, Franzen's translation of [[Frank Wedekind]]'s play ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' ({{lang-de|Frühlings Erwachen}}) was published. In his introduction, Franzen describes the [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Broadway musical version]] as "insipid" and "overpraised." In an interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Franzen stated that he had in fact made the translation for Swarthmore College's theater department for $50 in 1986 and that it had sat in a drawer for 20 years since. After the Broadway show stirred up so much interest, Franzen said he was inspired to publish it because "I knew it was a good translation, better than anything else out there."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/arts/books/features/37214/|title=Q&A With 'Spring Awakening: A Play' Translator Jonathan Franzen|date=2007-09-10|access-date=2009-01-21}}</ref>

Franzen published a social commentary on cell phones, sentimentality, and the decline of public space, "I Just Called To Say I Love You" (2008),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/21173/?a=f|title=I Just Called to Say I Love You|date=September 2008|work= Technology Review|access-date=2010-12-01}}</ref> in the September/October 2008 issue of ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''.

In 2012 he published ''[[Farther Away (book)|Farther Away]]'', a collection of essays dealing with such topics as his love of birds, his friendship with [[David Foster Wallace]], and his thoughts on technology.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lopate|first=Phillip|title=Manageable Discontents|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/books/review/farther-away-essays-by-jonathan-franzen.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=18 July 2012|date=May 18, 2012}}</ref>

Franzen published his third essay collection, ''The End of the End of the Earth: Essays'', in November 2018.<ref name="us.macmillan.com">https://us.macmillan.com/theendoftheendoftheearth/jonathanfranzen/9780374147938/</ref> According to advance press for the book, the collection "gathers essays and speeches written mostly in the past five years, [and] Jonathan Franzen returns with renewed vigor to the themes—both human and literary—that have long preoccupied him. Whether exploring his complex relationship with his uncle, recounting his young adulthood in New York, or offering an illuminating look at the global seabird crisis, these pieces contain all the wit and disabused realism that we've come to expect from Franzen.
Taken together, these essays trace the progress of a unique and mature mind wrestling with itself, with literature, and with some of the most important issues of our day, made more pressing by the current political milieu. The End of the End of the Earth is remarkable, provocative, and necessary."<ref name="us.macmillan.com"/>

==Philosophy of writing==
[[File:Jonathan Franzen 2011 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Franzen at the 2010 [[National Book Critics Circle]] awards]]
During a lecture on autobiography and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked of him by audiences, all of which annoy or bother him in some way. They are:

* Who are your influences?
* What time of day do you work, and what do you write on?
* I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters "take over" and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too?
* Is your fiction autobiographical?

In the lecture he said of the third question in particular "This one always raises my blood pressure" and quoted [[Nabokov]] in response.

In February 2010, Franzen (along with writers such as [[Richard Ford]], [[Margaret Atwood]], and [[Anne Enright]]) was asked by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to contribute what he believed were ten serious rules to abide by for aspiring writers.<ref name=ten_rules_guardian>{{cite news|first1=Geoff |last1=Dyer |first2=David |last2=Hare |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one |title=Ten rules for writing fiction |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=2010-02-20 |access-date=2010-03-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001023035/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one |archive-date=October 1, 2013 }}</ref>
