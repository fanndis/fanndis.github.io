'''Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor''' {{Post-nominals|country=HKG|GBM|GBS}} ({{zh|t=林鄭月娥|cy=Làhm Jehng Yuht-ngòh}}; ''{{nee}}'' '''Cheng''', born 13 May 1957) is a [[Hong Kong]] politician serving as the fourth and current [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] since 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong chooses first woman head|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-chooses-carrie-lam-amid-political-tension/article17666890.ece?homepage=true|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=March 26, 2017}}</ref> She served as the [[Secretary for Development]] from 2007 to 2012 and [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] from 2012 to 2017.

After graduating from the [[University of Hong Kong]] Lam joined the [[British Hong Kong]] civil service in 1980 and served in various government agencies. She became a key official in 2007 when she was appointed [[Secretary for Development]]. During her tenure, she earned the nickname "tough fighter" for her role in the controversial demolition of the [[Queen's Pier]] in 2008.

Lam became Chief Secretary for Administration under the [[Leung Chun-ying]] [[Leung Chun-ying as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|administration]] in 2012. From 2013 to 2015 Lam headed the Task Force on Constitutional Development for the [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform]] and held talks with student and opposition leaders during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|widespread protests]]. In the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive selection process]], Lam obtained 777 votes from the 1,194-member appointed [[Election Committee]] as the Beijing-favoured candidate and became the first female Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] has seen controversies, including the trial and imprisonment of democracy activists, the disqualification of several pro-democracy candidates, as well as the criminalisation of the pro-independence [[Hong Kong National Party]].<ref name="HKNPappeal">{{cite news|last1=Lum|first1=Alvin|title=Hong Kong National Party founders lodge separate appeals against ban in effort to avoid legal action|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2170054/hong-kong-separatist-party-founders-andy-chan-and-chow-ho|access-date=24 October 2018|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=24 October 2018}}</ref> Her government was also criticised for raising the qualification age for [[Comprehensive Social Security Assistance]] and for its handling of the cross-harbour tunnel toll plan, among other policies.

In mid-2019, Lam's government pushed for a controversial [[Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019|amendment to the extradition law]] which received widespread domestic and international opposition. [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|Massive protests]] broke out and persisted throughout the latter half of the year, from demanding the withdrawal of the bill to Lam's resignation among [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests#Objectives|five key demands]]. Lam suspended the bill in June and did not withdraw the bill until September.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hundreds-of-thousands-in-hong-kong-protest-law-to-allow-extraditions-to-china/2019/06/09/4cba9dde-8926-11e9-9d73-e2ba6bbf1b9b_story.html|title=Hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong protest law to allow extraditions to China|last=Shih|first=Gerry|date=9 June 2019|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=9 June 2019|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Timothy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong leader will suspend unpopular extradition bill indefinitely|date=15 June 2019|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-hong-kong-extradition-20190615-story.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announces formal withdrawal of the extradition bill and sets up a platform to look into key causes of protest crisis|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3025641/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-announce-formal-withdrawal|work=South China Morning Post|date=4 September 2019|access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/what-do-the-hong-kong-protesters-want|title=What do the Hong Kong protesters want?|last=Rourke|first=Alliston|date=13 August 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref> She also stood firmly against the other demands including an independent inquiry into police conduct and universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections.<ref name=bbc11/> The clashes between the protesters and police escalated, which resulted in more than 9,000 arrests as of July 2020.<ref name="RTHK20200729">{{Cite web|title=Police blame rising crime on anti-govt protests|date=2020-07-29|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1540579-20200729.htm?|access-date=2020-07-30|website=news.rthk.hk|language=en}}</ref><ref name=bbc11>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695|title=Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words|date=12 November 2019|access-date=13 November 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> Lam's popularity also dropped to a historic low with the [[pro-Beijing camp]] suffering the worst landslide defeat in history in the [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|November District Council election]]. Lam is commonly criticized by many leaders after allowing many events destroying the human rights society in Hong Kong.

==Early life and education==
Born Cheng Yuet-ngor to a low-income family of [[Zhoushan]] ancestry in Hong Kong, Lam was the fourth of five children.<ref name="hk0112012017">{{cite web|title=林鄭由住板間房到進軍禮賓府　仕途兩度「轉線」鋪排今日攀峰之路|url=http://www.hk01.com/特首選舉2017/65125/林鄭由住板間房到進軍禮賓府-仕途兩度-轉線-鋪排今日攀峰之路|newspaper=HK01|date=12 January 2017}} (Traditional Chinese)</ref><ref name="standard13012017">{{cite web|title=The tough side of nanny carrie|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=178522|newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|date=13 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="Tramways">{{cite web |url= http://www.news.gov.hk/en/record/html/2014/07/20140718_193554.shtml|title= HK Tramways grows with time|date=18 July 2014 |website= news.gov.hk|publisher= Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government|access-date=3 October 2014}} Lam stated in a speech "To those who were born and brought up in Hong Kong like me"</ref> She was born and grew up in [[Lockhart Road]], [[Wan Chai]], where she finished her primary and secondary education at [[St. Francis' Canossian College]], a Catholic girls' school in the neighbourhood, where she was [[Head Prefect|head prefect]].<ref name="thestandard03052016"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Wan Chai: Evolution of a District|url=http://www.swireproperties.com/cornerstone/past_issues/20130304/en/spotlight.html|website=CornerStone|publisher=Swire Properties|date=2013|access-date=19 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903120738/http://www.swireproperties.com/cornerstone/past_issues/20130304/en/spotlight.html|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Straits"/><ref name="scmp21102013">{{cite news|title=Carrie Lam: I need my husband to lean on|url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1336142/carrie-lam-i-need-my-husband-lean|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=21 October 2013}}</ref>

==Civil service career==
Lam joined the Administrative Service in 1980 after she graduated from the [[University of Hong Kong]]. She served in various [[List of Hong Kong government agencies|bureaus and departments]], spending about seven years in the [[Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau|Finance Bureau]] which involved budgetary planning and expenditure control. Initially, she worked as Principal Assistant Secretary and subsequently as Deputy Secretary for the Treasury in the 1990s.<ref name="CV">{{cite web|title=The Hon Mrs Carrie LAM CHENG Yuet-ngor, GBM, GBS, JP – Chief Secretary for Administration|work=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|url=http://www.cso.gov.hk/eng/pdf/cs_detailcv.pdf|access-date=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113142303/http://www.cso.gov.hk/eng/pdf/cs_detailcv.pdf|archive-date=13 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2000, Lam was promoted to the position of Director of the [[Social Welfare Department]] during a period of high unemployment and severe fiscal deficits in Hong Kong. She tightened the [[Comprehensive Social Security Assistance]] scheme, making it available only to people who had lived in Hong Kong for more than seven years, excluding new immigrants. With other senior officials, she helped set up the We Care Education Fund, raising over HK$80 million to meet the long term educational needs of children whose parents died from the [[SARS epidemic]] in 2003.

In November 2003, Lam was appointed Permanent Secretary for [[Housing, Planning and Lands Bureau|Housing, Planning and Lands]] and chairman of the [[Town Planning Board]]. She was soon appointed Director-General of the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, London|Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London]] in September 2004.<ref name="CV" />

On 8 March 2006, Lam returned to Hong Kong to take up the position as Permanent Secretary for [[Home Affairs Bureau|Home Affairs]]. She was involved in the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] and [[Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics Equestrian Events]] and the [[West Kowloon Cultural District]] plan.<ref name="CV"/>

==Secretary for Development==
[[File:林鄭月娥.jpg|Carrie Lam facing conservationists at a public forum at the [[Queen's Pier]] in July 2007|thumb|left|150px]]
On 1 July 2007, Lam left the civil service when she was appointed [[Secretary for Development]] by [[Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]], becoming one of the principal officials. In the first days of her office, Lam oversaw the demolition of the landmark [[Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier]] for the [[Star Ferry]] and the [[Queen's Pier]] to make way for land reclamation, which triggered occupation protests by the conservationists.

In July 2007, she attended a public forum at Queen's Pier in a bid to persuade the protesters to disperse and allow the demolition to begin. She firmly repeated the government's position that it was not an option to retain the pier and she would "not give the people false hope".<ref>{{cite news|title=‘Good fighter’ plus ‘peacemaker’, but can Carrie Lam hold up the sky?|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2054855/good-fighter-plus-peacemaker-can-carrie-lam-hold-sky|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=15 December 2016}}</ref> Her handling of the pier conflict earned her a reputation as a "tough fighter" by the then [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Rafael Hui]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/nextplus/%E7%B2%BE%E9%81%B8/article/20170112/2_468992_0/-%E6%9E%97%E9%84%AD%E7%99%BC%E7%89%B9%E9%A6%96%E5%A4%A2-%E4%BD%A0%E8%A6%81%E8%AC%B9%E8%A8%98-%E5%A5%BD%E6%89%93%E5%BE%97-%E7%9A%84%E5%8D%81%E5%A4%A7%E5%8A%A3%E6%94%BF|title=【林鄭發特首夢】你要謹記「好打得」的十大劣政|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=12 January 2017}}</ref>

Lam also put forward a new Urban Renewal Strategy to lower the threshold for compulsory sale for redevelopment from 90 percent to 80 percent in 2010. Human rights organisations criticised the policy as benefiting the big real estate developers and violating the [[right to housing]] as recognised by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] as the bargaining power of the small owners would be undermined.<ref>{{cite news|title=強拍條例　林鄭企硬三不　不撤回　不修訂　若否決不會再推|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=16 March 2010|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20100316/13825049}}</ref>

In 2012, Lam led the [[Development Bureau]] in cracking down unauthorised building works largely found in the [[Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|indigenous villages]] in the [[New Territories]].<ref name="bomb"/> The change in law enforcement policy was opposed by leaders of rural communities and the [[Heung Yee Kuk]], a [[statutory body]] representing rural interests. The Heung Yee Kuk staged protests against Lam and accused her of "robbing villagers of their fundamental rights".<ref>{{cite news|title=Minister robbing villagers of rights, says kuk|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1004422/minister-robbing-villagers-rights-says-kuk|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> Lam also tried to tackle the "[[Small House Policy]]", which has been subject to abuse amidst a land crunch. The policy gives male indigenous villagers in the New Territories the right to build a house close to their ancestral homes but the policy has drawn criticism because in some cases, it has been abused for profit.<ref name="Straits"/><ref name="bomb"/>

In recognition of her achievements as Secretary for Development, she was awarded honorary member of the Hong Kong Institute of Landscape Architects, honorary fellow of the [[Hong Kong Institution of Engineers]], Property Person of the Year in the RICS Hong Kong Property Awards 2012, honorary member of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Architects]], honorary member of the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], honorary fellow member of the Hong Kong Institute of Architectural Conservationists, and honorary fellow of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].<ref name="CV"/>

During the [[2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2012 Chief Executive election]], Lam cracked down on the unauthorised building works of Chief Executive candidate [[Henry Tang]] who was contesting [[Leung Chun-ying]]. That scandal put paid to Tang's hopes of becoming Chief Executive. Leung was later found to also have unauthorised building works at his house. Lam was criticised for letting him get away with it.<ref name="bomb">{{cite news|title=Illegal building works may be ticking time bomb for Carrie Lam

==Chief Secretary for Administration==
[[File:Sturgeon visits Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lam meeting with [[Nicola Sturgeon]], [[First Minister of Scotland]], in 2015 as Chief Secretary.]]
After hinting she would retire in the United Kingdom with her family, Lam received appointment to become the [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] under Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying on 1 July 2012. Her popularity started to shrink as Chief Secretary as the [[Moral and National Education]] controversy sparked in the first months of the Leung administration, which saw Lam's popularity rating dipped two percentage points from 64 percent to 62 percent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tearful Carrie Lam says she put reputation on the line|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1031942/tearful-carrie-lam-says-she-put-reputation-line|date=8 September 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>

===2014 political reform and protests===
In October 2013, she became the head of the Task Force on Constitutional Development headed by [[Secretary for Justice]] [[Rimsky Yuen]] and [[Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs]] [[Raymond Tam]] which was responsible for the [[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform consultation]] for the electoral methods for the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive election]] and [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]]. After Hong Kong Basic Law Committee member Rao Geping explicitly ruled out any form of open nomination for candidates in the 2017 Chief Executive election at a seminar, Lam characterised Rao's statement as "setting the tune of the gong with a final hit" which received attacks from the pan-democrats that Lam had effectively put an end to consultation on the issue even before it has begun.<ref>{{cite news|title=It is how we are going to play the gong that matters|first=Nai-keung|last=Lau|date=11 April 2014|newspaper=China Daily}}</ref>

After the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) [[831 decision|decreed the restriction]] on the 2017 Chief Executive election in August 2014, the [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] suffragists launched a [[2014 Hong Kong protests|large-scale occupation protests]] which lasted for 79 days. In response to the occupations, Lam announced that the second round of public consultations on political reform, originally planned to be completed by the end of the year, would be postponed.<ref name="wsj-carrielam">"Yung, Chester. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/carrie-lam-hong-kong-to-delay-discussions-on-political-reform-1411992195 Carrie Lam: Hong Kong to Delay Discussions on Political Reform]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. 29 September 2014.</ref>

During the midst of the occupation protests, Lam also held talks in a televised open debate with student leaders on 21 October. In the talks, Lam obdurately resisted, stating that students' proposal of civil nomination falls outside of the framework imposed by the Basic Law and the NPCSC decision, which could not be retracted.<ref name="LATimes talks">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-hong-kong-talks-20141021-story.html#page=1|title=No breakthrough as Hong Kong officials open talks with students|work=Los Angeles Times|date=21 October 2014|access-date=23 October 2014|first=Tiffany|last=Ap}}</ref>

The political reform uproar caused Lam to lose her long-held title as one of the most popular government officials when her approval ratings in a University of Hong Kong poll plunged to its lowest level since she became Chief Secretary.<ref name="Straits" /> The constitutional reform proposals were defeated in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] in June 2015.

===Lead-in-water scandal and controversies===
Lam sparked controversy when she was the only principal official not to offer an apology for the [[2015 Hong Kong heavy metal in drinking water incidents|lead-in-water scandal]], insisting that, "even though the commission’s hearings reflected an inadequate awareness by government departments and flaws in the monitoring system, it did not necessarily equate to particular officials not following laws or neglecting duties – because of that, they do not have to bear personal responsibility."<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Carrie Lam doesn’t have what it takes to be Hong Kong’s next chief executive|date=2 June 2016|first=Albert|last=Cheng|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref> She fought back [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrat]] legislators in a Legislative Council meeting, criticising the pan-democrats for politicising the scandal, stating that she could be as bold as she wants as "a government official with no expectation is always courageous". Her words were criticised for being arrogant.

She stirred another controversy when she, in a speech to open the Caritas Bazaar in 2015, Lam cited the eight [[Beatitudes]], saying "Some said that the eighth blessing applies very well to me – it says, 'blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven' – there is already a place reserved for me in heaven." Senior cleric, The Reverend Thomas Law Kwok-Fai, told the media "No one would say that about themselves&nbsp;... I won’t dare to myself", while a senior lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said that Lam sounded arrogant.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chief Sec.

===Palace Museum controversy===
In December 2016, Lam was under fire when she announced a deal with Beijing for the plans for a [[Hong Kong Palace Museum]] as the chair of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority without any public consultation and transparency during the decision-making process. She was also criticised for appointing architect Rocco Yim Sen-kee to start a HK$4.5 million feasibility study for building the museum and exhibition centre complex behind closed doors months before the authority board chose the architect as its design consultant. Lam linked the backlash to her announcement that she would "reconsider" running in the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive election]] after incumbent Leung Chun-ying said he would not seek a second term.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Chief Secretary Carrie Lam links Beijing Palace Museum row to leadership bid|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2060972/hong-kong-chief-secretary-carrie-lam-links-beijing-palace|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=10 January 2017}}</ref> Lam previously said that she would retire in the English countryside with her family after her term ended in 2017.<ref name="Straits" /><ref name="retire">{{cite news|title=Mom's the word for a retired Lam|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=168932|date=4 May 2016|newspaper=The Standard}}</ref>

[[File:Hong Kong reactions to John Tsang and Carrie Lam election campaign 1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Carrie Lam held an election rally with her star-studded campaign team on 3 February 2017.]]
Lam formally announced her plan to enter the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive election]] after resigning as Chief Secretary on 12 January 2017, ending her 36-year government career. She also set out what she described as an eight-point "achievable new vision" with a call to play to "strengths with determination and confidence".<ref>{{cite news|title=Carrie Lam declares bid to lead Hong Kong|date=12 January 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2061552/carrie-lam-resigns-hong-kongs-no-2-official-ahead-expected?spm=0.0.0.0.yqPad3}}</ref> The election rally with the campaign slogan of "We Connect" including the catchwords "We Care, We Listen, We Act" was attended by many pro-Beijing figures and tycoons from both the [[Henry Tang]] and [[Leung Chun-ying]] camps in the last election. She also revealed a star-studded campaign team, which included council of chairpersons and senior advisers consisting of heavyweights including senior pro-Beijing politicians and tycoons.<ref>{{cite news|title=Carrie Lam opts for ‘we connect’ as campaign slogan, promising to break stalemate, overcome division in Hong Kong society|date=3 February 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2067829/carrie-lams-chief-executive-campaign-rally-draws-supporters}}</ref>

On 6 February, multiple media reports said [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) chairman [[Zhang Dejiang]], who was simultaneously head of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]'s [[Central Coordination Group for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs]], and [[Sun Chunlan]], head of the party's [[United Front Work Department]], were in Shenzhen to meet with some [[Election Committee]] members from the major business chambers and political groups.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2068373/state-leader-zhang-dejiang-meets-hong-kong-politicians-and|title=State leader Zhang Dejiang meets Hong Kong politicians and business leaders in Shenzhen|date=6 February 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref> It was reported that Zhang told the electors that the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo of the Communist Party]] had decided to support Carrie Lam in the election.<ref>{{cite news|title=【特首跑馬仔】張德江南下深圳傳話   消息人士：張稱林鄭是中央唯一支持的特首人選 (11:05)|url=http://news.mingpao.com/ins/instantnews/web_tc/article/20170206/s00001/1486375279437|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=6 February 2017}}</ref>

In response to the criticism of not having a full election platform, Lam revealed her manifesto titled "Connecting for Consensus and A Better Future" on 27 February, two days before the nomination period ended. The platform focused on reforming the government structure and boosting the economy, but did not make any promise on relaunching the political reform or [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23 legislation]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Carrie Lam’s election manifesto focuses on economy, government reforms|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2074393/pro-democracy-protesters-crash-carrie-lam-campaign-event|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=27 February 2017}}</ref> Carrie Lam submitted a total of 579 nominations on 28 February, just 22 votes short of the final number needed to win the race. Lam dominated in the pro-Beijing business and political sectors, winning three-quarters of the votes in the business sector, but failed to receive any nomination from the pro-democracy camp.

On 26 March 2017, Lam was elected Chief Executive with 777 votes in the 1,194-member Election Committee, 197 more votes than she got in the nomination period. She is the first female leader of Hong Kong, the first candidate to be elected without leading in the polls and the first leader to have graduated from the [[University of Hong Kong]]. She pledged to "heal the social divide" and "unite our society to move forward" in her victory speech.<ref>{{cite news|title=‘The work of uniting society begins now’: Carrie Lam pledges to heal Hong Kong’s divide|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2082226/new-leader-carrie-lam-pledges-heal-divide-hong-kong-society|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=26 March 2017}}</ref>

===Suppression on localists and independentists===
====Disqualifications of localists====
{{main|Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy}}
In July 2017 weeks after Lam sworn in, four pro-democracy legislators [[Leung Kwok-hung]], [[Yiu Chung-yim]], [[Nathan Law]] and [[Lau Siu-lai]] who were legally challenged for their [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|oath-taking manners]] by the then Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Rimsky Yuen]] were disqualified by the court. The event caused the quick deterioration of the relations between the pro-democracy camp and the government after the strained relations had been improved compared to Lam's predecessor Leung Chun-ying.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong pan-democrats warn of Legislative Council turmoil|date=18 July 2017|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2103118/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-non-committal-pan-democrats|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref> Lam pledged she would not target more pro-democrats in oath-taking controversy.<ref>{{cite news|title=I won’t target more Hong Kong pan-democrats in oath-taking saga, Carrie Lam says|date=15 July 2017|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2102802/i-wont-target-more-hong-kong-pan-democrats-oath-taking-saga|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>

In the [[2018 Hong Kong by-election|2018 Legislative Council by-election]] for four of the six vacancies left by the disqualified legislators, [[Demosistō]] candidate [[Agnes Chow]] was disqualified for her party's platform of calling for "self-determination". After the [[European Union]] issued a statement warning that banning Chow from the by-election "risks diminishing Hong Kong’s international reputation as a free and open society", Lam defended the returning officer's decision, but denied that she had anything to do with the returning officer, stating that "there are absolutely no grounds for that sort of accusation or allegation of pressure."<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong’s leader rejects foreign criticism over barring of democracy activist Agnes Chow from legislative by-election|date=30 January 2018|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2131168/european-union-leads-chorus-disapproval-over-decision-bar}}</ref>

In the [[November 2018 Kowloon West by-election]], the candidacy of the ousted legislator Lau Siu-lai was also disqualified by the returning officer as she advocated for "self-determination" on her 2016 electoral platform.<ref>{{cite news|title=‘Gov’t twisted my words’: Lau Siu-lai leads democrats in protest against her election ban|date=13 October 2018|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/10/13/govt-twisted-words-lau-siu-lai-leads-democrats-protest-election-ban/|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}</ref> Her ally and elected legislator [[Eddie Chu]], who signed the same statement in the 2016 election, was also barred from running in the rural representative election in December 2018.

====Ban on pro-independence party====
{{main|Hong Kong National Party|Victor Mallet visa controversy}}
In July 2018, the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] unprecedentedly served the convenor of the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence]] [[Hong Kong National Party]] [[Chan Ho-tin]] a notice under the [[Societies Ordinance]] and sought to ban the Party. The police claimed that the party has engaged in [[sedition]] and that the party may be banned on grounds of national security with respect to Chinese territorial integrity. The notice contained highly detailed surveillance material on the party leadership's public engagements. On 24 October 2018, Chan Ho-tin and party spokesman Jason Chow Ho-fai filed appeals against the ban with the Chief Executive and [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] but were eventually rejected.<ref name="HKNPappeal"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong National Party's call for ‘armed revolution’ no mere political slogan but a threat to safety and order, security minister John Lee says|date=24 September 2018|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2165439/hong-kong-issues-unprecedented-ban-separatist-party}}</ref>

In August, a controversy erupted in 2018 when the [[Foreign Correspondents' Club]] (FCC) hosted a lunchtime talk with Chan Ho-tin on 14 August. A ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist Victor Mallet, vice-chairman of the press organisation, chaired the session.<ref name=time5450061>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5450061/hong-kong-financial-times-journalist-barred/|title=Financial Times Editor Barred Entry into Hong Kong|website=Time|date=8 October 2018}}</ref> The event was opposed by the governments of China and Hong Kong, because the issue of independence supposedly crossed one of the "bottom lines" on national sovereignty.<ref name=bbc45769811>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45769811|title=Hong Kong rejects visa for FT editor|date=6 October 2018|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name=scmp2168041>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2168041/hong-kong-denied-journalist-victor-mallets-visa-influence|title=Ex-British foreign minister, US senator urge action on Hong Kong visa refusal|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 November 2018}}</ref> Upon returning to Hong Kong after a visit to Bangkok, Mallet was denied a working visa by the Hong Kong government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2167429/financial-times-journalist-victor-mallet-re-enters-hong-kong|title=Financial Times journalist Victor Mallet allowed back into Hong Kong for seven days only – even though British tourists can stay for six months|work=South China Morning Post|date=8 October 2018}}</ref> He was then subjected to a four-hour interrogation by immigration officers upon his return from Thailand on Sunday, 7 October before he was finally allowed to enter Hong Kong on a seven-day tourist visa.<ref name=scmp2172430>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2172430/refusal-let-british-financial-times-journalist-enter-hong|title=Ban on journalist risks undermining business confidence, UK minister warns|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 November 2018}}</ref> Carrie Lam refused to make any comment, only stating that the Immigration Department was not obliged to explain individual cases.<ref name="scmp2168041"/>

===Infrastructure projects===
====Express Rail Link co-location plan====
In July 2017, the Lam administration proposed co-location arrangement of the [[Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link]] (XRL) has sparked concerns that it might constitute a breach of the Basic Law and undermine Hong Kong's autonomy of "[[One Country, Two Systems]]", especially regarding the immigration control issue. In January 2018, Carrie Lam slammed the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] for its criticism on the "co-location arrangement" which would allow customs officers from Mainland China to set up checkpoints and exercise jurisdiction inside the [[West Kowloon Station]].<ref name=ejinsight20151205>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151205-why-we-shouldnt-stick-to-the-colocation-system/|title=Why we shouldn’t stick to the co-location arrangement|work=EJ Insight}}</ref> The Bar Association criticized the arrangement for distortion of the Basic Law, stating it damages the rule of law in Hong Kong as Article 18 was clearly written and leaves no room for any interpretation which would allow Chinese law to apply in any certain part of HKSAR.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/28/beijings-distortion-hong-kong-basic-law-greatly-undermines-rule-law-legal-experts-warn/|title=Beijing’s ‘distortion’ of Hong Kong Basic Law greatly undermines rule of law, legal experts warn|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

Lam defended the bill and responded by stating that "some Hong Kong legal professionals have an elitist mentality or double standards, that is, they think that Hong Kong’s legal system is supreme, and that the mainland legal system – a big country with a 1.3 billion population – is wrong." Her statement prompted widespread disbelief as she appeared to defend Chinese legal system being better than Hong Kong's legal system which is derived from British system, accusing her of hypocrisy as she herself is seen as an elite out of touch with society, damaging the One Country, Two Systems principle and for attacking the character instead of the arguments of Hong Kong's lawyers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/02/rule-without-law-hong-kong-lawyers-hit-back-leader-carrie-lam-attacks-elitist-mentality/|title=‘Rule without law’: Hong Kong lawyers hit back as leader Carrie Lam attacks ‘elitist mentality’|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=2 January 2018}}</ref>

The long-debated plan was finally passed on 14 June 2018 in the Legislative Council by 40 to 20 votes after [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council President]] [[Andrew Leung]] capped debate time for the bill at 36 hours to counter pro-democrats' filibustering.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong’s controversial China rail checkpoint bill finally passed by lawmakers amid protests, delays and expulsions|date=14 June 2018|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2150873/hong-kongs-controversial-china-rail-checkpoint-bill-finally}}</ref> The cross-border Express Rail Link was opened on 22 September 2018, followed by the opening of another cross-border infrastructure [[Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge]] on 23 October 2018 by [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] general secretary [[Xi Jinping]]. Lam entering the venue side by side with Xi and ahead of [[Chief Executive of Macau|Macau Chief Executive]] [[Fernando Chui]] and [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|First Vice Premier]] [[Han Zheng]]. The entrance raised eyebrows among those who saw it as a departure from protocol for her to walk in front of top mainland officials.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chinese President Xi Jinping hails Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge as showpiece of innovation and integration|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/transport/article/2169743/hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge-top-officials-gather|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=23 October 2018}}</ref>

[[File:香港特首林鄭發表施政報告2.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Carrie Lam published the second [[policy address of Hong Kong|policy address]] in her term of office in October 2018.]]

====Lantau Tomorrow Vision====
{{main|Lantau Tomorrow Vision}}
In October 2018, Lam launched a development plan in her second [[policy address of Hong Kong|policy address]] which suggested the construction of artificial islands with a total area of about 1,700 hectares through massive [[land reclamation]] near [[Kau Yi Chau]] and [[Hei Ling Chau]] of the eastern waters of [[Lantau Island]].<ref>{{cite news|work=Hong Kong Government|date=10 October 2018|title=Lantau a development priority|url=https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2018/10/20181010/20181010_103500_083.html}}</ref> The project meets with controversies and opposition for its high cost of estimated HK$500 billion (US$63.8 billion) – amounting to half of the city's fiscal reserves – as well as environmental concerns.

===Late 2018 to early 2019 crises===
====UGL case closure====
{{main|Leung Chun-ying–UGL agreement}}
On 12 December 2018, the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC) announced it would not take any "further investigative action" against Leung Chun-ying over his receipt of HK$50 million from the Australian engineering firm [[UGL Limited|UGL]], ending the four-year marathon probe. The [[Department of Justice]] also issued a statement claiming there was "insufficient evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction" against Leung for any criminal offence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2177693/former-hong-kong-chief-executive-cy-leung-cleared-any|title=Former Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung cleared of any wrongdoing over HK$50 million UGL payment after four-year ICAC probe|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=12 December 2018}}</ref>

Carrie Lam defended [[Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]] who was strongly criticised for not following the conventional procedure of seeking external legal advice in the UGL case. Lam said Cheng had made a professional call and she hoped the UGL saga, which had been a point of contention for four years, could finally end.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam defends Justice Secretary’s decision not to seek external advice in CY Leung case|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2179897/critics-justice-department-should-not-dwell-decision-not|date=28 December 2018|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>

====Age threshold of the elderly CSSA====
In January 2019, the Lam administration announced that the age threshold for elderly [[Comprehensive Social Security Assistance]] (CSSA) would jump from 60 to 65, starting in February. She faced opposition from both the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy legislators, in which she responded that it was the Legislative Council who approved the change in the CSSA scheme, as part of the 2018 Budget. Her remarks attracted backlashes from the legislators as well as the public. On 18 January, Lam backed down by announcing that people affected would get a new employment support supplement that would cover the cut. The Lam government also made an U-turn by suspending the controversial plan to impose a HK$200 penalty on Hong Kong's senior citizens claiming welfare payments without joining a job programme.<ref name="CSSA"/>

====$4,000 handout scheme====
The government was also under fire by the HK$4,000 handout scheme proposed in the [[Financial Secretary]] [[Paul Chan Mo-po|Paul Chan]]'s 2018 Budget in which adult residents would get up to HK$4,000 if they do not own property or get government benefits. The application procedure was criticised for being too complicated. Applicants were initially required to provide an address proof. Facing the criticism, the government later waived the address proof requirement.<ref name="CSSA">{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam admits welfare failings after uproar over elderly CSSA changes and cash handout applications|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2184078/hong-kong-chief-executive-carrie-lam-admits-welfare-failings|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=29 January 2019}}</ref>

Amid the UGL case and the mismanagements, the average score of Carrie Lam further plunged to a new low in mid January to 50.9 in the poll by the [[University of Hong Kong]], dropping 5.5 points from the previous month. Her net approval rating fell 21 percentage points to a new low.<ref>{{cite news|title=Approval ratings for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and justice chief Teresa Cheng hit new lows|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2182218/approval-ratings-hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-and-justice|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=15 January 2019}}</ref> In another poll conducted by [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], Lam scored the lowest point of only 50.9 per cent – 1.8 percentage points lower than the previous month.<ref>{{cite news|title=Another U-turn on welfare as HK$200 penalty for elderly Hongkongers not seeking work put on hold|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=28 January 2019|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2183930/another-u-turn-welfare-hk200-penalty-elderly-hongkongers-out}}</ref> Lam softened her tone after the widespread criticism. "The implementation of these measures has made people question the ability of this administration to govern," Lam said. "I completely accept this criticism."<ref name="CSSA"/>

====Cross-harbour tunnel toll plan====
The Lam administration first presented a cross-harbour tunnel toll plan in January 2019 to balance the traffic between the three cross-harbour tunnels by raising tolls at the publicly operated overused [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] and [[Eastern Harbour Tunnel]], while lowering them for the privately run [[Western Harbour Tunnel]] which was underused because of its higher charges. But [[Secretary for Transport and Housing]] [[Frank Chan Fan|Frank Chan]] abruptly withdrew it after strong opposition from the Legislative Council. The government made two changes to the motion in the hope of getting more support, but legislators across the political spectrum remained unconvinced. In March, Carrie Lam said her government has decided to shelve the plan for the second time as the government could not get enough votes in the legislature, symbolising the first defeat of the Lam administration.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dropping cross-harbour tunnel toll plan for second time ‘does not weaken Hong Kong government’, says leader Carrie Lam|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3003280/dropping-cross-harbour-tunnel-toll-plan-second-time-does|date=26 March 2019|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>

[[File:Demonstration in Wan Chai Hennessy Road overview 20190609.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Protesters demonstrating against the extradition bill on 9 June 2019.]]

====Introduction of the bill and opposition====
In mid-2019, the Lam government introduced [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|a bill to amend the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance]]. This sparked opposition which expressed fears about the city opening itself to Mainland Chinese law and urged the government to establish an extradition arrangement with Taiwan only.<ref name="extradition">{{cite news|title=Extradition bill not made to measure for mainland China and won’t be abandoned, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3004067/extradition-bill-not-made-measure-mainland-china-and-wont|date=1 April 2019|work=South China Morning Post}}</ref> Lam insisted that she would proceed with the bill and that the Legislative Councillors must still pass new extradition laws before their summer break.<ref>{{cite news|title=New extradition laws still urgent, says Carrie Lam|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1455134-20190429.htm|work=RTHK|date=29 April 2019}}</ref> Lam also claimed that the bill controversy had been "escalated" by foreign powers, allegedly seizing the opportunity to attack the mainland's legal system and human rights record.<ref name="escalated">{{cite news|title=Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam defends Beijing’s involvement in extradition bill row, pointing out foreign powers ‘escalated’ controversy|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3011104/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-defends-beijings-involvement|date=21 May 2019|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref> She survived the first motion of no-confidence against her with the backing of the pro-Beijing majority in the legislature on 29 May.

The June 9 peaceful demonstration against the bill saw a new high number of over a million people marching in the streets as the organisers claimed, but the government issued a press statement, that it "acknowledge[s] and respect[s] that people have different views on a wide range of issues", but insisted the second reading debate on the bill would resume on 12 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201906/09/P2019060900587.htm?fontSize=1|title=Government response to procession|date=9 June 2019|work=The Hong Kong Government}}</ref> On the day of the second reading, the protest outside the government headquarters later descended into violent clashes with the police. Amid the clashes, Lam appeared in a [[TVB]] interview where she was in tears when asked if she betrayed Hong Kong, replying "I grew up with all Hong Kong people and my love for this place has prompted me to make many personal sacrifices."

====Persisting protests====

The protests took a dramatic turn on 1 July, the 22nd anniversary of the [[handover of Hong Kong]] as a group of protesters [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex|stormed the Legislative Council Complex]] and vandalised the building, leaving graffiti such as "It was you who told me peaceful marches did not work."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/world/hong-kong-protests-graffiti-parliament|title=Hong Kong protests: What graffiti in the parliament conveys|first=Fox News|last=Staff|date=2 July 2019|publisher=Fox News Channel|access-date=29 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829234550/https://www.foxnews.com/world/hong-kong-protests-graffiti-parliament|archive-date=29 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Lam refused to grant any of the five key demands requested by the protesters, namely the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, a commission of inquiry into the police misconduct, release and a possible [[amnesty]] of the arrested protesters, the retraction of the categorisation of the protests as "riots" and universal suffrage of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council. As the protests intensified and spread to different districts of the city, Lam saw her support in August 2019 fall to a record low of 17 per cent, with those opposed hitting 76 per cent, according to a survey released by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute. Satisfaction with the SAR government fell to 14 per cent, the lowest ever recorded in post-colonial times. Notwithstanding a 2017 pledge, she refused to resign, claiming the community needed her to "hold the fort".<ref>{{cite news|title=Faith in Hong Kong leader and gov’t dips to lowest point in post-colonial history – survey|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/28/faith-hong-kong-leader-govt-dips-lowest-point-post-colonial-history-survey/|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|last=Cheng|first=Kris|date=28 August 2019|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>

On 2 September 2019, ''[[Reuters]]'' published a recording of a behind-the-door talk that Lam had given in late August 2019 to several businesspeople. Lam said that "for a Chief Executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable. It's just unforgivable. If I have a choice, the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology, is to step down." She also said "the political room for [the Chief Executive who serve two masters, Beijing and the Hong Kong people] maneuvering is very, very, very limited." Lam responded that the leak was "very inappropriate", and that she had "not even contemplated tendering resignation".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pomfret |first1=James |last2=Torode |first2=Greg |title=Exclusive: 'If I have a choice, the first thing is to quit' – Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam – transcript |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-carrielam-transcrip-idUSKCN1VO0KK |website=[[Reuters]] |access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kuo |first1=Lily |last2=Yu |first2=Verna |title=Hong Kong protests: Carrie Lam denies offering to resign |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-denies-she-considered-resigning |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=3 September 2019 |date=3 September 2019}}</ref> Shortly after that, on 4 September Lam formally withdrew the bill after three months of unprecedented anti-government protests, but gave no sign of stepping down or conceding to any of the protesters' other four key demands.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announces formal withdrawal of the extradition bill and sets up a platform to look into key causes of protest crisis|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3025641/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-announce-formal-withdrawal|newspaper=SCMP|date=4 September 2019|access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref> She only repeatedly stated that the [[Complaints Against Police Office]] (CAPO), a unit within the Police Force, and the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC), a monitoring body, would still be able to handling the complaint cases as the accusations against police mismanagement, brutality and corruption mounted up, including the [[2019 Yuen Long attack|July 21 Yuen Long attack]] and [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|August 31 Prince Edward station attack]].<ref name="hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn">{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/09/04/breaking-hong-kong-officially-withdraw-extradition-bill-legislature-still-no-independent-commission-inquiry/|title=Hong Kong to officially withdraw extradition bill from legislature, but still no independent probe into crisis|first=Holmes|last=Chan|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=4 September 2019|access-date=4 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190904100404/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/09/04/breaking-hong-kong-officially-withdraw-extradition-bill-legislature-still-no-independent-commission-inquiry/|archive-date=4 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Lam also held a dialogue session was held on 26 September as she pledged to communicate with the public, but no subsequent session has been held since then.<ref name="guardian_20190926_dialoguesession">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-public-anger-dialogue-session|title=Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam faces public anger in 'dialogue session'|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 September 2019|access-date=1 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930182421/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-public-anger-dialogue-session|archive-date=30 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Electoral defeat and impeachment attempt====
In the [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|November District Council elections]] which were seen as a de facto referendum on the persisting protests, Lam's pro-Beijing camp suffered from the largest electoral defeat in Hong Kong history with pro-democrats gaining more than 240 seats, over 80 per cent of the available seats, and controlling 17 of the 18 District Councils.<ref name="guardian_20191124_landslidevictory">{{cite news|title=Hong Kong voters deliver landslide victory for pro-democracy campaigners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers|work=The Guardian|date=24 November 2019}}</ref> Carrie Lam said that her government would "listen humbly" and "seriously reflect" on views expressed at the election and would set up an independent review committee to look at cause of social unrest, modelling on Britain's response to the [[2011 Tottenham riots]], fell short of the protesters' demand on an independent commission of inquiry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong District Council election: No concessions, but gov’t will reflect and improve, says Chief Exec.

Lam said she was disappointed by the passage of the Act, and said the Hong Kong freedom had not been eroded.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong’s freedom has not been eroded, says leader Carrie Lam says after US passes law in support of protesters|date=3 December 2019|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/12/03/hong-kongs-freedom-not-eroded-says-leader-carrie-lam-says-us-passes-law-support-protesters/|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}</ref>

In December, 25 pro-democrat legislators tabled an impeachment motion to form an independent investigative committee to examine claims that Lam's conduct constituted a "serious breach of the law and dereliction of duty".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Lawmakers in Impeachment Bid Against City's Leader Carrie Lam|date=4 December 2019|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/impeachment-12042019110630.html|work=Radio Free Asia}}</ref> Despite the motion being defeated, with 36 voted "no" and 26 voted yes, Lam received criticism from both pro-democracy and pro-Beijing legislators for mishandling the extradition bill and the protests.<ref>{{cite news|title=Motion to impeach Hong Kong Chief Exec.

===COVID-19 outbreak===
{{main|COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong}}
The months-long anti-government protests and the alleged initial mishandling of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Hong Kong|coronavirus outbreak]] cost Carrie Lam's substantial public support. A Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute survey in late January found 75 per cent of respondents were dissatisfied with the government's response to the outbreak, while Lam's support rating sunk to nine per cent in late February, the lowest on record for any leader.<ref>{{cite news|title=2019 Movement, Winter Coronavirus — Is Hong Kong’s springtime coming?|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article52124|date=20 February 2020|work=Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières|first=Ben|last=Hillier}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=林鄭民望再創新低　支持率首跌至單位數|date=2020-02-25|work=Stand News 立場新聞|url=https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E6%9E%97%E9%84%AD%E6%B0%91%E6%9C%9B%E5%86%8D%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E4%BD%8E-%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E7%8E%87%E9%A6%96%E8%B7%8C%E8%87%B3%E5%96%AE%E4%BD%8D%E6%95%B8/|access-date=2020-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225134028/https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E6%9E%97%E9%84%AD%E6%B0%91%E6%9C%9B%E5%86%8D%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E4%BD%8E-%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E7%8E%87%E9%A6%96%E8%B7%8C%E8%87%B3%E5%96%AE%E4%BD%8D%E6%95%B8/|archive-date=2020-02-25|url-status=live}}</ref> In February 2020, a confidential report by Carrie Lam to the central government revealed that Lam's attempt to win back the public trust and support by effectively handling the coronavirus outbreak in which she believed would serve as a political turnaround for the coming election.<ref>{{cite news|title=林鄭呈中央報告曝光　藉抗疫圖翻盤　篤背脊　泛民：令人作嘔　建制：佢冇得救|newspaper=蘋果日報|date=2020-02-23|url=https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/20200223/3FYZEKJDUNKRYC5PRDKHMOABIQ/|access-date=2020-02-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200223081321/https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/20200223/3FYZEKJDUNKRYC5PRDKHMOABIQ/|archive-date=2020-02-23|url-status=live}}</ref>

===National security legislation===
{{main|Hong Kong national security law}}
In May 2020, the Beijing authorities initiated a plan for implementing the national security law for Hong Kong which would prominently criminalise "separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference", which many interpreted as a crackdown on civil liberties, government critics, and the [[Hong Kong independence|independence movement]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lily Kuo|date=29 May 2020|title=China threatens 'countermeasures' against UK over Hong Kong crisis|work=the Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/hong-kong-crisis-china-support-police-warns-us-interfere-trump|access-date=3 June 2020}}</ref> Carrie Lam welcomed the adoption of the draft decision on national security law, stressing that the SAR government will "fully cooperate with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) to complete the relevant work on legislation as soon as possible."

On October 14, 2020, the United States Department of State released a report on 10 individuals who materially contributed to the failure of China to meet its obligations under the Sino–British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's Basic Law. Lam was on the list. <ref>{{cite web |last1= U.S. Department of State | title= Identification of Foreign Persons Involved in the Erosion of the Obligations of China Under the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law |url= https://www.state.gov/identification-of-foreign-persons-involved-in-the-erosion-of-the-obligations-of-china-under-the-joint-declaration-or-the-basic-law/  |access-date=14 October 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201015031346/https://www.state.gov/identification-of-foreign-persons-involved-in-the-erosion-of-the-obligations-of-china-under-the-joint-declaration-or-the-basic-law/ | archive-date=14 October 2020}}</ref>

In November 2020, Lam said that the national security law was "remarkably effective" and that "After a year of social unrest with fear for personal safety, Hong Kong people can once again enjoy their basic rights and freedoms according to the law."<ref>{{Cite web|title=CE hails 'highly trusted' police, new security law - RTHK|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1561797-20201125.htm?|access-date=2020-11-26|website=news.rthk.hk|language=en-gb}}</ref> In contrast to her opinion, activist [[Nathan Law]] said, after the expulsion of 4-pro democracy lawmakers from the Hong Kong Legislative Council, that "Erosion of Hong Kong's freedom has reached a new height."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nathan Law: “Erosion of Hong Kong’s freedom has reached a new height”|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2020/11/nathan-law-erosion-hong-kong-s-freedom-has-reached-new-height|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en}}</ref>

=== Sanctions ===
In August 2020, Lam and ten other officials were [[International sanctions|sanctioned]] by the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]] under an executive order by President [[Donald Trump]] for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.<ref>{{cite news |title=US sanctions Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, police chief and 9 other top officials for 'undermining autonomy' |url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/08/07/breaking-us-sanctions-hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-police-chief-and-other-top-officials-for-undermining-autonomy/ |access-date=7 August 2020 |work=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP |date=7 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1088 |publisher= [[United States Department of the Treasury]] |title= Treasury Sanctions Individuals for Undermining Hong Kong’s Autonomy |date=7 August 2020 |access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref> The sanction is based on the [[Hong Kong Autonomy Act]] and Lam would be listed in the [[Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Macias |first1=Amanda |title=U.S. sanctions Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam for carrying out Chinese 'policies of suppression' |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/us-sanctions-hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam.html |access-date=7 August 2020 |work=CNBC |date=7 August 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

As a result of the sanctions Lam has lost access to her banking services. She told the  Hong Kong International Business Channel "I am using cash every day for everything. I have piles of cash at home because the government is paying my salary in cash.” Because the [[SWIFT]] is so important to the international banking system not even Chinese state owned banks will do business with sanctioned individuals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chang |first1=Chris |title=HK chief executive piles cash at home |url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4064942 |website=www.taiwannews.com.tw |access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref>

=== Disqualification of lawmakers ===
In November 2020, following the expulsion of 4 pro-democracy lawmakers from the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Lam revealed that it was she who had requested the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) for help with disqualifying the lawmakers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2020-11-12|title=Who initiated Beijing’s intervention in Legco?

I am not the one who can tell whether they will come back or not."<ref name=":0" />

=== Democracy ===
In November 2020, Lam said that when she first became Chief Executive, she "fantasised" about implementing [[Democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic reform in Hong Kong]], "but the bubbles burst quickly."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Wong|first=Rachel|date=2020-11-26|title=Policy Address 2020: No plan for Hong Kong democracy in my term, says Carrie Lam, as address receives lowest public rating yet|url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/11/26/policy-address-2020-no-plan-for-hong-kong-democracy-in-my-term-says-carrie-lam-as-address-receives-lowest-public-rating-yet/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|language=en-GB}}</ref> In addition, she claimed that democratic reform would only further divide society.<ref name=":1" /> In addition, Lam said that universal suffrage would not be implemented until Hong Kong's constitutional order and political system are "restored."<ref>{{Cite web|title='No universal suffrage until HK gets politics right' - RTHK|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1561941-20201125.htm?|access-date=2020-11-26|website=news.rthk.hk|language=en-gb}}</ref>

=== Criticism of teachers ===
Even though Lam introduced the failed [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|Hong Kong extradition bill]], Lam in November 2020 also said that the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|2019-2020 Hong Kong protests]] were partially due to the city's teachers, and that the government will take "stringent actions" against teachers deemed "incompetent or found misconducted."<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Govt will 'enhance quality' of HK teachers, says CE - RTHK|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1561808-20201125.htm?|access-date=2020-11-26|website=news.rthk.hk|language=en-gb}}</ref> Additionally, Lam said that "We cannot bear to see that with the infiltration of politics into school campuses, students are drawn into political turbulence or even misled to engage in illegal and violent acts."<ref name=":2" /> In response, [[Ip Kin-yuen]] said there was no evidence to back Lam's claim that teachers fueled the protests.<ref name=":2" />

==Honours==
In recognition of her "career achievements and contributions to the community", Lam was awarded the [[Gold Bauhinia Star]] and the [[Grand Bauhinia Medal]] in 2010 and 2016. In 2013 she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Social Sciences by [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]] and was made an Officier de la [[Légion d’Honneur]] by the French government in 2015.<ref name="CV"/>

Lam also received an honorary fellowship from the [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] for being "persons of distinction whom the College holds in high standing". In the 2019 anti-extradition bill protests, activists and politicians including three members of the [[House of Lords (United Kingdom)|House of Lords]] urged the university to revoke Lam's title, condemning her "hard line approach" against the protesters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Protestors take to street over Carrie Lam’s Wolfson Fellowship|url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/18287|first=Sasi|last=Valaiyapathi|work=[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]|date=16 November 2019|access-date=15 August 2020}}</ref> On 15 August 2020, Lam announced on her Facebook page that she has returned her honorary fellowship as she states that, "I was very disappointed that the college slandered others in an unfounded and unreasonable manner. Therefore, it was difficult to persuade myself to continue to have any contact with Wolfson College, so I also returned the honorary academician title ."<ref>{{Cite web|title=林鄭月娥 Carrie Lam|url=https://www.facebook.com/carrielam.hksar/posts/1565222013657359|access-date=2020-08-16|website=www.facebook.com|language=en}}</ref>

Wolfson College, which was already considering removing the title, responded that it had "raised concerns" about Lam's "commitment to the protection of human rights and the freedom of expression".<ref>{{cite news|last=Lau|first=Joyce|title=Hong Kong leader gives up Cambridge honorary fellowship|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/hong-kong-leader-gives-cambridge-honorary-fellowship|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=17 Aug 2020}}</ref>
