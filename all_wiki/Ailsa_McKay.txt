She served as Vice Dean of the [[Glasgow School for Business and Society]], and was also well known for her support of [[Scottish independence]] and as a key adviser to the Scottish government and First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] on economic and welfare state policies. Ailsa McKay is highlighted as a leading intellectual figure in the campaign for independence in Alex Salmond's 2015 book ''The Dream Shall Never Die''.<ref name="Salmond">[[Alex Salmond]], ''The Dream Shall Never Die: 100 Days that Changed Scotland Forever'', William Collins, 2015, {{ISBN|0008139768}}</ref> Both Salmond and his successor [[Nicola Sturgeon]] have highlighted McKay's influence on Scottish gender equality policies.

She was a member of the board of directors of the left-wing [[Jimmy Reid Foundation]] think tank, and was an adviser to the [[United Nations]]. With [[Margunn Bjørnholt]], she co-edited the book ''[[If Women Counted#Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics]]'', which was published days before her death. The Ailsa McKay Fellowship, the Ailsa McKay Lecture, one of the foremost honours in feminist economics, and the McKay House at [[Lenzie Academy]] are named in her honour.<ref>[http://www.caledonianblogs.net/wise/2015/09/24/lenzie-academy-honour-professor-ailsa-mckay/ Lenzie Academy honour Professor Ailsa Mckay], caledonianblogs.net</ref>

==Career and work==
McKay joined [[Glasgow Caledonian University]] as a lecturer in economics in 1991. She later became head of department for economics and international business and Vice Dean of the [[Glasgow School for Business and Society]]. She was [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Gender and Economics until her 2011 appointment as Professor of Economics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcu.ac.uk/gsbs/staff/professorailsamckay/ |title=Professor Ailsa McKay |publisher=Glasgow School for Business and Society |accessdate=8 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225232502/http://www.gcu.ac.uk/gsbs/staff/professorailsamckay/ |archivedate=25 December 2013  }}</ref>

Her 2005 book ''The Future of Social Security Policy'' is according to Almaz Zelleke in ''Basic Income Studies'', a "feminist critique of the neoclassical economic framework in which social security policies are traditionally assessed". The work argues that "this framework is biased in a way that prioritizes income-maintenance aspects of social security policy above all others."<ref>Almaz Zelleke, "Review of Ailsa McKay, ''The Future of Social Security Policy: Women, Work and a Citizens’ Basic Income''," ''Basic Income Studies'', 1:2, 2006</ref>

=== Basic income ===
McKay was a noted and early proponent of the [[basic income]] concept. She argued in 2001 that "social policy reform should take account of all gender inequalities and not just those relating to the traditional labor market" and that "the citizens' basic income model can be a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |author-link1=Ailsa McKay |year=2001 |title= Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income |url= |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 97–118 |doi=10.1080/13545700010022721 }}</ref>

===''Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics''===

Her final academic work is ''[[If Women Counted#Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics]]'', a new anthology in the field of [[feminist economics]] that went into print just days before her death, that aims to map the development in the field in the last two decades. In the opening chapter, "Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis," McKay and her co-editor [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] call for a reshaping of the economy, economic theory and the economics profession, taking into account "advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bjørnholt|first1=Margunn|author1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|last2=McKay|first2=Ailsa|editor1-last=Bjørnholt|editor1-first =Margunn|editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|editor2-last=McKay|editor2-first =Ailsa|title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|year=2014|publisher=[[Demeter Press]]|chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis|isbn=9781927335277}}</ref> The book was described by Winthrop Professor of Economics [[Alison Preston]] as "a timely reminder of the politics and economics underpinning what, how and by whom activities and outputs are valued. For those concerned with social justice and sustainable futures, this important and powerful book provides an invaluable and practical insight into issues that are in need of greater visibility." Economics commentator Maria Reinertsen compared the book to [[Thomas Piketty]]'s ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', arguing that "while Thomas Piketty's bestseller ''Capital in the Twenty-First Century'' barely tests the discipline's boundaries in its focus on the rich, ''Counting on Marilyn Waring'' challenges most limits of what economists should care about."<ref>''[[Morgenbladet]]'', 4–10 July 2014, pp. 6–7</ref> According to ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'', the book explores "a wide range of issues—including the fundamental meaning of economic growth and activity to consumption, health care, mortality, unpaid household work, mothering, education, nutrition, equality, and sustainability" and reveals "the breadth, depth, and substance that can grow from innovative ideas and critical analysis."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sullivan |first=T.E. |year= 2014 |title= Counting on Marilyn Waring: new advances in feminist economics |url= |journal=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages= 52–1517|doi= 10.5860/CHOICE.185300}}</ref> [[Diane Elson]] argues that "despite many valiant efforts, women do not as yet really count in the conduct of economic policy.

==Death and legacy ==
McKay died aged 50 on the morning of 5 March 2014, following a year-long battle with cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0223/economics-professor-passes-after-cancer-battle|title=Economics professor passes after cancer battle|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=6 March 2014|publisher=The Targe}}</ref>

First Minister of Scotland [[Alex Salmond]] praised McKay's "astonishing contribution as a feminist economist, both in arguing the case for women into work, and in being the principal author and arguer for many years for the transformation of childcare that will make that possible,"<ref name="eveningtimes" /> while Salmond's eventual successor [[Nicola Sturgeon]] described her as "an inspirational economist and feminist."<ref name="beaton">Connor Beaton, [http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0223/economics-professor-passes-after-cancer-battle Economics professor passes after cancer battle], 6 March 2014</ref> [[Scottish Labour Party|Scottish Labour]] leader [[Johann Lamont]] described her as a "woman of great wisdom".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/scotland-26550926 |work=BBC Democracy Live |title=Lamont says 'huge issues facing women' deeper than constitutional arrangements |publisher=BBC |date=12 March 2014 |accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>

Pamela Gillies, principal and vice-chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University, wrote: "In her far too early death, Scotland has lost an important force for good, the University has lost a greatly valued, committed and intellectually vibrant colleague and I have lost a dear friend. Professor Ailsa McKay will be missed by so many, but a scholarship founded in her name by the University she loved will inspire future generations of young, similarly feisty scholars to debate and to act for social change."<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119214405/http://www.gcu.ac.uk/gsbs/staff/professorailsamckay/ |url=http://www.gcu.ac.uk/gsbs/staff/professorailsamckay/ |title=Our Staff: Professor Ailsa McKay |archivedate=19 November 2014 |publisher=[[Glasgow Caledonian University]]}}</ref> Professor Michael Danson praised her "lifetime inspiring a better kind of economics in Scotland and across the world."<ref>Michael Danson, [http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/michael-danson/appreciation-of-ailsa-mckay-1963-%E2%80%93-2014 An appreciation of Ailsa McKay, 1963 – 2014], ''[[openDemocracy.net]]'', 10 March 2014</ref>

A January 2015 conference in honour of McKay attended by academics and politicians paid tribute to her work.
