In 1994 the ''New York Times'' commented on the company's influence by writing that its "made-over flea-market clothes put an end to the conspicuous consumption [of the fashion industry] of the 1980s."

The interior of the headquarters and furniture were painted entirely white with [[emulsion]], creating an aged look. In addition to the white surroundings, employees all wear "blouse blanche", white coats traditionally worn by [[Haute couture|couture]] craftsmen. The white coats are both a nod to history and aesthetics, as well as an equalizer, as all employees wear them, regardless of title.<ref name="another"/> By the summer of 2008 there were 14 Margiela boutiques.<ref name="Independent_2008"/>

===New design team and collections===
In October 2009, it was announced that [[Martin Margiela]] had resigned as creative director of Maison Martin Margiela, to varied speculation about the reasons.<ref name="vogue.co.uk"/><ref name="NYT_Wilson_2008"/> Following Margiela's departure, the anonymous design team continued to design the label, with no single creative director in place.<ref name="vogue.co.uk"/> CEO Giovanni Pungetti stated that "we want to stay avant-garde, and provocative, but without a new creative director. It’s a challenge. We know this. We will probably make mistakes, but the most important thing is to learn from them." The company expanded its homewares and interior design business in 2010,<ref name="Drapers_Oxberry_2009"/> and in July 2011 the house designed several concept hotel suites for La Maison Champs-Élysées in Paris.<ref name="vogue.co.uk"/>

By the fall of 2014, sources estimated that the brand generated about $126 million in annual revenues, with around 50 directly owned stores.
