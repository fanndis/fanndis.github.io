[[File:Ryan White.jpg|thumb|Ryan White in 1989]]
Elton John was inspired to start the organization after the passing of Indiana teenager, [[Ryan White]], who was infected with HIV by a blood transfusion and died in 1990.

In 1999, the [[World Health Organization]] announced that AIDS was [[Africa]]’s number one killer, with 33 million HIV infections and 14 million AIDS-related deaths. It was during this time that the Foundation funded palliative care in Africa to support 800,000 people to die with dignity and help over 800,000 children orphaned by AIDS.

In 2002, Elton John testified before [[United States Congress|U.S Congress]] pleading for more funds to fight the global AIDS epidemic, and in 2003, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] created [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]], the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the biggest fund for health in history.

During the following years, the Foundation continued to fund HIV testing, treatment and care services for key populations most at risk.

Elton John met with [[Emmanuel Macron|President Macron]] in 2019 and was awarded the [[Legion of Honour|Légion d'Honneur]] for his commitment to HIV/AIDS.

== Events ==


=== Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party ===
Every year, the foundation hosts a viewing party for the [[Academy Awards]]. It is an invitation-only event that has grown to become one of the most desired invitations in the entertainment industry, as well as one of the Elton John AIDS Foundation's most fruitful fundraising efforts. For the first few years, the party was a dinner held at the Maple Drive restaurant in Beverly Hills. The inaugural dinner was arranged by Patrick Lippet, another activist in Hollywood who was best known for his work with the Rock the Vote campaign. Lippet died from AIDS only three months after helping Elton John put together the first Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscar night party.

In 1998, the party moved to Spago, another upscale restaurant in Beverly Hills known for its celebrity clientele. It has moved multiple times since then with the West Hollywood Park in Los Angeles serving as the venue in since 2018.

The event features dinner, a live broadcast of the Academy Awards Ceremony, and a post-broadcast after-party with live music.

This annual event has raised millions of dollars, thanks to the generosity of the Foundation’s supporters, which helps the Foundation support HIV treatment and care for the most marginalized communities.

=== Midsummer Party ===
In July 2019, the Foundation held their first Midsummer Party event in the South of France to support HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, supporting services, and advocacy programs across the globe.

The star-studded evening was held at Johnny Pigozzi’s beautiful Villa Dorane at the end of [[Antibes|Cap d’Antibes]] and featured a cocktail reception and a sumptuous Provençal dinner with beautiful music provided by [[Stjepan Hauser]] of [[2Cellos]].
