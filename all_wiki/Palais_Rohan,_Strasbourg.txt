The '''Palais Rohan''' (Rohan [[Palace]]) in [[Strasbourg]] is the former residence of the [[prince-bishop]]s and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] of the [[House of Rohan]], an ancient [[French nobility|French noble]] family originally from [[Brittany]]. It is a major architectural, historical, and cultural landmark in the city.<ref name="strasbourg">{{cite web|title=Le Palais Rohan|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=le-palais-rohan|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref> It was built next to [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] in the 1730s, from designs by [[Robert de Cotte]], and is considered a masterpiece of [[French Baroque architecture]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=The message of a great European cathedral|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2006/05/the-message-of-a-great-european-cathedral/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=24 May 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sherwood|first1=Seth|title=36 Hours in Strasbourg, France|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/travel/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-strasbourg-france.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 December 2014}}</ref> Since its completion in 1742, the palace has hosted a number of [[List of French monarchs|French monarchs]] such as [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Napoleon]] and [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]], and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]].

Reflecting the history of Strasbourg and of France, the palace has been owned successively by the nobility, the municipality, the monarchy, the state, [[University of Strasbourg|the university]], and the municipality again. Its architectural conception and its [[iconography]] were intended to indicate the return of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to the city, which had been dominated by [[Protestantism]] for the previous two centuries. Thus the [[prelate]]'s apartments face the cathedral, to the north, and many of the statues, reliefs and paintings reflect the [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Borda d'Água|first1=Flávio|title=Le Palais Rohan : un joyau princier au coeur de Strasbourg|url=http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/bge/sites_html/bge-gazette/38/lieux_le_palais_Rohan.html|work=La Gazette des Délices|date=Summer 2013}}</ref>

Since the end of the 19th century the palace has been home to three of Strasbourg's most important museums: the [[Musée archéologique (Strasbourg)|Archaeological Museum]] (''Musée archéologique'', basement), the [[Musée des Arts décoratifs, Strasbourg|Museum of Decorative Arts]] (''Musée des arts décoratifs'', ground floor) and the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg|Museum of Fine Arts]] (''Musée des beaux-arts'', first and second floor). The municipal [[art gallery]], ''Galerie Robert Heitz'', in a lateral wing of the palace, is used for temporary exhibitions. The Palais Rohan has been listed since 1920 as a ''[[Monument historique]]'' by the [[French Ministry of Culture]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Palais des Rohan, actuellement Musée archéologique et Musée des Beaux Arts et Arts Décoratifs|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00085184|publisher=French Ministry of Culture|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Up to 1871 ===
In 1727 [[Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan]], bishop of Strasbourg since 1704 and [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] since 1712, commissioned the architect [[Robert de Cotte]] to design the palace; de{{nbsp}}Cotte provided initial plans the same year.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Étienne|title=Le Palais Rohan|date=2012|isbn=978-2-35125-098-3|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|location=Strasbourg|page=83}}</ref> Seven years prior, in 1720, Cardinal de{{nbsp}}Rohan had already charged de{{nbsp}}Cotte with renovation and embellishment works on his castle in [[Saverne]], the predecessor of the current [[Rohan Castle]].<ref name="strasbourg"/> De{{nbsp}}Cotte had also previously designed the [[Episcopal Palace (Strasbourg)|Hôtel du grand Doyenné]], the first ''[[hôtel particulier]]'' in [[Louis Quinze]] style built in Strasbourg. The Palais Rohan was built on the site of the former residence of the bishop, the "bishop's [[demesne]]",{{refn|name=Demesne|group=N|{{lang-de|link=no|bischöflicher Fronhof}}, shortened to ''Bischofshof'', "bishop's court",<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Bischofshof zu Strassburg|url=http://www.archi-wiki.org/photo-detail-2_place_du_ch%E3%A2teau__grande_%E3%8Ele_-_centre_ville__strasbourg-26013-evenement-idEvenement-16681-adresse598.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160605171117/http://www.archi-wiki.org/photo-detail-2_place_du_ch%E3%A2teau__grande_%E3%8Ele_-_centre_ville__strasbourg-26013-evenement-idEvenement-16681-adresse598.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 June 2016|publisher=archi-wiki.org|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref> also known as "bishop's palace" ({{lang-de|link=no|bischöfliche Pfalz}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=L'ancien Hôtel de Ville ou Pfalz|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=moyen-age|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>}} which is recorded since at least 1262.<ref>{{cite web|title=Place du château ou Fronhof|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=vieux-strasbourg|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref> The area itself is near the heart of the ancient [[Argentoratum]], first mentioned in 12{{nbsp}}BC.

Building work on the Palais Rohan took place from 1732 until 1742<ref>Martin, p. 94.</ref> under the supervision of the municipal architect [[Joseph Massol]], who also worked on the [[Hôtel de Hanau]] and the [[Hôtel de Klinglin]] during the early years of the project.

The [[ébéniste]] Bernard Kocke and the [[ironwork]]ers and [[Lock (security device)#lLocksmithing|locksmiths]] Jean-François Agon and his son Antoine Agon worked on the furnishings of the apartments, while the [[stucco]] was the work of the Italians Castelli and Morsegno.<ref>Martin, pp. 94–95, 116, 121, 153, 181, 184.</ref><ref name ="Collections eng.">{{cite web|title=Collections|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=collections-Arts-deco-en|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref> A budget of 344,000 [[French livre]]s had been established for the construction&nbsp;– 200,000 livres lent from the [[Cathedral chapter|Cathedral chapter (''Grand Chapitre'')]] and 144,000 raised as local taxes over a period of twelve years&nbsp;– but the final cost is estimated at one million French livres.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le pouvoir royal et l'architecture|url=http://www.crdp-strasbourg.fr/data/albums/idf_pouvoir_royal/index.php?img=7&parent=3|publisher=Base numérique du patrimoine d'Alsace|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref> The palace is mostly built in yellow [[sandstone]] from [[Wasselonne]],<ref name= "booking">{{cite web|title=Le Palais Rohan|url=http://www.mystrasbourg.com/data/adh_506_f1435062863.pdf|publisher=Strasbourg Convention Bureau}}</ref> with pink sandstone for the less visible parts.

Much of the furniture and many of the works of art in the Palais were sold, and in 1793 the eight life-sized mural portraits of prince-bishops decorating the ''Salle des évêques'' (Bishops' Hall) were destroyed.

The Palais Rohan remained the ''hôtel de ville'' until 1805. That year, the municipality presented it to [[Napoleon]], who returned the Hôtel de{{nbsp}}Hanau in exchange. Like the palace, the hôtel had been state-owned since the Revolution. The 1805 arrangement proved favourable for the municipality: the maintenance of the Hôtel de{{nbsp}}Hanau was less costly than that of the larger Palais Rohan. It pleased Napoleon, for whom the palace was the more conspicuous display of grandeur. As for the palace, imperial ownership meant renewed splendour. The present to Napoleon was officially accepted by decree on 21{{nbsp}}January 1806;<ref name="appartements">{{cite web|title=Les appartements|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=Les-appartements|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> the interiors were then refurbished by the architect [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]].<ref name="Martin"/> In the years before the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the return of Alsace to Germany, the Palais Rohan was the property of the French state, which was [[History of France|in turn]] an [[First French Empire|empire]], a [[Kingdom of France (1814–1830)|kingdom]], a [[July Monarchy|monarchy]], a [[French Second Republic|republic]], and again an [[Second French Empire|empire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=France, 1800–1900 A.D.|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/10/euwf.html|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Since 1871 ===
[[File:Palais épiscopal de Strasbourg-1744.jpg|thumb|290px|The palace on 5{{nbsp}}October 1744, during a visit of King [[Louis XV]] of France]]
The year 1871 signified the end of French rule and the beginning of German rule over Alsace, which had until 1681 been linked to Germany through the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=L'Alsace entre 1870 et 1914|url=http://www.crdp-strasbourg.fr/data/histoire/alsace_1870/|publisher=Centre régional de documentation pédagogique de Strasbourg|date=26 March 2012}}</ref> Having lost the Franco-Prussian War, France had to cede the [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Bas-Rhin]], [[Haut-Rhin]], and [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] (the territory also known as [[Alsace-Lorraine]], or ''Elsass-Lothringen'' in German) to the newly created [[German Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Franco-German War|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Franco-German-War|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Alsace from 1871 to 1918|url=http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/alsace-from-1871-to-1918/|publisher=Musée virtuel du protestantisme|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Now under new administration and having lost its residential purpose, the Palais Rohan had to be assigned a new role. Between 1872 and 1884, until the opening of the [[Palais Universitaire, Strasbourg|Palais universitaire]], it was used by the newly established ''Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität'', the Imperial German version of the [[University of Strasbourg]], as the seat of the [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] of law, philosophy, and sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=L'université impériale : 1872–1918|url=http://130anspalaisu.unistra.fr/index.php?id=21181#c97172|publisher=Université de Strasbourg|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> The palace then served as the university's library until the opening of the [[National and University Library]] in 1895.<ref>{{cite web|title=La bibliothèque nationale et universitaire de Strasbourg|url=https://mediadix.u-paris10.fr/cours/admin/adminpdf/TCAdminF3-7BNU.pdf|publisher=Université Paris Nanterre|accessdate=15 October 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018213039/https://mediadix.u-paris10.fr/cours/admin/adminpdf/TCAdminF3-7BNU.pdf|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After this, the palace again became the property of the city and was adapted to receive the municipal art collections that were being built up again by director [[Wilhelm von Bode]] after their total destruction during the [[Siege of Strasbourg]] (see below, [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg#Musée des beaux-arts|Musée des beaux-arts]]). The first section of the new ''Kunstmuseum der Stadt Strassburg'', established in 1898, was inaugurated in 1899.<ref name= "eventful history">{{cite web|title=A long and eventful history|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=histoire-du-reseau-des-musees-en|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Histoire|url=http://www.amisartsetmusees-strasbourg.fr/index.php/presentation-de-l-association/histoire|publisher=Société des amis des arts et des musées de Strasbourg|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>

After the return of Alsace to French rule in 1918, the new director of the ''Musée des beaux-arts'' and the ''Musée des arts décoratifs'', [[Hans Haug (art historian)|Hans Haug]] (1890–1965), put major efforts into presenting the Palais Rohan as a coherent whole again.<ref name= "eventful history"/> Strasbourg suffered during [[World War II]], and on 11{{nbsp}}August 1944 the palace was damaged by British and American bombs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bombardements de 1944|url=http://www.archi-wiki.org/?archiAffichage=adresseDetail&archiIdAdresse=598&archiIdEvenementGroupeAdresse=2931#10|publisher=archi-wiki.org|accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> After the war, restoration measures were soon undertaken under the supervision of the architects Robert Danis (1879–1949)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schnitzler|first1=Bernadette|title=Hans Haug, homme de musées : une passion à l'œuvre|date=2009|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|location=Strasbourg|isbn=978-2-35125-071-6|page=52}}</ref> and Bertrand Monnet (1910–1989),<ref>{{cite web|title=Bertrand Monnet|url=http://www.archi-wiki.org/personnalite-monnet__bertrand-208.html|publisher=archi-wiki.org|accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> but in 1947 a fire broke out and devastated a significant part of the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts. This fire was an indirect consequence of the bombing raids: because of the destruction inflicted on the palace, the building had suffered from damp, which was treated with [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|welding torches]], and poor handling of these caused the fire.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hubrecht|first1=Joël|last2=Le Bideau-Vincent|first2=Sandrine|last3=Mandrella|first3=David|title=Peintures flamandes et hollandaises du Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|location=Strasbourg|date=2009|isbn=978-2-35125-030-3|page=14}}</ref>

Rebuilding and refurbishing the palace took until well into the 1950s, with full restoration not completed until the 1990s.<ref>Recht, Foessel, Klein, p. 66.</ref> In 1989 a large [[trompe-l'œil]] [[fresco]] depicting the Roman goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] was rediscovered behind layers of plaster and white paint in the former dining hall, the eastern wing of the Synod Hall (see below, [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg#Apartments|Apartments]]). It is thought to have been concealed under Napoleonic ownership, and had been forgotten since.<ref>Schnitzler, p. 53.</ref>

=== Notable guests ===
[[File:Strasbourg rohan salon.JPG|290px|thumb|Fresco depicting Ceres, rediscovered in 1989]]
King [[Louis XV of France]] stayed in the palace from 5 to 10{{nbsp}}October 1744. [[Maria Josepha of Saxony, Dauphine of France]], spent two nights in the palace from 27 to 29{{nbsp}}January 1747.

== Structure ==
The palace is structured around a large and paved courtyard. It has a [[trapezoid]]al plan, and the land falls away toward the river [[Ill (France)|Ill]].<ref name="strasbourg"/> To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the [[Mansard roof]]), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg#Musée archéologique|Museums]]). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the ''quai des Bateliers'', is closed at both ends by elaborate [[wrought-iron]] gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.<ref>Martin, p. 87.</ref>

The riverside façade is formed by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The main part of the façade is symmetrically arranged around an [[avant-corps]] of four [[Column (architecture)|columns]] with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous [[Triangle|triangular]] [[pediment]], again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a [[Semicircle|semicircular]] pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost.<ref>Martin, pp. 87–90.</ref> The library wing was not part of the original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current ''rue de Rohan''. The architect, [[Robert de Cotte]], was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.<ref>Martin, pp. 51 and 83.</ref>

The courtyard façade of the main wing, in the same [[Classicism|classical style]] as its counterpart facing the Ill,<ref name="strasbourg"/> is narrower. A strong emphasis is put on the verticality of the windows, by which means the impression of height is accentuated. Again, a central avant-corps is crowned with a triangular pediment bearing [[Relief sculpture|reliefs]] and in this case also statues. Both façades are richly decorated with [[Allegory|allegorical]] [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascarons]] (depicting seasons, [[Four temperaments|temperaments]], continents and [[Classical element|elements]]), eighteen in all on the riverside façade and nine in all on the courtyard façade,<ref name="mascarons">{{cite web|last1=Parent|first1=Brigitte|title=Château (place du) N°02|url=http://www.mascaron.fr/portfolio/chateau-place-du-n2/|publisher=Les mascarons de Strasbourg|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> to which the riverside façade adds a pair of broad wrought-iron balconies. Due to the difference in width and the trapezoidal plan, the centres of the façades are not aligned.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The courtyard is divided in three sections separated by a row of [[arch]]es. The left section (as seen from the [[Strasbourg Cathedral|cathedral]]) belongs to the ''Communs'' wing, which housed the servants. The right section belongs to the [[stable]]s wing. Left and right of the façade are [[exedra]]s decorated with [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of [[Roman emperor]]s. The entrance to the palace is through the left exedra. Facing the courtyard façade is a [[peristyle]] with five arches. The central arch, the highest and widest, faces the centre of the façade and opens on the palace's main gate.<ref>Martin, pp. 58, 64, 75–76, 83, 87 and 90.</ref>

The front of the palace on ''Place du Château'' (called ''Place de{{nbsp}}l'Évêché'' between 1740 and 1793),<ref>{{cite web|title=Historique du nom de la place|url=http://www.archi-wiki.org/adresse-_place_du_ch%E3%A2teau__grande_%E3%8Ele_-_centre_ville__strasbourg-1297.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=1297&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&archiIdEvenementGroupeAdresse=2948&debut=#0|publisher=archi-wiki.org|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> designed in a more [[Baroque style]] than the rest of the palace, is wide and curved. The central gate is framed by two pairs of columns and juts out in the shape of a [[Triumphal arch]]. The upper part of the front section is crowned with statues representing [[Allegory of faith|allegories of faith]] such as "Religion" and "[[Eucharist]]", and personifications of [[Christian virtues]] such as "[[Mercy]]" and "[[Penance]]".<ref name="strasbourg"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Statues du Peristyle|url=http://www.archi-wiki.org/adresse-2_place_du_ch%E3%A2teau__grande_%E3%8Ele_-_centre_ville__strasbourg-598.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=598&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&archiIdEvenementGroupeAdresse=1867&debut=#7|publisher=archi-wiki.org|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> [[Plaster cast]]s of some of these statues are displayed in the [[lapidarium]] inside the [[Barrage Vauban]]. The wooden [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] ([[oak]]) and the walls east and west of the gate are decorated with trophies and [[Heraldic Symbolism|heraldic symbols]] relating to the House of Rohan and the [[episcopal polity]]. The two [[pavilion]]s connecting the ''Communs'' and the stable wings with the gate section are decorated with sixteen mascarons representing male and female [[Old Testament prophets]],<ref name="mascarons"/> and with crescent-shaped pediments, in contrast to the triangular pediments of the façades. The east (left) pavilion housed the palace's kitchens while the west (right) pavilion housed the offices of the [[ecclesiastical court]].<ref>Martin, pp. 58 and 64.</ref>

== Apartments ==
[[File:Décoration "rocaille", Palais Rohan, Strasbourg.jpg|290px|thumb|[[Gilding|Gilded]] stucco in the Bedchamber of the King]]
The apartments on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' today form a part of the ''[[Musée des Arts décoratifs, Strasbourg|Musée des arts décoratifs]]''.<ref name="appartements"/>

The chambers of the prince-bishops and cardinals of the [[House of Rohan]] are divided into the ''grand appartement'' (display space, facing the river, or south) and ''petit appartement'' (living space, facing the inner court and the cathedral, or north), as in the [[Palace of Versailles]].<ref>Recht, Foessel, Klein, p. 71.</ref> On either side of the suites are the two most spacious rooms of the palace, the [[Synod]] Hall (a single, vast room composed of the dining hall and the guards' hall, separated by a row of arches) and the library, which both extend over the entire longitudinal axis of the wing. The library also serves as the [[Nave (architecture)|nave]] of the palace's very small chapel. The ''grand appartement'' is composed of the ''Salle des évêques'' (Bishops' Hall)&nbsp;– the former ''[[Antechamber|Antichambre]] du roi''&nbsp;– the ''Chambre du roi'' (Bedchamber of the King), the ''Cabinet du roi'' ([[Cabinet (room)|Cabinet]] of the King), also known as the ''Salon d'assemblée'' ([[Assembly rooms|Assembly Room]]) and the ''Garde-robe du roi'' ([[Cloakroom]] of the King). The "petit appartement" is composed of the ''Antichambre du prince-évêque'', the ''Chambre du prince-évêque'', the ''Cabinet du prince-évêque'' (turned into ''Napoleon'''s bedchamber after 1800) and the ''Garde-robe du prince-évêque''. The castle's [[garderobe]] (''Cabinet de commodités'') is situated next to the cloakroom of the prince-bishop. The interiors were designed according to the decorative principles established by [[Jacques-François Blondel]] in his influential book ''De la distribution des maisons de plaisance et de la décoration des édifices en général'' (1738), and the stucco and [[Panelling#Boiserie|boiseries]] were influenced by the style of [[Nicolas Pineau]].<ref name ="Collections eng."/><ref name="appartements"/><ref>Martin, p. 50.</ref><ref>Recht, Foessel, Klein, p.&nbsp;67.</ref><ref name="page 184">Martin, p. 184.</ref>

Many of the original furnishings were sold in the wake of the [[French Revolution]]. Some works of art, including the [[overdoor]]s from the ''Salle des évêques'', part of the municipal collections, were destroyed with the museum situated in the [[Aubette (building)|Aubette]] when the [[Prussian Army]] shelled the city during the [[Siege of Strasbourg]] in 1870.<ref name="Le Palais Rohan"/> In the 20th century and especially during the reconstruction following the bomb damage of August 1944, a great deal of effort went into locating the surviving missing objects and replacing the lost works with identical or similar pieces.<ref>Schnitzler, pp. 191–192.</ref> They were supervised by the aforementioned Hans Haug, who had become director of the newly created network of the municipal museums on 1{{nbsp}}January 1945.<ref>Schnitzler, p. 186.</ref> Some elements, though, were never restored, such as the stucco of the library. It was lost in 1817 because of [[leak]]s through the ceiling; as the only free-standing part of the building, the library has a flat roof.<ref name="appartements"/><ref name="page 184"/>

Among the works of art on view in the apartments, several stand out for their artistic and historic value. The set of eight (originally nine) [[Tapestry|tapestries]] depicting "[[The History of Constantine]]" was woven around 1624 after [[modello]]s by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. It had been commissioned by [[Louis XIII of France]], who later presented it to the [[Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars|Marquis of Cinq-Mars]].<ref>Martin, p. 148.</ref> Three tapestries are displayed in the ''Chambre du roi'', one in the ''Cabinet du roi'', and four in the library. The set of eight 17th-century Italian busts of Roman emperors in the ''Salle des évêques'' belonged to the personal collection of [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. Both sets of works were bought in 1738 from the respective heirs by [[Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan|Armand Gaston de{{nbsp}}Rohan]].<ref>Martin, p.&nbsp;133.</ref>
Another bust of particular value is the [[marble]] portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by [[Edmé Bouchardon]].<ref name="page 184"/> It is also displayed in the library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745{{refn|name=Date1|group=N|The website of the ''Musées de Strasbourg'' erroneously writes "1743",<ref name="appartements"/> according to Étienne Martin, the carpet was woven between May and November 1745.}} imitation of a [[Turkish carpet]], woven in the [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson manufactory]] and bearing in its centre the [[coat of arms]] of Armand Gaston de{{nbsp}}Rohan.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The carpet covering the large table in the middle of the library was woven in [[Portuguese India]] around 1730.{{refn|name=Date2|group=N|The website of the ''Musées de Strasbourg'' erroneously writes "17th century"<ref name="appartements"/>}} It was given to the Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the [[Musée de Cluny, Paris|Musée de Cluny]] in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.<ref>Martin, pp. 184 and 222.</ref>
On display in most of the rooms are surviving works from [[Cardinal de Rohan|Louis René de{{nbsp}}Rohan]]'s vast collection of [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|Japanese vases]] and [[Chinese pottery]] and [[lacquerware]] from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, originally destined for the [[Rohan Castle|new castle]] in [[Saverne]].<ref>{{cite web|URL=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/sites_expos/GOUT_CHINOIS/F/GC_EXPO.HTML|title=Le goût chinois du cardinal de Rohan|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=27 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205213244/http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/sites_expos/GOUT_CHINOIS/F/GC_EXPO.HTML|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[curio cabinet]] in the ''Garde-robe du prince-évêque'' displays dessert [[tableware]] from the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Manufacture de Sèvres]], made in 1772–1774 for Louis-René de{{nbsp}}Rohan's special embassy in [[Vienna]]. These items now belong to the ''Musée des arts décoratifs''.<ref name=Martinp211>Martin, p.&nbsp;211.</ref>

A pair of large canvases with hunting dogs by [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] (1742), now hanging in the ''Salle du synode'', once hung in the Parisian ''[[hôtel particulier]]'' of [[Samuel-Jacques Bernard (1686–1753)|Samuel-Jacques Bernard]].<ref name=Martinp211/> The three paintings in the chapel are copies of works by [[Antonio da Correggio]]: ''[[Nativity (Correggio)|Adoration of the Shepherds]]'', ''[[Madonna of St. Jerome (Correggio)|Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine]]'', and ''[[Madonna della Scodella|The Rest on the Return from Egypt]]''. They were made in 1724 in [[Modena]] and [[Parma]] by Robert de{{nbsp}}Séry (1686–1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year.<ref>Martin, p.&nbsp;187.</ref> De{{nbsp}}Séry would later provide many other paintings for the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of paintings by greater masters. Napoleon's green bed is an authentic work by [[François-Honoré-Georges Jacob-Desmalter|Jacob-Desmalter]].<ref name="appartements"/>

The red [[canopy bed]] in the King's bedchamber is a 1989 copy of a bed kept in the [[Château d'Azay-le-Rideau]], thought to be very similar to the lost original.<ref>Martin, p. 221, note 93.</ref> The portraits of kings [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] of France in the library are copies made in 1950 of originals by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]] kept in the Palace of Versailles. These 20th-century copies are replacements for the 18th-century copies of the same paintings that were destroyed during the French Revolution at the same time as the portraits of the prince-bishops in the Bishops' Hall (see above, [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg#Up to 1871|History]]).<ref>Martin, p. 222, note 126.</ref> The overdoor paintings in the antechamber of the prince-bishop are also 20th-century copies, replacing 18th-century copies of French [[Baroque painting|Baroque masters]] such as [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Charles Le Brun]], and [[Charles de La Fosse]], that were destroyed in 1944. These paintings represent [[Bible|biblical stories]]; the lost first copies were made in 1737–1740 in Versailles.<ref>Martin, p. 193.</ref> The other paintings on the walls belong to the ''Musée des beaux-arts'', including ''Louis XV offrant la Paix à L'Europe'' ("Louis XV presenting Peace to Europe", 1737) by [[François Lemoyne]], on display in the ''Garde-robe du prince-évêque'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacquot|first=Dominique|title=Le musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg&nbsp;— Cinq siècles de peinture|date=2006|publisher=Éditions des Musées de Strasbourg|location=Strasbourg|isbn=2-901833-78-0|page=206}}</ref> and ''La déification d'Énée'' ("The [[Apotheosis|Deification]] of [[Aeneas]]", 1749) by [[Jean II Restout]], on display in the ''Chambre du prince-évêque''.<ref>Jacquot, p. 210.</ref>

=== Musée des beaux-arts ===
{{main article|Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg}}
The ''Musée des beaux-arts'' (Museum of Fine Arts), on the first and second floors of the palace, is the successor of the ''Musée de peinture et de sculpture'' (Museum of painting and sculpture), established in 1803 and entirely destroyed by [[Prussian Army|Prussian]] [[artillery]] shelling and the subsequent violent fire during the night of 24–25{{nbsp}}August 1870.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le siège de Strasbourg|url=http://www.crdp-strasbourg.fr/data/histoire/alsace_1870/siege_strasbourg.php?parent=8|publisher=Centre régional de documentation pédagogique de Strasbourg|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref> The new museum was opened in 1899. The collections present an overview of [[Art of Europe|European art]] from the 13th century to 1871, with considerable weight given to [[Italian art|Italian]] as well as Flemish and Dutch paintings, with artists such as [[Hans Memling]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Giotto]], [[Pieter de Hooch]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Jacob Jordaens]], and [[Jacopo Tintoretto|Tintoretto]], among many others. The collections of [[Upper Rhine|Upper Rhenish]] art until 1681 ([[Hans Baldung|Baldung]], [[Peter Hemmel of Andlau|Hemmel]], [[Sebastian Stoskopff|Stoskopff]], [[Konrad Witz|Witz]], and others) had been moved into the dedicated [[Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame]] in 1931.<ref name="eventful history"/><ref>{{cite web|title=History (Musée de l'Oeuvre Notre-Dame)|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=histoire-ond-en|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Musée des arts décoratifs ===
{{main article|Musée des Arts décoratifs, Strasbourg}}
The ''Musée des arts décoratifs'' (Museum of [[Decorative arts]]) is on the ground floor. It was established in its current form in the years 1920–1924, when the collections of the ''Kunstgewerbe-Museum Hohenlohe'', originally established in 1887, were relocated in the stables wing adjacent to the [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg#The apartments|palace apartments]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History (Musée des arts décoratifs)|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=histoire-arts-deco-en|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref> The collections had previously been in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] former municipal [[slaughterhouse]] ''Grandes Boucheries'' or ''Große Metzig'', which now hosts the [[Musée historique de Strasbourg]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Musée historique - histoire|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=histoire-historique|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref>) The ''Musée des arts décoratifs'' suffered in the World War II bombing raids of 1944 but the building has since been restored and the collections replenished. Besides the furniture and decoration of the cardinals' apartments, the collections focus on the local production of porcelain ([[Strasbourg faience]]), [[silver-gilt]], and [[Clockmaker|clockmaking]], with original parts of the medieval [[Strasbourg astronomical clock]] including the [[automaton]] [[rooster]] from 1354.<ref name ="Collections eng."/><ref>{{cite web|title=Strasbourg - Cathedral area|url=http://www.travelforkids.com/Funtodo/France/strasbourg/strasbourg-cathedral-notre-dame.htm|publisher=Travel for Kids|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> The reconstructed living room of a former ''[[hôtel particulier]]'', the 1750s Hôtel Oesinger, displays 18th-century furniture ''[[in situ]]'' on a more intimate scale than the rooms of the palace.<ref>{{cite web|title=L'aile des arts décoratifs|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=Aile-arts-deco|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

=== Musée archéologique ===
{{main article|Musée archéologique (Strasbourg)}}
The ''Musée archéologique'' (Archaeological Museum) is in the basement. The former archaeological collections of the city had been entirely destroyed, along with the municipal library, during the [[Siege of Strasbourg]] in 1870. A new collection was started in 1876 on behalf of the "Society for the preservation of the historical monuments of Alsace" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Société pour la conservation des Monuments historiques d'Alsace}}, {{lang-de|link=no|Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung der geschichtlichen Denkmäler im Elsass}}). It was moved into the palace in 1889, first opened to the public in 1896, and moved to its present location in 1907.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schnitzler|first1=Bernadette|last2=Schneider|first2=Malou|title=Le Musée archéologique de Strasbourg|date=1985|publisher=Musées de Strasbourg|location=Strasbourg|page=11}}</ref> The museum displays finds from northern Alsace from the [[Paleolithic]] Era to the [[Merovingian dynasty]], with a special focus on [[Argentoratum]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Collection|url=http://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/index.php?page=collections-2-en|publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>
