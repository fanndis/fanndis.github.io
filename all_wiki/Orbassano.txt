'''Orbassano''' is a ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) in the [[Metropolitan City of Turin]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region [[Piedmont]], located about {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Turin]].

Orbassano borders the following municipalities: [[Turin]], [[Rivoli (Italy)|Rivoli]], [[Rivalta di Torino]], [[Beinasco]], [[Nichelino]], [[Volvera]], [[Candiolo]], [[None (TO)|None]].

==History==
The known origins of the city date back to the Roman conquest of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], evidenced by two [[History of the Roman Empire|Imperial era]] tombstones found here in the second half of the nineteenth century.

By the end of the first millennium, Orbassano was among the lands of the [[March of Turin|Margrave of Susa]], but in 1029 it found itself sold by [[Ulric Manfred II of Turin|Manfredi]] to the new [[Susa Cathedral|Abbey of San Giusto in Susa]].   Shortly thereafter, in 1035, some of the land came into the possession of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Turin|Diocese of Turin]].   In the twelfth century Orbassano came under the control of its northern neighbours the Lords of Rivalta, the [[Orsini family]].

==People==
[[Sonia Gandhi]] was raised here, although she was born in [[Lusiana]], near [[Vicenza]].
