'''''Oprah's Lifeclass''''' (also known as '''''Oprah's Lifeclass: The Tour''''' in the show's second season) is an American primetime television show hosted and produced by [[Oprah Winfrey]], which aired on [[Oprah Winfrey Network|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]]. The series premiered on October 10, 2011.

==Concept==
''Oprah's Lifeclass'' is a self-help program that showcases "all of Oprah's lessons, revelations and aha moments over the past 25 years broken down to help make your life better, happier, bigger, richer –  more fulfilling."<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/OprahsLifeclass?sk=infop 'Oprah's Lifeclass'] ''Facebook'' November 8, 2011</ref>

Each episode revolves around a central topic or lesson that teaches viewers how to live their best life. Winfrey and her co-hosts share their ideas, thoughts, and reflections about the lesson, and the show features interviews with guests (and sometimes past guests and audience members from ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'') whose life experiences relate to each topic. Every episode also features segments with guests from around the world, who connect with Winfrey via [[Skype]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], or Oprah.com.

She was joined by a spiritual teacher or self-help expert, with whom she would discuss each ''Lifeclass'' lesson.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Oprah's Lifeclass'' debuted to mixed but generally negative reviews. Alessandra Stanley of ''The New York Times'' stated that "''Oprah’s Lifeclass'' is ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' with the life sucked out of it." Stanley further declared that the new series lacks "Winfrey’s spirited interactions with guests and audiences" and fails to capture the tone of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' when the host "was irreverent, bold and even at times shocking."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/arts/television/the-rosie-show-and-oprahs-lifeclass-on-own.html 'Among the Lectures, a Bit of Schtick'] ''The New York Times'' October 14, 2011</ref>

Nuzhat Naoreen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated the third season premiere featuring Winfrey and [[Iyanla Vanzant]] with a "B-" declaring that "the ensuing life lessons delivered by O and her co-chair can feel a bit overbearing and at times... slightly grating. But the show isn't without some notable nuggets of wisdom, though you'll only hear them if you manage to keep your attention from straying as the professors...er, hosts give their lecture."<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/tv/tonights_best_tv/0,,7,00.html 'Tonight's Best'] ''Entertainment Weekly'' July 29, 2012</ref>
