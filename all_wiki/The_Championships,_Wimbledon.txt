Wimbledon is one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, the others being the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Since the Australian Open shifted to [[hardcourt]] in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on [[grass court|grass]], which is widely considered as the classic tennis court.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} 

The tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. However, changes to the tennis calendar in 2015 have seen the event moved back by a week to begin in early July.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/18913701|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Enhanced UK grass court season announced for 2017|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2016-04-07/enhanced_uk_grass_court_season_announced_for_2017.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=7 April 2016}}</ref> Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place.

Wimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors and royal patronage. [[Strawberry#Culinary|Strawberries and cream]] are traditionally consumed at the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wimbledon's strawberries and cream has Tudor roots|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/surrey/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8756000/8756132.stm|agency=BBC|date=9 June 2015}}</ref> In 2017, fans consumed 34,000{{nbsp}}kg (33 tons) of English strawberries and 10,000 litres (2,200 gallons) of cream.

The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts, with the exception of [[Rolex]], which provides timekeeping technology during matches, and [[Robinsons (drink)|Robinsons barley water]].

In 2009, Wimbledon's [[Centre Court]] was fitted with a [[retractable roof]] to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating and a table.

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the [[2020 Wimbledon Championships|2020 Championships]] were cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rossingh|first=Danielle|title=Taking A Look At Every Time Wimbledon Has Been Canceled, Including The 2020 Tournament|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellerossingh/2020/04/01/coronavirus-other-times-wimbledon-has-been-canceled/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Spencer gore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], the winner of the [[1877 Wimbledon Championship|inaugural Wimbledon Championship]]]]

=== Beginning ===
The [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as "The All England Croquet Club". Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon.<ref>[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/4462679.Anyone_for_a_game_of_sphairistik___/ "Anyone for a game of sphairistiké?"] 41, ''[[The Northern Echo]]'', 27 June 2009, accessed 8 July 2009</ref>

In 1876, [[Tennis|lawn tennis]], a game devised by Major [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]] a year or so earlier as an outdoor version of [[real tennis]] and originally given the name ''Sphairistikè'', was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed "The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.

The inaugural [[1877 Wimbledon Championship]] started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held. 22 men paid a [[Guinea (coin)|guinea]] to enter the tournament, which was to be held over five days. The rain delayed it four more days and thus, on July 19, 1877, the final was played. [[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], an old Harrovian [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]] player, defeated [[William Marshall (tennis)|William Marshall]] 6-1, 6-2 and 6-4 in 48 minutes. Gore was presented with the silver challenge cup, valued at 25 guineas and donated by the sports magazine ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'', as well as a prize money of 12 guineas. About 200 spectators paid one [[shilling]] each to watch the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|title=1877 Wimbledon Championships|accessdate=5 October 2010|publisher=Wimbledon.org|first=Ron|last=Atkin|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221222928/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|archive-date=21 December 2010}}</ref>

The lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title "[[Centre Court]]".{{efn|A Centre Court did not yet exist during the first four years of the championship.<ref name=little>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=Wimbledon Compendium 2011|year=2011|publisher=All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club|location=London|isbn=978-1-899039-36-4|pages=9, 102|edition=21st}}</ref>|name=centrecourt}} The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Malin Lundin|title=Throwback Thursday: The New Wimbledon|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-03-12/20150312_throwback_thursday_twins_in_tennis.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=12 March 2015}}</ref> However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly described. The opening of the new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description.
[[File:1884 wimbledon ladies program.jpg|thumb|Ladies [[1884 Wimbledon Championships|Championship, 1884]]. First prize, awarded to [[Maud Watson]], was a silver flower-basket worth 20 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]].]]

By 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word "croquet" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.

In 1884, the club added [[List of Wimbledon ladies' singles champions|Ladies' Singles]] and [[List of Wimbledon gentlemen's doubles champions|Gentlemen's Doubles]] competitions. [[List of Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions|Ladies' Doubles]] and [[List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions|Mixed Doubles]] events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three ''Major or Grand Slam'' events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players; professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the [[History of tennis|open era]] in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between [[Fred Perry]] in 1936 and [[Andy Murray]] in 2013, while no British woman has won since [[Virginia Wade]] in 1977, although [[Annabel Croft]] and [[Laura Robson]] won the Girls' Championship in [[1984 Wimbledon Championships|1984]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|2008]] respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.

Though properly called "The Championships, Wimbledon", depending on sources the event is also known as "The All England Lawn Tennis Championships", "The Wimbledon Championships" or simply "Wimbledon". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the [[International Lawn Tennis Federation]] as the "World Grass Court Championships".

In the period of 1915-1918, no tournament was organized due to [[World War I]].

During [[World War II]], the tournament was not held in the period 1940-1945. On October 11, 1940 one bomb hit a corner of the competitors’ stand of the Centre Court. The championships did go ahead in 1946 even though the damage meant that 1,200 seats were lost. The organisers were unable to repair the damaged section until 1947 and the Centre Court was fully restored and renovated for the 1949 edition.<ref>{{cite web|title=History - 1940s|url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/aboutwimbledon/history_1940s.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>

In 1946 and 1947 Wimbledon was held before the [[French Championships]] and was thus the second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis event of the year.

=== 21st century ===
Wimbledon is widely considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Term Plan|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315213309/http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|archive-date=15 March 2012}}</ref> Stage one (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000–2011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601051854/http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history|date=1 June 2012}}</ref>

A new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on [[Centre Court]]. The Club tested the new roof at an event called ''A Centre Court Celebration'' on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving [[Andre Agassi]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Tim Henman]]. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Amélie Mauresmo]].  The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] on 29 June 2009. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02{{nbsp}}pm in a victory over [[Marcos Baghdatis]] at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships. The 2012 Men's Singles Final on 8 July 2012, between [[Roger Federer]] and Murray, was the first singles final to be partially played under the roof, which was activated during the third set.{{efn|name=monday_final|To date only four finals were played on a Monday due to rain: [[1919 Wimbledon Championships|1919]], [[1922 Wimbledon Championships|1922]], [[1988 Wimbledon Championships|1988]] and [[2001 Wimbledon Championships|2001]].}}

A new 4000-seat [[No. 2 Court]] was built on the site of the old No. 13 Court in time for the 2009 Championships.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2009-06-11/200906111244725616916.html New Court No. 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620004403/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2009-06-11/200906111244725616916.html |date=20 June 2009 }}</ref>  A new 2000-seat [[No. 3 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 3 Court]] was built on the site of the old No. 2 and No. 3 Courts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wimbledon.org/2010/03/26/the-new-court-3 |title=The New Court 3 |publisher=Blog.wimbledon.org |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803031905/http://blog.wimbledon.org/2010/03/26/the-new-court-3/ |archive-date=3 August 2010 }}</ref>

On 1 August 2011, the All England Club transferred all of its assets relating to The Championships to a separate though wholly owned subsidiary, The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited, also known as AELTC. Since that time, the club's activities have been formally conducted separately from those of The Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/about_aeltc.html |title=About the AELTC |publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>

In 2012, the All England Club hosted the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] and became the first Olympic grass court tournament since tennis was reintroduced as an Olympic sport and the first to be held at a Grand Slam venue in the Open era.<ref name="Tennis at the 2012 London Games">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympictennis.net |title=Olympic Tennis |publisher=UK Media Limited |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612121743/http://olympictennis.net/ |archive-date=12 June 2013 }}</ref>

In April 2013, Wimbledon unveiled its 'Master Plan' a vision in which to improve the championships over the next 10–15 years. This was in large part due to other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments such as the [[French Open]] and [[Australian Open]] also announcing expansion and re-development plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/article/roland-garros-redevelopment-under-way-lenglen-chatrier-court-18|title=First glimpse of future-facing Roland-Garros – Roland-Garros – The 2018 French Open official site|website=www.rolandgarros.com|language=en-us|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennis.com.au/about-tennis-australia/melbourne-park-redevelopment,%20https://www.tennis.com.au/about-tennis-australia/melbourne-park-redevelopment|title=Melbourne Park Redevelopment {{!}} About Tennis Australia|website=Tennis Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref> Aspects of the master plan included new player and media facilities, expansion of the No.1 court including a new retractable roof, new catering and hospitality areas, additional floor to the museum building, construction of an underground car park and new indoor courts and also a total reconfiguration of the site including the relocation of a number of practice, clay and championship courts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/aboutwimbledon/master_plan.html|title=The Championships, Wimbledon 2018 – Official Site by IBM|website=www.wimbledon.com|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>

New member and player facilities are currently being constructed by [https://www.willmottdixon.co.uk/projects/new-members-and-players-facilities-at-wimbledon Willmott Dixon] for completion in 2021.

Part of the plan also includes acquiring the land of the adjacent [[Wimbledon Park]] Golf club for £65&nbsp;million, so that the tournament qualifying matches can be played on site.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/13/wimbledon-to-expand-after-golf-club-members-vote-to-sell-for-65m|title=Wimbledon to expand after golf club members vote to sell for £65m|last=correspondent|first=Rupert Neate Wealth|date=13 December 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=5 January 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

As a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 global pandemic]], the All England Club announced on 1 April 2020 that the entire grass-court season was to be cancelled as a public safety precaution, marking the first time a Wimbledon tournament would not be played since [[World War II]] and for the first time in the [[Open Era (tennis)|Open Era]] every major tennis event cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fuller |first1=Russell |title=Wimbledon cancelled due to coronavirus - where does that leave tennis in 2020? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/52104196 |website=BBC News |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> Playing the tournament [[Behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]] was ruled out as impractical, in part because at least 5,000 staff –including ballkids, officials, maintenance, and security– would have still needed to be on site to hold a functioning tournament.

However, the sheer number of people who still would have needed to be on site led the board to realise "that wasn't going to be a workable option".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2020/04/tim-henman-takes-us-behind-curtain-aeltc-wimbledon-cancellation-covid-19-insurance/88375/|title=Behind the curtain: Henman on AELTC's decision to cancel Wimbledon|author1=Cale Hammond|publisher=[[Tennis Channel]]|date=13 April 2020}}</ref>  Prior to the start of the 2003 tournament, the club began paying an annual insurance premium of £1.61m ($2&nbsp;million) to cover losses from cancellation of Wimbledon in the event of a worldwide pandemic as a result of the [[2002–2004 SARS outbreak|SARS outbreak]]; it would receive an insurance payment of £114&nbsp;million ($141&nbsp;million) for the 2020 cancellation on expected losses of around £250&nbsp;million ($312&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite web |title=Wimbledon cancelled due to coronavirus - where does that leave tennis in 2020? |url=https://www.tennis365.com/grand-slam/wimbledon/wimbledon-set-to-receive-114m-insurance-payout-after-cancellation-of-tournament-report/ |website=Tennis 365 |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>

== Events ==
Wimbledon consists of five main events, four junior events and seven invitation events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/championships/competing |title=Wimbledon Event Guide |publisher=wimbledon.org |accessdate=12 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811091625/http://www.wimbledon.com/championships/competing |archive-date=11 August 2011 }}</ref>

=== Main events ===

* Gentlemen's Singles (128)
* Ladies' Singles (128)
* Gentlemen's Doubles (64)
* Ladies' Doubles (64)
* Mixed Doubles (48)

=== Junior events ===
The four junior events and the number of players or teams are:

* Gentlemen's Wheelchair Singles<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon announces Wheelchair Tennis Singles events from 2016|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-07-12/wimbledon_announces_wheelchair_tennis_singles_events_from_2016.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=6 June 2016|date=12 July 2015}}</ref>
* Ladies' Wheelchair Singles
* Gentlemen's Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs)<ref name="Wheelchair">There are no age limits for the Wheelchair Doubles events.</ref>
* Ladies' Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs)<ref name="Wheelchair" />

=== Match formats ===
Matches in the Gentlemen's Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles are best-of-five sets; all other events are best-of-three sets.  Up to and including the 2018 tournament, a tiebreak game is played if the score reaches 6–all in any set except the fifth (in a five-set match) or the third (in a three-set match), in which case a two-game lead must be reached.  Since 2019, a final set tiebreak game is played if the score in the final set reaches 12–all.<ref name="bbc-tiebreak-2019" />

All events are [[single-elimination tournament]]s,{{efn|name=single_elimination|In a single-elimination tournament, a losing player or team is eliminated from the tournament.}} except for the Gentlemen's, Senior Gentlemen's and the Ladies' Invitation Doubles, which are [[round-robin tournament]]s.

Up to 1921, the winners of the previous year's competition (except in the Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles) were automatically granted [[Bye (sports)|byes]] into the final round (then known as the challenge round). This led to many winners retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start of the competition. Since 1922, the prior year's champions were required to play all the rounds, like other tournament competitors.

== Schedule ==
Each year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June or first Monday in July, two weeks after the [[Queen's Club Championships]], which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the [[Gerry Weber Open]], which is held in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle, Germany]], during the same week. Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are [[Eastbourne International|Eastbourne]], Great Britain, and [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships|Rosmalen]] in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events. The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is [[Birmingham Classic (tennis)|Birmingham]], also in Great Britain. The  men's event which is outside Europe before Wimbledon is the Antalya open in Turkey. The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the [[Hall of Fame Tennis Championships]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.

Wimbledon is scheduled for 14 days, beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. Before 1982 it ended a day earlier, with the women's singles final on the Friday and the men's singles final on the Saturday.<ref>{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=Wimbledon Switches To Sunday Men's Final | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=17 October 1981 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/17/sports/wimbledon-switches-to-sunday-men-s-final.html | access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref> The five main events span both weeks, but the junior and invitational events are held mainly during the second week.  Traditionally, unlike the other three tennis Grand Slams, there is no play on the "Middle Sunday", which is considered a rest day.  However, rain has forced play on the Middle Sunday four times, in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016. On the first of these four occasions, Wimbledon staged a "People's Sunday", with unreserved seating and readily available, inexpensive tickets, allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts.

The second Monday at Wimbledon is often called "Manic Monday", because it is the busiest day with the last-16 matches for both men's and women's singles, where fans have a pick of watching on a single day, any of the best 32 players left; which is also unique in a Grand Slam singles competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2017-manic-monday-what-is-it-court-times-roger-federer-andy-murray-rafael-nadal-novak-a7833151.html |title=Wimbledon 2017: What is Manic Monday |date=12 July 2017|work=The Independent }}</ref>

Since 2015, the championships have begun one week later than in previous years, extending the gap between the tournament and the [[French Open]] from two to three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18913701|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2012|date=19 July 2012}}</ref> Additionally the [[Stuttgart Open]] men's tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June, extending the grass court season.

== Players and seeding ==
Both the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Facts and Figures|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=27 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419022018/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|archive-date=19 April 2015}}</ref> Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions. Both tournaments have 8 [[Wild card (sports)#Professional tennis|wild card]] entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers. Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given [[Seed (sports)|seedings]] in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the [[1924 Wimbledon Championships]]. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the [[1927 Wimbledon Championships]] and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were [[René Lacoste]] and [[Helen Wills]].<ref name=compendium2013>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=2013 Wimbledon Compendium|edition=23rd|date=2013|publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|location=London|pages=163, 164, 200|isbn=978-1-899039-40-1}}</ref>

The Committee of Management decide which players receive wildcards. Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen's Singles Championship was [[Goran Ivanišević]] in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the [[Bank of England]] Sports Ground in [[Roehampton]]. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events. From 2019 singles qualification will increase to 128 players and no doubles qualification will occur.<ref name=":0" /> Previously the same-sex doubles competitions lasted for only two rounds. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: [[John McEnroe]] in 1977 (Gentlemen's Singles), [[Vladimir Voltchkov]] in 2000 (Gentlemen's Singles), and [[Alexandra Stevenson]] in 1999 (Ladies' Singles).

Players are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their [[International Tennis Federation]] world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.

The Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it can change the seedings based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that.<ref name=seedingexplained>{{cite news |last=Tebbutt |first=Tom |date=16 June 2010 |title=Explaining Wimbledon's seeding method |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/explaining-wimbledons-seeding-method/article4322158/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |access-date=17 June 2016 }}</ref> A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: [[Boris Becker]] in 1985 and [[Goran Ivanišević]] in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivanišević was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by [[Richard Krajicek]], who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was [[Venus Williams]], who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.

== Grounds ==
[[File:cmglee London Wimbledon Championships venue aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the grounds]]
{{Main|All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club}}

Since 2002, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% [[ryegrass|perennial ryegrass]]. Prior to 2002 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% [[Creeping Red Fescue]] was used. The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon – Grass Courts|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/news/media-centre/grass-courts|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon grass |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |publisher=Wimbledon Championship |accessdate=7 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507105351/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |archive-date= 7 May 2013 }}</ref>

The main show courts, [[Centre Court]] and [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]], are normally used for only two weeks a year, during the Championships, but play can extend into a third week in exceptional circumstances. The remaining 17 courts are regularly used for other events hosted by the club. The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. One of the show courts is also used for home ties of the GB teams in the [[Davis Cup]] on occasions.

Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts. At one time, all the Majors, except the French Open, were played on grass. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] abandoned grass in 1975 for [[green clay]] and the Australian Open did so in 1988 for [[hard court]]s; the US Open eventually would adopt hard courts as well.

From 1877 to 1921, Club's grounds were situated on four acres of meadowland between Worple Road and the railway line. In 1908, the venue hosted the tennis events for the [[Tennis at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympic Games]]. After moving to a new place, the old ground then became the Girls' High School playing field.

In 1922, the Club moved to Church Road and the principal court, [[Centre Court]], was inaugurated. This new venue was larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand. 
[[File:Wimbledon order of play.jpg|thumb|left|The order of play for all courts is displayed on boards around the grounds.]]

Due to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open in about 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336573017483.html |title=Wimbledon – Centre Court roof |publisher=[[AELTC]] |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> Whilst the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving [[Amélie Mauresmo]] and [[Dinara Safina]]. The first full match played and completed under the roof featured [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]], played on the same date.

The court has a capacity of 15,000. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.

The second most important court is [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]]. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court.  The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. Construction of a new retractable roof on the No.1 Court began after the 2017 Championships and was completed in time for the 2019 championships. The capacity of the stadium also rose by 900 to 12,345.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2019/06/11/wimbledons-new-no1-court-roof-marks-2019-stadium-changes/#44f3501c667f|title=New No. 1 Court Roof Among Stadium Changes For Wimbledon 2019|work=Forbes|date=11 June 2019}}</ref>

Since 2009, a new [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 2 Court]] has been used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people. To obtain [[planning permission]], the playing surface is around 3.5m below ground level, ensuring that the single-storey structure is only about 3.5m above ground level, and thus not affecting local views.<ref name="Wim 18">{{cite web|url=https://www.aeltc.com/cms/media/pressreleases/no2_24_04_07.aspx |title=Tickets – 2013 Wimbledon Championships Website – Official Site by IBM |publisher=[[AELTC]].com |accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> Plans to build on the current site of Court 13 were dismissed due to the high capacity of games played at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. The old No.2 Court has been renamed as [[No. 3 Court (Wimbledon)|No.3 Court]]. The old No.2 Court was known as the "Graveyard of Champions" because many highly seeded players were eliminated there during early rounds over the years, including [[Ilie Năstase]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Andre Agassi]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Venus Williams]], [[Serena Williams]] and [[Maria Sharapova]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wimbledontennis.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/how-the-graveyard-of-champions-got-its-name/ |title=How the 'Graveyard of champions' got its name |publisher=Blog.wimbledon.org |accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> The court has a capacity of 2,192 + 770 standing. In 2011 a new No.3 Court and a new Court 4 were unveiled on the sites of the old No.2 and 3 courts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/longtermplan.aspx |title=Wimbledon Debentures – About Debentures – The Long Term Plan |publisher=[[AELTC]].com |accessdate=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608080457/http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/longtermplan.aspx |archive-date=8 June 2011  }}</ref>
[[File:Wimbledon court No. 1.JPG|thumb|View from seats of Wimbledon Court No. 1]]
Because of the summer climate in southern England, Wimbledon employs 'Court Attendants' each year, who work to maintain court conditions. Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.

At the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an area of grass officially known as the [[Aorangi Terrace]]. When British players do well at Wimbledon, the hill attracts fans for them, and is often renamed after them by the press: [[Greg Rusedski]]'s followers convened at "Rusedski Ridge", and [[Tim Henman]] has had the hill nicknamed [[Henman Hill]]. As both of them have now retired and [[Andy Murray]] is the number 1 British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as "Murray Mound" or "[[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish rugby ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on – the area is still usually referred to as Henman Hill. None of these nicknames are official.

=== Bank of England Sports Centre ===

The qualifying matches, prior to the main draw, take place at the [[Bank of England Ground|Bank of England Sports Ground]], in [[Roehampton]], {{convert|3.6|mi|km|1}} from the All England Club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/qualifying.html |title=Qualifying – Information on The Championships Qualifying Competition |publisher=Wimbledon |accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>

== Traditions ==
[[File:Wimbledon Court 10 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|Court 10. On the outside courts there is no reserved seating.]]

Social commentator [[Ellis Cashmore]] describes Wimbledon as having "a [[David Niven]]-ish propriety", in trying to conform to the standards of behaviour regarded as common in the 1950s. Writer [[Peter York]] sees the event as representing a particular white, upper middle class, affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as "a southern, well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character". Cashmore has criticised the event for being "remote and insulated" from the changing multicultural character of modern Britain, describing it as "nobody's idea of all-things-British".<ref name="cnn">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/25/sport/tennis/tennis-wimbledon-preview-york-olympics-identity/index.html|title=Game, set and match: What Wimbledon says about the British – CNN.com|author=James Montague|website=CNN}}</ref>

=== Ball boys and ball girls ===
In the championship games, [[ball boy]]s and girls, known as BBGs, play a crucial role in the smooth running of the tournament, with a brief that a good BBG "should not be seen. They should blend into the background and get on with their jobs quietly."<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/29/ftballs29.xml&site=6&page=0 Strawberries, cream and BBGs]. ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 29 June 2006.</ref>

From 1947 ball boys were recruited from Goldings,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldonian.org/wimbledon/goldings_ballboys.htm |title=Goldings Ballboys |publisher=Goldonian.org |date=26 June 2004 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> the only [[Barnardos]] school to provide them. Prior to this, from the 1920s onwards, the ball boys came from [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|The Shaftesbury Children's Home]].
[[File:Wimbledon ballgirl 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Wimbledon ball girl at the net, 2007]]
Since 1969, BBGs have been drawn from local schools. Traditionally, [[Wandsworth School|Wandsworth Boys School]] in Sutherland Grove, Southfields and Mayfield Girls School on [[West Hill, Wandsworth|West Hill]] in Wandsworth, both now defunct, were the schools of choice for selection of BBGs. This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. Since 2008 they have been drawn from schools in the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], as well as from [[Surrey]].<ref name=BBG>{{cite web|title=Ball Boys and Ball Girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/ball_boys_and_ball_girls.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years [[Year Nine|nine]] and [[Year Ten|ten]].<ref name="Official Site">[http://www.aeltc.com/CMS/BBG/background.aspx Official Site] Ballboys and Ballgirls Background Information</ref> They serve for one, or if re-selected, for up to five tournaments, up to year thirteen.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507113749/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html |date=7 May 2013 }} About the Ball Boys and Girls</ref>

Starting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day's play.<ref name="Official Site" /> Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. Starting on the second Wednesday, the number of BBGs is reduced due to the decrease in the number of matches per day, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of £120-£180 being paid to each ball boy or girl after the 13-day period, depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or [[skorts]], track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water bottle holder, bag and trainers. Along with this it is seen as a privilege, and a valuable addition to a school leaver's [[curriculum vitae]], showing discipline. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been included since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Wimbledon – Behind the scenes – Ball boys and ball girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336567795051.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>

Prospective BBGs are first nominated by their school [[headteacher]], to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships to ensure that BBGs gain a feel of the grass court.

=== Colours and uniforms ===
[[File:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|[[Sébastien Grosjean]] takes a shot on Court 18 during the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|2004 Championships]].]]
Dark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours. However, all tennis players participating in the tournament are required to wear all-white or at least almost all-white clothing, a long-time tradition at Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game and All Set for a Match: Wimbledon and our Inner Tennis Player|url=http://www.thegreenrooms.net/research-and-articles/game-and-all-set-for-a-match-wimbledon-and-our-inner-tennis-player/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140115104417/http://www.thegreenrooms.net/research-and-articles/game-and-all-set-for-a-match-wimbledon-and-our-inner-tennis-player/|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 January 2014|publisher=The Green Rooms|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>{{efn|name=clothing_guidelines|Guidelines regarding the prominently-white clothing rule include no solid mass of colouring; coloured trims not to exceed 1{{nbsp}}cm; shirt or dress backs to be totally white; all other items of clothing, including shorts, shirts, caps, headbands, socks, and shoe uppers to be predominantly white.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/clothing_and_equipment.html | work=Wimbledon | title=Clothing and equipment | access-date=12 July 2016 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712041512/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/clothing_and_equipment.html | archive-date=12 July 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>}} Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable, provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo (the outfitter's brand logo being the sole exception). Controversy followed [[Martina Navratilova]]'s wearing branding for "Kim" cigarettes in 1982. Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer [[Ralph Lauren]]. This marked the first time in the history of the Championships that an outside company was used to design Wimbledon clothing.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== Referring to players ===
By tradition, the "Men's" and "Women's" competitions are referred to as "Gentlemen's" and "Ladies'" competitions at Wimbledon. The junior competitions are referred to as the "Boys'" and "Girls'" competitions.

Prior to 2009, female players were referred to by the title "Miss" or "Mrs." on scoreboards. As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, [[Chris Evert]] appeared on scoreboards as "Mrs. J. M. Lloyd" during her marriage to [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], since [[Coverture#Outside the legal realm|"Mrs. X" essentially designates the wife of X]]. This tradition has continued, at least to some extent.<ref>"Mrs. P-Y Hardenne" is used to describe Justine Henin. See {{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/roll_of_honour/ladies-singles.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507103844/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/roll_of_honour/ladies-singles.html |archive-date=7 May 2013  }}</ref> For the first time during the 2009 tournament, players were referred to on scoreboards by both their first and last names.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why has Wimbledon dropped 'Miss'?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8126223.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=30 June 2009}}</ref>

The title "Mr." is not used for male players who are professionals on scoreboards but the prefix is retained for amateurs, although chair umpires refer to players as "Mr." when they use the replay challenge. The chair umpire will say "Mr. <surname> is challenging the call..." and "Mr. <surname> has X challenges remaining." Up until 2018, the chair umpire said "Miss"/"Mrs." <surname> when announcing the score of the Ladies' matches. However, the chair umpire no longer calls "Miss"/"Mrs." <surname> when announcing the score, since 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/sports/wimbledon-wedded-to-tradition-steps-into-the-present.html |title=Wimbledon, Wedded to Tradition, Steps into the Present |author=Ben Rothenberg |date=1 July 2019 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>

If a match is being played with two competitors of the same surname (e.g. Venus and Serena Williams, Bob and Mike Bryan), the chair umpire will specify to whom they are referring by stating the player's first name and surname during announcements (e.g. "Game, Venus Williams", "Advantage, Mike Bryan").

=== Royal family ===
[[File:The Royal Gallery at Centre Court, Wimbledon.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Gallery at Centre Court, Wimbledon]]
Previously, players bowed or curtsied to members of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] seated in the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court.

=== Services stewards ===
[[File:Wimbledon_scoreboard.jpg|thumb|right|A Royal Marines Commando as a services steward in 2005.]]

Prior to the Second World War, members of the [[Brigade of Guards]] and retired members of the [[Royal Artillery]] performed the role of stewards. In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave. Initially, this scheme extended only to the [[Royal Navy]], followed by the [[British Army]] in 1947 and the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1949. In 1965 [[London Fire Brigade]] members joined the ranks of stewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWestMidlands/posts/590494050995421 |title=Follow my blog as a steward at Wimbledon |publisher=Army West Midlands }}</ref> The service stewards, wearing uniform, are present in Centre Court and No.'s 1, 2, 3, 12 and 18 courts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hamilton |first=Leigh |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/wimbledon-fans-show-pride-in-armed-forces |title=Wimbledon fans show pride in Armed Forces |work=Defence News |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=10 July 2016 | location=London}}</ref> In 2015, 595 Service and London Fire Brigade stewards attended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/faq_and_facts_and_figures.html |title=Wimbledon – Facts and Figures |publisher=[[AELTC]] | website=www.wimbledon.com }}</ref> Only enlisted members of the Armed Forces may apply for the role, which must be taken as leave, and half of each year's recruits must have stewarded at Wimbledon before. The AELTC pays a subsistence allowance to servicemen and women working as stewards to defray their accommodation costs for the period of the Championships. The Service Stewards are not to be confused with the 185 Honorary Stewards.

The majority of centre and show court tickets sold to the general public have since 1924 been made available by a public ballot that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club holds at the start of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ballot|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/tickets/201205091336562669724.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=25 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219172911/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/tickets/201205091336562669724.html|archive-date=19 February 2013}}</ref> The ballot has always been substantially oversubscribed. Successful applicants are selected at random by a computer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tickets|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/tickets/index.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> The most recent figures from 2011 suggested there were four applicants to every ballot ticket. Applications must be posted to arrive at the AELTC by the last day of December in the year prior to the tournament. Seats and days are allocated randomly and ballot tickets are not transferable.

The All England Club, through its subsidiary The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc, issues [[Debenture (sport)|debentures]] to tennis fans every five years to raise funds for capital expenditure. Fans who invest thus in the club receive a pair of tickets for every day of the Wimbledon Championships for the five years the investment lasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/About.aspx |title=Wimbledon Debentures – About Debentures – About Wimbledon Debentures |publisher=[[AELTC]].com |accessdate=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723005314/http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/About.aspx |archive-date=23 July 2010 }}</ref> Only debenture holders are permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties and demand for debentures has increased in recent years, to such an extent that they are even traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]].

Wimbledon and the French Open are the only Grand Slam tournaments where fans without tickets for play can queue up and still get seats on the three show courts on the day of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rolandgarros.fft-tickets.com/uk/information/ticket-info/evening-visitors |title=Evening Visitors &#124; Le site officiel de la billetterie Roland-Garros 2013 |publisher=Rolandgarros.fft-tickets.com |accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> Sequentially numbered queue cards were introduced in 2003. From 2008, there is a single queue, allotted about 500 seats for each court. When they join the queue, fans are handed queue cards. Anyone who then wishes to leave the queue temporarily, even if in possession of a queue card, must agree their position with the others nearby in the queue and/or a steward.

To get access to the show courts, fans normally have to queue overnight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.nationmultimedia.com/natee/2007/07/16/entry-1 |title=Natee's Blog |publisher=Blog.nationmultimedia.com |accessdate=6 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714160621/http://blog.nationmultimedia.com/natee/2007/07/16/entry-1 |archive-date=14 July 2011  }}</ref> This is done by fans from all over the world and, although considered vagrancy, is part of the Wimbledon experience in itself. The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30{{nbsp}}pm and the money goes to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.

At 2.40pm on Day Seven (Monday 28 June) of the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|2010 Championships]], the one-millionth numbered Wimbledon queue card was handed out to Rose Stanley from South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Championships  – Day Nine Diary|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/06/Wimbledon/Wimbledon-Diary-Day-Nine.aspx?|website=www.atpworldtour.com|publisher=ATP|date=29 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=John Martin|title=For Many Wimbledon Fans, the Waiting Is Not the Hardest Part|url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/for-many-wimbledon-fans-the-wait-is-worth-it/|website=straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 July 2010}}</ref>

=== Sponsorship ===
Wimbledon is notable for the longest running sponsorship in sports history due to its association with [[Slazenger]] who have supplied all tennis balls for the tournament since 1902.<ref>{{cite web|title=At 113 Years and Counting, Slazenger Maintains the Longest Sponsorship in Sports|url=http://www.sesponsorshipgroup.com/sponsorship-figures/2015/11/3/at-113-years-and-counting-slazenger-maintains-the-longest-sponsorship-in-sports|publisher=S&E Sponsorship Group|date=4 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617070504/http://www.sesponsorshipgroup.com/sponsorship-figures/2015/11/3/at-113-years-and-counting-slazenger-maintains-the-longest-sponsorship-in-sports|archive-date=17 June 2016}}</ref> Wimbledon has had a sponsorship deal with the [[Robinsons (drink)|Robinsons]] fruit drink brand since 1935.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon and Robinsons: charting 79 years of a fruitful relationship|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1300801/wimbledon-robinsons-charting-79-years-fruitful-relationship#|publisher=Campaign|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

It operated under a [[Restricted Service Licence]]. Presenters included Sam Lloyd and Ali Barton. Typically they worked alternate four-hour shifts until the end of the last match of the day. Reporters and commentators included Gigi Salmon, Nick Lestor, Rupert Bell, Nigel Bidmead, Guy Swindells, Lucie Ahl, Nadine Towell and Helen Whitaker. Often they reported from the "Crow's Nest", an elevated building housing the Court 3 and 4 scoreboards which affords views of most of the outside courts. Regular guests included Sue Mappin. In later years Radio Wimbledon acquired a second low-power FM frequency (within the grounds only) of 96.3 FM for uninterrupted Centre Court commentary, and, from 2006, a third for coverage from No. 1 Court on 97.8 FM. Hourly news bulletins and travel (using [[Radio Data System|RDS]]) were also broadcast.

=== Television coverage ===

Beginning with the [[2018 Wimbledon Championships|2018 tournament]], an in-house operation known as Wimbledon Broadcasting Services (WBS) has served as the official host broadcaster of the tournament, replacing [[BBC Sport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/wimbledon-to-launch-in-house-host-broadcaster|title=Wimbledon to launch in-house host broadcaster|access-date=3 July 2018|language=en}}</ref>

==== United Kingdom ====

The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]], and their Red Button service. This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels. The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2024.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-all-england-club-wimbledon-2024 |title=BBC and All England Club extend contract to broadcast Wimbledon until 2024 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>  During the days of [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers. One of the most notable British commentators was [[Dan Maskell]], who was known as the BBC's "voice of tennis" until his retirement in 1991. [[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]] succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006. Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players [[Andrew Castle]], [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], [[Tim Henman]], [[Greg Rusedski]], [[Samantha Smith (tennis)|Samantha Smith]] and [[Mark Petchey]]; tennis legends such as [[John McEnroe]], [[Tracy Austin]], [[Boris Becker]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]]; and general sports commentators including [[David Mercer (broadcaster)|David Mercer]], [[Barry Davies]], [[Andrew Cotter]] and [[Nick Mullins]]. The coverage is presented by [[Sue Barker]] (live) and [[Claire Balding]] (highlights). Previous BBC presenters include [[Des Lynam]], [[David Vine]], [[John Inverdale]] and [[Harry Carpenter]].

The Wimbledon Finals are obliged to be shown live and in full on terrestrial television (BBC Television Service, ITV, Channel 4, or Channel 5) by government mandate. Highlights of the rest of the tournament must be provided by terrestrial stations; live coverage (excepting the finals) may be sought by satellite or cable TV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/PDF/sport_on_television.pdf |title=Coverage of Sport on Television |format=PDF |publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|DCMS]] |accessdate=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415173542/http://www.culture.gov.uk/PDF/sport_on_television.pdf |archive-date=15 April 2010  }}</ref>

The BBC was forced to apologise after many viewers complained about "over-talking" by its commentary team during the TV coverage of the event in 2011. It said in a statement that views on commentary were subjective but that they "do appreciate that over-talking can irritate our audience". The BBC added that it hoped it had achieved "the right balance" across its coverage and was "of course sorry if on occasion you have not been satisfied". [[Tim Henman]] and [[John McEnroe]] were among the ex-players commentating.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC sorry for 'over-talking' Wimbledon commentators|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14026985|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=5 July 2011}}</ref>

Wimbledon was also involved in a piece of television history, when on 1 July 1967 the first official [[colour television]] broadcast took place in the UK. Four hours live coverage of the [[1967 Wimbledon Championships|1967 Championships]] was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however, the Gentlemen's Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives because it was the first Gentlemen's Final transmitted in colour. The tennis balls used were traditionally white, but were switched to yellow in 1986 to make them stand out for colour television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.watches2u.com/blog/wimbledon-facts.html|title=Wimbledon Facts|website=www.watches2u.com|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> Since 2007, Wimbledon matches have been transmitted in [[High-definition television|high-definition]], originally on the BBC's free-to-air channel [[BBC HD]], with continual live coverage during the tournament of Centre Court and Court No. 1 as well as an evening highlights show ''[[Today at Wimbledon]]''.  Coverage is now shown on BBC One and Two's HD feeds. Beginning 2018, all centre court matches are televised in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra-high-definition]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/how-to/wimbledon-in-4k-the-best-ways-to-catch-the-tennis-action-in-ultra-hd|title=Wimbledon in 4K: the best ways to catch the tennis action in Ultra HD|work=TechRadar|access-date=3 July 2018|language=en}}</ref>

The BBC's opening theme music for Wimbledon was composed by [[Keith Mansfield]] and is titled "Light and Tuneful". A piece titled "A Sporting Occasion" is the traditional closing theme, though nowadays coverage typically ends either with a montage set to a popular song or with no music at all. Mansfield also composed the piece "World Champion", used by NBC during intervals (change-overs, set breaks, etc.) and at the close of broadcasts throughout the tournament.

==== Ireland ====
In Ireland, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] broadcast the tournament during the 1980s and 1990s on their second channel [[RTÉ Two]], they also provided highlights of the games in the evening. The commentary provided was given by Matt Doyle a former Irish-American professional tennis player and Jim Sherwin a former RTÉ newsreader. Caroline Murphy was the presenter of the programme. RTÉ made the decision in 1998 to discontinue broadcasting the tournament due to falling viewing figures and the large number of viewers watching on the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/1998/0708/98070800158.html|title=Tennis – set for change?|date=8 July 1998|work=The Irish Times |accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref> From 2005 until 2014 [[TG4]] Ireland's Irish-language broadcaster provided coverage of the tournament. Live coverage was provided in the [[Irish language]] while they broadcast highlights in English at night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |title=TG4'S SUCCESSFUL TENNIS COVERAGE TO CONTINUE WITH WIMBLEDON 2009 |date=20 June 2009 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218210514/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |archive-date=18 February 2010 }}</ref>

In 2015 Wimbledon moved to pay TV broadcaster [[Setanta Sports]] under a 3-year agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setanta.com/ie/big-summer-of-sport-on-setanta/|title=Big summer of sport on Setanta|work=Setanta Sports|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612105325/http://www.setanta.com/ie/big-summer-of-sport-on-setanta/|archive-date=12 June 2015}}</ref> Its successor, [[Eir Sport]], currently hosts broadcasting rights in Ireland.

==== Americas ====
In the United States, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Final in the 1960s on its ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' series. [[NBC]] began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of [[NBC]]'s "Breakfast at Wimbledon"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_5|title=NBC Sports establishes "Breakfast at Wimbledon"|website=NBC Sports History Page}}</ref> specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from [[Bud Collins]], whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US. Collins was sacked by [[NBC]] in 2007, but was promptly hired by [[ESPN]], the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster [[Dick Enberg]].

From 1975 to 1999, premium channel [[HBO]] carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included [[Jim Lampley]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]] and [[Barry MacKay]] among others.<ref>HBO Guides, program schedules, 1975 to 1999</ref> [[ESPN]] took over as the cable-television partner in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=ESPN, Wimbledon come to terms |url=https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2003/04/14/ESPN-Wimbledon-come-to-terms/27281050341777/ |work=UPI |language=en}}</ref>

The AELTC grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and using [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in [[2009 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|2009]], ESPN2's coverage of the [[Tommy Haas]]-[[Novak Djokovic]] quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous [[Ivo Karlović]]-[[Roger Federer]] quarterfinal in full.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |title=Why Wimbledon Switched to ESPN From NBC |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/sports/tennis/why-wimbledon-switched-to-espn-from-nbc.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 July 2011}}</ref> Beginning with the 2012 tournament, coverage moved to ESPN and [[ESPN2]], marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) where live coverage is exclusively on pay television. The finals are also broadcast tape-delayed on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/espn-reaches-deal-to-carry-wimbledon/ | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Sandomir | title=ESPN Reaches Deal to Carry Wimbledon | date=3 July 2011}}</ref>

Taped coverage using the world feed is aired in primetime and overnights on [[Tennis Channel]] and is branded ''Wimbledon Primetime''.

In [[Canada]], coverage of Wimbledon is exclusively carried by [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[RDS Info|RDS]], which are co-owned by Bell Media and ESPN.  Prior to 2012, [[CBC Television]] and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|SRC]] were the primary broadcaster of Wimbledon for Canada, and its live coverage of the tournament predated "Breakfast at Wimbledon" by over a decade, Canada being at least four hours from its fellow [[Commonwealth realms|Commonwealth realm]].

In [[Mexico]], the [[Televisa]] family of networks has aired Wimbledon since the early 1960s.  Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] with the weekday matches broadcast on the [[Televisa Deportes Network]].  As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after [[sign-on]].  Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.

In most of the remainder of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on [[ESPN Latin America|ESPN]], as do the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, [[SporTV]] has exclusive rights to the broadcast.

==== Other countries ====
In several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]], [[Eurosport 2]] and the Eurosport Player. Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] holds the right to show matches until 2022. In the [[Netherlands]] Center Court is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]] and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player. But Court One is covered live on [[Ziggo Sport]]/[[Ziggo Sport Select]].

In [[Australia]], the free-to-air [[Nine Network]] covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the [[Seven Network]], the then-host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel [[7Two]] would broadcast the event from 2011. Pay television network [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports Australia]] also covers the event. In [[India]] and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on [[Star Sports (Indian TV network)|Star Sports]].

Coverage is free-to-air in [[New Zealand]] through [[TVNZ One]], beginning each night at 11 pm (midday in London).  In 2017 their new channel, [[TVNZ Duke]] (also free-to-air), carried an alternative to the main feed, including (for example) matches on outside courts involving New Zealand players.

[[Fox Sports Asia]] holds broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia.

Most matches are also available for viewing through internet betting websites and other live streaming services, as television cameras are set up to provide continuous coverage on nearly all the courts.

== Trophies and prize money ==

=== Trophies ===
[[File:Wimbledon trophies.jpg|thumb|The Ladies' (top) and Gentlemen's singles trophies]]
The Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 47{{nbsp}}cm) in height and 7.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 19{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter. The trophy has been awarded since 1887 and bears the inscription: "All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World". The actual trophy remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 13.5 inches, 34{{nbsp}}cm).<ref name="wimbledon_trophies">{{cite web|title=Trophies|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/trophies.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>

The Ladies' Singles champion is presented with a sterling silver salver commonly known as the "[[Venus Rosewater Dish]]", or simply the "Rosewater Dish". The salver, which is 18.75{{nbsp}}inches (about 48{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology.  The actual dish remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a miniature replica bearing the names of all past Champions. From 1949 to 2006 the replica was 8 inches in diameter, and since 2007 it has been a three-quarter size replica with a diameter of 13.5 inches.<ref name="wimbledon_trophies" />

The winner of the Gentlemen's Doubles, Ladies' Doubles, and Mixed Doubles events receive silver cups. A trophy is awarded to each player in the Doubles pair, unlike the other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments where the winning Doubles duo shares a single trophy. The Gentlemen's Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884.
