'''''Good Girl Gone Bad Live''''' is the first [[Live album|live]] [[Music video|long-form video]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was first released on June 9, 2008 by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The [[DVD-Video|DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release features Rihanna's concert at the [[Manchester Arena]] in [[Manchester]], [[United Kingdom]] held on December 6, 2007, as part of her [[Good Girl Gone Bad Tour]] (2007—2009) which supported singer's third studio album ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007). Most of the concert's set list originates from ''Good Girl Gone Bad'', however, Rihanna also performed songs from her previous albums ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005) and ''[[A Girl like Me (Rihanna album)|A Girl like Me]]'' (2006). It also contains a special Documentary Feature that presents Rihanna discussing her experiences during the tour.

Critics were divided on ''Good Girl Gone Bad Live''; they praised the show, dancers, Rihanna's vocals and contrast levels of the video, however, there was criticism towards some technicalities including the close-up frames. At the [[2009 Grammy Awards]], the video album received a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Best Long Form Music Video]]. Commercially, ''Good Girl Gone Bad Live'' peaked within the top-ten in nine countries, including at number one in Austria and Switzerland. On the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' Music DVD Chart]] it peaked at number six and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 25,000 copies.

==Background and release==
Following the release of her two studio albums ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005) and ''[[A Girl like Me (Rihanna album)|A Girl like Me]]'' (2006), in late 2006 Rihanna started working with songwriters and producers on her third studio album. She worked with some of the producers who were involved on her previous albums including [[Evan Rogers]] and [[Carl Sturken]], [[Ne-Yo]], [[J.R. Rotem]], [[Sean Garrett]] and Norwegian duo [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]].<ref name="Moss">{{Cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Rihanna Gets Voice Lessons From Ne-Yo For 'Fresh, Uptempo' New Tracks |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1553347/20070226/rihanna.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV News]].

[[Apple Inc]]|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref> During an interview with [[MTV News]], Rihanna explained the meaning and reasoning behind the album's title:

{{Quote|We figured Good Girl Gone Bad was the perfect title because it showed people I'm my own [person] now. Not doing what anyone wants me to do. I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy. We have some urban records, some really pop records."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1558496/rihanna-goes-bad-with-jay-z-justin.jhtml|title=Rihanna Loses Good Girl Image, Thanks To Jay-Z, Justin, Timbaland, Ne-Yo|publisher=MTV News.

''Good Girl Gone Bad Live'' opens with a black-and-white [[video interlude]] of Rihanna putting on and zipping up leather clothing. Scenes are intercut with an aerial view of the audience in the arena. As the audience is waiting for her to perform, scenes of Rihanna approaching the stage are shown. As she says "Let's go" the music begins to play. The concert opens as Rihanna emerges from a portable floor behind a giant curtain and starts performing her debut single "[[Pon de Replay]]". The show continues with her performing "[[Break It Off]]" and "Let Me". Before performing "[[Rehab (Rihanna song)|Rehab]]", Rihanna reveals that the song was written by [[Justin Timberlake]] who is her "very good friend and hopes that the audience like it". Then, she performs "Breakin' Dishes" before rendering a cover of "[[Is This Love (Bob Marley & The Wailers song)|Is This Love]]", a song by Jamaican reggae singer [[Bob Marley]] and his band [[Bob Marley & The Wailers|The Wailers]]. "Is This Love" is mashed-up with "Kisses Don't Lie". The song is the last from the first set and ends with Rihanna leaving the stage at the portable floor from which she entered.<ref name="Album Credits">{{cite AV media notes |title=Good Girl Gone Bad Live |others=[[Rihanna]] |year=2008 |type=Booklet |publisher=[[The Island Def Jam Music Group]]|location=[[Manchester]], UK}}</ref>

The second set opens with Rihanna performing "[[SOS (Rihanna song)|SOS]]", accompanied with dancers wearing [[Ancient Egypt]] inspired outfits who through the performance change their clothes. Rihanna then sits on the stairs on the stage together with her back-up singers Ashley and Erica who are about to help her with the next songs, "Good Girl Gone Bad" and "[[Hate That I Love You]]". Rihanna finishes the set with the performances of the ballad "[[Unfaithful (song)|Unfaithful]]" and "Sell Me Candy". In the next set, the [[disc jockey]] asks the audience are they ready to party and then Rihanna emerges from behind the stage to perform "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" and "Push Up on Me"; the latter features Rihanna and the dancers climbing on assembled rods. Before the performance of "[[Shut Up and Drive (Rihanna song)|Shut Up and Drive]]", the back-up singers run through the stage carrying finish [[racing flags]]. As Rihanna enters the stage, the dancers also come together with chairs which are set to represent [[vehicle]] seats. Rihanna performs "Question Existing" on a leopard-leather inspired sofa which is climbed on a pedestal. The concert ends with the performance of "Umbrella". Before performing the song, Rihanna speaks to the audience telling that she will perform her "biggest record so far all over the world". The concert ends with frames of the audience and the fans.<ref name="Album Credits"/>

===Documentary Feature===
{{Quote box|width=30%|bgcolor=#ffeeaa|align=left|quote="Every day I hit the stage, I look out at the audience and I think: 'They all bought those tickets to come and see me perform. Oh my God, they are singing my song, they're screaming my name.' That's when all gets weird. So it's kind of overwhelming".|source=—Rihanna talking about her fans during the Documentary Feature interview.<ref name="Album Credits"/>}}

''Good Girl Gone Bad Live'' contains a Documentary Feature of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour during her course. It begins with the performance of "Umbrella" at the Manchester show when the scenes are intercut with Rihanna talking about how her fans are coming to watch her on the tour concerts. Other scenes of Rihanna and her crew members, dancers and band are also shown backstage. Rihanna then continues with the interview telling about how she went to some places that she never heard in her life including [[Ischgl]] and [[Sofia]]. She also explains how flying in private jet with her team like "one family" is fun, but very rare. Scenes of Rihanna performing a show in Ischgl and having snowball fight with hear team at the town's streets are shown. During the interview Rihanna explains that she, her crew members and dancers were touring for a considerable amount of time and became very close so as a result of that, they hang out a lot. One of the crew explains: "It is like a family. Rihanna comes in every day, says hi to every single one of us. Each of us come in every day, we all say hi to each other." Rihanna further describes herself as a prankster, and a story of her and one of the crew members pranking is shown. Scenes are intercut to Rihanna and her team performing a show. Later, Rihanna jokingly explains that they put probably "the worst show ever" because of her dancers.<ref name="Album Credits"/>

Rihanna explains what they do when they get to a city: "Sometimes we get to the city that morning. We sometimes come straight to the venue. We pull up, everybody comes out, you shower, then you do your sound check. Then it's time to get ready. Hair, makeup, that's the fun part." Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is "good girl gone bad and black is kind of [[Gothic rock|gothic]] and [[rock n' roll]]". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is [[up-tempo]] and [[Loudness|loud]], before becoming a little bit "mellow" at the middle of it. The show then gets "on party" again with their [[Techno music|techno]] club set-list. The encore consists of "Question Existing" and "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, "Question Existing" is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very hard for her to call herself a superstar. The Documentary Feature ends with Rihanna announcing that in the end of 2008 she will be hitting the studio again and "she won't be away for too long".<ref name="Album Credits"/>

==Critical response==
Azeem Ahmad of [[MusicOMH]] positively reviewed ''Good Girl Gone Bad Live'' giving it four stars and wrote that "it isn't going to win over any new fans, but buying it won't disappoint the many that already exist".<ref name="musicOMH">{{cite web|last=Ahmad |first=Azeem |date=June 16, 2008 |title=Rihanna – Good Girl Gone Bad Live |url=http://www.musicomh.com/music/dvds/rihanna_0608.htm |publisher=[[musicOMH]] |accessdate=July 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010101237/http://www.musicomh.com/music/dvds/rihanna_0608.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}</ref> According to him the songs are different from their recorded versions and sound "infectiously upbeat but in a more grown-up way than the album". Ahmad concluded that even the "cringey" [[American English|American]] pronunciation of "Manchester" and associated drivel can't take away the vocal strength of "Rehab".<ref name="musicOMH"/> He further praised the interlude "Scratch" calling it "impressive". Ahmad concluded that "If anyone was still wondering, Rihanna isn't miming during this show but the DVD's audio might be little bit out of sync with the video."<ref name="musicOMH"/> A reviewer of Blu-ray.com was more critical stating that even though the transfer does not have serious technical flaws, the video can not pair to ''[[Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]'' (2009) by American rock band [[The Killers]].<ref name="blu-ray"/> According to the reviewer there are few close-ups that look soft and also a lot of motion-judder that ranges from mild to strong. He stated that the camera positioning during a lot of acts in not "overly convincing" and some close-ups are too dark.<ref name="blu-ray"/> However, according to him contrast levels are good. The reviewer concluded that "all in all, consistency is definitely an issue with Good Girl Gone Bad; parts of the show look great in high-definition, but there are also certain parts of it that are far from convincing."<ref name="blu-ray"/> At the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]], ''Good Girl Gone Bad Live'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Best Long Form Music Video]], but lost to ''[[Runnin' Down a Dream (film)|Runnin' Down a Dream]]'' (2007).<ref name="grammy.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=All&genre=18 |title=Past Winners Search |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}}</ref>
