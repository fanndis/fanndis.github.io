'''Frida Giannini''' (born in Rome, 1972) is an Italian fashion designer. She was the [[creative director]] of the Italian fashion house [[Gucci]] from 2006 to 2014.<ref>MATTHEW SCHNEIER [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/fashion/after-frida-gianninis-departure-a-brand-new-mens-collection-at-gucci.html?_r=0 After Frida Giannini’s Departure, a Brand-New Men’s Collection at Gucci] [[nytimes.com]] JAN. 20, 2015</ref>

==Education==
Giannini studied [[fashion design]] at Rome's Fashion Academy.<ref>[http://www.businessoffashion.com/frida-giannini Frida Giannini] businessoffashion.com</ref>

==Career==
In 1997, Giannini worked for [[Fendi]] to design [[ready-to-wear]]. After three seasons, she was promoted to designer of leather goods. In 2002, she joined Gucci as design director of handbags.<ref name="vogue">{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/frida-giannini |title=Frida Giannini |author=Sowray, Bibby |work=British Vogue |date=May 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

In 2004, Giannini was appointed to head women's accessories when [[Tom Ford]] departed the company. At the time, Gucci stores focused its inventory on the "GG" [[monogram]] canvas bag. Giannini attempted to change Gucci's style from [[Tom Ford]]'s designs by drawing from Gucci's heritage. Based on the 1960s [[Grace Kelly]] scarf, she developed the "Flora" collection of colorful bags. The collection was not well received by critics. In 2006, [[Women's Wear Daily]] commented: "Trends do not start here." However, Flora proved to be Giannini's first commercial success and she applied the style to other accessories including ballet shoes.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703399404575505423060865984 |title=Gucci Unpacks 'La Dolce Vita' |author=Passariello, Christina |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 21, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> In 2006, Giannini was promoted to Creative Director for the entire Gucci label.

Giannini continues to design from heritage. For example, the 2010 Winter Men's line was noted for influences from Gucci's equestrian history. However, Giannini says, "I don't think it is a nostalgic collection, but heritage is good for me—going back to the archives, but looking forward to the future."<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/fashion/19iht-rsuzy.html?ref=frida_giannini |title=The Calm After the Storm |author=Menkes, Suzy |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 18, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

In 2011 she created, in collaboration with [[Lapo Elkann]], the [[Fiat 500]] by Gucci, a special edition of the Italian car.

On 12 December 2014 [[Kering SA]] announced Frida Giannini and Patrizio di Marco will be leaving the company.  Giannini plans to see the fall/winter collection through to the [[Milan Fashion Week]] and departed in early 2015.  <ref>{{cite web|last1=Milligan|first1=Lauren|title=Giannini And Di Marco Both Leave Gucci|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/12/12/frida-giannini-leaves-gucci-steps-down-with-patrizio-de-marco|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Her successor is [[Alessandro Michele]].<ref> Bridget Foley [http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/gucci-confirms-michele-as-creative-director-8127391 Gucci Confirms Alessandro Michele as Creative Director] [[Women's Wear Daily]] January 21, 2015 </ref>
