The '''2014 New Zealand general election''' took place on Saturday 20 September 2014 to determine the membership of the [[51st New Zealand Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9811213/Election-date-announced-for-September |title=Election date announced for September |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand |date=10 March 2014 |accessdate= 10 March 2014}}</ref>

Voters elected 121 members to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], with 71 from single-member [[electoral district|electorates]] (an increase from 70 in 2011)<ref name="3newselectorates">{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Population-growth-leads-to-new-electorate/tabid/423/articleID/316171/Default.aspx |title= Population growth leads to new electorate |first= Simon |last= Wong |publisher=3 News NZ |date= 7 October 2013 |accessdate= 7 October 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194827/http://www.3news.co.nz/Population-growth-leads-to-new-electorate/tabid/423/articleID/316171/Default.aspx |archive-date= 29 October 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref> and 49 from [[Party lists in the 2014 New Zealand general election|party lists]]. Since 1996, New Zealand has used the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) voting system, giving voters two votes: one for a political party and one for their local electorate MP. The party vote decides how many seats each party gets in the new Parliament; a party is entitled to a share of the seats if it receives 5% of the party vote or wins an electorate. Normally, the House has 120 seats but extra seats may be added where there is an [[Overhang seat|overhang]], caused by a party winning more electorates than seats it is entitled to. The one-seat overhang from the 50th Parliament will remain for the 51st Parliament, after [[United Future]] won one electorate when their 0.22% party vote did not entitle them to any seats.

A total of 3,140,417 people were registered to vote in the election; around 92.6% of all eligible New Zealanders.<ref name="enrolstats">

==Background==

===MMP review=== <!-- this section added to article [[Electoral system of New Zealand]] -->
{{main|Electoral reform in New Zealand#2012 review}}
A [[2011 New Zealand voting system referendum|referendum on the voting system]] took place in conjunction with the 2011 election, with 57.8% of voters voting to keep the existing Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting system. Under the terms of the Electoral Referendum Act 2010 the majority vote in favour of retaining MMP meant that the Electoral Commission had the task of conducting an independent review of the workings of the MMP system.

The Commission released a consultation paper in February 2012 calling for public submissions on ways to improve the MMP system, with the focus put on six areas:

# basis of eligibility for list seats (thresholds)
# [[by-election]] candidates
# dual candidacy
# order of candidates on [[Party-list proportional representation|party lists]]
# [[Overhang seat|overhang]]
# proportion of electorate seats to list seats

The Commission released a proposal paper for consultation in August 2012 and published its final report on 29 October 2012. In the report, the Commission recommended the following:<ref name="MMPproposal">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20report%202012%20review%20of%20MMP.pdf |title= Report of the Electoral Commission on the review of the MMP voting system |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 29 October 2012 |accessdate= 7 December 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121114205922/http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20Report%202012%20Review%20of%20MMP.pdf |archive-date= 14 November 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref>
* Reducing the party vote threshold from 5 percent to 4 percent. If introduced, the 4 percent threshold should be reviewed after three general elections.
* Abolishing the one electorate seat threshold – a party must cross the party vote threshold to gain list seats.
* Abolishing the provision of overhang seats for parties not reaching the threshold – the extra electorates would be made up at the expense of list seats to retain 120 MPs
* Retaining the status quo for by-election candidacy and dual candidacy.
* Retaining the status quo with closed party lists, but increasing scrutiny in selection of list candidates to ensure parties comply with their own party rules.
* Parliament should give consideration to fixing the ratio between electorate seats and list seats at 60:40 (72:48 in a 120-seat parliament).

Parliament has the right to decide whether to implement any changes to the system, which had been largely unchanged since it was introduced in 1994 for the {{NZ election link|1996}}. In November 2012 a [[private member's bill]] under the name of opposition Labour Party member [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] proposed implementing the first two recommendations; it was drawn from the member's bill ballot on 14 November 2013, but by the time Parliament dissolved for the election, it was still awaiting its first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL12864_1/electoral-adjustment-of-thresholds-amendment-bill |title= Electoral (Adjustment of Thresholds) Amendment Bill – Bills – Legislation |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |date= 14 November 2013 |accessdate= 24 September 2014}}</ref>
In May 2014 [[Judith Collins]] and John Key announced that no inter-party consensus existed on implementing the recommendations of the Commission, so the Government would not introduce any legislation.<ref>{{cite news

===50th Parliament (2011–14)===
{{main|50th New Zealand Parliament}}
Following the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] entered into [[confidence and supply]] agreements with [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], the [[Māori Party]] and [[United Future]] to continue the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]]. These arrangements give the National-led government a majority of seven seats, with 64 on confidence-and-supply in the 121-seat Parliament.

The [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]], [[New Zealand First]] and [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana]] parties are all in opposition, but only the Labour Party constitutes the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|formal Opposition]].

At the 2011 election, the National Party gained 59 seats, the Labour Party 34 seats, the Green Party 14 seats, New Zealand First eight seats, Māori three seats, and Mana, ACT, and United Future gained one seat each. One change was made to the allocation during the Parliament. In 2012, [[Brendan Horan]] was expelled from the NZ First caucus but continued to sit as an Independent, meaning NZ First had seven caucus MPs for the remainder of the Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/Parties/NZFirst/|title=New Zealand Parliament – NZ First|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

On 31 May 2013, the Electoral Commission de-registered United Future after it could not prove it had the 500 financial members required for registration. The party successfully re-registered on 13 August 2013, but in the interim its sole MP, [[Peter Dunne]], sat in the house as an independent. On 13 June 2014, ACT's sole MP [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] resigned from Parliament after being found guilty of filing a false electoral return for his 2010 Auckland mayoral campaign. As his resignation came within six months of the election, his seat was left vacant, meaning ACT had no representation in Parliament until the general election.

==Dates==
On 10 March 2014, Prime Minister John Key announced that the election would take place on Saturday 20 September 2014. As in 2011, the Prime Minister announced the date early, although only six months in advance compared to the nearly ten months in 2011. Traditionally, the election date is a closely guarded secret, and announced as late as possible.<ref>{{cite news |first= Hamish |last= Rutherford |date= 10 March 2014 |title= Election date announced for September |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9811213/Election-date-announced-for-September |publisher=Fairfax NZ News |accessdate= 19 September 2014}}</ref>

A general election must take place every three years, and Parliaments generally run the full three-year term unless an early election is called or the election date is set to circumvent holding a by-election. Voting for the previous election occurred on Saturday, 26 November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Election Results |url=http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/ |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> In 1950, New Zealand introduced a legal requirement to hold elections on a Saturday,<ref name="Key dates in electoral reform">{{cite web|title=Key dates in New Zealand electoral reform|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/key-dates-electoral-reform.html|publisher=Elections New Zealand|accessdate=6 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109015352/http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/key-dates-electoral-reform.html|archive-date=9 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and beginning with the {{NZ election link|1957}}, a convention evolved to hold general elections on the last Saturday of November.

Ideally, major diplomatic visits and engagements should be avoided during the election period, as they can distract politicians from campaigning and voters may see them as an attempt to influence the election result.<ref>{{cite news |first= Pattrick |last= Smellie |date= 3 February 2014 |title= Key hints at election date |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11196113 |work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate= 3 February 2013}}</ref>

==Electorate boundaries==
Per the Electoral Act 1993, the South Island must have 16 general electorates, with the number of North Island general and Maori electorates calculated by dividing the respective population in each group by one-sixteenth of the South Island general electorate population, within a tolerance of five percent. At the 2011 election, the North Island had 47 general electorates and the Maori roll had seven Māori electorates, totalling 70 electorates across the country. Following the March [[2013 New Zealand census]] and the 2013 Maori electoral option, the Representation Commission re-drew some electorate boundaries.

In October 2013, Statistics New Zealand announced that there would be one additional North Island general electorate, bringing the total number of North Island general electorates to 48 and the overall number of electorates to 71.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9252413/NZ-to-get-one-new-electorate |title = NZ to get one new electorate |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand |date= 7 October 2013 |accessdate = 27 October 2013}}</ref> Growth in Auckland saw three existing electorates, [[Auckland Central (New Zealand electorate)|Auckland Central]], [[Helensville (New Zealand electorate)|Helensville]] and [[Hunua (New Zealand electorate)|Hunua]], exceed their quota by at least 14 percent. Population changes in Christchurch following the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|2011 earthquakes]] meanwhile saw the [[Christchurch East (New Zealand electorate)|Christchurch East]] electorate drop to 23 percent below quota, while the urban fringe electorate of [[Selwyn (New Zealand electorate)|Selwyn]] grew to 14 percent above quota.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Population-growth-leads-to-new-electorate/tabid/423/articleID/316171/Default.aspx |title= Population growth leads to new electorate |first= Simon |last= Wong |publisher=3 News NZ |date= 7 October 2013 |accessdate= 27 October 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194827/http://www.3news.co.nz/Population-growth-leads-to-new-electorate/tabid/423/articleID/316171/Default.aspx |archive-date= 29 October 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

The Representation Commission, tasked with redrawing the electorate boundaries, released its final electorate boundaries on 17 April 2014. The largest changes took place in northern and western Auckland, with two new electorates – {{NZ electorate link|Upper Harbour}} and {{NZ electorate link|Kelston}} – created, while the existing {{NZ electorate link|Waitakere}} electorate was dissolved.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9423676/New-seats-in-electoral-shake-up |title= New seats in electoral shake-up |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand |date= 21 November 2013 |accessdate= 21 November 2013}}</ref> Upper Harbour centres on the [[Upper Harbour Bridge]], stretching from [[Wairau Valley, Auckland|Wairau Valley]] to [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]], and was predicted to be a safe National seat. Kelston centres on the [[Kelston, New Zealand|western Auckland suburb of the same name]], stretching from [[Oratia]] to [[Waterview, New Zealand|Waterview]], and was predicted to be a safe Labour seat.<ref name="Small2013" /> Kelston's creation took population from the Mount Albert electorate, which in turn allowed Mount Albert to take [[Westmere, New Zealand|Westmere]] and [[Grey Lynn]] from Auckland Central, bringing Auckland Central within quota. Helensville's over-quota has been solved by the creation of the Upper Harbour electorate, while Hunua has lost the area south of the Auckland Region boundary to {{NZ electorate link|Waikato}} to bring it within quota.

In Christchurch, the under-quota {{NZ electorate link|Christchurch East}} and {{NZ electorate link|Christchurch Central}} electorates took population from {{NZ electorate link|Waimakariri}} in the north and from [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills]] in the south. While it was correctly predicted Christchurch East would remain a Labour seat, the prediction that the marginal Christchurch Central electorate would move in Labour's favour proved false; the seat instead swung in National's favour. The loss of Labour-leaning urban parts of Waimakariri made it a safer seat for National, which increased it majority from 642 votes in 2011 to 2,133 in 2014. The [[Halswell]]-Oaklands-[[Westmorland, New Zealand|Westmorland]] area moved from Selwyn into Port Hills to compensate for Port Hills' loss and to bring Selwyn within quota. As Halswell-Oaklands-Westmorland are predominantly National-leaning, it caused the Labour-held electorate of Port Hills to become more marginal.<ref name="Small2013">{{cite news |url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/9429898/Bennett-won-t-make-way-for-Craig |title= Bennett won't make way for Craig |first= Vernon |last= Small |work= The Dominion Post |page= A2 |date= 22 November 2013 |accessdate= 22 November 2013}}
</ref>

In Wellington, the Labour-leaning {{NZ electorate link|Hutt South}} electorate took the National-leaning western hill suburbs of Lower Hutt from {{NZ electorate link|Ōhariu}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rimutaka}}, in exchange for Rimutaka taking the Labour-leaning [[state housing]] suburb of [[Naenae]]. The changes allowed Ōhariu to take [[Wadestown, New Zealand|Wadestown]] off the over-quota Wellington Central electorate. This was correctly predicted to make Hutt South more marginal; Labour's Trevor Mallard retained the seat in 2011 by a 4825-vote majority, and this reduced to just 709 in 2014,<ref>{{cite news |first= Derek |last= Cheng |date= 5 September 2014 |title= Boundary changes put Mallard in danger |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11319247 |work= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate= 11 September 2014}}</ref> while Rimutaka's [[Chris Hipkins]] increased his majority by 3,378 votes.

==Retiring MPs==
Twenty-two existing Members of Parliament did not stand for re-election, including fourteen members of the governing National Party.

At the close of nominations, 554 individuals had been nominated to contest the election, up from 544 at the 2011 election. Of those, 71 were list-only, 114 were electorate-only (including 13 candidates from non-registered parties and 23 independent candidates), and 369 contested for both list and electorate seats. Just under 30% of candidates (164) were female, up from 27% in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/electoral-commission-releases-party-and-candidate-lists-2014-election |title= Electoral Commission releases party and candidate lists for 2014 election |date= 27 August 2014 |publisher=Electoral Commission (New Zealand) |accessdate= 27 August 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140827121017/http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/electoral-commission-releases-party-and-candidate-lists-2014-election |archive-date= 27 August 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Political parties registered with the Electoral Commission on Writ Day can contest the general election as a party. Each such party can submit a party list to contest the party vote, and can have a party election-expenses limit in addition to limits on individual candidates' campaigns. At Writ Day, 19 political parties had registered to contend the general election.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/parties-candidates/registered-political-parties-0/register-political-parties |title= Register of Political Parties |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate= 17 August 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130829210149/http://www.elections.org.nz/parties-candidates/registered-political-parties-0/register-political-parties |archive-date= 29 August 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref> At the close of nominations, 15 registered parties had put forward a party list to the Commission to contest the party vote, up from 13 in 2011.

On 27 May 2014, the [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana Party]] and [[Internet Party (New Zealand)|Internet Party]] announced an agreement to field a combined party list at the election under the Internet Mana Party banner. Their electorate candidates, however, can continue to campaign under each individual party's banner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11262597|title=Mana confirms election year deal with Internet Party|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/asia/new-zealand-kim-dotcom-harawira/|title=Kim Dotcom, Maori nationalist: The world's least likely political bedfellows?|date=27 May 2014|publisher=CNN|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

==Campaigning==

===Campaign expense limits and broadcasting allocations===
During the three-month regulated period prior to election day (i.e. 20 June to 19 September 2014), parties and candidates have limits on how much they may spend on election campaigning. It is illegal in New Zealand to campaign on election day itself.

For the 2014 election, every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend $1,091,000 plus $25,700 per electorate candidate on election campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately). A party contesting all 71 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $2,915,700 on election campaigning. All electorate candidates are permitted to spend $25,700 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Part 7: Election expenses, donations and loans – Party Secretary Handbook |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/party-secretary-handbook/part-7-election-expenses-donations-loans |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= April 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2014}}</ref>

Registered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning, and broadcasting time on [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to make opening and closing addresses. Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; the actual production costs of advertisements can come from the general election expenses budget.<ref>{{cite web |title= Part 7: Election campaigning – Party Secretary Handbook |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/party-secretary-handbook/part-6-election-campaigning |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= April 2014 |accessdate= 28 August 2014}}</ref>

The Electoral Commission sets the amount of broadcasting funds and time each party gets. The initial election broadcasting allocation was announced on 6 June 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title= 2014 broadcasting allocation decision released |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/2014-broadcasting-allocation-decision-released |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 6 June 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2014}}</ref> Two parties who were allocated broadcasting funds and time failed to register by Writ Day, so their funding and allocation of time for closing address were redistributed to the remaining parties. ACT did not receive any redistributed funding as they had lost their only MP since the initial allocation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/2014-variation-broadcasting-allocation-decision-released |title= 2014 Variation Broadcasting Allocation Decision Released |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 20 August 2014 |accessdate= 22 August 2014}}</ref> Broadcasting funding was further redistributed on 29 August after the Alliance failed to register its party list (a requirement to receive broadcasting funds).<ref name="august29">{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/29-august-2014-variation-broadcasting-allocation-decision-released |title= 29 August 2014 Variation Broadcasting Allocation Decision Released |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 29 August 2014 |accessdate= 4 September 2014}}</ref> This coincided with the Conservative Party's bid to receive a court-mandated increase in broadcasting funds and time,<ref>{{cite news |last=Davison |first=Isaac |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11312930 |title=Colin Craig heading to court yet again |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=22 August 2014 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> which was taken into consideration when funding was redistributed for the second time.<ref name="august29" />

==Opinion polling==
{{Main|Opinion polling for the 2014 New Zealand general election}}

Opinion polls have been undertaken periodically since the 2011 election by [[Fairfax Media]] (Fairfax Media [[Ipsos]]), [[MediaWorks New Zealand]] ([[3 News]] Reid Research), [[The New Zealand Herald]] (Herald Digipoll), [[Roy Morgan Research]], and [[Television New Zealand]] (''[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]'' [[Colmar Brunton]]). The graph on the left below shows the collated results of all five polls for parties that polled above the 5% electoral threshold at the 2011 election; The graph on the right shows results for parties that polled between 1% and 4.9%, or won an electorate seat, at the 2011 election, as well as parties contesting the 2014 election which have polled over 1.0% since 2011.

After the November 2011 election, National remained around the 47% mark in polling until the end of 2013, when its popularity slowly rose to 49% by the last week before the election. Labour recovered from its 27.5% election result to cross the 30% mark in March 2012, before levelling out around 33% for most of 2013. From around November 2013, Labour's support started slipping, down to 25% by election day. The Green Party and New Zealand First did not move much from the 11% and 5% marks respectively until the last few weeks before the election, where they each gained 1–2%. No other party has polled above the 5% threshold, although the Conservative Party came close on individual polls in the weeks before the election.

==Results==
Preliminary results were gradually released after 19:00 ([[New Zealand Standard Time|NZST]]) on 20 September, with the targets that all advance vote results were available by 20:30 and all preliminary results were available by 23:30. The preliminary count is done within the polling booths, and only includes ordinary votes; it does not include any [[special vote]]s. Special votes include votes from those who enrolled after the deadline on 20 August, those who voted outside their electorate (this includes all overseas votes), hospital votes, and those voters enrolled on the unpublished roll.

All voting papers, counterfoils and electoral rolls are returned to the electorate's returning officer for a compulsory recount; this also includes approving and counting any special votes, and compiling a master roll to ensure no voter has [[Ballot stuffing|voted more than once]]. Official results, including all recounted ordinary votes and special votes, were released at 14:00 on Saturday 4 October 2014. Parties and candidates had 3 working days afterwards (i.e. until 8 October 2014) to apply to the [[District Court of New Zealand|District Court]] for a [[Election recount|judicial recount]].

On 7 October 2014, Mana Party leader [[Hone Harawira]] filed for a judicial recount of the [[Te Tai Tokerau]] electorate.<ref>{{cite news |first= Katie |last= Bradford |date= 7 October 2014 |title= Hone Harawira seeks recount in Te Tai Tokerau |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/hone-harawira-seeks-recount-in-te-tai-tokerau-6100137 |publisher=Television New Zealand |accessdate= 8 October 2014}}</ref> The recount was taken under the auspices of Judge TJ Broadmore at the Kaitaia District Court on 8 and 9 October, and apart from a few minor changes in vote tallies, the official result was upheld.<ref>{{cite court |litigants= re Application by Hone Harawira for an order that a recount of the electorate votes in the Te Tai Tokerau electorate be conducted |court= District Court of New Zealand at Kaitaia |date= 16 October 2014 |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/expanded_decision_to_the_te_tai_tokerau_recount.pdf |accessdate= 29 June 2017}}</ref>

===Non-parliamentary parties===
Eight parties did not gain 5% of the party vote or win an electorate seat, entitling them to no representation in the 51st Parliament.

Despite speculation{{by whom|date=September 2014}} that the Conservative Party might cross the 5% threshold, it did not; nonetheless, it secured an increase in its share of the party vote, winning just under 4.0%. The [[Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party]] received 0.46% of the vote, twice as many as the lowest-polling party to gain a seat, [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]].<ref name="results" />

===Electorate results===

{{clear}}
Prior to the election, the National Party held the majority of the electorate seats with 41. Labour held 22 seats, Māori held three seats, and ACT, Mana and United Future held one seat each. There are two new electorates in 2014, {{NZ electorate link|Kelston}} and {{NZ electorate link|Upper Harbour}}.

National held steady on 41 electorates, Labour gained three seats to hold 27 electorates, Māori lost two seats to hold one, and ACT and United Future held steady with one seat each. The Mana Party lost its only seat, after sole incumbent MP [[Hone Harawira]] lost {{NZ electorate link|Te Tai Tokerau}} to Labour's [[Kelvin Davis (politician)|Kelvin Davis]].

In the two new electorates, Labour's [[Carmel Sepuloni]] won Kelston, while National's [[Paula Bennett]] won Upper Harbour. Bennett previously held {{NZ electorate link|Waitakere}}, which was disestablished prior to the election in favour of the two new electorates.

In 11 electorates, the incumbents did not seek re-election, and the seats passed to new MPs of the same party. In the remaining 3 electorates where the incumbent did not seek re-election, the electorate changed allegiance. In {{NZ electorate link|Napier}}, Labour's [[Stuart Nash]] won the seat off retiring National MP Chris Tremain, caused by large [[vote splitting]] between National candidate Wayne Walford and Conservative candidate [[Garth McVicar]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/vote-2014-news/labour-crushes-rivals-in-takeover-napier-seat-6086976 |title= Labour crushes rivals in takeover of Napier seat |publisher=Television New Zealand |date= 20 September 2014 |accessdate= 21 September 2014}}</ref> In {{NZ electorate link|Tāmaki Makaurau}} and {{NZ electorate link|Te Tai Hauāuru}}, Labour won both seats off the retiring Māori Party co-leaders Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia.

Of the 55 electorates where the incumbents sought re-election, only the aforementioned Te Tai Tokerau changed hands.

==Post-election events==

===Leadership changes===
{{main|2014 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election}}
On 30 September 2014, Labour leader [[David Cunliffe]] stepped down and forced a party leadership election. [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] won leadership of the Labour Party,

===Local by-elections===
Two sitting mayors of local councils were elected: [[Jono Naylor]] (National) of [[Palmerston North|Palmerston North City]] and [[Ron Mark]] (NZ First) of [[Carterton, New Zealand|Carterton District]]. Both announced they would stand down as mayors if elected to Parliament, resulting in by-elections being called in Palmerston North and Carterton.

Nominations for the Palmerston North mayoral by-election close on 22 December 2014, with the by-election taking place on 10 February 2015 if needed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pncc.govt.nz/news-events-and-culture/news/nominations-now-open-for-mayoral-candidates/ |title= Nominations now open for Mayoral candidates |publisher=Palmerston North City Council |date= 28 November 2014 |accessdate= 7 December 2014}}</ref> Carterton's incumbent deputy mayor, John Booth, was elected mayor unopposed on 28 October 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yong |first1=Alisa |date=29 October 2014 |title=New mayor 'rapt' to carry legacy |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wairarapa-times-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503414&objectid=11349761 |work=Wairarapa Times Age |location=Masterton |publisher=APN New Zealand |accessdate=7 December 2014 }}</ref>

===Financial market reaction===
Within an hour of the [[New Zealand Exchange]] opening on Monday 22 September, the headline [[NZX 50 Index]] jumped 1.27%, led by the country's five main electricity generator-retailers: [[Contact Energy]], [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]], [[Meridian Energy]], [[Mercury Energy|Mighty River Power]] and [[TrustPower]]. During the previous Parliament, the National Party partially [[privatisation|privatised]] Genesis, Meridian and Mighty River, reducing the Crown's share from 100% to 51%. In response, the Labour and Green parties promised to reform the wholesale electricity market if elected, which would have provided cheaper retail prices by cutting how much generators could profit off their wholesale prices.<ref>{{cite news |first= Christopher |last= Adams |date= 22 September 2014 |title= Power shares tipped to keep rising after Nat victory |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11329267 |work= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate= 22 September 2014}}</ref>

===Election offences===
Under section 197(1g) of the Electoral Act 1993, it is illegal for any person to publish anything that may influence voters to vote in a particular way between 00:00 and 19:00 on election day. The rule applies equally to traditional media and [[social media]], and those found breaking the rule can be fined up to $20,000. After the election, 24 people were caught out by the rule and referred to Police. Among those were former [[All Black]] [[Jonah Lomu]], current All Black [[Israel Dagg]], and Olympic rowing medallist [[Eric Murray (rower)|Eric Murray]], who were caught [[Twitter|tweeting]] their support for the National Party during the gag period.<ref>{{Cite news |date= 4 November 2014 |title= Jonah Lomu among stars referred to police over vote tweets |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10698431/Jonah-Lomu-among-stars-referred-to-police-over-vote-tweets |publisher=Fairfax NZ News |accessdate= 5 November 2014}}</ref>

A complaint was made against the Civilian Party for failure to include a promoter statement on their Facebook page as required by section 204F of the Electoral Act. Ben Uffindell, Party Leader, noted that the omission of the promoter statement was inadvertent and immediately placed a promoter statement onto the page after being instructed to do so by the Electoral Commission.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
