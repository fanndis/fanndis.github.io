The '''American Bar Association''' ('''ABA'''), founded August 21, 1878,<ref>[http://www.abanet.org/about/history.html ABA History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027093641/http://www.abanet.org/about/history.html |date=2007-10-27 }}; For a historical overview see Matzko, John A., "'The Best Men of the Bar': The Founding of the American Bar Association," in ''The New High Priests: Lawyers in Post-Civil War America'', Gerard W. Gawalt (ed.), (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1984), pp. 75-96.</ref> is a [[voluntary association|voluntary]] [[bar association]] of [[lawyers]] and law students, which is not specific to any jurisdiction in the United States. The ABA's most important stated activities are the setting of academic standards for [[law school]]s, and the formulation of model ethical codes related to the legal profession. As of fiscal year 2017, the ABA had 194,000 dues-paying members, constituting approximately 14.4% of U.S. attorneys.<ref>https://www.legalmosaic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ABA-Story.pdf</ref> In 1979, half of all lawyers in the U.S. were members of the ABA.<ref name=bloomberg/> The organization's national [[headquarters]] are in [[Chicago, Illinois]]; it also maintains a significant branch office in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
[[File:American Bar Association 3c 1953 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. stamp commemorating the ABA's 75th anniversary in 1953]]
The ABA was founded on August 21, 1878, in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], by 75 lawyers from 20 states and the District of Columbia. According to the ABA website,

{{quote|The legal profession as we know it today barely existed at that time. Lawyers were generally sole practitioners who trained under a system of apprenticeship. There was no national code of ethics; there was no national organization to serve as a forum for discussion of the increasingly intricate issues involved in legal practice.}}

The purpose of the original organization, as set forth in its first constitution, was "the advancement of the science of jurisprudence, the promotion of the administration of justice and a uniformity of legislation throughout the country...."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lectlaw.com/files/att05.htm|title=Brief History Of The American Bar Association |website=Lectlaw.com|access-date=18 December 2018}}</ref>

In 1918, the first women were admitted to the ABA – Judge Mary Belle Grossman of Cleveland and Mary Florence Lathrop of Denver.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nywba.org/history2/ |title=History |url-status=live|website = New York Women's Bar Association |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180522002757/https://www.nywba.org/history2/ |archive-date=22 May 2018 }}</ref>

The ABA did not allow African-Americans to join until 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/09/06/paulette-brown-become-first-african-american-woman-head-american-bar-association/dFc460FXfVoONC0AAcAWWJ/story.html|title=Paulette Brown to become first African-American woman to head the American Bar Association  |work=BostonGlobe.com}}</ref> This discrimination by the ABA led to the formation, in 1937, of the [[National Lawyers Guild]].

[[Roberta Cooper Ramo]] was the first female President of the ABA from 1995 to 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wisc-amh.org/symposia/view/2-risk-reinvention-how-women-are-changing-the-world|title=Risk & Reinvention: How Women Are Changing the World — August 15-16, 2014 |website= Women's International Study Center |url-status = dead |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140801170917/http://wisc-amh.org/symposia/view/2-risk-reinvention-how-women-are-changing-the-world|archive-date = 1 August 2014}}</ref>

In 2016 ABA introduced a new ethics rule prohibiting attorneys from using [[sexist]], [[racist]] and condescending terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/honeys-finally-barred-from-courtroom-aba-move-long-overdue/|title='Honeys' finally barred from courtroom; ABA move long overdue|date=16 August 2016|website=Seattletimes.com}}</ref>  The rule also prohibits attorneys from engaging in discrimination based on age in the conduct of bar association activities.<ref name="americanbar.org">https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/2016%20Annual%20Resolutions/109.pdf</ref>

On May 1, 2019, the ABA launched a new membership model aimed at reversing declining membership and revenue.<ref name=bloomberg>{{Cite web|date = 1 May 2019|url= http://biglawbusiness.com/abas-new-membership-model-logo-go-into-effect|title=New ABA Membership Strategy Aims to Reverse Slide (1)|last=Stanzione|first=Melissa Heelan|website=biglawbusiness.com|language=en}}</ref>  As mentioned in "Criticisms," below, and despite ABA's own rule against age-discriminatory conduct, the "experience-based" component of the ABA dues structure is a proxy for age discrimination, imposing significantly higher dues on lawyers as their years in practice increase.<ref name="ReferenceA">https://www.americanbar.org/membership/dues_eligibility/</ref>

==Leadership and governance==
The ABA adopts "policy" (organizational positions) on certain legislative and national issues, as voted on by its elected, 589-member House of Delegates. Its Board of Governors, with 44 members, has the authority to act for the ABA, consistent with previous action of the House of Delegates, when the House is not in session.

The ABA president, elected to a one-year term, is chief executive officer of the association, while the appointed, longer-serving executive director works as chief operating officer. The conclusion of the ABA Annual Meeting, in August, is when a new president takes office, as well as when the main sessions of the House of Delegates take place. The Annual Meeting also gives the general membership the opportunity to participate in educational programs and hear speakers address many issues.<ref>Fitzpatrick, Thomas M., editor. ''American Bar Association Centennial—A Century of Service'', page 8 (American Bar Association, 1979)</ref>

In 2010, [[Jack L. Rives]], formerly TJAG (The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force), was appointed Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/meet_the_abas_new_executive_director_jack_l_rives/ |title=Meet the ABA's New Executive Director, Jack L.

== Model ethical standards for lawyers ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}
One function of the ABA is its creation and maintenance of a code of ethical standards for lawyers. The [[Model Code of Professional Responsibility]] (1969) and/or the newer [[Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] (1983) have been adopted in 49 [[U.S. state|states]], the [[District of Columbia]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. The exception is the [[State Bar of California]]; however, a few sections of the California Rules of Professional Conduct were drawn from the ABA models.

== Accreditation of U.S. law schools since 1923 ==
The [[United States Department of Education]] recognises the Council of the ABA Section on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar as a professional accrediting agency for law schools in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html#law|title=Accreditation in the United States}}</ref> American law schools that are accredited by the council are termed "approved" by the ABA, which indicates the law school was found to be in compliance with ABA accreditation standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/aba_approved_law_schools/by_year_approved.html |title=ABA-Approved Law Schools by Year |work=ABA website |access-date=April 1, 2011}}</ref>
{{Legal education in the United States}}
ABA accreditation is important not only because it affects the recognition of the law schools involved, but it also affects a graduate's ability to practice law in a particular state. Specifically, in most U.S. jurisdictions, graduation from an ABA-accredited law school is  prerequisite towards being allowed to sit for that state's bar exam, and even for existing lawyers to be admitted to the bar of another state upon motion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/law-school-advice/law-school-accreditation|title=ABA-Accredited Law School {{!}} The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Even states which recognize unaccredited schools within their borders will generally not recognize such schools from other jurisdictions for purposes of bar admission.<ref name=witz7>See, e.g., [http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/OPINIONS/TSC/RULES/TNRulesOfCourt/06supct1_9.htm#7 Supreme Court Rule 7] (Tennessee), [http://calbar.ca.gov/calbar/pdfs/rules/Rules_Title4_Div1-Adm-Prac-Law.pdf Rules Regarding Admission to Practice Law] (California).</ref>

For law students attending ABA-accredited schools, memberships are available for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/abalawstudents|title=Why Join? |work=ABA for Law Students}}</ref>  Students attending non-ABA accredited law schools are permitted to join the ABA as associate members.<ref>{{cite web |title=ABA Membership FAQ |url=https://www.americanbar.org/membership/faq/ |website=American Bar Association}}</ref>

=== Accreditation process criticisms ===
The ABA accreditation process has been widely criticized for failing to ensure that law schools are disclosing accurate post-graduate statistics which may mislead students regarding the post-graduate job market, especially in light of ever-growing student loan debt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawschooltransparency.com/blog/2011/03/breaking-senator-boxer/ |title=Breaking: Senator Boxer Calls on ABA to Ensure Accurate and Transparent Reporting by Law Schools|date= 2011-03-31|website=LST Blog|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/senators_seek_detailed_stats_on_law_school_placement_bar_passage_and_studen|title=Senators Seek Decade of Detailed Law School Placement, Bar Passage and Student Debt Data|last=Hansen|first=Mark|website=ABA Journal|language=en |date = 14 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-asks-about-potential-bait-and-switch-students-aba-accredited-law-schools|title=Grassley asks about potential bait and switch of students at ABA-accredited law schools and subsequent risk for taxpayers |website= www.grassley.senate.gov |language=en|date = 11 July 2011}}</ref> There are heated debates over requirements placed on law schools by the ABA.

A non-profit organization, [[Law School Transparency]], called upon the ABA to provide meaningful statistics regarding the employment prospects and salary information of graduates of ABA accredited institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/kyle_mcentee_scourge_of_the_status_quo|title=Kyle McEntee Challenges Law Schools to Come Clean|last=Journal|first=A.

Since 2014, the ABA has required law schools to disclose more information about their applicants and graduates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/changes_for_law_schools_breeze_in_accreditation_standards_get_update_after|title=Law school accreditation standards get update after 6 years of effort|last=Journal|first=A.

In May 2019, the ABA Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar changed the requirement for graduate bar passage rates.<ref name="azcentral.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2019/05/21/law-schools-tougher-american-bar-association-sanctions-graduates-fail-bar-exam-asu-school-law/3745028002/|title=Law schools will face tougher sanctions if too many graduates fail bar exam|website=azcentral|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Previously, to remain accredited, schools had to have a 75% bar passage rate for students within 5 years of graduation, with various ways to meet this standard and no law schools having ever been found in violation of the rule.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/council-of-legal-ed-adopts-tighter-bar-pass-standard-and-clock-for-compliance-starts-now|title=ABA legal ed section's council adopts tighter bar pass standard; clock for compliance starts now|last=Journal|first=A.

Opponents claim this will adversely affect diversity in law schools, which will be forced to increase their admissions standards and required LSAT scores, which in turn will disproportionately affect minority applicants.<ref name="azcentral.com"/> Under the new plan, 14 schools will be at risk of losing their accreditation if their bar-passage rates do not improve within two years. At the time of the rule change, three law schools were currently in the process of closing, and another school was under probation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefacultylounge.org/2019/04/ultimate-bar-passage-law-schools-at-risk.html|title=Ultimate Bar Passage: Law Schools at Risk|website=The Faculty Lounge|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> In June 2019, the ABA voted to revoke the accreditation of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/american-bar-association-votes-to-strip-thomas-jefferson-law-school-of-accreditation/|title=American Bar Association Votes to Strip Thomas Jefferson Law School of Accreditation|date=2019-06-11|website=Voice of San Diego|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>

===Antitrust consent decree and contempt fine===
In 1995 the United States Department of Justice accused the ABA of violating Section 1 of the [[Sherman Act]] in its law school accreditation proceedings. The case was resolved with a [[consent decree]].<ref name=decree>United States v.

==Continuing legal education==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}
[[File:Russell Frisby.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Russell Frisby, 2008–2009 Chair of the ABA's Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice section, at a [[Rappaport Center for Law and Public Service|Rappaport Center]] roundtable]]
The American Bar Association Center for Continuing Legal Education (ABA-CLE) serves as the central CLE resource for the ABA. It is overseen by the ABA Standing Committee on Continuing Legal Education and works closely with experts from the ABA Sections and the profession at large. In addition to its own distribution, the ABA-CLE is also delivered via private, non-profit CLE organizations, such as [[Practising Law Institute]] and for-profit organizations, such as West LegalEdCenter.

== Publications ==
;Association
{{Main|ABA Journal}}
The Association publishes a monthly general magazine circulated to all members, the ''[[ABA Journal]]'' (since 1984, formerly ''American Bar Association Journal'', 1915–1983), now also online.

;Sections, divisions and forums
ABA members may also join practice setting or subject-specific "sections," "divisions", or "forums," and each entity publishes a variety of newsletters and magazines for its members (such as ''[[Law Practice Magazine]]'' published by the Law Practice Division and [[GPSolo Magazine]] published by the Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division). Some of these magazines, such as the Business Law Section's "Business Law Today," are available on-line to non-members. The first such journal was the ''[[Annual Bulletin (CLB)|Annual Bulletin]]'' of the [[Comparative Law Bureau]], the first [[comparative law]] journal in the U.S. (1908–1914). The entities also hold their own meetings, such as the annual Solo Day.<ref>Annual Report of the American Bar Association 2007</ref>

Each entity typically has a publication program that includes (1) books, usually oriented toward practitioners; (2) scholarly journals, such as ''[[Administrative Law Review]]'' (published by the ABA Section of Administrative Law & Regulatory Practice and The American University [[Washington College of Law]]) and ''[[The International Lawyer]]'' (published by the ABA Section of International Law and [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] [[Dedman School of Law]]); (3) newsletters, such as The International Law News (published by the ABA Section of International Law); (4) e-publications, such as a monthly message from the section chair, or updates on substantive law developments; and (5) committee publications, such as a committee newsletter published by one of the substantive law committees.

== Commissions ==

The ABA's Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was established in 2007.<ref name="associationsnow.com">{{cite web|url=http://associationsnow.com/2014/08/aba-says-lgbt-discrimination-violates-human-rights/|title=ABA Says LGBT Discrimination Violates Human Rights|work=Associations Now|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>

The ABA's Criminal Justice Section, specifically the Corrections Committee, focuses on the United States Criminal Justice System and its surrounding laws, policies, and structure. The Corrections Committee "is pushing to provide greater assistance ... for those reentering society" from prison by pushing law schools and state bar associations to provide opportunities for law students to represent prisoners reentering society.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2018|title=Pushing Pro Bono for the Incarcerated and Those Reentering Society|url=https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=295096073027113074073089113097113107055064063038093061070012082027073103081003127023041124051002057017044101123064084025096030017010070089022091089088115030095085125059006082107027007011092107027026018082025121108114105020000117119006072006074073096093&EXT=pdf|format=PDF|website=Poseidon01.ssrn.com|access-date=18 December 2018}}</ref>

[[Law schools]] award 47.3 percent of J.D.s to women, which has been consistent for the past 10 years. In private practice [[law firms]], women make up less than 22 percent of partners, a 4.2 percent increase over the last 10 years. In the last decade, there has been a significant growth rate of women in the role of [[general counsel]] in [[Fortune 500]] companies, but still women only represent 24.8 percent of Fortune 500 general counsels.<ref name="Current Glance"/>

==Positions on social and legal issues==
===Discrimination against LGBT people===
In 2011, the ABA's House of Delegates passed an anti-bullying resolution that included [[sexual orientation]] and gender identity among characteristics that should be protected, along with race, religion, national origin, sex, and disability.<ref name="associationsnow.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/american-bar-association-adopts-inclusive-anti-bullying-resolution |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821004224/http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/american-bar-association-adopts-inclusive-anti-bullying-resolution |archive-date=2014-08-21 }}</ref>

At the 2013 annual meeting, the ABA's House of Delegates passed a resolution that made it harder for criminal defense lawyers to use the [[LGBT]] panic defense, which argues that a crime victim's sexual orientation should mitigate the defendant's guilt.<ref name="associationsnow.com"/>

At the 2014 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 114B, which stated that "lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have a human right to be free from discrimination, threats, and violence based on their LGBT status," and called on the governments of countries where such discriminatory laws exist to repeal them.<ref name="associationsnow.com"/>

===Presidential signing statements===
In July 2006, an ABA task force under then President [[Michael S. Greco]] released a report that concluded that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of "[[signing statement]]s" violates the Constitution.<ref>Green, Elizabeth Weiss. "Signs Of A Struggle." ''U.S. News & World Report'' 141.5 (7 Aug. 2006): 30.

===Same sex marriage===
At the 2010 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 111 urging every state, territorial, and tribal government to eliminate legal barriers to [[same-sex marriage|civil marriage between two persons of the same sex]] who are otherwise eligible to marry.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/aba_backs_marriage_equality_for_gays_and_lesbians/|title=ABA Backs Marriage Equality for Gays and Lesbians|magazine=[[ABA Journal]]|date=2010-08-10|access-date=2012-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Resolution 111|url=http://www.abajournal.com/files/RResolution_111.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=16 August 2012}}</ref>

==Rating of judicial nominees==
For decades, the ABA has participated in the federal judicial nomination process by vetting nominees and giving them a rating ranging from "not qualified" to "well qualified". According to a compendium of those ratings, the ABA's Committee on the Federal Judiciary began rating Supreme Court nominees in 1956, but: "At various points in its history, the committee altered its ratings categories, making comparisons across time difficult."<ref>Epstein, Lee et al. ''The Supreme Court Compendium: Data, Decisions & Developments'', page 390 (Fourth Edition, CQ Press, 2007)</ref>

The committee consists of two members from the ninth judicial circuit, one member from each of the other federal judicial circuits and the chair of the committee. The ABA's Board of Governors, House of Delegates and officers are not involved with the work of the committee, and it is completely insulated from the rest of the ABA's activities, including its policies. Although the committee rates prospective nominees, it does not propose, recommend or endorse candidates for nomination to the federal judiciary, as that would compromise its independent evaluative function.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/uncategorized/GAO/Backgrounder.pdf|title=STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY WHAT IT IS AND HOW IT WORKS|date=2017}}</ref>

The committee works in strictly-enforced confidentiality, typically evaluating around 60 nominees per year. Nominees are rated as "well qualified", "qualified" or "not qualified". If the president selects a prospective nominee, the committee chair notifies the White House, the Department of Justice, the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the nominee of the committee's rating.<ref name=":1" />

There are several procedural differences between the committee's investigations of Supreme Court nominees and those of lower courts, notably that investigations of Supreme Court nominees are conducted after the president has submitted a nomination. Also, there is added scrutiny with Supreme Court nominees, such as teams of law professors examining the legal writings of the prospective justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/92105/obama-asks-aba-to-evaluate-federal-judiciary-picks|title=Obama Asks ABA To Evaluate Federal Judiciary Picks|website=Law360.com|access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref>

The process has been alleged by some (including the [[Federalist Society]]) to have a [[american liberalism|liberal]] bias.<ref>{{cite web|last=Batkins|first=Sam|title= ABA Retains Little Objectivity in Nomination Process|publisher=Center for Individual Freedom|date=2004-08-12|url= http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legislative_issues/federal_issues/hot_issues_in_congress/confirmation_watch/aba_little_objectivity.htm|access-date=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lindgren|first=James|title=Yes, the ABA Rankings Are Biased|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2001-08-06|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95000927|access-date=2006-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907052245/http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95000927|archive-date=7 September 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ABA Ratings of Judicial Nominees|work=ABA Watch|publisher=[[Federalist Society]]|date=July 1996|url= http://www.fed-soc.org/abaw8969.htm|access-date=2006-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010710135604/http://www.fed-soc.org/abaw8969.htm|archive-date=2001-07-10}}</ref> For example, the ABA gave [[Ronald Reagan]]'s judicial nominees [[Richard Posner]] and [[Frank H.

In 2001, the George W.

=== Nominee ratings during the Trump administration ===
The ABA judicial nominee rating process has drawn additional attention during the Trump administration. Through June 2019, six of President Trump's nominees were rated 'not qualified'. Three of those were ranked unanimously not qualified, which had only occurred twice previously since the George H.W. Bush administration.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/ABA_ratings_during_the_Trump_administration|title=ABA ratings during the Trump administration|website=Ballotpedia|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> This has added further fuel to conservative's arguments of bias in the nominee rating process.<ref name=":3" /> Republicans claim the members of the Committee on the Federal Judiciary allow their personal liberal political leanings to influence their ratings under the category of judicial temperament.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/1/american-bar-association-refers-conservatives-you-/|title=American Bar Association refers to conservatives as 'you people' when rating Trump's judicial pick|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>

Members of the committee were accused of asking inappropriate questions of a nominee regarding abortion and negatively referring to Republicans as "you people."<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/27/cynthia-nance-bias-colors-trump-judicial-nominees-/|title=Cynthia Nance bias colors Trump judicial nominees' ABA ratings, Republicans say|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> [[Ted Cruz|Senator Ted Cruz]] stated that the ABA is a liberal advocacy group and, as such, "should not be treated as a fair or impartial arbiter of merit."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courthousenews.com/senate-scours-american-bar-association-liberal-bias/|title=Senate Scours American Bar Association for Liberal Bias|last=Ryan|first=Tim|date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> [[Ben Sasse|Senator Ben Sasse]] also criticized the organization for taking liberal stances on issues then proclaiming to be neutral when evaluating judicial nominees.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/26/lawyers-group-fuels-republicans-ire-over-its-negative-reviews-trump-judicial-picks/974095001/|title=Lawyers' group fuels Republicans' ire over its negative reviews of Trump judicial picks|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> The ABA has maintained "evaluation of these candidates does not consider the nominees' politics, their ideology or their party affiliation and has found unqualified candidates put forth by both political parties."<ref name=":5" />

==Criticisms==
The ABA has been criticized for [[racism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} In 1925, [[African-American]] lawyers formed the [[National Bar Association]] at a time when the ABA would not allow them to be members. Currently, the National Bar Association has over 60,000 members and 84 chapters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalbar.org/NBA/About_Us/History/NBA/History.aspx?hkey=f3b6e3cb-0688-4a91-a797-cf0ed3246ac7|title=History|website=www.nationalbar.org|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref>

ABA's "experience based" dues structure is also discriminatory against older lawyers, because it generally imposes higher dues for members who have been in practice longer.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lawyers with less than five years of experience are charged only $75.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  Lawyers with 20 or more years of experience (except for government or non-profit lawyers, judges, solo and small firm practitioners) are charged $450 for no greater member benefits.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  The discriminatory rates are not tied to economic justifications, as the median starting pay for new lawyers working in law firms at the start of 2019 was $155,000 <ref>http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/median-pay-for-new-associates-jumps-nearly-15-nalp-survey-says</ref>  ABA's own Model Rule 8.4(g) provides that it is professional misconduct for practicing lawyers, in the course of bar association activities, to engage in discrimination based on age <ref name="americanbar.org"/>

Since the advent of twenty-first century, the ABA has increased the diversity of its membership and leadership.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} Dennis Archer, who served as ABA president from 2003 to 2004, was the first African-American to hold the position, while Paulette Brown, 2015–2016, was the association's first president who is a [[woman of color]]. Steve Zack, whose term was in 2010 and 2011, was the first [[Cuban American]] to hold the American Bar Association's presidency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In 2016, for the first time, the ABA had an all-female roster of officers, including two African-Americans and one [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]: Linda A. Klein (president), Hilarie Bass (president-elect), Deborah Enix-Ross (chair of the House of Delegates), Mary L. Smith (secretary), Michelle A. Behnke (treasurer) and Paulette Brown (immediate past president).{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In recent years, the ABA has also drawn some criticism, mainly from the conservative side of the political spectrum, for taking positions on controversial public policy topics such as [[abortion]], [[Gun politics in the US|gun control]], and [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/us/31bar.html|title=Legal Group's Neutrality Is Challenged|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=2009-03-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-06-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courthousenews.com/senate-scours-american-bar-association-liberal-bias/|title=Senate Scours American Bar Association for Liberal Bias|last=Ryan|first=Tim|date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/26/lawyers-group-fuels-republicans-ire-over-its-negative-reviews-trump-judicial-picks/974095001/|title=Lawyers' group fuels Republicans' ire over its negative reviews of Trump judicial picks|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref> The ABA's official position in favor of abortion rights led to the formation of an alternative organization for lawyers in 1993, the National Lawyers for Life, now the [[National Lawyers Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nla.org/adout-nla/history/|title=Our History {{!}} National Lawyers Association|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref> The [[Federalist Society]] previously sponsored a twice-a-year publication called "ABA Watch" that reports on the political activities of the ABA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fed-soc.org/publications/page/aba-watch|title=ABA Watch - The Federalist Society|website=Fed-soc.org|access-date=January 19, 2018}}</ref>
