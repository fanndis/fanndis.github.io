'''LGBT parenting''' refers to [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people raising one or more children as [[parent]]s or [[foster care]] parents. This includes: children raised by [[same-sex couple]]s ('''same-sex parenting'''), children raised by single LGBT parents, and children raised by an opposite-sex couple where at least one partner is LGBT.

Opponents of LGBT rights have argued that LGBT parenting adversely affects children. However, scientific research consistently shows that gay and lesbian parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as those reared by heterosexual parents.<ref name="cpa2006" /><ref name="apsp" /><ref name="amici2010" /> Major associations of mental health professionals in the U.S., Canada, and Australia have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise.<ref name="amici2010" /><ref name="pediatrics" /><ref name="herek2006" /><ref name="stacey2010" /><ref name="cpa2005" />

Some children do not know they have an LGBT parent; [[coming out]] issues vary and some parents may never reveal to their children that they identify as LGBT. Accordingly, how children respond to their LGBT parent(s) coming out has little to do with their sexual orientation or gender identification of choice, but rather with how either parent responds to acts of coming out; i.e. whether there is dissolution of parental partnerships or rather if parents maintain a healthy, open, and communicative relationship after coming out or during transition in the case of trans parents.<ref name="Dunne EJ 1987 213–22">{{cite journal |author=Dunne EJ |title=Helping gay fathers come out to their children |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=213–22 |year=1987 |pmid=3655343 |doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_16}}</ref><ref name="haworthpress.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=3Q4EE45JK40W8L1DN0HJVF3U8WFT5DSC&ID=55278|title=A Family Matter: When a Spouse Comes Out as Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual |publisher=Haworth Press |accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="Faccio, Elena 2013">{{cite journal |last1=Faccio |first1=Elena |last2=Bordin |first2=Elena |last3=Cipolletta |first3=Sabrina |s2cid=32472958 |title=Transsexual parenthood and new role assumptions |journal=Culture, Health & Sexuality |date=October 2013 |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=1055–1070 |doi=10.1080/13691058.2013.806676 |pmid=23822798 }}</ref>

Many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people are parents. In the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. Census]], for example, 33 percent of female same-sex couple households and 22 percent of male same-sex couple households reported at least one child under the age of 18 living in the home.<ref name=apa>[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/parents.html APA Policy Statement on Sexual Orientation, Parents & Children], [[American Psychological Association]], July 28 & 30, 2004.

=== Adoption ===
{{Main|LGBT adoption}}
Joint adoption by same-sex couples is legal in 27 countries and in some sub-national territories. Furthermore, 5 countries have legalized some form of step-child adoption.

==== Judgements ====

In January 2008, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that an otherwise legally qualified and suitable candidate must not be excluded from  [[LGBT adoption|adopting]] based on their sexual orientation.<ref>[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-84571 Judgment in the case of E.B. v. France]</ref>

In 2010 a Florida court declared that "reports and studies find that there are no differences in the parenting of homosexuals or the adjustment of their children", therefore the ''Court is satisfied that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dca.flcourts.org/Opinions/3D08-3044.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010214522/http://www.3dca.flcourts.org/opinions/3D08-3044.pdf |archive-date=2010-10-10 }}</ref>

=== Surrogacy ===
{{Main|Surrogacy}}
Some gay couples decide to have a surrogate pregnancy. A surrogate is a woman carrying an egg fertilised by sperm of one of the men. Some women become surrogates for money, others for humanitarian reasons or both.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihr.com/infertility/surrogacy/gay-parent-through-surrogacy.html|title=For Gay Men: Becoming a Parent through Surrogacy|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> Parents who use surrogacy services can be stigmatised.<ref>Gahan, Luke (2017) "Separated Same-Sex Parents' Experiences and Views of Services and Service Providers," Journal of Family Strengths: Vol. 17 : Iss. 2, Article 2.

[[File:Blausen 0058 ArtificialInsemination.png|thumb|Schematic illustration of an AI procedure]]

=== Insemination ===
{{Main|Artificial Insemination}}
Insemination is a method used mostly by lesbian couples.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} It is when a partner is fertilised with donor sperm injected through a syringe. Some men donate sperm for humanitarian reasons, others for money or both. In some countries, the donor can choose to be anonymous (for example in Spain) and in others, they cannot have their identity withheld (United Kingdom).

=== Reciprocal IVF ===
{{Main|Reciprocal IVF}}
Reciprocal IVF is used by couples who both possess female reproductive organs. Using in vitro fertilization, eggs are removed from one partner to be used to make embryos that the other partner will hopefully carry in a successful pregnancy.<ref name=":0" />

=== Developing methods ===
Currently scientists conduct research on alternative types of human parenthood which can aid same-sex couples to have children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/possibility-of-genetic-children-from-same-sex-couples/17228/|title=Breakthrough raises possibility of genetic children for same-sex couples|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> One of the possibilities is obtaining sperm from skin stem cells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/stem-cells-same-sex-reproduction.html|title=Stem Cells and Same Sex Reproduction|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>

== Statistics ==
According to [[U.S. Census]] Snapshot published in December 2007, same-sex couples with children have significantly fewer economic resources and significantly lower rates of homeownership than heterosexual married couples.<ref name="censussnapshot"/>

According to a 2013–14 survey conducted in Poland by the Institute of Psychology of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (IP PAN) on 3000 LGBT people in same-sex relationships living in the country, 9% (11.7% of women and 4.6% of men) of coupled LGBT people were parents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rodzinyzwyboru.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Raport_Rodziny-z-wyboru-w-Polsce.-%C5%BBycie-rodzinne-os%C3%B3b-nieheteroseksualnych.pdf |work=rodzinyzwyboru.pl | author = Joanna Mizielińska, Marta Abramowicz, Agata Stasińska |title=Rodziny z wyboru w Polsce.

In the United States, studies on the effect of gay and lesbian parenting on children were first conducted in the 1970s, and expanded through the 1980s in the context of increasing numbers of gay and lesbian parents seeking legal custody of their biological children.<ref name="Fitzgerald">{{cite journal |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Bridget |title=Children of Lesbian and Gay Parents: A Review of the Literature |journal=Marriage & Family Review |date=November 1999 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=57–75 |doi=10.1300/J002v29n01_05 }}</ref>

===Methodology===
Studies of LGBT parenting have sometimes suffered from small and/or non-random samples and inability to implement all possible controls, due to the small LGBT parenting population and to cultural and social obstacles to identifying as an LGBT parent.

A 1993 review published in the ''Journal of Divorce & Remarriage'' identified fourteen studies addressing the effects of LGBT parenting on children. The review concluded that all of the studies lacked [[external validity]] and that therefore: "The conclusion that there are no significant differences in children reared by lesbian mothers versus heterosexual mothers is not supported by the published research database."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Belcastro |first1=Philip A. |last2=Gramlich |first2=Theresa |last3=Nicholson |first3=Thomas |last4=Price |first4=Jimmie |last5=Wilson |first5=Richard |title=A Review of Data Based Studies Addressing the Affects of Homosexual Parenting on Children's Sexual and Social Functioning |journal=Journal of Divorce & Remarriage |date=7 March 1994 |volume=20 |issue=1–2 |pages=105–122 |doi=10.1300/J087v20n01_06 }}</ref>

Fitzgerald's 1999 analysis explained some methodological difficulties:
<blockquote>
Many of these studies suffer from similar limitations and weaknesses, with the main obstacle being the difficulty in acquiring representative, random samples on a virtually invisible population. Many lesbian and gay parents are not open about their sexual orientation due to real fears of discrimination, homophobia, and threats of losing custody of their children. Those who do participate in this type of research are usually relatively open about their homosexuality and, therefore, may bias the research towards a particular group of gay and lesbian parents.

Because of the inevitable use of convenience samples, sample sizes are usually very small and the majority of the research participants end up looking quite homogeneous—e.g. white, middle-class, urban, and well-educated. Another pattern is the wide discrepancy between the number of studies conducted with children of gay fathers and those with lesbian mothers...

Another potential factor of importance is the possibility of social desirability bias when research subjects respond in ways that present themselves and their families in the most desirable light possible. Such a phenomenon does seem possible due to the desire of this population to offset and reverse negative images and discrimination. Consequently, the findings of these studies may be patterned by self-presentation bias.<ref name="Fitzgerald" />
</blockquote>

According to a 2001 review of 21 studies by Stacey and Biblarz published in ''[[American Sociological Review]]'': "[R]esearchers lack reliable data on the number and location of lesbigay parents with children in the general population, there are no studies of child development based on random, representative samples of such families. Most studies rely on small-scale, snowball and convenience samples were drawn primarily from personal and community networks or agencies. Most research to date has been conducted on white lesbian mothers who are comparatively educated, mature, and reside in relatively progressive urban centers, most often in California or the Northeastern states."<ref name="Stacey_Biblarz">{{cite journal |last1=Stacey |first1=Judith |last2=Biblarz |first2=Timothy J. |s2cid=36206795 |title=(How) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parents Matter? |journal=American Sociological Review |date=April 2001 |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=159 |doi=10.2307/2657413 |jstor=2657413 |quote=If these young adults raised by lesbian mothers were more open to a broad range of sexual possibilities, they were not statistically more likely to self-identify as bisexual, lesbian, or gay.....Children raised by lesbian co-parents should and do seem to grow up more open to homoerotic relationships. This may be partly due to genetic and family socialization processes, but what sociologists refer to as "contextual effects" not yet investigated by psychologists may also be important...even though children of lesbian and gay parents appear to express a significant increase in homoeroticism, the majority of all children nonetheless identify as heterosexual, as most theories across the essentialistt" to "social constructionist" spectrum seem (perhaps too hastily) to expect.|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bfcd/28de58f431efa05e0c5b8c0c34923b2f5942.pdf }}</ref>

In more recent studies,<ref name=mazrekaj>{{cite journal |last1=Mazrekaj |first1=Deni |last2=De Witte |first2=Kristof |last3=Cabus |first3=Sofie |title=School Outcomes of Children Raised by Same-Sex Parents: Evidence from Administrative Panel Data |journal=American Sociological Review |date=2020 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=830–856 |doi=10.1177/0003122420957249}}</ref> many of these issues have been resolved due to factors such as the changing social climate for LGBT people.

Herek's 2006 paper in ''American Psychologist'' stated:

<blockquote>
The overall methodological sophistication and quality of studies in this domain have increased over the years, as would be expected for any new area of empirical inquiry. More recent research has reported data from probability and community-based convenience samples, has used more rigorous assessment techniques, and has been published in highly respected and widely cited developmental psychology journals, including ''Child Development and Developmental Psychology''. Data are increasingly available from prospective studies. In addition, whereas early study samples consisted mainly of children originally born into heterosexual relationships that subsequently dissolved when one parent came out as gay or lesbian, recent samples are more likely to include children conceived within a same-sex relationship or adopted in infancy by a same-sex couple. Thus, they are less likely to confound the effects of having a sexual minority parent with the consequences of divorce.<ref name="herek2006"/></blockquote>

A 2002 review of the literature identified 20 studies examining outcomes among children raised by gay or lesbian parents and found that these children did not systematically differ from those raised by heterosexual parents on any of the studied outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderssen |first1=Norman |last2=Amlie |first2=Christine |last3=Ytterøy |first3=Erling André |title=Outcomes for children with lesbian or gay parents.

In a 2009 affidavit filed in the case ''[[Gill v. Office of Personnel Management]]'', [[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]], a professor of [[psychology]] and head of Department of [[Social psychology|Social]] and [[Developmental psychology|Developmental Psychology]] at [[Cambridge University]], stated:
<blockquote>The methodologies used in the major studies of same-sex parenting meet the standards for research in the field of developmental psychology and psychology generally. The studies specific to same-sex parenting were published in leading journals in the field of child and adolescent development, such as Child Development, published by the Society for Research in Child Development, [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]], published by the American Psychological Association, and The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, the flagship peer-review journals in the field of child development. Most of the studies appeared in these (or similar) rigorously peer-reviewed and highly selective journals, whose standards represent expert consensus on generally accepted social scientific standards for research on child and adolescent development. Prior to publication in these journals, these studies were required to go through a rigorous peer-review process, and as a result, they constitute the type of research that members of the respective professions consider reliable. The body of research on same-sex families is consistent with standards in the relevant fields and produces reliable conclusions."<ref name="lamb" /></blockquote>

Gartrell and Bos's 25-year longitudinal study, published 2010, was limited to mothers who sought donor insemination and who may have been more motivated than mothers in other circumstances.<ref>Discover magazine "Same-Sex Parents Do No Harm". January 2, 2011 edition, p. 77</ref>  Gartrell and Bos note that the study's limitations included utilizing a non-random sample, and the lesbian group and control group were not matched for race or area of residence. The study was supported by grants from the [[Gill Foundation]], the Lesbian Health Fund of the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]], Horizons Foundation, and the Roy Scrivner Fund of the [[American Psychological Association|American Psychological Foundation]].<ref name=Gartrell />

Michael J. Rosenfeld, associate professor of sociology at [[Stanford University]], wrote in a 2010 study published in ''Demography'' that "[A] critique of the literature—that the sample sizes of the studies are too small to allow for [[Statistical power|statistically powerful]] tests—continues to be relevant." Rosenfeld's study, "the first to use large-sample nationally representative data," found that children of same-sex couples demonstrated normal outcomes in school. "The core finding here," reports the study," offers a measure of validation for the prior, and much-debated, small-sample studies."<ref name=rosen>{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Michael J. |title=Nontraditional Families and Childhood Progress Through School |journal=Demography |date=2010 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=755–775 |doi=10.1353/dem.0.0112 |pmid=20879687 |pmc=3000058 }}</ref>

According to a 2005 brief by the American Psychological Association:
{{quote|In summary, research on diversity among families with lesbian and gay parents and on the potential effects of such diversity on children is still sparse (Martin, 1993, 1998; Patterson, 1995b, 2000, 2001, 2004; Perrin, 2002; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001; Tasker, 1999). Data on children of parents who identify as bisexual are still not available, and information about children of non-White lesbian or gay parents is hard to find (but see Wainright et al., 2004, for a racially diverse sample)... However, the existing data are still limited, and any conclusions must be seen as tentative... It should be acknowledged that research on lesbian and gay parents and their children, though no longer new, is still limited in extent. Although studies of gay fathers and their children have been conducted (Patterson, 2004), less is known about children of gay fathers than about children of lesbian mothers. Although studies of adolescent and young adult offspring of lesbian and gay parents are available (e.g., Gershon et al., 1999; Tasker & Golombok, 1997; Wainright et al., 2004), relatively few studies have focused on the offspring of lesbian or gay parents during adolescence or adulthood.<ref name="APAreport">American Psychological Association [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting-full.pdf Lesbian & Gay Parenting]</ref>}}

In 2010 American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, The American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy stated:
{{quote|Relatively few studies have directly examined gay fathers, but those that exist find that gay men are similarly fit and able parents, as compared to heterosexual men. Available empirical data do not provide a basis for assuming gay men are unsuited for parenthood. If gay parents were inherently unfit, even small studies with convenience samples would readily detect it.  This has not  been the case.  Being raised by a single father does not appear to inherently disadvantage children's psychological wellbeing more than being raised by a single mother. Homosexuality does not constitute a pathology or deficit, and there is no theoretical reason to expect gay fathers to cause harm to their children. Thus, although more research is needed, available data place the burden of empirical proof on those who argue that having a gay father is harmful.<ref name="amici2010" />}}

A significant increase in methodological rigor was achieved in a 2020 study by Deni Mazrekaj at [[University of Oxford]], Kristof De Witte and Sofie Cabus at [[KU Leuven]] published in the [[American Sociological Review]].<ref name=mazrekaj>{{cite journal |last1=Mazrekaj |first1=Deni |last2=De Witte |first2=Kristof |last3=Cabus |first3=Sofie |title=School Outcomes of Children Raised by Same-Sex Parents: Evidence from Administrative Panel Data |journal=American Sociological Review |date=2020 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=830–856 |doi=10.1177/0003122420957249}}</ref> The authors used administrative longitudinal data on the entire population of children born between 1998 and 2007 in the Netherlands, which was the first country to legalize same-sex marriage. They followed the educational performance of 2,971 children with same-sex parents and over a million children with different-sex parents from birth. This was the first study to address how children who were actually raised by same-sex parents from birth (instead of happening to live with a same-sex couple at some point in time) perform in school while retaining a large representative sample. The authors found that children raised by same-sex parents from birth perform better than children raised by different-sex parents in both primary and secondary education. According to the authors, a major factor explaining these results was parental socioeconomic status. Same-sex couples often have to use expensive fertility treatments and adoption procedures to have a child, meaning they tend to be wealthier, older and more educated than the typical different-sex couple.

=== Consensus ===

Since the 1970s, it has become increasingly clear that it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting, the psychosocial well-being of parents, the quality of and satisfaction with relationships within the family, and the level of co-operation and harmony between parents) that contribute to determining children's well-being and outcomes rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and cohabitation status of parents.<ref name=apsp/><ref name=lamb>[[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]], [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit – United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225193923/http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf |date=2010-12-25 }}</ref> Since the end of the 1980s, as a result, it has been well established that children and adolescents can be as well-adjusted in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings.<ref name="lamb" /> Furthermore, whereas factors such as the number and cohabitation status of parents can and do influence relationship quality in aggregate, the same has not been demonstrated for sexuality.

Important observations from research on twins separated at birth and large adoption studies, is that parents tend to have little to no environmental effects on their children's behavioural traits, which are instead correlated with genes shared between parent and child and the non-shared environment (environment which is unique to the child, such as random developmental noise and events, as opposed to rearing).<ref name=":5" /> The 2016 Bailey et al. review concludes that there "is good evidence for both genetic and nonsocial environmental influences on sexual orientation" including [[Prenatal development|prenatal developmental]] events, but that there is better evidence for biological mechanisms relating to male sexual orientation, which appears unresponsive to socialization, saying "we would be surprised if differences in social environment contributed to differences in male sexual orientation at all."<ref name=":5" />{{Rp|87}} In contrast, they say that female sexual orientation may be somewhat responsive to social environment, saying "it would also be less surprising to us to discover that social environment affects female sexual orientation and related behavior, that possibility must be scientifically supported rather than assumed."<ref name=":5" />{{Rp|87}}

A 2013 statement from the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] states that children of LGBT parents do not have any differences in their gender role behaviors in comparison to those observed in heterosexual family structures.<ref>{{cite journal|author=American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|date=August 2013|title=Children with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Parents|url=http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/facts_for_families/92_children_with_lesbian_gay_bisexual_transgender_parents.pdf|journal=Facts for Families|volume=No. 92.|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>

=== Misrepresentation by opponents ===
In a 2006 statement, the Canadian Psychological Association released an updated statement on their 2003 and 2005 conclusions, saying, "The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some persons and institutions are misinterpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values."<ref name="cpa2006"/> Several professional organizations have noted that studies which opponents of LGBT parenting claim as evidence that same-sex couples are unfit parents do not in fact address same-sex parenting, however, and therefore do not permit any conclusions to be drawn about the effects of the sexes or sexual orientations of parents. Rather, these studies, which only sampled heterosexual parents, found that it was better for children to be raised by two parents instead of one, and/or that the divorce or death of a parent had a negative effect on children.<ref name="cpa2006"/><ref name=S14799>[http://www.courts.ca.gov/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, In re Marriage Cases Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365, Application for leave to file brief [[Amicus curiae|amici curiae]] in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion, and brief amici curiae of the American Psychological Association, California Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, and National Association of Social Workers, California Chapter in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion].

Policy debates will be impoverished if this important source of knowledge is simply dismissed as a 'he said, she said' squabble."<ref name=hereklat>[http://www.beyondhomophobia.com/blog/2006/11/03/la-times-on-lesbiangay-parents-he-saidshe-said/ LA Times on Lesbian/Gay Parents: He Said/She Said?] date:2006/11/03</ref>

==Other aspects==

===Marriage===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage|Same-sex marriage and the family}}
Same-sex parenting is often raised as an issue in debates about the recognition of same-sex marriage by law.

===Trans parenting===
There is little to no visibility or public support through pregnancy and parenting resources directed towards trans parents.<ref name="Faccio, Elena 2013"/><ref>Wallace, J. "The Manly Art of Pregnancy," in Bornstein, Kate, and Bergman, S. Bear (2010). Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation. Berkeley: Seal Press{{pn|date=August 2020}}</ref>

While "once gay and lesbian parents attain parenthood status[…] they almost never lose it" this is not the case for trans parents, as seen with the cases of Suzanne Daly (1983) and Martha Boyd (2007), two trans women who both had their parental rights, with regard to biological children, terminated on the basis of their diagnosis of gender identity disorder and their trans status.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Donelson|first=Raff|title=Feminist Judgments: Family Law Opinions Rewritten|date=2020|chapter=Commentary on Daly v. Daly|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/feminist-judgments-family-law-opinions-rewritten/commentary-on-daly-v-daly/878F28D7534293C5E8B55C8AE46BABFC|access-date=2020-07-25|website=Feminist Judgments: Family Law Opinions Rewritten|pages=162–186|language=en|doi=10.1017/9781108556989.008|isbn=9781108556989}}</ref> They were perceived to have abandoned their role as "fathers" through their MTF transition, and were perceived to have acted selfishly in putting their own sexual/identity needs before the wellbeing of their children. These cases are amongst many legal custody battles fought by trans parents whereby U.S. courts have completely overlooked defendants' suitability as "parents" as opposed to "mothers" or "fathers," roles that are heavily gendered and come with strict societal understandings of normative parental behaviour.<ref name="Ball, Carlos A. 2012">Ball, Carlos A. (2012). The Right to Be Parents: LGBT families and the transformation of parenthood. New York: New York University Press.{{pn|date=August 2020}}</ref> In the case of trans individuals who desire to become parents and to be legally recognized as mothers or fathers of their children, courts often refuse to legally acknowledge such roles because of biological discrimination. An example of this is the X, Y and Z vs. U.K case, whereby X, a trans man who had been in a stable relationship with Y, a biological woman who gave birth to Z through artificial insemination through which X was always present, was denied the right to be listed as Z's father on their birth certificate due to the fact that they did not directly inseminate Y.<ref>European Court of Human Rights (1997).

Recently,{{when|reason=WP:RELTIME|date=September 2018}} Canada has started acknowledging trans parental rights in terms of custody arrangements and of legal recognition of parental status. In 2001, Leslie (formerly Howard) Forester was permitted to retain custody of her daughter after her ex-partner filed for sole custody on the basis of Leslie's transition. The courts ruled that  "the applicant's transsexuality, in itself, without further evidence, would not constitute a material change in circumstances, nor would it be considered a negative factor in a custody determination," marking a landmark case in family law whereby "a person's transsexuality is irrelevant on its own as a factor in his or her ability to be a good parent"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Owens |first1=Anne Marie |title=Father's Sex Change Does Not Alter Custody, Court Says: Girl, 6, Calls Mommy and Daddy; Cautious in Public |work=The National Post |date=2 February 2001 |id={{ProQuest|329903587}} }}</ref> Additionally, Jay Wallace, a resident trans-man from Toronto, Canada, "was permitted to identify as Stanley's father on the province of Ontario's Statement of Live Birth Form," marking a decoupling of genetics and bio-sex in relation to parental roles.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karaian |first1=Lara |s2cid=145257751 |title=Pregnant Men: Repronormativity, Critical Trans Theory and the Re(conceive)ing of Sex and Pregnancy in Law |journal=Social & Legal Studies |date=June 2013 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=211–230 |doi=10.1177/0964663912474862 }}</ref>
