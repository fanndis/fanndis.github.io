}}{{History of Singapore}}

The '''Colony of Singapore''' or simply '''Singapore''' was a [[British Crown colony]] that existed from 1946 to 1963. When the [[Empire of Japan]] [[surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of [[World War II]], Singapore was returned to the British in 1945. In 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] were dissolved and together with [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos-Keeling]] and [[Christmas Island]], Singapore became a separate Crown colony.<ref>Colony of Singapore.

==History==

[[File:Singapore Map - 1945.jpg|thumb|Singapore in 1945]]

===Post war period: return of British rule===

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:British return to Singapore - fanfare.jpg|right|thumb|350px|There was much fanfare when the Japanese left Singapore in 1945. Note the huge [[flag of the Republic of China]] held by the people, and a smaller flag waving near the background.]] -->

After Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August 1945, there was a state of [[anomie]] in Singapore, as the British had not arrived to take control, while the Japanese occupiers had a considerably weakened hold over the populace.  Incidents of [[looting]] and revenge killing were widespread.

When British troops returned to Singapore in September 1945, thousands of Singaporeans lined the streets to cheer them. Singapore was ruled by a [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] (BMA) between September 1945 and March 1946, during which it also served as the headquarters of the British governor-general for Southeast Asia. However much of the infrastructure had been destroyed, including electricity and [[water supply]] systems, telephone services, as well as the harbour facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]].<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar">{{cite web |title = Singapore – Aftermath of War |url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm |publisher = U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate = 18 June 2006}}</ref>

There was also a shortage of food including rice, and this led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crimes and violence. Unemployment, high [[food prices]], and workers' discontent culminated in a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by the growing demand for tin and rubber around the world. But it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/>

===Establishment of the Colony===

{{see also|Coat of arms of Singapore|Flag of Singapore}}

On 1 April 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] was dissolved and Singapore became a Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor and separated from peninsular Malaya. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and provisions were made to allow for the election of six members of the Legislative Council the next year.<ref name="micaSelfGovernment">{{cite web|title=Towards Self-government|url=http://www.sg/explore/history_towards.htm|publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore|accessdate=18 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713023113/http://www.sg/explore/history_towards.htm|archive-date=13 July 2006|url-status=dead}}|</ref> On 30 November 1959, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem.<ref>Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 (No. 70 of 1959), now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act|cap=296|ed=1985}}.</ref>

===Merger with Malaysia===

{{main|Singapore in Malaysia|Self-governance of Singapore}}

The failure of the British to defend Singapore had destroyed their credibility as infallible rulers in the eyes of the locals in Singapore. The decades after and during the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of nationalist and [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] sentiments, including a cry for ''[[Merdeka]]'', roughly translated to "independence" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were prepared to embark on a program of gradually increasing [[self-governance]] for Singapore and Malaya.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/> The Crown colony was dissolved on 16 September 1963 when Singapore became a state of Malaysia, ending 144 years' of British rule on the island.

On 9 August 1965, Singapore officially left Malaysia to become the independent [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]], due to political, economic and racial disputes.

==Government==

===First Legislative Council (1948–1951)===

The [[1948 Singapore general election|first Singaporean elections]], held in March 1948 to select members of the Legislative Council, were rather limited.  The right to vote was restricted to adult British subjects, of which only 23,000 or about 10 percent of those eligible [[Voter registration|registered to vote]]. In addition, only six of the twenty-five seats on the [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]] were to be elected; the rest were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers of commerce.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/>

Three of the elected seats were won by a newly formed [[Singapore Progressive Party]] (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen and professionals and were disinclined to press for immediate self-rule. The other three seats were won by independents.

Three months after the elections, an armed insurgency by communist groups in Malaya – the [[Malayan Emergency]] – broke out, and the British imposed harsh measures to control left-wing groups in both Singapore and Malaya; the controversial [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]], which allowed indefinite detention without [[trial (law)|trial]] for persons suspected of being "threats to security", was introduced at this time.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/>

Since the left-wing groups were the strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government stalled for several years. The colonial government also tried to prevent contacts between Singaporean Chinese and [[People's Republic of China|China]], which had just fallen under the rule of the [[Communist Party of China]]. [[Tan Kah Kee]], a local businessman and philanthropist, was denied re-entry into Singapore after he made a trip to China.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/>

===Second Legislative Council (1951–1955)===

A second Legislative Council election was held in 1951 with the number of elected seats increased to nine. This election was again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. This slowly contributed to the formation of a distinct [[government of Singapore]], although colonial administration was still dominant.
 
In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the 'Emergency' period over, the government appointed a commission, headed by [[George William Rendel|Sir George Rendel]], to study the possibility of self-government for Singapore. The commission proposed a limited form of self-government.

The [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a [[Chief Minister]] as [[head of government]] and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a [[parliamentary system]]. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.

The government agreed with the recommendations, and Legislative Assembly elections were scheduled for 2 April 1955. The election was a lively and closely fought affair, with several newly formed political parties joining the fray. In contrast to previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly defeated in the election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the largest winner with ten seats and was able to form a coalition government with the [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]]-[[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] Alliance, which won three seats.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/> Another new party, the then [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), won three seats.

==Administration==

On 1 April 1946, the Colony of Singapore was formed with [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos-Keeling]], [[Christmas Island]] after the dissolution of the Straits Settlement. As a Crown colony, Singapore inherited the hierarchical organisational structure of the Straits Settlements government with a governor, who was assisted by an Advisory Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a Municipal Council.<ref>Electoral representation for the new Singapore Council.

The administration of Christmas Island was also transferred to Australia in 1958.

==Governors of Singapore (1946–1959)==

''The '''Governors of Singapore''' ruled Singapore. The men that held this position governed the Crown Colony of Singapore from 1946 to 1959, on behalf of the [[Colonial Office]] until Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 in where the Office of the Governor was abolished.''
