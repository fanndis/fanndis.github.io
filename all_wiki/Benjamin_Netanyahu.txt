He moved back to Israel in 1978 to found the [[Yonatan Netanyahu#The Jonathan Institute|Yonatan Netanyahu Anti-Terror Institute]], named after his brother [[Yonatan Netanyahu]], who died leading [[Operation Entebbe]].

In 1984, Netanyahu was appointed the [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations]] by Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]], a role he held until 1988. He was subsequently elected to the [[Knesset]] before becoming the leader of [[Likud]] in 1993; he then led the party to victory at the [[1996 Israeli general election|1996 election]], becoming Israel's youngest-ever prime minister. After being defeated in the [[1999 Israeli general election|1999 election]], Netanyahu left politics, returning to the private sector. He later served as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Minister of Finance]] in the government of [[Ariel Sharon]], but eventually resigned over disagreements regarding the [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|disengagement plan]].

== Early life and military career ==
Netanyahu was born in 1949 in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], to a predominantly [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] family with some [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] ancestry, who claim descent from the [[Vilna Gaon]].<ref>Itamar Eichner (25 May 2016) [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4807687,00.html "Netanyahu: I have Sephardic roots as well"], [[Ynetnews]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Winer|first=Stuart|title=Netanyahu reveals his roots go back to Spain|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-reveals-roots-go-back-to-spain/|access-date=2020-08-16|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US}}</ref> His mother, Tzila Segal (1912–2000) was born in [[Petah Tikva]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], and his father, [[Warsaw]]-born, Prof. [[Benzion Netanyahu]] (née Mileikowsky) (1910–2012) was an accomplished historian specializing in the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jewish Golden age of Spain]]. Netanyahu's paternal grandfather, [[Nathan Mileikowsky]] was a notable rabbi and Zionist writer. When Netanyahu's father emigrated to Israel he [[Hebraization of surnames|hebraized his surname]] from "Mileikowsky" to "Netanyahu" meaning "God has given". 

Netanyahu was the second of three children. He was initially raised and educated in [[Jerusalem]], where he attended Henrietta Szold Elementary School. A copy of his evaluation from his 6th grade teacher Ruth Rubenstein indicated that Netanyahu was courteous, polite, and helpful; that his work was "responsible and punctual"; and that he  was friendly, disciplined, cheerful, brave, active, and obedient.<ref name="JPost responsible">{{cite news| url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=282840 | title=PM was 'responsible' sixth-grader, evaluation shows |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=28 August 2012 |author=Lidman, Melanie | access-date=30 August 2012}}</ref>

After graduating from high school in 1967, Netanyahu returned to Israel to enlist in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. He trained as a combat soldier and served for five years in an elite special forces unit of the IDF, [[Sayeret Matkal]].

Netanyahu returned to the United States in late 1972 to study architecture at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). After briefly returning to Israel to fight in the [[Yom Kippur War]], he returned to the United States and under the name Ben Nitay, completed a [[Bachelor of Science|bachelor's degree]]<ref name=MITDegrees>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/registrar/stats/degrees/index.html |title=Enrollment Statistics |publisher=MIT Office of the Registrar |access-date=17 October 2012}}</ref> in architecture<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/mitlist/?page=full|title=The MIT 150: 150 Ideas, Inventions, and Innovators that Helped Shape Our World|work=The Boston Globe|date=15 May 2011|access-date=8 August 2011}}</ref> in February 1975 and earned a [[master's degree]]<ref name=MITDegrees /> from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in June 1976. Concurrently, he was studying towards a doctorate<ref name="ball" /> in political science,<ref>Cathy Hartley, David Lea, Paul Cossali, Annamarie Rowe, ''Survey of Arab-Israeli Relations'' (Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 522</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm |title=Profile: Benjamin Netanyahu |date=20 February 2009 |work=BBC News Online |access-date=9 March 2013}}</ref> until his studies were broken off by the death of his brother in [[Operation Entebbe]].<ref name="ball" />

At MIT, Netanyahu studied a double-load, completing a master's degree (that would normally take four years) in only two and a half years, despite taking a break to fight in the Yom Kippur War, and while simultaneously completing a thesis in a graduate course at Harvard.<ref name="ball"/> Professor Groisser at MIT recalled: "He did superbly. He was very bright. Organized. Strong. Powerful. He knew what he wanted to do and how to get it done."<ref name="ball"/>

At that time he changed his name to Benjamin Ben Nitai (Nitai, a reference to both [[Mount Nitai]] and to the eponymous Jewish sage [[Nittai of Arbela]], was a pen name often used by his father for articles).<ref name="Gresh"/> Years later, in an interview with the media, Netanyahu clarified that he decided to do so to make it easier for Americans to pronounce his name. This fact has been used by his political rivals to accuse him indirectly of a lack of Israeli national identity and loyalty.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ariel |first=Mira |title=Pragmatics and Grammar |series=Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-55018-5}}</ref>

In 1976, Netanyahu's older brother [[Yonatan Netanyahu]] was killed. Yonatan was serving as the commander of Benjamin's former unit, the Sayeret Matkal, and died during the [[counter-terrorism]] hostage-rescue mission Operation Entebbe in which his unit rescued more than 100 mostly Israeli hostages hijacked by terrorists and flown to the [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]] in Uganda.

Between 1978 and 1980, he ran the Jonathan Netanyahu Anti-Terror Institute,<ref name="ynetnews.com"/> a non-governmental organization devoted to the study of terrorism; the Institute held a number of international conferences focused on the discussion of international terrorism.

It was while living in New York during the 1980s that Netanyahu became friends with [[Fred Trump]], the father of [[Donald Trump]].<ref name="nymag.com">Gabriel Sherman (1 June 2016), [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/trump-is-considering-pre-convention-israel-visit.html "Trump Is Considering a Pre-Convention Visit to Israel"] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''</ref>

== Chairman of Likud ==
Prior to the [[1988 Israeli legislative election]], Netanyahu returned to Israel and joined the [[Likud]] party. In the Likud's internal elections, Netanyahu was placed fifth on the party list. Later on he was elected as a Knesset member of the 12th Knesset, and was appointed as a deputy of the foreign minister [[Moshe Arens]], and later on [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]]. Netanyahu and Levy did not cooperate and the rivalry between the two only intensified afterwards. During the [[Gulf War]] in early 1991, the English-fluent Netanyahu emerged as the principal spokesman for Israel in media interviews on [[CNN]] and other news outlets. During the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] Netanyahu was a member of the Israeli delegation headed by Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]]. After the Madrid Conference Netanyahu was appointed as Deputy Minister in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.<ref name="netanyahu" />

Following the defeat of the Likud party in the [[1992 Israeli legislative election]]s the Likud party held a primary election in 1993 to select its leader, and Netanyahu was victorious, defeating [[Benny Begin]], son of the late Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], and veteran politician [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]]<ref>{{cite news |title= Netanyahu wins battle for leadership of Likud |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/netanyahu-wins-battle-for-leadership-of-likud-1499916.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=26 March 1993 |access-date=11 August 2009 }}</ref> (Sharon initially sought Likud party leadership as well, but quickly withdrew when it was evident that he was attracting minimal support). Shamir retired from politics shortly after the Likud's defeat in the 1992 elections.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yitzhak Shamir, Former Israeli Prime Minister, Dies at 96 |first=Joel |last=Brinkley |author-link=Joel Brinkley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/world/middleeast/yitzhak-shamir-former-prime-minister-of-israel-dies-at-96.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |date=30 June 2012 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>

Following the [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin]], his temporary successor [[Shimon Peres]] decided to call early elections in order to give the government a mandate to advance the peace process.<ref>{{cite news |title=Israeli elections will test support for peace |first=Jerrold |last=Kessel |url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9602/israel_elex/02-11/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=11 February 1996 |access-date=10 March 2013}}</ref> Netanyahu was the Likud's candidate for Prime Minister in the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|1996 Israeli legislative election]] which took place on 26 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which [[Israelis]] elected their Prime Minister directly. Netanyahu hired American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political operative [[Arthur J. Finkelstein|Arthur Finkelstein]] to run his campaign, and although the American style of sound bites and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism, it proved effective. When Netanyahu won the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|1996 election]], he became the youngest person in the history of the position and the first Israeli Prime Minister to be born in the State of Israel ([[Yitzhak Rabin]] was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state).

Netanyahu's victory over the pre-election favorite [[Shimon Peres]] surprised many. The main catalyst in the downfall of the latter was a wave of [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|suicide bombings]] shortly before the elections; on [[Jaffa Road bus bombings#Second bombing|3]] and [[Dizengoff Center suicide bombing|4 March 1996]], Palestinians carried out two [[suicide bombing]]s, killing 32 Israelis, with Peres seemingly unable to stop the attacks. During the campaign, Netanyahu stressed that progress in the peace process would be based on the [[Palestinian National Authority]] fulfilling its obligations–mainly fighting terrorism—and the Likud campaign slogan was, "Netanyahu – making a safe peace". However, although Netanyahu won the election for Prime Minister, Peres's [[Israeli Labor Party]] received more seats in the [[1996 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]]. Netanyahu had to rely on a coalition with the [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] parties, [[Shas]] and [[United Torah Judaism|UTJ]] in order to form a government.

A spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security. [[Hamas]] claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. As Prime Minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the [[Oslo Accords]]. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the [[status of Jerusalem]], and the amending of the [[Palestinian National Charter]]. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process.

In 1996, Netanyahu and [[Jerusalem]]'s mayor [[Ehud Olmert]] decided to open an exit in the [[Arab Quarter]] for the [[Western Wall Tunnel]], which prior Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/macleans/israel-opens-disputed-tunnel |title=Israel Opens Disputed Tunnel |last1=Morris |first1=Nomi |last2=Silver |first2=Eric |date=7 October 1996 |work=Maclean's |access-date=9 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020014235/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/macleans/israel-opens-disputed-tunnel |archive-date=20 October 2012}}</ref> This sparked three days of [[Western Wall Tunnel#Northern exit and riots|rioting]] by Palestinians, resulting in dozens of both Israelis and Palestinians being killed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Step Inside The Hidden Tunnels Under Jerusalem's Sacred Western Wall |first=Grace |last=Wyler |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/western-wall-tunnels-israel-jerusalem-temple-photos-2013-1?op=1 |website=Business Insider |date=31 January 2013 |access-date=10 March 2013}}</ref>

Netanyahu first met Palestinian President Arafat on 4 September 1996. Prior to the meeting, the two leaders spoke by telephone.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/04/araf.netan.preview/index.html Arafat, Netanyahu shake hands, begin talks] 4 September 1996, CNN</ref> The meetings would continue through Autumn 1996. On their first meeting, Netanyahu said: "I would like to emphasize that we have to take into account the needs and the requirements of both sides on the basis of reciprocity and the assurance of the security and well-being of both Israelis and Palestinian alike." Arafat said: "We are determined to work with Mr. Netanyahu and with his government."<ref>[http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/MFADocuments/Yearbook11/Pages/20%20Joint%20press%20conference%20with%20Prime%20Minister%20Neta.aspx Joint press conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu and PA Chairman Arafat, 4 September 1996] Vol. 16: 1996–1997, Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ref>  The talks culminated on 14 January 1997, in the signing of the [[Hebron Protocol]].<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/14/hebron.late Netanyahu, Arafat shake hands on Hebron accord] 14 January 1997, CNN</ref> The signing of the Hebron Protocol with the [[Palestinian Authority]] resulted in the redeployment of Israeli forces in [[Hebron]] and the turnover of civilian authority in much of the area to the control of the [[Palestinian Authority]].

Eventually, the lack of progress of the peace process led to new negotiations which produced the [[Wye River Memorandum]] in 1998 which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. It was signed by Netanyahu and PLO chairman [[Yasser Arafat]], and on 17 November 1998, Israel's 120 member parliament, the [[Knesset]], approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75–19. In a nod to the 1967 [[Khartoum Conference|Khartoum conference]], Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized a policy of "three no(s)": no withdrawal from the Golan Heights, no discussion of the case of Jerusalem, no negotiations under any preconditions.<ref>Hawas, Akram T.

During his term, Netanyahu also began a process of economic liberalization, taking steps towards a free-market economy. Under his watch, the government began selling its shares in banks and major state-run companies. Netanyahu also greatly eased Israel's strict [[foreign exchange controls]], enabling Israelis to take an unrestricted amount of money out of the country, open foreign bank accounts, hold foreign currency, and invest freely in other countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jta.org/1998/04/29/archive/israel-reforms-economy-on-eve-of-independence-day-2|title=Israel Reforms Economy on Eve of Independence Day|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/world/in-fight-over-privatization-netanyahu-wins-a-round.html|title=In Fight Over Privatization, Netanyahu Wins a Round|date=26 July 1997|work=The New York Times|first=Serge|last=Schmemann}}</ref>

Throughout his term, Netanyahu was opposed by the political left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to the Palestinians in [[Hebron]] and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges.

With the fall of the Barak government in late 2000, Netanyahu expressed his desire to return to politics. By law, Barak's resignation was supposed to lead to elections for the prime minister position only. Netanyahu insisted that general elections should be held, claiming that otherwise it would be impossible to have a stable government. Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of [[Ariel Sharon]], who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu. In 2002, after the [[Israeli Labor Party]] left the coalition and vacated the position of foreign minister, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appointed Netanyahu as Foreign Minister.<ref name="netanyahu" /> Netanyahu challenged Sharon for the leadership of the Likud party, but failed to oust Sharon.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sharon Beats Netanyahu in Likud Primary |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,71685,00.html |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=28 November 2002 |access-date=29 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828161003/http://foxnews.com/story/0,2933,71685,00.html |archive-date=28 August 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 9 September 2002, a scheduled speech by Netanyahu at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in Montreal, Quebec, Canada [[Anti-Netanyahu riot at Concordia University|was canceled]] after hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters overwhelmed security and smashed through a glass window.

== Minister of Finance ==
After the [[2003 Israeli legislative election]], in what many observers regarded as a surprise move, Sharon offered the [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Ministry]] to [[Silvan Shalom]] and offered Netanyahu the [[Finance Minister of Israel|Finance Ministry]]. Some pundits speculated that Sharon made the move because he deemed Netanyahu a political threat given his demonstrated effectiveness as Foreign Minister, and that by placing him in the Finance Ministry during a time of economic uncertainty, he could diminish Netanyahu's popularity. Netanyahu accepted the new appointment. Sharon and Netanyahu came to an agreement that Netanyahu would have complete freedom as Finance Minister and have Sharon back all of his reforms, in exchange for Netanyahu's silence over Sharon's management of Israel's military and foreign affairs.<ref name=marketwatch>{{cite news |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/3-economic-lessons-from-ariel-sharon-2014-01-13|title=3 economic lessons from Ariel Sharon|first=Amotz|last=Asa-El|publisher=MarketWatch}}</ref>

As Finance Minister, Netanyahu undertook an economic plan in order to restore Israel's economy from its low point during the [[Second Intifada]]. Netanyahu claimed that a bloated public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved a move toward more [[Free market|liberalized markets]], although it was not without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the [[El Al]] national airline, and [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]]. The retirement ages for both men and women were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure.<ref name=marketwatch/><ref name="Likud Leaders 2015">''Likud Leaders'', Thomas G.

However, opponents in the Labor party (and even a few within his own Likud) viewed Netanyahu's policies as "Thatcherite" attacks on the venerated Israeli social safety net.<ref>{{cite news |first=Gil |last=Hoffman |title=Netanyahu: Sharon is a dictator |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=5323 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=21 November 2005 |access-date=17 June 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, unemployment declined while economic growth soared, the debt-to-GDP ratio dropped to one of the lowest in the world, and foreign investment reached record highs.<ref name=marketwatch/>

Netanyahu threatened to resign from office in 2004 unless the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Gaza pullout plan]] was put to a referendum. He later modified the ultimatum and voted for the program in the Knesset, indicating immediately thereafter that he would resign unless a referendum was held within 14 days.<ref>{{cite news |title=Knesset approves PM Sharon's disengagement plan |first1=Gideon |last1=Alon |first2=Mazal |last2=Mualem |first3=Nadav |last3=Shragai |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/knesset-approves-pm-sharon-s-disengagement-plan-1.138398 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=26 October 2004 |access-date=10 March 2013}}</ref> He submitted his resignation letter on 7 August 2005, shortly before the Israeli cabinet voted 17 to 5 to approve the initial phase of withdrawal from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].<ref>{{cite news |first= Stephen |last=Farrell|title= Netanyahu resigns from Cabinet over Gaza withdrawal |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article552940.ece |work=The Times |location=London |date=8 August 2005 |access-date=29 July 2009 }}</ref>

== Return to leadership of Likud ==
Following the withdrawal of Sharon from the Likud, Netanyahu was one of several candidates who vied for the Likud leadership. His most recent attempt prior to this was in September 2005 when he had tried to hold early primaries for the position of the head of the Likud party, while the party held the office of Prime Minister – thus effectively pushing Ariel Sharon out of office. The party rejected this initiative. Netanyahu retook the leadership on 20 December 2005, with 47% of the primary vote, to 32% for [[Silvan Shalom]] and 15% for [[Moshe Feiglin]].<ref name=xinh>{{cite news |title=Netanyahu elected as Likud party chairman |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-12/20/content_3944753.htm |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=20 December 2005 |access-date=27 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227183818/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-12/20/content_3944753.htm |archive-date=27 February 2006}}</ref> In the [[2006 Israeli legislative election|March 2006 Knesset elections]], Likud took the third place behind [[Kadima]] and [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]] and Netanyahu served as Leader of the Opposition.<ref name=poor>{{cite news |last= Marciano |first= Ilan|title= Likud stunned by collapse |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3233422,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=28 March 2006 |access-date=27 July 2009}}</ref> On 14 August 2007, Netanyahu was reelected as chairman of the Likud and its candidate for the post of Prime Minister with 73% of the vote, against far-right candidate [[Moshe Feiglin]] and World Likud chairman [[Danny Danon]].<ref name=feig>{{cite news |title= Netanyahu wins Likud leadership |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6947176.stm |work=BBC News |date=15 August 2007 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref> He opposed the [[2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire]], like others in the Knesset opposition.

Following [[Tzipi Livni]]'s election to head [[Kadima]] and Olmert's resignation from the post of Prime Minister, Netanyahu declined to join the coalition Livni was trying to form and supported new elections, which were held in February 2009.<ref>{{cite news |last= Tran |first= Mark|title= Netanyahu calls for new Israeli elections |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/31/israelandthepalestinians1 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=31 July 2008 |access-date=29 July 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Netanyahu rejects Livni's call for unity government |first=Mazal |last=Mualem |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/netanyahu-rejects-livni-s-call-for-unity-government-1.254503 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=24 September 2008 |access-date=1 March 2013}}</ref> Netanyahu was the Likud's candidate for Prime Minister in the [[2009 Israeli legislative election]] which took place on 10 February 2009, as Livni, the previous [[Acting Prime Minister of Israel|Designated Acting Prime Minister]] under the Olmert government, had been unable to form a viable governing coalition. Opinion polls showed Likud in the lead, but with as many as a third of Israeli voters undecided.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marie |last=Colvin |title= Netanyahu stokes fears to take poll lead |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article5683360.ece |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=8 February 2009 |access-date=8 February 2009 }}</ref>

In the election itself, Likud won the second highest number of seats, Livni's party having outnumbered the Likud by one seat. A possible explanation for Likud's relatively poor showing is that some Likud supporters defected to [[Avigdor Lieberman]]'s [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] party. Netanyahu, however, claimed victory on the basis that right-wing parties won the majority of the vote, and on 20 February 2009, Netanyahu was designated by Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] to succeed Ehud Olmert as prime minister, and began his negotiations to form a coalition government.

Despite right wing parties winning a majority of 65 seats in the [[Knesset]], Netanyahu preferred a broader centrist coalition and turned to his Kadima rivals, chaired by Tzipi Livni, to join his government. This time it was Livni's turn to decline to join, with a difference of opinion on how to pursue the peace process being the stumbling block. Netanyahu did manage to entice a smaller rival, the Labour party, chaired by Ehud Barak, to join his government, giving him a certain amount of centrist tone. Netanyahu presented his cabinet for a Knesset "Vote of Confidence" on 31 March 2009. The 32nd Government was approved that day by a majority of 69 lawmakers to 45 (with five abstaining) and the members were sworn in.<ref name=swornh/><ref name=swornr/>

In 2011, [[2011 Israeli social justice protests|social justice protests]] broke out across Israel. Hundreds of thousands of people protested Israel's high cost of living throughout the country.

The [[2013 Israeli legislative election|2013 election]] returned Netanyahu's [[Likud Yisrael Beiteinu|Likud Beiteinu]] coalition with 11 fewer seats than the combined Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu parties had going into the vote. Nevertheless, as leader of what remained the largest faction in the Knesset, Israeli president Shimon Peres charged Netanyahu with the task of forming the [[Thirty-third government of Israel]]. The new coalition included the [[Yesh Atid]], [[The Jewish Home]] and [[Hatnuah]] parties and excludes the ultra-Orthodox parties at the insistence of Yesh Atid and the Jewish Home.

During Netanyahu's third term, he continued his policy of economic liberalization. In December 2013, the Knesset approved the Business Concentration Law, which intended to open Israel's highly concentrated economy to competition to lower consumer prices, reduce income inequality, and increase economic growth. Netanyahu had formed the Concentration Committee in 2010, and the bill, which was pushed forward by his government, implemented its recommendations. The new law banned multi-tiered corporate holding structures, in which a CEO's family members or other affiliated individuals held public companies which in turn owned other public companies, and who were thus able to engage in [[price gouging]]. Under the law, corporations were banned from owning more than two tiers of publicly listed companies and from holding both financial and non-financial enterprises. All conglomerates were given four to six years to sell excess holdings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/overhaul-of-israels-economy-offers-lessons-for-united-states/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|title=Overhaul of Israel's Economy Offers Lessons for United States|first=Steven|last=Davidoff|work=The New York Times Dealbook blog}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/1.565986|title=What is Israel's new Business Concentration Law and why should we care?|date=29 December 2013|work=Haaretz}}</ref> Netanyahu also began a campaign of port privatization to break what he viewed as the monopoly held by workers of the [[Israel Port Authority]], so as to lower consumer prices and increase exports.

On 2 December 2014, Netanyahu fired two of his ministers, Finance Minister [[Yair Lapid]], who heads the centrist [[Yesh Atid]] party and Justice Minister [[Tzipi Livni]], who heads [[Hatnua]].

So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth&nbsp;... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that."<ref name="haaretz.com"/>

=== Views on counter-terrorism ===
{{Quote box|width=290px|align=right|quote=[T]he essence of democratic societies, and that which distinguishes them from dictatorships, is the commitment to resolve conflict in a nonviolent fashion by settling issues through argument and debate ... The salient point that has to be underlined again and again is that nothing justifies terrorism, that it is evil per se – that the various real or imagined reasons proffered by the terrorists to justify their actions are meaningless|source=Benjamin Netanyahu, 1995<ref name="Farrar, Straus and Giroux">{{cite book |title=Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374154929 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/19 19] |url=https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/19 }}</ref>}}
Netanyahu has said his own "hard line against all terrorists" came as a result of his brother's death. [[Yoni Netanyahu]] had been killed while leading the hostage-rescue mission at [[Operation Entebbe]].<ref>[[Gordon Thomas (author)|Thomas, Gordon]]. ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad'', [[Macmillan Publishers]] (2009) p. 145 {{ISBN missing}}</ref>

In addition to having taken part in counter-terrorist operations during his service in the military, Netanyahu has published three books on the subject of fighting terrorism. He identifies terrorism as a form of [[totalitarianism]], writing: "The more far removed the target of the attack from any connection to the grievance enunciated by the terrorists, the greater the terror ... Yet for terrorism to have any impact, it is precisely the lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or "complicity" of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism's underlying message is that every member of society is "guilty", that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe ... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups ... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means they choose; their choice of means indicate what their true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny. Terrorists use the techniques of violent coercion in order to achieve a regime of violent coercion."<ref>{{cite book |title=Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374154929 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/8 8–9] |url=https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/8 }}</ref>

Netanyahu cautions that "[t]he trouble with active anti-terror activities ... is that they do constitute a substantial intrusion on the lives of those being monitored."  He believes there is a balance between civil liberties and security, which should depend on the level of sustained terrorist attacks in a country.  During periods of sustained attack, there should be shift towards security, due to "the monstrous violation of personal rights which is the lot of the victims of terror and their families".<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374154929 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/33 33] |url=https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/33 }}</ref> But this should be regularly reviewed, with an emphasis on guarding civil liberties and individual privacy wherever and whenever security considerations allow:<ref name="ReferenceA"/> "The concern of civil libertarians over possible infringements of the rights of innocent citizens is well placed, and all additional powers granted the security services should require annual renewal by the legislature, this in addition to judicial oversight of actions as they are taken in the field."<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book |title=Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374154929 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/142 142] |url=https://archive.org/details/fightingterroris00neta/page/142 }}</ref>

He advises tighter immigration laws as an essential tool to preemptively combat terrorism: "This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end. An important aspect of taking control of the immigration situation is stricter background checks of potential immigrants, coupled with the real possibility of deportation."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

He also cautions that it is essential that governments do not conflate terrorists with those legitimate political groups that may or may not hold extremist views, but which advance their positions by means of debate and argument: "Democracies have their share of anti-immigrant or anti-establishment parties, as well as advocates of extreme nationalism or internationalism ... [T]hey are often genuinely convinced participants in democracy, accepting its basic ground rules and defending its central tenets. These can and must be distinguished from the tiny splinters at the absolute fringes of democratic society, which may endorse many similar ideas, but use them as a pretext to step outside the rubric of the democratic system".<ref name="Farrar, Straus and Giroux"/>

In particular, [[Ronald Reagan]] was an admirer of Netanyahu's work on counter-terrorism, and Reagan recommended Netanyahu's book ''Terrorism: How the West Can Win'' to all senior figures in his administration.<ref>David Margolick (June 1996), [http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1996/06/benjamin-netanyahu "Star of Zion"], ''Vanity Fair''</ref>

=== LGBT rights ===
Netanyahu supports equal rights before the law for LGBT citizens, stating: "The struggle for every person to be recognized as equal before the law is a long struggle, and there is still a long way to go&nbsp;... I am proud that Israel is among the most open countries in the world in relation to the LGBT community discourse."<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/landedpages/printarticle.aspx?id=405669 PM to LGBT community: Israel among world's most open countries] 6 November 2015, ''The Jerusalem Post''</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Omri Nahmias |date=11 June 2015 |url=http://news.walla.co.il/item/2862577 |script-title=he:נתניהו בירך את קהילת הלהט"ב: "ישראל - מהפתוחות בעולם" |language=he |trans-title=Netanyahu congratulates the LGBT community: "Israel – one of the most open in the world"  |publisher=[[Walla!]]}}</ref> During an event held for the annual community rights day at the Knesset, Netanyahu proclaimed that he was "asked to come here in the middle of my busy schedule to say one thing to the male and female members of the LGBT community: We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God."<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=11963 "Knesset marks Gay Community Rights Day; PM Netanyahu: 'We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God{{'"}}] Publicized: 23 February 2016, Knesset Press Releases</ref> However, in his coalition government, many of his coalition government party members opposed [[Same-sex marriage in Israel|same-sex marriage]].

=== Ethiopian Jewish integration ===
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - A memorial service of Ethiopian immigrants.jpg|thumb|upright|Netanyahu at a memorial service of Ethiopian Israeli immigrants, in honor of their friends who died on their way to Israel.]]

In 2015, after Ethiopian Jewish protests against police brutality, Netanyahu said: "We will bring a comprehensive plan to the government to assist you in every way. There is no room for racism and discrimination in our society, none ... We will turn racism into something contemptible and despicable."<ref>Judah Ari Gross (17 May 2015), [http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-failed-ethiopian-community-president-says-at-memorial "Israel failed Ethiopian community, president says at memorial"] ''The Times of Israel''</ref>

=== African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem ===
Netanyahu supports the integration of the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]] into Israeli society, and takes part in celebrations in honor of this community's "exodus" from America to Israel, which occurred in 1967. In 2012, Netanyahu expressed appreciation towards "the cooperative society that is working towards the inclusion of the Hebrew Israelite community in Israeli society at large," and declared that the experience of the community in the land of Israel is "an integral part of the Israeli experience."<ref>Andrew Esensten (25 May 2012) [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/african-hebrew-israelites-mark-their-modern-day-exodus-from-u-s.premium-1.432537 "African Hebrew Israelites mark their modern day exodus from U.S"]. ''Haaretz''</ref>

=== Peace process ===
Netanyahu opposed the [[Oslo accords]] from their inception. In 1993, he dedicated a chapter, entitled "Trojan Horse", of his book ''A Place Among the Nations'' to argue against the Oslo Peace Process. He asserted that Amin al-Husseini had been one of the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's "alleged exterminationist Nazism".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/jore.12119|title = Holocaust Abuse| journal=Journal of Religious Ethics| volume=43| issue=4| pages=723–759|year = 2015|last1 = Sells|first1 = Michael A.}}</ref> During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy [[Dennis Ross]] to note that "neither President Clinton nor Secretary [of State Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/09/27/us-jewish-groups-help-make-palestinian-state-impossible.html |title=How U.S. Jews Stymie Peace Talks |last=Beinart |first=Peter |date=27 September 2010 |newspaper=The Daily Beast |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: "They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo Accords]", "I said I would, but&nbsp;...

On 9 August 2009, speaking at the opening of his weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu promised not to repeat the "mistake" of the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Gaza unilateral pullout]], saying, "We will not repeat this mistake. We will not create new evacuees", and adding that "the unilateral evacuation brought neither peace nor security. On the contrary", and that "We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and [the second is] a security settlement. In the case of Gaza, both of these factors were lacking". He also said, "Should we achieve a turn toward peace with the more moderate partners, we will insist on the recognition of the State of Israel and the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state".<ref name=sofer>{{cite news |last= Sofer|first=Roni|title= Netanyahu vows not to repeat 'mistake' of Gaza pullout |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3759065,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=9 August 2009 |access-date=9 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Netanyahu: I won't repeat Gaza evacuation mistake |first=Barak |last=Ravid |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/netanyahu-i-won-t-repeat-gaza-evacuation-mistake-1.281670 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=9 August 2009 |access-date=16 March 2013}}</ref> In October 2014, Netanyahu said "We don't just hand over territory, close our eyes and hope for the best.

In January 2009, prior to the February 2009 Israeli elections Netanyahu informed Middle East envoy Tony Blair that he would continue the policy of the Israeli governments of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert by expanding settlements in the [[West Bank]], in contravention of the Road Map, but not building new ones.<ref>{{cite news |title=Likud allow settlement expansion |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7851140.stm |work=BBC News |date=26 January 2009 |access-date=16 March 2013}}</ref>

He endorsed for the first time the notion of a [[Palestinian state]] alongside Israel.<ref name=lays /> Netanyahu's speech could be viewed in part as a response to Obama's [[A New Beginning|4 June speech at Cairo]]. ''Yedioth Ahronoth'' claimed that Obama's words had "resonated through Jerusalem's corridors".<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3726367,00.html|title=Ministers split over Obama's Cairo speech|date=4 June 2009|access-date=19 June 2009}}</ref>

As part of his proposal, Netanyahu demanded the full demilitarization of the proposed state, with no army, rockets, missiles, or control of its airspace, and said that Jerusalem would be [[Positions on Jerusalem|undivided Israeli territory]]. He stated that the Palestinians should recognize Israel as the Jewish national state with an undivided Jerusalem. He rejected a [[Palestinian right of return|right of return]] for Palestinian refugees, saying, "any demand for resettling Palestinian refugees within Israel undermines Israel's continued existence as the state of the Jewish people." He also stated that a complete stop to [[Israeli settlement|settlement building]] in the [[West Bank]], as required by the 2003 [[Road map for peace|Road Map]] peace proposal, was not possible and the expansions will be limited based on the "natural growth" of the population, including immigration, with no new territories taken in.

In a response to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s statements in his Cairo speech, Netanyahu remarked, "there are those who say that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the State of Israel would never have been established. But I say that if the State of Israel would have been established earlier, the Holocaust would not have occurred." He also said, "this is the homeland of the Jewish people, this is where our identity was forged."

===Illegal immigration===
In his 1995 book ''Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism'', Netanyahu strongly argued that tightening immigration laws in the West is the most effective method to combat terrorism. "This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end", he wrote in 1995.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

In 2012 the Netanyahu government passed the "Prevention of Infiltration Law", which mandated automatic detention of all people, including asylum-seekers, who enter Israel without permission.

Netanyahu has been married three times. Netanyahu's first marriage was to Miriam Weizmann, whom he met in Israel. Weizmann lived near Yonatan Netanyahu's apartment in Jerusalem, where Netanyahu was based during his military service. By the time Netanyahu's service was finished, Weizmann had completed her own military service and a degree in chemistry from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1972, they both left to study in the United States, where she enrolled in [[Brandeis University]], while Netanyahu studied at MIT. They married soon afterward. The couple had one daughter, Noa (born 29 April 1978).

In 1993, Netanyahu confessed on live television to having had an affair with Ruth Bar, his public relations adviser. He said that a political rival had planted a secret video camera that had recorded him in a sexually compromising position with Bar, and that he had been threatened with the release of the tape to the press unless he quit the Likud leadership race.

On 23 December 2016, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334|a resolution]] calling for an end to [[Israeli settlement]]s. In a departure from longstanding American policy, the U.S. abstained from the vote and did not exercise its [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]]. At the behest of the Netanyahu government, President-elect Trump attempted to intercede by publicly advocating the resolution be vetoed and successfully persuading Egypt's [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] to temporarily withdraw it from consideration.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|title=For Obama and Netanyahu, a Final Clash After Years of Conflict|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/middleeast/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-barack-obama.html?src=me |date=23 December 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=25 December 2016}}</ref> The resolution was then "proposed again by [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Senegal]] and [[Venezuela]]"&nbsp;– and passed 14 to 0.
