'''Nicole Scherzinger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɜːr|z|ɪ|ŋ|ər}}; born '''Nicole Prescovia Elikolani Valiente''';<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKvZNzrK1ksC|title=The Extraordinary Book of Native American Lists|first1=Arlene|last1=Hirschfelder|first2=Paulette F.|last2=Molin|date=March 22, 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|accessdate=April 26, 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780810877108}}</ref> June 29, 1978) is an American singer and television personality. Born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]], and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Scherzinger initially performed in plays throughout her adolescence and went to study at [[Wright State University]], before dropping out to pursue a musical career with American rock band [[Days of the New]] and later found modest success in 2001 upon winning a place in [[Eden's Crush]], a [[girl group]] created through [[The WB]]'s ''[[Popstars]]''. 

She came to wider public attention when cast as the lead singer of [[the Pussycat Dolls]] and released the albums ''[[PCD (album)|PCD]]'' (2005) and ''[[Doll Domination]]'' (2008), becoming one of the world's [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]] of all time. Scherzinger's prominent role was a point of contention within the group and factor in its eventual dissolution in 2009. Despite achieving mainstream recognition, Scherzinger's has struggled to carve out a successful solo career releasing two studio albums–''[[Killer Love]]'' (2011) and ''[[Big Fat Lie]]'' (2014)—to moderate success; the former includes the number-one single "[[Don't Hold Your Breath]]".

Scherzinger subsequently ventured into television winning ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' (2010) and serving as a judge on multiple television talent shows like ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' (2009-2010), ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' (2019) and most notably ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor UK]]'' (2012-2017) for four series. She currently serves as a panelist on ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' to ratings success and has reunited with the Pussycat Dolls for an upcoming tour. As an actress, Scherzinger made her [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in a 2014 revival of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', for which she received a nomination for a [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical]] and starred in the television film, ''[[Dirty Dancing (2017 film)|Dirty Dancing]]'' (2017).

Throughout her career, Scherzinger has sold over 16 million records as an artist,<ref name="Cooper"/> and more than 54 million records with The [[Pussycat Dolls]]. Her other ventures include clothing lines, a fragrance and service as an ambassador for the [[Special Olympics]] and supporter of [[UNICEF UK]].<ref name="unicef uk">{{cite web |title=Celebrity Supporters – Unicef UK |url=https://www.unicef.org.uk/celebrity-supporters/ |publisher=UNICEF UK |accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>
