==Criticisms and controversies==

===Data sharing===
Care Everywhere is Epic's health information exchange software, which comes with its EHR system.<ref name="Sullivan"/> A 2014 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' interviews two doctors who say that their Epic systems won't allow them to share data with users of competitors' software in a way that will satisfy the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act#Meaningful use|Meaningful Use]] requirements of the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]].

=== Danish experience ===
In 2016, Danish health authorities spent 2.8 billion [[Danish currency|DKK]] on the implementation of Epic in 18 hospitals in a region with 2.8 million residents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digi.no/artikler/har-brukt-2-8-milliarder-pa-ny-plattform-ikke-mulig-a-tro-at-profesjonelle-aktorer-er-i-stand-til-a-lage-et-sa-elendig-produkt/440508|title=Har brukt 2,8 milliarder på ny plattform: – Ikke mulig å tro at profesjonelle aktører er i stand til å lage et så elendig produkt|work=Digi.no|access-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625161017/https://www.digi.no/artikler/har-brukt-2-8-milliarder-pa-ny-plattform-ikke-mulig-a-tro-at-profesjonelle-aktorer-er-i-stand-til-a-lage-et-sa-elendig-produkt/440508?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-2018-06-23|archive-date=June 25, 2018|language=no}}</ref><ref name="Allen"/> On May 20, Epic went live in the first hospital. Doctors and nurses reported chaos in the hospital and complained of severe under preparation and training. Epic and its Danish partners insisted that normal testing and training were carried out.

Since some elements of the Epic system were not properly translated from English to Danish, physicians resorted to [[Google Translate]]. As one example, when inputting information about a patient's condition, physicians were given the option to report between the left and the "correct" leg, not the left and right legs.  As of 2019, Epic had still not been fully integrated with Denmark's national medical record system, which is meant to be accessed every time a patient is seen. Danish anesthesiologist and computer architect Gert Galster worked to adapt the system. According to Galster, these Epic systems were designed specifically to fit the [[Health care in the United States|U.S. health care]] system, and could not be disentangled for use in Denmark.<ref name="Allen">{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/epic-denmark-health-1510223|title=Lost in translation: Epic goes to Denmark|last=Allen|first=Arthur|work=POLITICO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>

An audit of the implementation that voiced concerns was published in June 2018.<ref>https://www.eurosai.org/en/databases/audits/Report-on-Sundhedsplatformen/</ref> At the end of 2018, 62% of physicians expressed they were not satisfied with the system and 71 physicians signed a petition calling for the system to be removed.<ref name="Allen"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/content/item/1338165|title=Blå blok vil droppe Sundhedsplatformen: "Har gjort det værre for sundhedspersonale og patienter i stedet for at gøre det bedre"|last1=Christensen|first1=Mikkel Fyhn|last2=Sturlason|first2=Astrid Sofie|date=January 23, 2019|website=Berlingske.dk}}</ref>
