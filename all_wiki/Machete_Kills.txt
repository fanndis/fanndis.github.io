'''''Machete Kills''''' is a 2013 American [[action film|action]] [[exploitation film]] co-written and directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/machete-kills-v563549 |title=Allmovie|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |author=Buchanan, Jason|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/machete-kills-movie-review-article-1.1481897|work=[[New York Daily News]]|title='Machete Kills,' movie review|author=Neumaier, Joe|accessdate=February 24, 2014|date=October 10, 2013}}</ref> It is a sequel to ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]'', the third film based on a ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' fake trailer and the second [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the [[Spy Kids (franchise)|''Spy Kids'' franchise]].

The film was released on October 11, 2013, failing to recoup its budget of $20 million and received mixed reviews. Critics cited the overuse of plot points, poorly produced [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and the 'out-of-place' science fiction elements.

==Plot==
[[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]] ([[Danny Trejo]]) and Sartana Rivera ([[Jessica Alba]]) attempt to capture weapon dealers who have been supplying the [[Drug cartel#Mexico|Mexican drug cartels]]. The military men are then all killed by the gangsters, who in turn are wiped out by another intervening party. Its leader murders Sartana while Machete is arrested by corrupt Sheriff Doakes ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) and Deputy Clebourne (Samuel Davis). Doakes unsuccessfully tries to hang Machete but the [[President of the United States|President of the US]], Rathcock ([[Charlie Sheen]]), intervenes. Machete is brought to the [[White House]], where the president offers him US citizenship if he eliminates Marcos Mendez ([[Demián Bichir]]), a psychopath who is threatening to fire a nuclear missile at [[Washington, D.C.]] if the American government does not intervene to stop the rampant drug cartels in Mexico and the corruption of its government.

Machete agrees and travels to [[San Antonio]], where he meets his handler Blanca Vasquez ([[Amber Heard]]), an undercover [[beauty pageant]] competitor. She sends him to [[Acapulco]] to meet a young woman, Cereza ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]), who can lead him to Mendez. Machete finds her in a brothel run by her mother, Madame Desdemona ([[Sofía Vergara]]), who attempts to kill Machete before he escapes with Cereza. She takes him to Mendez's associate, Zaror ([[Marko Zaror]]), who kills Cereza before taking Machete to Mendez's base of operations.

There, Machete learns that Mendez has wired the missile's launch device to Mendez' heart and triggered its launch in 24 hours. If he dies, the missile fires. After Machete kills Zaror, he also captures Mendez, intending to escort Mendez to the US and find a way to disarm the missile. Machete learns that Mendez is an ex-secret agent who tried to expose his corrupt superiors, only to be betrayed and forced to watch his family being tortured. The trauma drove him insane, creating his split personalities and leading him to join forces with the missile's creator.

Shortly thereafter, a hit is put out on them. Machete is targeted by several assailants, including Madame Desdemona and her prostitute assassins, a [[shapeshifting]] hitman called El Camaleón, and Doakes. Machete and Mendez manage to reach the US and kill Doakes and Clebourne only to be caught by a reborn Zaror and the same mercenaries who killed Sartana. Zaror decapitates Mendez and Machete is riddled with bullets.

Machete wakes up to find himself in a healing tank. He is taken to meet Zaror's benefactor—corrupt businessman, inventor and ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan Luther Voz ([[Mel Gibson]]), who reveals Zaror is a series of cloned warriors. He shows Machete Mendez's beating heart, preserved in a jar, and informs him of his plan to manipulate extremists throughout the world to detonate nuclear weapons while planning to escape in a spaceship to rebuild society in space. Machete then escapes with help from Luz ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), who had heard about the hit on Machete. She informs him that the only one who can disarm Mendez's heart is Machete's old enemy, Osiris Amanpour ([[Tom Savini]]), who had repented and joined Luz's Network. Machete contacts Vasquez, who instructs him to meet her at a rendezvous point.

Arriving there, Machete is betrayed and ambushed by Vasquez, who is in league with Voz. As she is escaping into the desert, Machete gives chase and jumps onto the top of her vehicle but falls off after gunfire comes through the roof. Machete is then given a ride by El Camaleón, who tries to kill him one last time, but he escapes and El Camaleón ends up being shot to death by a group of racist [[rednecks]] just inside the US border. Machete then reunites with Luz and the Network. They infiltrate a fundraiser at Voz's base of operations, where Voz kills Osiris. Machete realizes Voz was the one who killed Sartana and fights him. He severely burns Voz's face, disfiguring him to the extent that Voz is forced to wear a metallic, silver mask. Meanwhile, Vasquez shoots Luz in her good eye, completely blinding her. Luz kills Vasquez in return but is captured by Voz, frozen in Carbonite and taken aboard his ship.

Machete jumps on the missile as it launches and disarms it in mid-air, while Voz boards the ship and departs with the Zaror clones, his supporters, as well as Luz and the surviving Network members who will be used as slave labor. The disarmed missile then plunges into the [[Rio Grande]] and Machete is rescued by President Rathcock, who asks him to follow Voz into space and kill him. Machete agrees and uses a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.0]] rocket to depart to Voz's Station in Earth's orbit, where he is given a laser machete to start his mission.

In a [[post-credits scene]], an [[outtake]] from the Luz and Blanca fight scene is included followed by a shot of President Rathcock in front of a space background inquisitively brandishing two of Voz's guns (the molecular disruptor and the same pistol used to kill Sartana) before firing wildly at an off-screen target.

==Production==
On June 10, 2012, Rodriguez announced that principal photography for ''Machete Kills'' had begun.<ref>[https://twitter.com/Rodriguez/status/212054882583187456 MACHETE KILLS today!

The film was produced by [[Robert Rodriguez]], as well as Aaron Kaufman and Iliana Nikolic, through their QuickDraw Productions, Sergei Bespalov of Aldamisa Films, Alexander Rodnyansky of AR Films, and [[Rick Schwartz]] of Overnight Productions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=98893 |title='Machete Kills' Will Slice Into Theaters on September 13 |website=ComingSoon.net |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

[[Lindsay Lohan]], who played April Booth in the first film, did not appear in this installment. Rodriguez said that he liked Lohan's character but she "didn't fit into the story".<ref>{{cite web|author=Josh Wigler|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1701042/lindsay-lohan-machete-sequel-robert-rodriguez.jhtml|title=Lindsay Lohan Not In 'Machete' Sequel, Robert Rodriguez Confirms|publisher=MTV.com|date=2013-01-30|accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref>

The film has [[Charlie Sheen]] credited under his birth name Carlos Estévez. Expected to be a one-time move, it was Sheen's idea to use his birth name for the film, due to the film's Hispanic theme. The [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] and opening credits for the film use an "and introducing..." tag when showing Sheen's birth name.<ref name="Machete Kills">[http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/showbiz/charlie-sheen-now-carlos-estevez Adios Charlie Sheen, hello Carlos Estevez] [[CNN]].com, June 6, 2013</ref>

On June 20, 2013, the film's release date was pushed back from September 13, 2013, to October 11, 2013, to avoid competition with ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Road Pushes Back Machete Kills and Homefront|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=105674|publisher=ComingSoon}}</ref>

==Promotion==
On October 9, 2013, Lady Gaga's [[Vevo]] released a lyric video for "[[Aura (song)|Aura]]", a song from her third studio album ''[[Artpop]]'', to promote the film.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/1715374/lady-gaga-aura-machete-kills-lyric-video/ MTV]</ref>

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
''Machete Kills'' received negative reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a rating of 30%, based on 121 reviews,<ref name="rottentomatoes">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/machete_kills/ |title=Machete Kills – Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=April 23, 2020 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc}}</ref> with the critical consensus "While possessed with the same schlocky lunacy as its far superior predecessor, ''Machete Kills'' loses the first installment's spark in a less deftly assembled sequel." At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received a score of 41 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indictating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/machete-kills | title=Machete Kills (2013): Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc | accessdate=March 4, 2014 }}</ref>

Gaga was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress|Worst Supporting Actress]] for her work in the film, but lost to [[Kim Kardashian]] for ''[[Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor]]''.<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/74929 NME]</ref>

==Possible sequel==
At the end of the first film's theatrical version, two sequels are mentioned, ''Machete Kills'' and ''Machete Kills Again''. The trailer for the third film titled, ''Machete Kills Again... In Space'',<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2011/07/robert_rodriguez_sin_city_2.html Robert Rodriguez Tells Vulture About Machete in Space, Sin City 2, and Fire and Ice]</ref> precedes the second film as a "Coming Attraction".<ref name="AutoMR-44">{{cite web| url = https://collider.com/robert-rodriguez-machete-kills-sin-city-2-heavy-metal/104116/| title = Comic-Con 2011: Robert Rodriguez Updates on MACHETE Sequels and SIN CITY 2; Announces HEAVY METAL Remake | year = 2011 | publisher = [[Collider (website)|Collider]] }}</ref><ref name="AutoMR-45">{{cite web | url = http://io9.com/5823656/robert-rodriguezs-next-projects-sin-city-2-heavy-metal-frank-frazetta-and-machete-in-space | title="Robert" Rodriguez's next projects: sin city 2, heavy Metal, frank Frazetta... and machete in space!' | year = 2011 | publisher = [[io9]] }}</ref> In 2015, Trejo told Halloween Daily News that the third film is happening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halloweendailynews.com/2015/04/danny-trejo-confirms-machete-kills-in/|title=Danny Trejo Confirms 'Machete Kills In Space' Filming This Year [Exclusive]|publisher=Halloween Daily News|last=Artz|first=Matt|date= April 2, 2015}}</ref> Since then nothing was announced about the movie.
