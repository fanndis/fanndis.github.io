'''Duncan''' is a town in [[Greenlee County, Arizona|Greenlee County]], [[Arizona]], [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the town was 696.<ref name="Census 2010"/> In 2018 the estimated population was 789.<ref name="USCensusEst2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>

Duncan is in the [[Gila River]] valley, {{convert|4|mi|0}} west of the Arizona-[[New Mexico]] border. The town limits are on both sides of the Gila, but the primary portion of the town and the entire downtown area lie on the south side of the river. Duncan was founded in the mid 19th century, and the land was added to the United States as a part of the [[Mexican Cession]]. The town of Duncan has been destroyed twice by flood and once by fire.

The town and area are primarily populated by ranchers and miners (especially from the Freeport-McMoran copper mines in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico). Surrounding smaller towns such as [[Franklin, Arizona|Franklin]] and [[York, Arizona|York]] in Arizona and [[Virden, New Mexico]], use Duncan public works and public schools. The Duncan area along the Gila River is renowned for Native American artifacts such as arrow heads, pottery, burial sites, cave paintings and other remnants of the [[Anasazi]] and other pre-historic cultures, as well as artifacts from garrison camps of the expedition of [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]].

[[Duncan High School]] (mascot: Wildkats; school colors: red, grey, and white) competes in many sports, but is renowned for their football team.

[[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] was born in [[El Paso, Texas]], but grew up near Duncan on the Lazy B ranch, which straddles the border between Arizona and New Mexico. The Day family ran the ranch for many years until selling it; it continues to be run as a ranch. O'Connor later wrote a book titled ''Lazy B: Growing up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest'' about her childhood experiences on the ranch with her brother H. Alan Day.

In April the average diurnal range is as high as {{convert|43.7|F-change|C-change}} and it is only less than {{convert|36|F-change|C-change}} in the often stormy months of July and August when over a third of the year's total rainfall can be expected.

During a typical year 131.6 nights will fall below {{convert|32|F|C}}, but only 7.8 days fail to top {{convert|50|F|C}}, and there are only seven occurrences of nights falling to {{convert|0|F|C|1}} or lower, notably on December 24, 1953, and January 11, 1962, when the record low of {{convert|&minus;2|F|C|1}} was set.

Rainfall is generally scanty outside of the monsoon season, with substantial falls from winter storms being very rare, although December 1991 did see {{convert|4.76|in|mm|1|disp=or}} of rain. The wettest month since continuous records began in 1942 has been August 2014 with {{convert|6.17|in|mm|1|disp=or}}, whilst the wettest calendar year has been 1983 with {{convert|18.88|in|mm|1|disp=or}} and the driest 1956 with {{convert|3.49|in|mm|1|disp=or}}.<ref>[[National Weather Service]], Tucson; [http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=twc NOW Data]</ref> Snowfall is most unusual, with the median being zero and the mean only {{convert|0.5|in|m|3}}. The most snowfall ever in Duncan was {{convert|15.0|in|m|2|disp=or}} during the record Western cold wave of January 1949.
