Along with his competitors [[Peter Jennings]] at [[ABC News]] and [[Dan Rather]] at [[CBS News]], Brokaw was one of the "Big Three" [[news anchor]]s in the U.S. during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. The three hosted their networks' flagship nightly news programs for over 20 years, and all three started and retired from the anchor chair (or died, in Jennings' case) with Dan Rather notably being fired from CBS due to false reports broadcast on [[60 Minutes II]] within a year of each other.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Anchors could bring new era of network stability|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/anchors-bring-new-era-network-stability-article-1.1922051|website = NY Daily News|access-date = January 21, 2016}}</ref>

Brokaw has also written several books on American history and society in the 20th century. He is the author of ''[[The Greatest Generation (book)|The Greatest Generation]]'' (1998) and other books and the recipient of numerous awards and honors including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], which was awarded to him by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2014.<ref>https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/10/president-obama-names-recipients-presidential-medal-freedom</ref>

Brokaw was born in [[Webster, South Dakota]], the son of Eugenia "Jean" (''[[née]]'' Conley; 1917–2011),<ref name="Orange County Register">{{cite web|title=Eugenia Conley Brokaw Obituary |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/orangecounty/obituary.aspx?pid=154559432}}</ref> who worked in sales and as a post-office clerk, and Anthony Orville "Red" Brokaw (1912–1982).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/77/Tom-Brokaw.html |title=Tom Brokaw Biography (1940–) |work=Filmreference.com |access-date=November 27, 2011}}</ref> He was the eldest of their three sons (brothers named William and Michael) and named for his maternal great-grandfather, Thomas Conley.

His father was a descendant of [[Huguenot]] immigrants Bourgon and Catherine (''née'' Le Fèvre) Broucard, and his mother was Irish-American,<ref name="STL02">McGuire, John M. (November 6, 2002). "From Yankton to Yankee Town". ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', p.

Brokaw's father was a construction foreman for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. He worked at the [[Black Hills Ordnance Depot]] (BHOD) and helped construct [[Fort Randall Dam]]; his job often required the family to resettle throughout South Dakota during Brokaw's early childhood.<ref name="MidwestToday">Jordan, Larry (February 1995).

''Midwest Today''.</ref> The Brokaws lived for short periods in Bristol, [[Igloo, South Dakota|Igloo]] (the small residential community of the BHOD), and [[Pickstown, South Dakota|Pickstown]], before settling in [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]], where Brokaw attended high school.<ref name="STL02" /><ref name="MidwestToday" />

As a high school student attending [[Yankton High School|Yankton Senior High School]],<ref name="Yahoo TV"/> Brokaw was governor of South Dakota [[American Legion]] [[Boys State]], and in that capacity he accompanied then-South Dakota Governor [[Joe Foss]] to New York City for a joint appearance on a TV [[game show]]. It was to be the beginning of a long relationship with Foss, whom Brokaw would later feature in his book about World War II [[veterans]], ''The Greatest Generation''. Brokaw also became an Advisory Board member of the [[Joe Foss Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joefossinstitute.org/about-jfi/our-leadership/|website=Joe Foss Institute|title=Our Leadership|access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

Brokaw matriculated at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], but dropped out after a year as he apparently failed to keep up in his studies, in his words majoring in "beer and co-eds".<ref name=Munson170410>{{cite news | last = Munson | first = Kyle | title = Tom Brokaw's 'stuff' in Iowa is a window into his life | url = https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/columnists/kyle-munson/2017/04/10/tom-brokaws-stuff-iowa-window-into-his-life/99805406/ | work= The Des Moines Register | date = April 10, 2017 | access-date = March 19, 2018}}</ref>  In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University, and he later donated his papers to the [[University of Iowa]] Libraries. He joked that the "honorary degree is especially coveted because it helps to make up for the uneven (to put it mildly) performance of my freshman year." He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of South Dakota]] in 1964.<ref name="Yahoo TV">{{cite web|title=Tom Brokaw – Biography|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/tom-brokaw/contributor/213912/bio|work=Yahoo!

== Broadcasting career ==

[[File:Photograph of NBC White House Correspondent Tom Brokaw Interviewing President Gerald R. Ford in the White House Library for a Special NBC Broadcast on American Foreign Policy.jpg|thumb|left|Brokaw interviewing President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976]]
Brokaw's television career began at [[KTIV]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] followed by stints at [[KMTV-TV|KMTV]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Wishart|first=David J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|date=2004|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803247871|page=507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC&pg=PA507 }}</ref> In 1966, he joined [[NBC News]], reporting from [[Los Angeles]] and anchoring the 11:00 pm news for [[KNBC]]. In 1973, NBC made Brokaw [[White House]] correspondent, covering the [[Watergate scandal]], and anchor of the Saturday editions of ''Nightly News.''  He became host of NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' in 1976 and remained in the job until 1981.

He kept a closely guarded secret for many years, in 2017 Brokaw wrote of having been offered – and having promptly turned down – the [[White House Press Secretary|press secretary]] position in the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon White House]] in 1969. While living in California before Nixon made his political comeback, Brokaw had come to know [[H. R. Haldeman|H. R. 'Bob' Haldeman]] (White House chief of staff and initiator of the offer) as well as Nixon's press secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], and others members of the White House staff.<ref>Brokaw, Tom, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/opinion/tom-brokaw-the-offer-from-nixon-i-refused.html "The Offer From Nixon I Refused" (opinion)], [[Op-ed]], ''The New York Times'', February 17, 2017. Retrieved February 18, 2017.</ref>

In 2019, Brokaw wrote a book entitled, "The Fall of Richard Nixon: A Reporter Remembers Watergate", about his experiences working as a reporter and experiences as a member of the White House press corps.

[[File:Nancy Reagan in an Interview with Tom Brokaw at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas Texas.jpg|thumb|Brokaw with [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[1984 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in August 1984]]
On April 5, 1982, Brokaw began co-anchoring ''NBC Nightly News'' from New York with [[Roger Mudd]] in Washington.  After a year, NBC News president [[Reuven Frank]] concluded that the dual-anchor program was not working and selected Brokaw to be sole anchor.<ref>Frank, Reuven. ''Out of Thin Air: The Brief Wonderful Life of Network News'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991), pp. 383–84.</ref> The ''NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw'' commenced on September 5, 1983.

Brokaw scored a major coup when, on November 9, 1989, he was the first English-language broadcast journalist to report the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]]. Brokaw attended a televised press conference organized in [[East Berlin]] by [[Günter Schabowski]], press spokesman for [[East Germany|East German]] Politburo, which had just decided to allow its citizens to apply to permanently leave the country through its border with [[West Germany]]. When Schabowski was asked when this loosening of regulations would take effect, he glanced through his notes, then said, "''sofort, unverzüglich''" ("immediately, without delay"), touching off a stampede of East Berliners to the [[Bornholmer Straße border crossing|Wall]]. Brokaw had an interview with Schabowski after the press conference, who repeated his "immediately" statement when pressed. Later that evening Brokaw reported from the west side of Brandenburg Gate on this announcement and pandemonium that had broken out in East Berlin because of it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nbcnews-com/brokaw-reports-from-the-berlin-wall-337455683615|work=NBC NEWS|date=November 9, 1989|title=Brokaw reports from the Berlin Wall|access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref>

As anchor, Brokaw conducted the first one-on-one American television interviews with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. He and [[Katie Couric]] hosted a prime-time [[newsmagazine]], ''[[Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric|Now]]'', that aired from 1993 to 1994 before being folded into the multi-night ''Dateline NBC'' program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Now with Tom Brokaw & Katie Couric |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/now-with-tom-brokaw-katie-couric/episodes/203488/ |website=tvguide.com |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |access-date=31 August 2019}}</ref>

Also, in 1993, on the first broadcast of ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on [[CBS]], in response to [[David Letterman]]'s monologue containing jokes about [[NBC]], Brokaw walked on stage in a surprise cameo (accompanied by [[Paul Shaffer]] and the CBS Orchestra playing the ''NBC Nightly News'' theme).<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLSG5xOaqOY|title=Late Show with David Letterman First Episode (8/30/93)|via=[[YouTube]]|last=Valisno|first=Patrick Josh|date=January 1, 2015|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref>  He congratulated Letterman on his new show and wished him well, but also stated he was disappointed and shocked; he subsequently walked over to the man holding the [[cue cards]], took two, and remarked, "These last two jokes are the [[intellectual property]] of NBC!", leaving the stage afterwards.<ref name="youtube.com"/>  Letterman then remarked, "Who would have thought you would ever hear the words 'intellectual property' and 'NBC' in the same sentence?"<ref name="youtube.com"/>

[[Richard Jewell]] sued NBC News for this statement, made by Brokaw about the 1996 Olympic Park bombing, "The speculation is that the FBI is close to making the case. They probably have enough to arrest [Jewell] right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case." Even though NBC stood by its story, the network agreed to pay Jewell $500,000.

On [[September 11, 2001]], Brokaw joined [[Katie Couric]] and [[Matt Lauer]] around 9:30&nbsp;a.m., following the live attack on the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], and continued to anchor all day, until after midnight. Following the collapse of the second tower, Brokaw observed: "This is war.  This is a declaration and an execution of an attack on the United States."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20010912owentv4p4.asp|title=Tuned In: This was reality TV at its most horrific|work=Post-gazette.com|date= September 12, 2001|access-date=November 4, 2008|first=Rob|last=Owen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n16ArLMUwAE|title=9/11/01 NBC World Trade Center Part 12|via=[[YouTube]]|last=emscrazy001|date=November 21, 2007|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref> He continued to anchor coverage to midnight on the following two days. Later that month, a letter containing [[anthrax]] was addressed to him as part of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]. Brokaw was not harmed, but two NBC News employees were infected. In 2008, he testified before the [[Commission on Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism]] about the anthrax attacks, publicly discussing his experiences for the first time in a detailed, day-by-day account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?281113-3/biological-threat-assessment|title=Biological Threat Assessment|work=[[C-SPAN]]|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref>

In 2002, NBC announced that Brokaw would retire as anchor of the ''NBC Nightly News'' following the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]], to be succeeded by [[Brian Williams]]. Brokaw would remain with [[NBC News]] in a part-time capacity from that point onwards, serving as an analyst and anchoring and producing documentary programs. Brokaw closed his final ''Nightly News'' broadcast in front of 15.7 million viewers on NBC on December 1, 2004, by saying:

{{quote|Well the time is here. We've been through a lot together through dark days and nights and seasons of hope and joy. Whatever the story, I had only one objective, to get it right. When I failed, it was personally painful, and there was no greater urgency than course correction. On those occasions, I was grateful for your forbearance and always mindful that your patience and attention didn't come with a lifetime warranty.

I was not alone here, of course. I am simply the most conspicuous part of a large, thoroughly dedicated and professional staff that extends from just beyond these cameras, across the country, and around the world. In too many instances, in places of grave danger and personal hardship and they're family to me.

What have I learned here? More than we have time to recount this evening, but the enduring lessons through the decades are these: it's not the questions that get us in trouble, it's the answers. And just as important, no one person has all the answers.

Just ask a member of the generation that I came to know well, the men and women who came of age in the Great Depression who had great personal sacrifice, saved the world during World War II and returned home to dedicate their lives to improving the nation they had already served so nobly. They weren't perfect, no generation is, but this one left a large and vital legacy of common effort to find common ground here and abroad in which to solve our most vexing problems. They did not give up their personal beliefs and greatest passions, but they never stopped learning from each other and most of all, they did not give up on the idea that we're all in this together, we still are.

And it is in that spirit that I say, thanks, for all that I have learned from you. That's been my richest reward.

That's ''Nightly News'' for this Wednesday night. I'm Tom Brokaw. You'll see Brian Williams here tomorrow night, and I'll see you along the way.}}

By the end of his time as ''Nightly News'' anchor, Brokaw was regarded as the most popular news personality in the United States. ''Nightly News'' had moved into first place in the [[Nielsen ratings]] in late 1996<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1997/03/12/STYLE6031.dtl&type=printable|title=CBS tops Nielsens 2nd week in row|work=[[SF Gate]]|date=March 12, 1997}}</ref> and held on to the spot for the remainder of Brokaw's tenure on the program, placing him ahead of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Peter Jennings]] and ''[[World News with Charles Gibson|World News Tonight]]'', and [[CBS]]'s [[Dan Rather]] and the ''[[CBS News|CBS Evening News]]''.
Along with Jennings and Rather, Brokaw helped usher in the era of the TV [[news anchor]] as a lavishly compensated, globe-trotting star in the 1980s. The magnitude of a news event could be measured by whether Brokaw and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene. Brokaw's retirement in December 2004, followed by Rather's ousting from the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' in March 2005, and Jennings's death in August 2005, brought that era to a close.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Donaldson-Evans |first1=Catherine |title=Jennings' Death Forces New Look at 'Big 3' |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/jennings-death-forces-new-look-at-big-3 |website=foxnews.com |publisher=Fox News Network, LLC |access-date=31 August 2019}}</ref>

=== 2004-present: After ''Nightly News'' ===
[[File:TomBrokaw.jpg|thumb|Brokaw in 2006 speaking about the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].]]
After leaving the anchor chair, Brokaw remained at NBC as Special Correspondent, providing periodic reports for ''Nightly News''.  He served as an NBC analyst during the 2008 presidential election campaign<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/?s=brokaw |title=Inside Cable News |work=Insidecable.blogsome.com |access-date=November 4, 2008}}</ref> and moderated the second presidential debate between [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] at [[Belmont University]].  He reported documentaries for the Discovery Channel and the History Channel and in 2006 delivered one of the eulogies during the [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|state funeral of former President Gerald R. Ford]].

On June 13, 2008, when NBC interrupted its regular programming to announce the sudden death of NBC News Washington Bureau Chief and ''[[Meet the Press]]'' moderator [[Tim Russert]], Brokaw served as the announcer.  A week later, NBC announced that Brokaw would serve as host of ''Meet the Press'' on an interim basis.  He was succeeded by [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] in December 2008.

Brokaw serves on the board of directors of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], the [[International Rescue Committee]] and the [[Mayo Clinic]].  He is also a member of the [[Howard University]] School of Communications Board of Visitors and a trustee of the [[University of South Dakota]], the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the [[International Rescue Committee]]. He also provides the voiceover for a [[University of Iowa]] advertisement that airs on television during [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] athletic events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juniorelitetri.com/the-university-of-iowa-tom-brokaw-and-because-each-student-and-young-with-their-research-should-alt.html |title=The University of Iowa, Tom Brokaw, and because each student (and young) with their research should Alt |publisher=Online University |access-date=March 16, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In December 2012, Brokaw starred in the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]'s annual Christmas concert, with live audiences of 84,000.

In April 2014, a new broadcast facility opened on the [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] lot, and named in Brokaw's honor as the Brokaw News Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/2014/04/29/nbc-names-l-a-facility-for-brokaw/|title=NBC names L.A. facility for Brokaw|work= NewscastStudio|date=April 29, 2014

In November 2014, [[President Barack Obama]] presented Brokaw with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], American's highest civilian honor.
