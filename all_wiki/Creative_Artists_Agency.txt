Creative Artists Agency (CAA) was formed by five agents at the [[William Morris Agency]] in 1975.<ref name="twsWSJ1"/> At a dinner, [[Michael S.

Within a week, they sold a [[game show]] called ''[[Rhyme and Reason (TV show)|Rhyme and Reason]]'', the ''[[Rich Little]] Show'', and [[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|''The Jackson 5ive'']]. An early plan was to form a medium-sized full-service agency, share proceeds equally, and do without nameplates on doors or formal titles or individual client lists, with guidelines like "be a team player" and "return phone calls promptly."

CAA used its writer clients to attract actors to the agency. Ovitz and CAA were the first to [[film packaging|package]] films like TV shows. Representing numerous A-list actors and having about $90 million in annual bookings in the late 1970s, Ovitz led the agency to expand into the film business.<ref name="Cieply1989"/>{{r|davis19890709}} By the mid-1990s, CAA had 550 employees, about 1,400 of Hollywood's top talent, and $150 million in revenue.<ref name="diamond2008">{{Citation | last = Diamond | first = Michael | title = Corporations: A Contemporary Approach | publisher = Carolina Academic Press | year = 2008 }}</ref> In the 1990s, CAA was owned mostly by several key agents, including Michael Ovitz, Bill Haber, and Ron Meyer.<ref name="twsLAT11"/>

==Industry information==
With many clients, agents charge a percentage fee based on monies that their clients make; one estimate was that CAA charges 10% of what its movie and television clients are paid.<ref name="twsWSJ1"/>

CAA chiefs including Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer and Bill Haber built the agency by packaging actors and directors with literary clients,<ref name="twsLAT9"/> but the scope of deal-making has widened in recent decades. For example, CAA crafted a deal between toy-maker Hasbro and [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], along with numerous CAA writers and directors, to make the movie franchise ''[[Transformers]]''.<ref name="twsNYT4"/><ref>Note: Hasbro changed talent agencies a month before the film was released, and defected to the William Morris agency.</ref> Sometimes deal-making entails creating new technology firms.<ref name="twsWSJ3"/> CAA even manages deals with the estates of long-dead clients such as reggae musician [[Bob Marley]], who died in 1981.<ref name="twsLAT5">{{cite web|author=Dawn C. Chmielewski|date=March 6, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/06/entertainment/la-et-ct-caa-bravado-strike-bob-marley-deals-20130305|title=Bob Marley family strikes deals with CAA, merchandiser Bravado|accessdate=May 1, 2016|quote=...Bob Marley died ... has attracted new deals with Creative Artists Agency and giant music merchandising company Bravado. ...}}</ref> CAA helped one former politician create an online career institute.<ref name="twsSFC22">{{cite web|author=Steve Poizner|date=August 18, 2011|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Encore-Career-Institute-s-real-world-job-solutions-2334323.php|title=Encore Career Institute's real world job solutions|accessdate=May 3, 2016|quote=...Steve Poizner ... online university at UCLA, in partnership with Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists agency....}}</ref> CAA sold sponsorship rights for a baseball stadium in San Francisco.<ref name="twsWSJ1"/>

While talent agencies can grow by making acquisitions, CAA has generally grown organically by bringing in new clients.<ref name="twsWSJ1"/> The company divided its agents into two camps: traditional agents who manage the career tracks of 1,000 stars, and specialists in [[investment banking]], consulting, advertising and digital media. The agency can use its more glamorous clients in film and TV to craft deals with steadier income streams; for example, using clients such as [[Julia Roberts]], they can assemble marketing programs for less glamorous clients,<ref name="twsWSJ1"/> such as [[Nationwide Insurance]].<ref name="twsAA1">{{cite web|author=E.

When Hollywood agents change firms, and take stars and talent with them, it can have major financial repercussions for the departing agency,<ref name="twsLAT9"/> and can lead to much confusion as lawyers pour over the fine print of numerous contracts.

To market themselves, talent agencies often cater exclusive parties following awards ceremonies such as the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]].<ref name="twsPeopleMag3">{{cite web|author=LINDSAY KIMBLE|date=January 12, 2016|publisher=People Magazine|url=http://www.people.com/article/leonardo-dicaprio-lady-gaga-golden-globes-party-together|title=Leonardo DiCaprio Enjoyed Golden Globes Afterparty Together Following Awards Show Run-In|accessdate=May 1, 2016|quote=...The pair were spotted ... at the Creative Artists Agency's Golden Globes afterparty...}}</ref> In 2013, CAA threw a party at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] which caused embarrassment and a public relations backlash, where "guests mingled with lingerie-clad women pretending to snort prop cocaine, erotic dancers outfitted with sex toys and an Alice in Wonderland look-alike performing a simulated sex act on a man in a rabbit costume."<ref name="twsLAT6">{{cite web|author1=Chris Lee|author2=John Horn|date=January 24, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/24/entertainment/la-et-mn-sundance-caa-20130125|title=A bawdy CAA party at Sundance shocks guests, including clients: Creative Artists Agency's party at the Sundance Film Festival, featuring scantily clad performers and sex toys, provokes a public relations backlash|accessdate=May 1, 2016|quote=...

==Buildings==
In the late 1980s, CAA commissioned architect [[I.M. Pei|I. M.

==Competition==
CAA was formed in 1975 from defections from the William Morris Agency, and there continue to be about four or five major talent agencies.

In 2009, William Morris Agency and Endeavor merged to form [[William Morris Endeavor Entertainment|William Morris Endeavor]] (WME). As of 2015, CAA and WME are the largest agencies in the business.<ref name="twsWSJ8"/><ref name="twsNexus1"/> In 2014, WME bought IMG Worldwide, a fashion and sports agency, for $2.4 billion.<ref name="twsWSJ1"/> In 2014, WME had 4500 employees while CAA had 1500 employees.<ref name="twsWSJ1"/> WME had a larger share of sports-related clients.<ref name="twsWSJ1"/> The rivalry can get cantankerous: in one instance, the William Morris Endeavor agency placed dozens of ads around the city using Creative Artists Agency's red-and-white color signature with the headline being CAAN'T, a "playful nod to the CAA acronym."<ref name="twsWSJ1"/><ref name="twsLAT1">{{cite web
