===School of Architecture and Design===
{{main|University of Kansas School of Architecture, Design, and Planning}}
The University of Kansas School of Architecture and Design (Arc/D), with its main building being Marvin Hall, traces its architectural roots to the creation of the [[architectural engineering]] degree program in KU's School of Engineering in 1912. The Bachelor of Architecture degree was added in 1920. In 1969 the School of Architecture and Urban Design (SAUD) was formed with three programs: architecture, architectural engineering, and urban planning. In 2001 architectural engineering merged with civil and environmental engineering. The design programs from the discontinued School of Fine Arts were merged into the school in 2009 forming the School of Architecture, Design, and Planning (SADP) with three departments. In 2017, the Urban Planning department merged into KU's School of Public Affairs and Administration. Accordingly, the SADP was renamed to the School of Architecture and Design (Arc/D).

According to the journal ''DesignIntelligence'', which annually publishes "America's Best Architecture and Design Schools," the School of Architecture and Design at the University of Kansas was named the best in the [[Midwest]] and ranked 11th among all undergraduate architecture programs in the U.S in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sadp.ku.edu/node/618|title=KU Architecture Ranked No. 14 in DesignIntelligence Rankings, No. 1 in Midwest|publisher=sadp.ku.edu|date=November 8, 2012|accessdate=November 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419044608/http://www.sadp.ku.edu/node/618|archive-date=April 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Athletics===
{{Main|Kansas Jayhawks}}
[[File:Kansas Jayhawks wordmark.svg|thumb|270px|Kansas Jayhawks wordmark as of 2018]]The school's sports teams, wearing crimson and royal blue, are called the [[Kansas Jayhawks]]. They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. KU has won thirteen National Championships: five in men's basketball (two [[Helms Foundation]] championships and three NCAA championships), three in men's indoor track and field, three in men's outdoor track and field, one in men's cross country and one in women's outdoor track and field. The home course for KU Cross Country is Rim Rock Farm. Their most recent championship came on June 8, 2013 when the KU women's track and field team won the NCAA outdoor in Eugene, Oregon becoming the first University of Kansas women's team to win a national title.<ref name="Women's Track">{{cite web|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2013/jun/08/ku-wins-ncaa-womens-track-title/|title=KU wins NCAA women's track title|website=KUsports.com|accessdate=November 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323100639/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2013/jun/08/ku-wins-ncaa-womens-track-title/|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:University of Kansas - Memorial Stadium.JPG|thumb|Memorial Stadium]]

[[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas football]] dates from 1890, and is one of the oldest continuous programs in the nation. They have played in the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] three times: [[1948 Orange Bowl|1948]], [[1969 Orange Bowl|1969]], and [[2008 Orange Bowl|2008]]. They are currently coached by [[Les Miles]], who was hired in 2018.<ref name="kuathletics.com">{{cite web |title=Les Miles named football coach at Kansas |url=https://kuathletics.com/news/2018/11/18/les-miles-named-football-coach-at-kansas.aspx |website=Kansas Jayhawks |date=November 11, 2018 |accessdate=March 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119051545/https://kuathletics.com/news/2018/11/18/les-miles-named-football-coach-at-kansas.aspx |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> From its inception in 1890 to 1929 the program saw consistent success, winning several conference titles in 4 different conferences. After joining the Big 6 Conference (which would eventually become the Big 8) in 1929, Kansas began to struggle in the wins-loss column. With the formation of the Big 8 conference in 1960, Kansas became a consistent winner again, and fielded legendary coaches like Don Fambrough, Bud Moore, and Glen Mason. In 2008, under the leadership of [[Mark Mangino]], the #7 Jayhawks emerged victorious in their first BCS bowl game, the [[FedEx]] [[Orange Bowl]], with a [[2008 Orange Bowl|24–21 victory]] over the #3 [[Virginia Tech Hokies]]. This capstone victory marked the end of the most successful season in school history, in which the Jayhawks went 12–1 (.923). The team plays at [[David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium]], which recently underwent a $31 million renovation to add the Anderson Family Football Complex, adding a football practice facility adjacent to the stadium complete with indoor partial practice field, weight room, and new locker room.

The [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|KU men's basketball]] team has fielded a team every year since 1898. The Jayhawks are a perennial national contender, coached by [[Bill Self]]. The team has won five national titles, including three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament championships]] in [[1951–52 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1952]], [[1987–88 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1988]], and [[2007–08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2008]]. The basketball program is currently the second winningest program in college basketball history with an overall record of 2,248-848 through the 2017–18 season. The team plays at [[Allen Fieldhouse]]. Perhaps its best recognized player was [[Wilt Chamberlain]], who played in the 1950s, later becoming an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star and [[Harlem Globetrotter]]. Other notable Jayhawk basketball players include [[Phog Allen]] (who would later become head coach of the Jayhawks), [[Dean Smith]], [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[B.H. Born]], [[Dave Robisch]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Darnell Valentine]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Jacque Vaughn]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Nick Collison]], [[Kirk Hinrich]], [[Mario Chalmers]], [[Marcus Morris (basketball)|Marcus Morris]], [[Markieff Morris]], [[Andrew Wiggins]], and [[Joel Embiid]], among others.

Kansas has counted among its coaches Dr. [[James Naismith]] (the inventor of basketball), Basketball Hall of Fame inductee [[Phog Allen]] ("the Father of basketball coaching" and a Kansas alumnus himself), Basketball Hall of Fame inductee [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]], and Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and former NBA Champion [[Detroit Pistons]] coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]]. Currently, Kansas is coached by Basketball Hall of Fame inductee [[Bill Self]]. In addition, legendary [[University of Kentucky]] coach and Basketball Hall of Fame inductee [[Adolph Rupp]] played for KU's 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams, and NCAA Hall of Fame inductee and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] Coach [[Dean Smith]] played for KU's 1952 NCAA Championship team. Both Rupp and Smith played under Phog Allen. Allen also coached Hall of Fame coaches Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), which started what is now the NCAA Tournament. The Tournament began in 1939 under the NABC and the next year was handed off to the newly formed NCAA.<ref name="NABC">{{cite web|url=http://www.nabc.org/about/index|title=Phog Allen founded NCAA Tournament|website=Nabc.org|accessdate=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007153741/http://www.nabc.org/about/index|archive-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Notable non-varsity sports include rugby, men's hockey, and men's soccer. The rugby team owns its private facility and internationally tours every two years.

[[Sheahon Zenger]] was introduced as KU's new [[athletic director]] in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kuathletics.com/staff.aspx?staff=174|title=Sheahon Zenger|website=Kuathletics.com|accessdate=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017025658/http://www.kuathletics.com/staff.aspx?staff=174|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Under former athletic director [[Lew Perkins]], the department's budget increased from $27.2 [[million]] in 2003 (10th in the conference) to currently over $50 million thanks in large part to money raised from a new priority seating policy at Allen Fieldhouse, a new $26.67 million eight-year contract with [[Adidas]] replacing an existing contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and a new $40.2 million seven-year contract with [[ESPN]] Regional Television. The additional funds brought improvements to the university, including:<ref>King, Jason. "Hawk Market", ''The Kansas City Star'' (June 11, 2006), pp. C1, C14.</ref>
* The Booth Family Hall of Athletics addition to Allen Fieldhouse
* Brand new offices and lounges for the women's basketball program

===Media===
The university's newspaper is ''[[University Daily Kansan]]'', which placed first in the Intercollegiate Writing Competition of the prestigious William Randolph Hearst Writing Foundation competition, often called "The Pulitzers of College Journalism" in 2007. In Winter 2008, a group of students created KUpedia, a wiki about all things KU. They received student funding for operations in 2008–09. The KU Department of English publishes the ''Coal City Review'', an annual literary journal of prose, poetry, reviews and illustrations. The ''Review'' typically features the work of many writers, but periodically spotlights one author, as in the case of 2006 Nelson Poetry Book Award-winner ''Voyeur Poems'' by Matthew Porubsky.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/orgs/kac/2006convention/2006winnerreviews.html|title=2006 Award Winner Reviews ~ Kansas Authors Club|website=Skyways.lib.ks.us|accessdate=October 12, 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110135602/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/orgs/kac/2006convention/2006winnerreviews.html|archivedate=November 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.lawrence.com/news/2006/dec/02/poet_wellversed_voyeurism/ "Poet well-versed in voyeurism" ~ Lawrence.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210234145/http://www.lawrence.com/news/2006/dec/02/poet_wellversed_voyeurism/ |date=December 10, 2006 }}, December 2, 2006</ref>

The ''University Daily Kansan'' operates outside of the university's William Allen White School of Journalism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.ku.edu/welcome-dean|title=Welcome from the Dean|website=Journalism.ku.edu|accessdate=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015133406/http://journalism.ku.edu/welcome-dean|archive-date=October 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> and reaches at least 30,000 daily readers through its print and online publications<ref>[[University Daily Kansan]]</ref>

The university houses the following public broadcasting stations: [[KJHK]], a student-run [[campus radio]] station, [[KUJH-LP]], an [[independent station]] that primarily broadcasts public affairs programs, and [[KANU-FM|KANU]], the [[NPR]]-affiliated radio station. Kansas Public Radio station KANU was one of the nation's first [[public broadcasting|public radio]] stations. KJHK, the campus radio has roots back to 1952 and is completely run by students.
