'''Jamaica''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Jamaica.ogg|dʒ|ə|ˈ|m|eɪ|k|ə}}) is an [[island country]] situated in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Spanning {{convert|10990|sqkm|sqmi}} in area, it is the third-largest island of the [[Greater Antilles]] and the [[Caribbean]] (after [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]).<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jm.html |title=CIA World Factbook – Jamaica |accessdate=29 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708045958/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jm.html |archive-date=8 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Jamaica lies about {{convert|145|km|mi}} south of Cuba, and {{convert|191|km|mi}} west of Hispaniola (the island containing the countries of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]); the British Overseas Territory of the [[Cayman Islands]] lies some {{convert|215|km|mi}} to the north-west.

Originally inhabited by the indigenous [[Arawak]] and [[Taíno]] peoples, the island came under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] following the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1494. Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity, and the Spanish then forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/> The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]) conquered it, renaming it ''Jamaica''. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farms]] rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian [[Indenture|indentured]] labour to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/>

With {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Jamaica}}|,|}}/1e6 round 1}} million people,{{UN_Population|ref}} Jamaica is the third-most populous [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] country in the [[Americas]] (after the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean. [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] is the country's capital and largest city. The majority of [[Jamaicans]] are of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry, with significant [[White Jamaicans|European]], [[East Asian people|East Asian]] (primarily [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]]), [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Lebanese]], and mixed-race minorities.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/> Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large [[Jamaican diaspora]], particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the [[Rastafari]] religion, [[reggae]] music (and associated genres such as [[Dub music|dub]], [[ska]] and [[dancehall]]), and it is internationally prominent in sports, most notably [[cricket]], [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]] and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]].<ref name="track">{{cite web |title=Athletics in Jamaica |url=http://www.my-island-jamaica.com/athletics_in_jamaica.html |publisher=My island Jamaica |accessdate=11 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818201042/http://www.my-island-jamaica.com/athletics_in_jamaica.html |archive-date=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>"Reggae."

==Etymology==
The [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]], the [[Yamaye]] (also known as the [[Taíno]]), called the island ''Xaymaca'' in an [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language]],<ref>As represented in [[Spanish orthography#Orthography|Old Spanish orthography]], meaning it began with a "[[Esh (letter)|sh]]" sound.</ref> meaning the "Land of Wood and Water" or the "Land of Springs".<ref name=taino>{{cite web |url=http://www.uctp.org/VocesIndigena.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016055722/http://www.uctp.org/VocesIndigena.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |title=Taíno Dictionary |publisher=The United Confederation of Taíno People |accessdate=18 October 2007 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/>

Colloquially, Jamaicans refer to their home island as the "Rock". Slang names such as "Jamrock", "Jamdown" ("Jamdung" in [[Jamaican Patois]]), or briefly "Ja", have derived from this.<ref name="CCLEC">{{cite web |url=https://www.cclec.org/membership/jamaica/ |title=Jamaica - Caribbean Customs Law Enforcement Council |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2018 |publisher= aribbean Customs Law Enforcement Council |access-date=30 June 2020 |quote=Colloquially Jamaicans refer to their home island as the "Rock"..}}</ref>

The English began taking an interest in the island and, following a failed attempt to conquer [[Santo Domingo]] on Hispaniola, [[William Penn (admiral)|Sir William Penn]] and General [[Robert Venables]] led an [[invasion of Jamaica]] in 1655.<ref>*{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Matthew |date=2011 |title=The Sugar Barons}}</ref> Battles at [[Battle of Ocho Rios|Ocho Rios in 1657]] and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo|Rio Nuevo in 1658]] resulted in Spanish defeats; in 1660 the Maroon community under the leadership of [[Juan de Bolas]] switched sides from the Spanish, and began supporting the English.

When the English captured Jamaica, most Spanish colonists fled, with the exception of Spanish Jews, who chose to remain in the island.

Meanwhile, the Spanish made several attempts to re-capture the island, prompting the British to support pirates attacking Spanish ships in the Caribbean; as a result piracy became rampant on Jamaica, with the city of [[Port Royal]] becoming notorious for its lawlessness. Spain later recognised English possession of the island with the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)]].<ref>C.V.

===18th–19th centuries===
[[File:Duperly (1833) Destruction of the Roehampton Estate January 1832.png|thumb|right|A plantation set alight during the Baptist War of 1831–32]]
During the 1700s the economy boomed, based largely on sugar and other crops such as [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[indigo]]. All these crops were worked by black slaves, who lived short and often brutal lives with no rights, being the property of a small planter-class.<ref name="EBJH"/> In the 18th century, slaves ran away and joined the Maroons in increasing numbers, and resulted in The [[First Maroon War]] (1728 – 1739/40), which ended in stalemate. The British government sued for peace, and signed treaties with the Leeward Maroons led by [[Cudjoe]] and [[Accompong]] in 1739, and the Windward Maroons led by [[Quao]] and [[Queen Nanny]] in 1740.<ref>Bev Carey, ''The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490–1880'' (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), p. 315-355.</ref>

By the beginning of the 19th century, Jamaica's dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering white people by a ratio of almost 20 to 1. Although the British had outlawed the importation of slaves, some were still smuggled in from Spanish colonies and directly.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} While planning the abolition of slavery, the British Parliament passed laws to improve conditions for slaves. They banned the use of whips in the field and flogging of women; informed planters that slaves were to be allowed religious instruction, and required a free day during each week when slaves could sell their produce,<ref>''History of the Catholic Church in Jamaica'' {{ISBN|978-0-829-40544-6}} p. 68</ref> prohibiting Sunday markets to enable slaves to attend church.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The House of Assembly in Jamaica resented and resisted the new laws. Members, with membership then restricted to European-Jamaicans, claimed that the slaves were content and objected to Parliament's interference in island affairs. Slave owners feared possible revolts if conditions were lightened.

Over the next 20 years, several epidemics of [[cholera]], [[scarlet fever]], and [[smallpox]] hit the island, killing almost 60,000 people (about 10 per day).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Nevertheless, in 1871 the census recorded a population of 506,154 people, 246,573 of which were males, and 259,581 females.

Unemployment and poverty remained a problem for many Jamaicans. Various movements seeking political change arose as a result, most notably the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] founded by [[Marcus Garvey]] in 1917. As well as seeking greater political rights and an improvement for the condition of workers, Garvey was also a prominent [[Pan-Africanist]] and proponent of the [[Back-to-Africa movement]].<ref name=back>{{cite web|title=Historian situates 'back-to-Africa' movements in broad context|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march1/colonize-030106.html|work=1 March 2006|publisher=Stanford.edu|accessdate=24 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729121919/http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march1/colonize-030106.html|archive-date=29 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> He was also one of the chief inspirations behind [[Rastafari]], a religion founded in Jamaica in the 1930s that combined Christianity with an [[Afrocentric]] theology focused on the figure of [[Haile Selassie]], Emperor of [[Ethiopia]]. Despite occasional persecution, Rastafari grew to become an established faith on the island, later spreading abroad.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s hit Jamaica hard. As part of the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–39]], Jamaica saw numerous strikes, culminating in a strike in 1938 that turned into a full-blown riot.<ref>Hamilton, Janice.

===Post-independence era===
{{Main|Independence of Jamaica}}
Strong economic growth, averaging approximately 6% per annum, marked the first ten years of independence under conservative JLP governments; these were led by successive Prime Ministers [[Alexander Bustamante]], [[Donald Sangster]] (who died of natural causes within two months of taking office) and [[Hugh Shearer]].<ref name="EBJH"/> The growth was fuelled by high levels of private investment in [[bauxite]]/alumina, [[tourism]], the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector. In the [[1967 Jamaican general election]], the JLP were victorious again, winning 33 out of 53 seats, with the PNP taking 20 seats.<ref>Dieter Nohlen (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook'', Volume I, p. 430.</ref>

The optimism of the first decade was accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many Afro-Jamaicans, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor, many of whom ended up living in crime-ridden shanty towns in Kingston.<ref name="EBJH"/> This, combined with the effects of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} led to the voters [[1972 Jamaican general election|electing the PNP]] under [[Michael Manley]] in 1972. The PNP won 37 seats to the JLP's 16.<ref>Dieter Nohlen (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook'', Volume I, p. 430.</ref>

Jamaica's current [[Constitution of Jamaica|constitution]] was drafted in 1962 by a bipartisan joint committee of the Jamaican legislature. It came into force with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962 of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom parliament]], which gave Jamaica independence.<ref name="EBJ"/>

The [[Parliament of Jamaica]] is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], consisting of the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House). Members of the House (known as Members of Parliament or ''MPs'') are directly elected, and the member of the House of Representatives who, in the governor-general's best judgement, is best able to command the confidence of a majority of the members of that House, is appointed by the governor-general to be the prime minister. Senators are nominated jointly by the prime minister and the parliamentary [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] and are then appointed by the governor-general.<ref name="EBJ"/>

The [[Judiciary of Jamaica]] operates on a [[common law]] system derived from [[English law]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] precedents.<ref name="EBJ"/> The court of final appeal is the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], though during the 2000s parliament attempted to replace it with the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Political parties and elections===
Jamaica has traditionally had a [[two-party system]], with power often alternating between the [[People's National Party]] (PNP) and [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP).<ref name="EBJ"/> The party with current administrative and legislative power is the Jamaica Labour Party, after its 2020 victory. There are also several minor parties who have yet to gain a seat in parliament; the largest of these is the [[National Democratic Movement (Jamaica)|National Democratic Movement]] (NDM).

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Parishes of Jamaica}}

Jamaica is divided into 14 [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], which are grouped into three historic [[Counties of Jamaica|counties]] that have no administrative relevance.<ref name="EBJ"/>

In the context of [[local government]] the parishes are designated "Local Authorities". These local authorities are further styled as "Municipal Corporations", which are either city municipalities or town municipalities.<ref name="localgovernemtn">{{cite web |title=Local Government Act, 2015 |url=http://www.localauthorities.gov.jm/sites/default/files/resources/local_governance_bill_2015.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913220934/http://localauthorities.gov.jm/sites/default/files/resources/local_governance_bill_2015.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 September 2016 |website=localauthorities.gov.jm |accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref> Any new city municipality must have a population of at least 50,000, and a town municipality a number set by the Minister of Local Government.<ref name="localgovernemtn"/> There are currently no town municipalities.

The local governments of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrews are consolidated as the city municipality of Kingston & St. Andrew Municipal Corporation. The newest city municipality created is the Municipality of Portmore in 2003. While it is geographically located within the parish of St. Catherine, it is governed independently.

===Military===
{{Main|Jamaica Defence Force}}
[[File:FN FAL DA-SD-04-01067.jpg|thumb|right|Jamaican soldiers training to fire the [[FN FAL]] in 2002]]
The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) is the small but professional military force of Jamaica.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/> The JDF is based on the British military model with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending on the arm of service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at Up Park Camp or JDF Training Depot, Newcastle, both in St. Andrew. As with the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as they rise up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The JDF is directly descended from the British Army's [[West India Regiment]] formed during the colonial era.<ref name="jdfhistory">{{cite web|title=Jamaica Defense Force History|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background2.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025200223/http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background2.php|archive-date=25 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The West India Regiment was used extensively by the British Empire in policing the empire from 1795 to 1926. Other units in the JDF heritage include the early colonial Jamaica Militia, the Kingston Infantry Volunteers of WWI and reorganised into the Jamaican Infantry Volunteers in World War II. The West Indies Regiment was reformed in 1958 as part of the [[West Indies Federation]], after dissolution of the Federation the JDF was established.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) comprises an [[The Jamaica Regiment|infantry Regiment]] and Reserve Corps, an Air Wing, a Coast Guard fleet and a supporting Engineering Unit.<ref name="JDFstructure">{{cite web|title=Jamaica Defense Force General Information|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background3.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025200228/http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background3.php|archive-date=25 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The infantry regiment contains the 1st, 2nd and 3rd (National Reserve) battalions. The JDF Air Wing is divided into three flight units, a training unit, a support unit and the JDF Air Wing (National Reserve). The Coast Guard is divided between seagoing crews and support crews who conduct maritime safety and maritime law enforcement as well as defence-related operations.<ref name="cgroles">{{cite web|title=JDF Coast Guard Roles|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/Units/coast_guard/cg_roles.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104441/http://www.jdfmil.org/Units/coast_guard/cg_roles.php|archive-date=11 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The role of the support battalion is to provide support to boost numbers in combat and issue competency training in order to allow for the readiness of the force.<ref name="csbattalion">{{cite web|title=The Combat Support Battalion (Cbt Sp Bn)|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/Units/combat_Support/CSB_home.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008022534/http://jdfmil.org/Units/combat_Support/CSB_home.php|archive-date=8 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 1st Engineer Regiment was formed due to an increased demand for military engineers and their role is to provide engineering services whenever and wherever they are needed.<ref name="engineerhistory">{{cite web|title=1st Engineering Regiment History|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/Units/engineers/er_history.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=11 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104425/http://www.jdfmil.org/Units/engineers/er_history.php|archive-date=11 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Headquarters JDF contains the JDF Commander, Command Staff as well as Intelligence, Judge Advocate office, Administrative and Procurement sections.<ref name="jdfhq">{{cite web|title=Headquarters Jamaica Defence Force (HQ JDF)|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/Units/hq_jdf/hqjdf_home.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=11 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125090433/http://jdfmil.org/Units/hq_jdf/hqjdf_home.php|archive-date=25 November 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In recent years the JDF has been called on to assist the nation's police, the [[Jamaica Constabulary Force]] (JCF), in fighting drug smuggling and a rising crime rate which includes one of the highest murder rates in the world. JDF units actively conduct armed patrols with the JCF in high-crime areas and known gang neighbourhoods. There has been vocal controversy as well as support of this JDF role. In early 2005, an Opposition leader, [[Edward Seaga]], called for the merger of the JDF and JCF. This has not garnered support in either organisation nor among the majority of citizens.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In 2017, Jamaica signed the UN [[treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;– No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=16 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806220546/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |archive-date=6 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Among the variety of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems are dry and wet limestone forests, rainforest, riparian woodland, wetlands, caves, rivers, seagrass beds and coral reefs. The authorities have recognised the tremendous significance and potential of the environment and have designated some of the more 'fertile' areas as 'protected'. Among the island's protected areas are the [[Cockpit Country]], [[Jamaican dry forests|Hellshire Hills]], and Litchfield forest reserves. In 1992, Jamaica's first marine park, covering nearly {{convert|15|km2|sqmi}}, was established in [[Montego Bay]]. [[Portland Bight Protected Area]] was designated in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/csi/act/jamaica/jamai2.htm |title=CSI Activities (Portland Bight, Jamaica) |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=20 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309111105/http://www.unesco.org/csi/act/jamaica/jamai2.htm |archive-date=9 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The following year [[Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park]] was created, covering roughly {{convert|300|mi2|km2}} of a wilderness area which supports thousands of tree and fern species and rare animals.

There are several small islands off Jamaica's coast, most notably those in [[Portland Bight]] such as [[Pigeon Island (Jamaica)|Pigeon Island]], [[Salt Island (Jamaica)|Salt Island]], [[Dolphin Island (Jamaica)|Dolphin Island]], [[Long Island (Jamaica)|Long Island]], [[Great Goat Island]] and [[Little Goat Island]], and also [[Lime Cay]] located further east.

Jamaica's climate is tropical, supporting diverse ecosystems with a wealth of plants and animals. Its plant life has changed considerably over the centuries; when the Spanish arrived in 1494, except for small agricultural clearings, the country was deeply forested. The European settlers cut down the great timber trees for building and ships' supplies, and cleared the plains, savannas, and mountain slopes for intense agricultural cultivation.<ref name="EBJ"/> Many new plants were introduced including sugarcane, bananas, and citrus trees.<ref name="EBJ"/>

Today, however, Jamaica is now the home to about 3,000 species of [[flowering plant|native flowering plants]] (of which over 1,000 are [[endemism|endemic]] and 200 are species of [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]), thousands of species of non-flowering flora, and about 20 [[botanical garden]]s, some of which are several hundred years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0021.html |title=Jamaica's Botantical{{sic|hide=y}} Gardens Worth More Than Gold |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Jamaica Gleaner |publisher=Jamaica Gleaner Newspaper |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130103325/http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0021.html |archive-date=30 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Aiken, Wilson, Vogel, Garraway PhD |first=Karl, Byron, Peter, Eric |date=21 January 2007 |title=LETTER OF THE DAY: Biologists speak on Cockpit mining |url=https://www.mona.uwi.edu/lifesciences/cockpit.htm |work=University of the West Indies |location=University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712155740/http://www.mona.uwi.edu/lifesciences/cockpit.htm |archive-date=12 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Areas of heavy rainfall also contain stands of bamboo, ferns, ebony, mahogany, and rosewood. Cactus and similar dry-area plants are found along the south and southwest coastal area. Parts of the west and southwest consist of large grasslands, with scattered stands of trees.

Jamaican's fauna, typical of the [[Caribbean]], includes highly diversified wildlife with many endemic species. As with other oceanic islands, land mammals are mostly several species of [[bat]]s of which at least three endemic species are found only in [[Cockpit Country]], one of which is at-risk. Other species of bat include the [[Jamaican fig-eating bat|fig-eating]] and [[lasiurus|hairy-tailed bats]]. The only non-bat native mammal extant in Jamaica is the [[Jamaican hutia]], locally known as the coney.<ref name="EBJ"/> Introduced mammals such as [[wild boar]] and the [[small Asian mongoose]] are also common.

One species of freshwater turtle is native to Jamaica, the [[Jamaican slider]]. It is found only on Jamaica and on a few islands in [[the Bahamas]]. In addition, many types of frogs are common on the island, especially [[treefrog]]s. Beautiful and exotic birds, such as the can be found among a large number of others.

Jamaican waters contain considerable resources of fresh-and saltwater fish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/Country/CountryChecklist.php?c_code=388&vhabitat=all2&csub_code= |title=All fishes reported from Jamaica |work=fishbase.org |access-date=14 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909194629/http://www.fishbase.org/Country/CountryChecklist.php?c_code=388&vhabitat=all2&csub_code= |archive-date=9 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The chief varieties of saltwater fish are [[King mackerel|kingfish]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[mackerel]], [[Whiting (fish)|whiting]], [[bonito]], and [[tuna]].

=== Aquatic life ===
Coral reef ecosystems are important because they provide people with a source of livelihood, food, recreation, and medicinal compounds and protect the land on which they live.<ref name=":03">{{cite journal |last=Edwards |first=Peter E.T. |date=March 2009 |title=Sustainable financing for ocean and coastal management in Jamaica: The potential for revenues from tourist user fees |journal=Marine Policy |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=376–385 |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2008.08.005 |url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/14769/1/MPRA_paper_14769.pdf |access-date=24 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922024647/https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/14769/1/MPRA_paper_14769.pdf |archive-date=22 September 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Jamaica relies on the ocean and its ecosystem for its development. However, the marine life in Jamaica is also being affected. There could be many factors that contribute to marine life not having the best health. Jamaica's geological origin, topographical features and seasonal high rainfall make it susceptible to a range of natural hazards that can affect the coastal and oceanic environments. These include storm surge, slope failures (landslides), earthquakes, floods and hurricanes.<ref name=":22">{{cite web |url=http://nepa.gov.jm/symposia_03/Policies/OceanandCoastalZoneManagementPolicy.pdf |title=Toward Developing a National Policy on Ocean and Coastal Zone Management |date=June 2000 |website=nepa.gov.jm |access-date=2018-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225031022/http://nepa.gov.jm/symposia_03/Policies/OceanandCoastalZoneManagementPolicy.pdf |archive-date=25 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Coral reefs in the Negril Marine Park (NMP), Jamaica, have been increasingly impacted by nutrient pollution and macroalgal blooms following decades of intensive development as a major tourist destination.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225357464 |title=Sewage pollution in Negril, Jamaica: Effects on nutrition and ecology of coral reef macroalgae |date=July 2011 |journal=Chinese Journal of Oceanology and Limnology |volume=29 |issue=4 |page=775 |access-date=2018-12-16 |bibcode=2011ChJOL..29..775L |last1=Lapointe |first1=B.

The Jamaican tourism industry accounts for 32% of total employment and 36% of the country's GDP and is largely based on the sun, sea and sand, the last two of these attributes being dependent on healthy coral reef ecosystems.<ref name=":03" /> Because of Jamaica's tourism, they have developed a study to see if the tourist would be willing to help financially to manage their marine ecosystem because Jamaica alone is unable to. The ocean connects all the countries all over the world, however, everyone and everything is affecting the flow and life in the ocean. Jamaica is a very touristy place specifically because of their beaches. If their oceans are not functioning at their best then the well-being of Jamaica and the people who live there will start to deteriorate. According to the OECD, oceans contribute $1.5 trillion annually in value-added to the overall economy.<ref name=":12">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment/brief/oceans|title=Oceans, Fisheries and Coastal Economies|website=World Bank|access-date=2018-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225030929/http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment/brief/oceans|archive-date=25 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A developing country on an island will get the majority of their revenue from their ocean.

=== Pollution ===
Pollution comes from run-off, sewage systems, and garbage. However, this typically all ends up in the ocean after there is rain or floods. Everything that ends up in the water changes the quality and balance of the ocean. Poor coastal water quality has adversely affected fisheries, tourism and mariculture, as well as undermining biological sustainability of the living resources of ocean and coastal habitats.<ref name=":22" /> Jamaica imports and exports many goods through their waters. Some of the imports that go into Jamaica include petroleum and petroleum products. Issues include accidents at sea; risk of spills through local and international transport of petroleum and petroleum products.<ref name=":22" /> Oil spills can disrupt the marine life because the chemicals that are being spilled that should not be there. Oil and water do not mix. Unfortunately oil spills is not the only form of pollution that occurs in Jamaica. Solid waste disposal mechanisms in Jamaica are currently inadequate.<ref name=":22" /> The solid waste gets into the water through rainfall forces. Solid waste is also harmful to wildlife, particularly birds, fish and turtles that feed at the surface of the water and mistake floating debris for food.<ref name=":22" /> For example, plastic can be caught around birds and turtles necks making it difficult to eat and breath as they begin to grow causing the plastic to get tighter around their necks. Pieces of plastic, metal, and glass can be mistaken for the food fish eat. Each Jamaican generates 1&nbsp;kg (2&nbsp;lbs) of waste per day; only 70% of this is collected by National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) — the remaining 30% is either burnt or disposed of in gullies/waterways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/consultative_process/documents/6_davis.pdf |title=MARINE DEBRIS: JAMAICA'S RESPONSE |date=6–10 June 2005 |website=www.un.org |access-date=2018-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107223159/https://www.un.org/Depts/los/consultative_process/documents/6_davis.pdf |archive-date=7 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Environmental policies ===
There are policies that are being put into place to help preserve the ocean and the life below water. The goal of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is to improve the quality of life of human communities who depend on coastal resources while maintaining the biological diversity and productivity of coastal ecosystems.<ref name=":22" /> Developing an underdeveloped country can impact the oceans ecosystem because of all the construction that would be done to develop the country. Over-building, driven by powerful market forces as well as poverty among some sectors of the population, and destructive exploitation contribute to the decline of ocean and coastal resources.<ref name=":22" /> Developing practices that will contribute to the lives of the people but also to the life of the ocean and its ecosystem. Some of these practices include: Develop sustainable fisheries practices, ensure sustainable mariculture techniques and practices, sustainable management of shipping, and promote sustainable tourism practices.<ref name=":22" /> As for tourism, tourism is the number one source of foreign exchange earnings in Jamaica and, as such is vital to the national economy.<ref name=":22" /> Tourist typically go to countries unaware of issues and how they impact those issues. Tourist are not going to be used to living in a different style compared to their own country. Practices such as: provide sewage treatment facilities for all tourist areas, determine carrying capacity of the environment prior to planning tourism activities, provide alternative types of tourist activities can help to get desired results such as the development of alternative tourism which will reduce the current pressure on resources that support traditional tourism activities.<ref name=":22" /> A study was conducted to see how tourist could help with sustainable financing for ocean and coastal management in Jamaica. Instead of using tourist fees they would call them environmental fees. This study aims to inform the relevant stakeholders of the feasibility of implementing environmental fees as well as the likely impact of such revenue generating instruments on the current tourist visitation rates to the island.<ref name=":03" /> The development of a user fee system would help fund environmental management and protection. The results show that tourists have a high consumer surplus associated with a vacation in Jamaica, and have a significantly lower willingness to pay for a tourism tax when compared to an environmental tax. The findings of the study show that the "label" of the tax and as well as the respondent's awareness of the institutional mechanisms for environmental protection and tourism are important to their decision framework.<ref name=":03" /> Tourist are more willing to pay for environmental fees rather than tourist tax fees. A tax high enough to fund for environmental management and protection but low enough to continue to bring tourist to Jamaica. It has been shows that if an environmental tax of $1 per person were introduced it would not cause a significant decline in visitation rates and would generate revenues of US$1.7M.<ref name=":03" />

Later, they would be followed by ambitious businessmen who spent time between their great country estates in Scotland and the island. As a result, many of the slave owning plantations on the island were owned by Scottish men, and thus a large number of mixed-race Jamaicans can claim Scottish ancestry. High immigration from Scotland continued until well after independence.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Today, notable Scottish-Jamaicans include the businessman John Pringle, former American Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], and American actress [[Kerry Washington]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Leask |first=David |date=10 October 2005 |title=Jamaica: the country with more Campbells per head of population than Scotland |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13839601.jamaica-the-country-with-more-campbells-per-head-of-population-than-scotland/ |work=Herald Scotland |access-date=28 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129010219/https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13839601.jamaica-the-country-with-more-campbells-per-head-of-population-than-scotland/ |archive-date=29 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The two exist in a dialect continuum, with speakers using a different register of speech depending on context and whom they are speaking to. 'Pure' Patois, though sometimes seen as merely a particularly aberrant dialect of English, is essentially mutually unintelligible with standard English and is best thought of a separate language.<ref name="EBJ"/> A 2007 survey by the Jamaican Language Unit found that 17.1 percent of the population were [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] in Jamaican Standard English (JSE), 36.5 percent were monolingual in Patois, and 46.4 percent were bilingual, although earlier surveys had pointed to a greater degree of bilinguality (up to 90 percent).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jettka |first=Daniel |date=2010 |title=English in Jamaica: The Coexistence of Standard Jamaican English and the English-based Jamaican Creole |url=http://www.daniel-jettka.de/pdf/JETTKA-The_language_situation_of_Jamaica.pdf |journal=Hamburg Centre for Language Corpora |publisher=[[Hamburg University]] |access-date=31 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115010332/http://www.daniel-jettka.de/pdf/JETTKA-The_language_situation_of_Jamaica.pdf |archive-date=15 November 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Jamaican education system has only recently begun to offer formal instruction in Patois, while retaining JSE as the "official language of instruction".<ref>Claude Robinson (30 March 2014).

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Jamaica}}
Though a small nation, Jamaican culture has a strong global presence. The musical genres [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[mento]], [[rocksteady]], [[Dub music|dub]], and, more recently, [[dancehall]] and [[ragga]] all originated in the island's vibrant, popular urban recording industry.<ref>Dave Thompson (2002) ''Reggae and Caribbean Music''. Backbeat Books. p. 261. {{ISBN|0879306556}}.</ref> These have themselves gone on to influence numerous other genres, such as [[punk rock]] (through reggae and ska), [[dub poetry]], [[New wave music|New Wave]], [[2 Tone (music genre)|two-tone]], [[reggaeton]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]], [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]], [[Grime (music genre)|grime]] and American [[Hip hop music|rap]] music. Some rappers, such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Heavy D]], are of Jamaican descent.

[[Bob Marley]] is probably the best known Jamaican musician; with his band [[The Wailers]] he had a string of hits in 1960s–70s, popularising reggae internationally and going on to sell millions of records.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/news/bob-marley-biography-facts |title=7 Fascinating Facts About Bob Marley |accessdate=10 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010155428/https://www.biography.com/news/bob-marley-biography-facts |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Toynbee2013">{{cite book |first=Jason |last=Toynbee |title=Bob Marley: Herald of a Postcolonial World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkDohE6Qd3oC&pg=PA1969 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |date=8 May 2013 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-7456-5737-0 |pages=1969– |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012235034/http://books.google.com/books?id=BkDohE6Qd3oC&pg=PA1969 |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many other internationally known artists were born in Jamaica, including [[Toots Hibbert]], [[Millie Small]], [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]], [[Gregory Isaacs]], [[Half Pint]], [[Protoje]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Bunny Wailer]], [[Big Youth]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Dennis Brown]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Beres Hammond]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Shabba Ranks]], [[Super Cat]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Sean Paul]], [[I Wayne]], [[Bounty Killer]] and many others.

===Literature===
{{Main|Jamaican literature}}

The journalist and author [[H. G. de Lisser]] (1878–1944) used his native country as the setting for his many novels.<ref name=Hughes>Michael Hughes, "De Lisser, Herbert G.", ''A Companion to West Indian Literature'', Collins, 1979, pp. 40–42.</ref> Born in [[Falmouth, Jamaica]], de Lisser worked as a reporter for the ''[[Jamaica Times]]'' at a young age and in 1920 began publishing the magazine ''[[Planters' Punch]]''. ''The White Witch of Rosehall'' is one of his better-known novels. He was named Honorary President of the Jamaican Press Association; he worked throughout his professional career to promote the Jamaican sugar industry.

[[Roger Mais]] (1905 – 1955), a journalist, poet, and playwright wrote many short stories, plays, and novels, including ''The Hills Were Joyful Together'' (1953), ''Brother Man'' (1954), and ''Black Lightning'' (1955).<ref name="Hawthorne 7">Hawthorne, Evelyn J. "The Writer and the Nationalist Model", ''Roger Mais and the Decolonization of Caribbean Culture'', NY: Peter Lang, 1989, p. 7.</ref>

[[Ian Fleming]] (1908 – 1964), who had a home in Jamaica where he spent considerable time, repeatedly used the island as a setting in his [[James Bond]] novels, including ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Doctor No]]'', "[[For Your Eyes Only (short story)|For Your Eyes Only]]", ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ian Fleming International Airport opened in Jamaica!|url=http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/news/index.asp?NewsID=128|work=News & Press|publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]]|accessdate=14 December 2011|date=17 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722035913/http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/news/index.asp?NewsID=128|archivedate=22 July 2012}}</ref> In addition, James Bond uses a Jamaica-based cover in ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. So far, the only James Bond film adaptation to have been set in Jamaica is ''[[Dr. No (film)|Doctor No]]''. Filming for the fictional island of [[James Bond locations#Locations depicted in films|San Monique]] in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' took place in Jamaica.

[[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]] (1970), novelist has published three novels: ''John Crow's Devil'' (2005), ''[[The Book of Night Women]]'' (2009) and ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'' (2014), winner of the 2015 [[Man Booker Prize]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/magazine/from-jamaica-to-minnesota-to-myself.html|title=From Jamaica to Minnesota to Myself|last=James|first=Marlon|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 March 2015|access-date=27 June 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731160335/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/magazine/from-jamaica-to-minnesota-to-myself.html|archive-date=31 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Usain Bolt after 200 m final Beijing 2015.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Usain Bolt]] is one of the most prominent sprinters in the world]]
Since independence Jamaica has consistently produced world class athletes in track and field.<ref name=track /> In Jamaica involvement in athletics begins at a very young age and most high schools maintain rigorous athletics programs with their top athletes competing in national competitions (most notably the VMBS Girls and Boys Athletics Championships) and international meets (most notably the [[Penn Relays]]). In Jamaica it is not uncommon for young athletes to attain press coverage and national fame long before they arrive on the international athletics stage.

Over the past six decades Jamaica has produced dozens of world class sprinters including Olympic and World Champion [[Usain Bolt]], world record holder in the 100m for men at 9.58s, and 200m for men at 19.19s. Other noteworthy Jamaican sprinters include [[Arthur Wint]], the first Jamaican Olympic gold medalist; [[Donald Quarrie]], [[Elaine Thompson]] double Olympic champion from Rio 2016 in the 100m and 200m, Olympic Champion and former 200m world record holder; [[Roy Anthony Bridge]], part of the International Olympic Committee; [[Merlene Ottey]]; [[Delloreen Ennis-London]]; [[Shelly-Ann Fraser|Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]], the former World and two time Olympic 100m Champion; [[Kerron Stewart]]; [[Aleen Bailey]]; [[Juliet Cuthbert]]; three-time Olympic gold medalist; [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]]; [[Sherone Simpson]]; [[Brigitte Foster-Hylton]]; [[Yohan Blake]]; [[Herb McKenley]]; [[George Rhoden]], Olympic gold medalist; [[Deon Hemmings]], Olympic gold medalist; as well as [[Asafa Powell]], former 100m world record holder and 2x 100m Olympic finalist and gold medal winner in the men's 2008 Olympic 4 × 100 m. American Olympic winner [[Sanya Richards-Ross]] was also born in Jamaica.

Jamaica has also produced several world class amateur and professional boxers including [[Trevor Berbick]] and [[Mike McCallum]]. First-generation Jamaican athletes have continued to make a significant impact on the sport internationally, especially in the United Kingdom where the list of top British boxers born in Jamaica or of Jamaican parents includes [[Lloyd Honeyghan]], [[Chris Eubank]], [[Audley Harrison]], [[David Haye]], [[Lennox Lewis]] and [[Frank Bruno]], [[Donovan Ruddock|Donovan "Razor" Ruddock]], [[Mike Tyson]], and [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], whose maternal grandfather is Jamaican.<ref>{{YouTube|gEAIWUxecvk|Floyd Mayweather is a Jamaican Yardie (big tings)}}</ref>

[[Association football]] and [[horse-racing]] are other popular sports in Jamaica. The [[Jamaica National Football Team|national football team]] qualified for the 1998 [[FIFA World Cup]]. Horse racing was Jamaica's first sport. It was brought in the 1700s by British immigrants to satisfy their longing for their favorite pastime back at home. During slavery, the Afro-Jamaican slaves were considered the best horse jockeys. Today, horse racing provides jobs for about 20,000 people including horse breeders, groomers, and trainers. Also, several Jamaicans are known internationally for their success in horse racing including Richard DePass, who once held the Guinness Book of World Records for the most wins in a day, Canadian awards winner George HoSang, and American award winners Charlie Hussey, Andrew Ramgeet, and Barrington Harvey. Also, there are hundreds of Jamaicans who are employed in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom as exercise riders and groomers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tortello |first=Dr. Rebecca |title=Jamaican Horse racing History: The sport of kings |url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0078.html |work=Jamaica Gleaner |location=Jamaica |access-date=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207044649/http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0078.html |archive-date=7 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Jamaica}}

The emancipation of the slaves heralded the establishment of an education system for the masses. Prior to emancipation there were few schools for educating locals and many sent their children off to England to access quality education.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} After emancipation the West Indian Commission granted a sum of money to establish Elementary Schools, now known as ''All Age Schools''. Most of these schools were established by the churches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/education/html/20041212T090000-0500_4438_JIS_MORAVIAN_CHURCH_CONTRIBUTING_MUCH_TO_EDUCATION.asp |title=Moravian Church Contribution to Education in Jamaica |accessdate=22 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123064227/http://www.jis.gov.jm/education/html/20041212T090000-0500_4438_JIS_MORAVIAN_CHURCH_CONTRIBUTING_MUCH_TO_EDUCATION.asp |archivedate=23 November 2007}}</ref> This was the genesis of the modern Jamaican school system.

Presently the following categories of schools exist:
* '''Early childhood''' – Basic, infant and privately operated pre-school. Age cohort: 2 – 5 years.
* '''Primary''' – Publicly and privately owned (privately owned being called preparatory schools). Ages 3 – 12 years.
* '''Secondary''' – Publicly and privately owned. Ages 10 – 19 years. The high schools in Jamaica may be either single-sex or co-educational institutions, and many schools follow the traditional [[Sixth form|English grammar school model]] used throughout the British West Indies.
* '''Tertiary''' – Community colleges; teachers' colleges, with the Mico Teachers' College (now The MICO University College) being the oldest, founded in 1836; the Shortwood Teachers' College (which was once an all-female teacher training institution); vocational training centres, colleges and universities, publicly and privately owned. There are five local universities: the [[University of the West Indies]] (Mona Campus); the [[University of Technology, Jamaica]], formerly The College of Art Science and Technology (CAST); the [[Northern Caribbean University]], formerly West Indies College; the [[University of the Commonwealth Caribbean]], formerly the University College of The Caribbean; and the [[International University of the Caribbean]].
Additionally, there are many community and teacher training colleges.

Education is free from the early childhood to secondary levels. There are also opportunities for those who cannot afford further education in the vocational arena, through the Human Employment and Resource Training-National Training Agency (HEART Trust-NTA) programme,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moec.gov.jm/news/speeches/ict2003.htm |title=Transforming the Jamaican Education System |accessdate=22 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520221921/http://www.moec.gov.jm/news/speeches/ict2003.htm |archivedate=20 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> which is opened to all working age national population<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=JAM | title=Vocational Education in Jamaica | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | date=August 2012 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010330/http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=JAM | archive-date=28 May 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> and through an extensive scholarship network for the various universities.

Students are taught Spanish in school from the primary level upwards; about 40–45% of educated people in Jamaica knows some form of Spanish.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Jamaica has a wide variety of industrial and commercial activities. The [[aviation]] industry is able to perform most routine aircraft maintenance, except for heavy structural repairs. There is a considerable amount of technical support for transport and agricultural aviation. Jamaica has a considerable amount of [[industrial engineering]], [[light manufacturing]], including [[metal fabrication]], metal roofing, and furniture [[manufacturing]]. Food and [[beverage]] processing, [[glassware]] manufacturing, [[software]] and [[data processing]], [[printing]] and [[publishing]], [[insurance]] underwriting, [[music]] and recording, and advanced [[education]] activities can be found in the larger urban areas. The Jamaican [[construction industry]] is entirely self-sufficient, with professional technical standards and guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0070.htm |title=History of Aviation in Jamaica: Part I |publisher=Jamaica-gleaner.com |accessdate=4 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717101044/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0070.htm |archivedate=17 July 2009}}</ref>

Since the first quarter of 2006, the economy of Jamaica has undergone a period of staunch growth. With inflation for the 2006 calendar year down to 6.0% and unemployment down to 8.9%, the nominal GDP grew by an unprecedented 2.9%.<ref>[http://www.statinja.com/ Statistical Institute of Jamaica<!-- bot-generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417202235/https://www.statinja.com/ |date=17 April 2018 }} at www.statinja.com</ref> An investment programme in island transportation and utility infrastructure and gains in the tourism, mining, and service sectors all contributed this figure.

In 2006, Jamaica became part of the [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]] Single Market and Economy [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy|(CSME)]] as one of the pioneering members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://caricom.org/media-center/communications/press-releases/statement-prime-minister-dr-keith-rowley-on-csme |title=Statement – Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley on CSME |publisher=CARICOM}}</ref>

The global economic downturn had a significant impact on the Jamaican economy for the years 2007 to 2009, resulting in negative economic growth. The government implemented a new Debt Management Initiative, the Jamaica Debt Exchange (JDX) on 14 January 2010. The initiative would see holders of Government of Jamaica (GOJ) bonds returning the high interest earning instruments for bonds with lower yields and longer maturities. The offer was taken up by over 95% of local financial institutions and was deemed a success by the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Jamaica-Debt-Exchange-40043 |title=Jamaica Debt Exchange |publisher=IMF |access-date=22 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222095221/https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Jamaica-Debt-Exchange-40043 |archive-date=22 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

This project has so far seen the completion of {{convert|33|km|mi}} of freeway.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Railways====
{{main|Railways of Jamaica}}

Railways in Jamaica no longer enjoy the prominent position they once did, having been largely replaced by roadways as the primary means of transport.

In addition there are local commuter airports at [[Tinson Pen Aerodrome|Tinson Pen (Kingston)]], [[Port Antonio]], and [[Negril]], which cater to internal flights only. Many other small, rural centres are served by private airstrips on sugar estates or bauxite mines.<ref name="EBJ"/>

====Ports, shipping and lighthouses====
{{see also|Lighthouses in Jamaica}}

Owing to its location in the Caribbean Sea in the [[sea lane|shipping lane]] to the [[Panama Canal]] and relative proximity to large markets in North America and [[emerging market]]s in Latin America, Jamaica receives much traffic of [[Containerization|shipping containers]].

Jamaica imports approximately {{convert|80000|oilbbl}} of oil energy products per day,<ref name="pcj.com"/> including asphalt and lubrication products. Just 20% of imported fuels are used for road transportation, the rest being used by the bauxite industry, electricity generation, and aviation. 30,000 barrels/day of crude imports are processed into various motor fuels and asphalt by the Petrojam Refinery in Kingston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petrojam.com/about-us/corporate-fact-sheet |title=Corporate Fact Sheet &#124; Petrojam Limited |publisher=Petrojam.com |accessdate=2017-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415220606/http://www.petrojam.com/about-us/corporate-fact-sheet |archive-date=15 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Jamaica produces enormous quantities of [[hydrous ethanol|drinking alcohol]] (at least 5% water content), most of which appears to be consumed as beverages, and none used as motor fuel.

The country's two mobile operators – [[Flow (brand)|FLOW Jamaica]] (formerly LIME, bMobile and Cable and Wireless Jamaica) and [[Digicel|Digicel Jamaica]] have spent millions in network upgrades and expansion. The newest operator, Digicel was granted a licence in 2001 to operate mobile services in the newly liberalised telecom market that had once been the sole domain of the incumbent FLOW (then Cable and Wireless Jamaica) monopoly. Digicel opted for the more widely used [[GSM]] wireless system, while a past operator, Oceanic (which became Claro Jamaica and later merged with Digicel Jamaica in 2011) opted for the [[CDMA]] standard. FLOW (formerly "LIME" – pre-[[Columbus Communications]] merger) which had begun with [[Digital AMPS|TDMA]] standard, subsequently upgraded to GSM in 2002, decommissioned TDMA in 2006 and only utilised that standard until 2009 when LIME launched its 3G network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwc.com/assets/uploads/files/Press%20Releases/3g%20launch%20in%20jamaica.pdf |title=LIME 3G launch in 2009 |access-date=23 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625182344/http://www.cwc.com/assets/uploads/files/Press%20Releases/3g%20launch%20in%20jamaica.pdf |archive-date=25 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Both operators currently provide islandwide coverage with HSPA+ (3G) technology.
