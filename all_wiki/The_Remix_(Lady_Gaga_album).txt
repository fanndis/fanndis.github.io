Chuck Campbell from the ''[[California Chronic]]le'' felt that the main "trick" adopted by the producers behind ''The Remix'', was to preserve the integrity of Gaga's nuances in her songs, at the same time bringing something new to her music.<ref name="cc">{{cite news|url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/148477122|title=Lady Gaga prevails through makeovers|last=Campbell|first=Chuck|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=August 12, 2010|work=[[California Chronic]]le|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055828/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/148477122|archivedate=March 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The second song in the track list, the "LLG vs GLG Radio Mix" of "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", features a computerized chanting of the "mum-mum-mum-mah" [[hook (music)|hook]] of the song.<ref name="cc" /> [[Stuart Price]] remixed "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]" into an electronic version, changing the original mid-tempo composition of the song.<ref name="cc" /> New vocals were added on top of the song, giving it a jungle-like vibe, according to Nicki Escuerdo from ''[[Phoenix New Times]]''.<ref name="phoenix" /> She also felt that the remix of "[[LoveGame]]" featuring Manson, changed the original composition by "giving the originally innocent and fun song an almost demonic quality".<ref name="phoenix" />

According to Campbell, The Monarchy Stylites remix of "Dance in the Dark" "pump[ed] extra oomph" into the song, with addition of drum beats.<ref name="cc" /> [[Richard Vission]]'s remix of "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" introduced an elastic [[rhythm]] in the song, while [[Frankmusik]] changed the soft composition of "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]" to a more upbeat one, also manipulating Gaga's vocals in the process.<ref name="cc" /><ref name="phoenix" /> Campbell also added that the [[Passion Pit]] remix of "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" felt like a "theatrical set up for a song that feels like it's going somewhere, but never does";<ref name="cc" /> the remix consists of synths, with a thumping beat accompanying the song.<ref name="phoenix" /> Sound of Arrows remixed "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]", changing the dark nature of its music into a bright, summery jam while "[[Bad Romance]]" was remixed by [[Starsmith]], making it a complete dance track.<ref name="phoenix" />

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] gave the album three out of five stars, but felt that the track list could have been shortened.
