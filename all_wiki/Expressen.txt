A project of [[Albert Bonnier Jr.]], [[Carl-Adam Nycop]], and [[Ivar Harrie]] – who was to become the first editor-in-chief – Expressen was created in part to push back against "[[national socialism]] and related violent ideologies."<ref>{{cite web |title=Expressens historia |url=https://www.expressen.se/om-expressen/expressens-historia/ |website=Expressen |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref>

The paper is owned by the [[Bonnier Group]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert G.

Through mergers, the [[Gothenburg]] edition of ''Expressen'' is titled ''[[#GT|GT]]'' (originally ''Göteborgs-Tidningen'') and the [[Malmö]] edition is titled ''[[#Kvällsposten|Kvällsposten]]'', but the three share half of the content. ''Expressen'' (with ''GT'' and ''Kvällsposten'') maintains a [[centre-right]] political profile, describing its editorial position as "independent [[liberalism|liberal]]", while the competitor ''Aftonbladet'' is [[social democracy|social-democratic]]. Ownership of ''Expressen'' (and Sweden's largest morning newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'') is controlled by the [[Bonnier family]], while ''Aftonbladet'' is owned jointly by Swedish trade unions and the Norwegian publishing family [[Schibsted]].
