{{Politics of China |expanded = Presidency }}

The '''president of the People's Republic of China'''<!--Please do not add Chinese characters. They are already on the infobox.--> is the [[head of state]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]], the [[Paramount leader|top leader]] in the [[One-party state|one party system]]. The presidency is officially regarded as [[Government of the People's Republic of China|an institution of the state]] rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on his own prerogative.{{NoteTag|The presidency is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the Premier.}} The current president is [[Xi Jinping]], who took office in March 2013.

When the current [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution was adopted in 1982]], the presidency was designed as a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]], with actual power concentrated on the [[Paramount leader]], who controlled the Party and the military. However, Presidents [[Li Xiannian]] (1983–1988) and [[Yang Shangkun]] (1988–1993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership, with their powers of [[Eight Elders]], but not the presidencies.<ref>MacFarquhar, Roderick. "Foreword" in Zhao Ziyang (2009). Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Zhao Ziyang. New York, NY: Simon and Schuster. ISBN 1-4391-4938-0</ref>

Since 1993, apart from brief periods of transition, the top leader of China simultaneously serves as the president, the [[Leader of the Communist Party of China|leader of the party]] (as [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]]), and the [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|commander-in-chief]] of the military (as the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]]). This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles. For example, the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as president, issues military directives as Chairman of [[Central Military Commission (China)|the Central Military Commission]], and upholds party rule as the general secretary of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).

The presidency was first established in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] in 1954 and successively held by [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Liu Shaoqi]]. Liu fell into political disgrace during the [[Cultural Revolution]], after which the presidency became vacant. The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language [[translation]] of the title was "[[Chairman]]"; after 1982, this translation was changed to "[[President (government title)|President]]", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.{{NoteTag|In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] the President of the PRC is termed ''zhǔxí'' while the Presidents of other countries are termed ''zǒngtǒng''. Furthermore ''zhǔxí'' continues to have the meaning of "chairman" in a generic context.}}

During the Mao era, there were no [[term limits]] for the presidency. Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In 2018, term limits were abolished, but the post's powers and ceremonial role were unchanged.

== Qualifications and election ==
According to the current [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution of China]], the president must be a Chinese citizen with full electoral rights who has reached the age of 45.

The president is elected by the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), China's highest state body, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812224210/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html |date=12 August 2010 }}, Articles 62, 63.</ref>

According to the Organic Law of the NPC, the president is nominated by the [[Presidium of the National People's Congress|NPC Presidium]], the Congress's executive organ.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Organic Law of the National People's Congress of the PRC |accessdate = 2013-07-03 |url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a1t4WswJ?url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-date = 15 July 2015 |url-status = live }}, Article 13.</ref> In practice, however, the ruling Chinese Communist Party reserves the post of president for its current general secretary. Like all officers of state elected by the NPC, the president is elected from a one name ballot.

In the event that the office of president falls vacant, the [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice-president]] succeeds to the office. In the event that both offices fall vacant, the [[President of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|president of the NPC Standing Committee]] temporarily acts as president until the NPC can elect a new president and vice-president.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812224210/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html |date=12 August 2010 }}, Article 84.</ref>

Between 1982 and March 2018, the president and vice-president were [[term limit|limited]] to two consecutive terms.<ref name="auto">[http://www.kkhsou.in/main/polscience/structure_function.html Krishna Kanta Handique State Open University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002431/http://www.kkhsou.in/main/polscience/structure_function.html|date=2 May 2014}}, EXECUTIVE: THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHINESE REPUBLIC.</ref> However these limits were removed at the [[2018 National People's Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/25/c_136998770.htm |title = CPC proposes change on Chinese president's term in Constitution - Xinhua - English.news.cn |website = www.xinhuanet.com |agency = [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] |date = 2018-02-25 |access-date = 25 February 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181025141732/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/25/c_136998770.htm |archive-date = 25 October 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="BBC_noTL">{{cite news |title = China approves 'president for life' change |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43361276 |accessdate = 11 March 2018 |work = BBC News |date = 11 March 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180311051405/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43361276 |archive-date = 11 March 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>

== Powers and duties ==
Under the current [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]], instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to [[promulgate]] laws, select and dismiss the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] (prime minister) as well as the ministers of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], grant [[presidential pardon]]s, declares a [[state of emergency]], issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honours. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the [[National People's Congress]]. The president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic. Under the constitution the "state visit" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the National People's Congress. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state.  It is therefore conceived to mainly function as an symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-term-limit-explainer.html|title=Ending Term Limits for China's Xi Is a Big Deal.

The NPC does no itself have the power to nominate the Premier.</ref>

In theory, the president has discretion over the selection of the premier, though in practice the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.<ref>{{Cite conference

In 2019, a report of [[U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission]] said that everyone should stop calling Chinese leader [[Xi Jinping]] “President” instead of “General Secretary” under Xi's [[One-party state|one-party]] leadership.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stop Calling China's Xi Jinping 'President,' U.S. Panel Says|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/stop-calling-chinas-xi-jinping-president-u-s-panel-says-11573740000|date=14 November 2019|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Kate O’Keeffe and Katy Stech Ferek|access-date=16 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115142227/https://www.wsj.com/articles/stop-calling-chinas-xi-jinping-president-u-s-panel-says-11573740000|archive-date=15 November 2019|url-status=live}}.</ref>

The president also has multiple modes of transports which he/she controls and can alter at any time.

'''By plane'''

The history of transporting heads of state dates back to the time of [[CAAC Airlines]].

Lower officials would be transported in a CAAC [[Boeing 707]]. Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] had a personal [[Ilyushin Il-18]] which he used on his visits. After he died, the aircraft was withdrawn from service and preserved at an aviation museum in China. In the 1970s, the position of Chinese president was abolished, but Mao Zedong and [[Hua Guofeng]] were [[Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party]] successively. With the introduction of the Boeing 747, officials started using the CAAC [[Boeing 747SP]] for international trips. After the CAAC was split up into six in 1988, the 747s were handed over to [[Air China]], and officials continued using 747SPs under the CA livery.

When [[Jiang Zemin]] came into power and succeeded as Party General Secretary in 1989, the 747SPs were permanently returned to passenger service, and 747-400s were utilized. They were used throughout the use of Jiang, [[Hu Jintao]] and Xi Jinping. The 747-400s originally belong to Air China, but one month before the president goes on an official trip, the chosen plane is specifically inspected and retrofitted for VIP use. After the president returns to Beijing, the 747-400 is inspected and converted back to passenger configurations.

In the 2010s a [[Boeing 747-8]] painted in the CA livery was seen around the world, under the fake rego B-2479 and the real rego B-2485. Rumours spread, saying this would be China's new Air Force One. In 2016 it was seen landing in Hamburg for VIP configuration, and since then, it has been on loan to the Chinese Government from Air China for use by the president. Although no official photos have been released, the inside is thought to have a far more lavish interior, including conference tables, seating for the press, private bedrooms, and other features.

After the 747-8 was introduced, the 747-400s now carry ministers and serve as decoy aircraft. On some occasions, an Air China Boeing 737 has even been used for transport. In the late 2010s, the president started importing his own presidential car on foreign trips. For this reason, an Air China Boeing 747 cargo aircraft is used for transportation of freight.

In order not to confuse air traffic control between a normal CA flight and a flight carrying a Chinese government member, all aircraft carrying government people fly under the callsign CA1 to CA100, since normal CA flights fly under the callsign CA101 and above.

== Post title ==
The title of the office (国家主席, Guójiā Zhǔxí) was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of "President of the People's Republic of China" has been adopted since 1982, instead of "Chairman of the People's Republic of China".

A 2019 report by the [[United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission]], a bipartisan commission within the [[United States Congress]], recommends that the Chinese leader Xi Jinping be called “General Secretary” rather than “President”, arguing that the title "president" incorrectly implies that the Chinese leader is democratically elected.<ref>{{cite news |title = Stop Calling China's Xi Jinping 'President,' U.S. Panel Says |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/stop-calling-chinas-xi-jinping-president-u-s-panel-says-11573740000 |date=14 November 2019 |newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] |first1=Kate |last1= O’Keeffe and |first2 = Katy Stech |last2 = Ferek |access-date=16 November 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191115142227/https://www.wsj.com/articles/stop-calling-chinas-xi-jinping-president-u-s-panel-says-11573740000 |archive-date=15 November 2019 |url-status=live }}.</ref>

== History ==
=== Establishment in 1954 ===
The office of State Chairman (the original English translation, as noted above) was first established under the 1954 Constitution. The ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution.<ref>[http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China, 1954] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601163025/http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm |date=1 June 2014 }}, Articles 40–42.</ref>

The powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental. The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: "The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is Chairman of the National Defence Council ({{zh|国防委员会}})."<ref>[http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601163025/http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm |date=1 June 2014 }}, Article 43.</ref> The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the [[People's Liberation Army]]. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.

The state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: "The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference ({{zh|最高国务会议}}) and acts as its chairman."  The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.<ref>[http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601163025/http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm |date=1 June 2014 }}, Article 44.</ref> The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.

=== History up to 1974 ===
Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of State Chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1955. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]], first [[Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party|vice chairman of the Communist Party]]. Liu was reelected as State Chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of State Chairman.  This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of State Chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman [[Dong Biwu]] as "acting state chairman."{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

=== Abolition in 1975 ===
When the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of State Chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the party chairman [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|Supreme Commander]] of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] in concurrence as Chairman of the party CMC.<ref>{{Cite journal

=== Restoration in 1982 ===
In the 1982 Constitution, the president was conceived of as a [[figurehead]] of state with actual state power resting in the hands of the General Secretary of the Communist Party, [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier of the State Council]] and the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and all four posts were designed to be held by separate people. The president therefore held minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party.

In the original 1982 Constitution plan, the party would develop policy while the state would execute it. The original goal was to divide state power in order to prevent a [[cult of personality]] from forming as it did with the case of Mao Zedong. Thus in 1982, although Deng Xiaoping was reckoned as the country's "[[paramount leader]]," he was one of four main leaders–Hu Yaobang, the party general secretary; Zhao Ziyang, the premier; Li Xiannian, the president; and Deng, the chairman of the Central Military Commission. The current [[Politics of Vietnam|political structure of Vietnam]] is similar to the structure China followed in the 1980s.

In the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], was terminated. In 1993, the post of President was taken by Jiang Zemin, who as General Secretary of the CCP and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, became the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|title=A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513080847/https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|archive-date=13 May 2018|access-date=12 May 2018|quote=[[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2111123/does-chinese-leader-xi-jinping-plan-hang-power-more-10|title=Does Chinese leader Xi Jinping plan to hang on to power for more than 10 years?|date=2017-10-06|access-date=7 October 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007064411/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2111123/does-chinese-leader-xi-jinping-plan-hang-power-more-10|archive-date=7 October 2017|quote=If Xi relinquished the presidency in 2023 but remained party chief and chairman of the Central Military commission (CMC), his successor as president would be nothing more than a symbolic figure... “Once the president is neither the party’s general secretary nor the CMC chairman, he or she will be hollowed out, just like a body without a soul.”}}</ref>

On March 11, 2018, the National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that allowed the President to serve an unlimited number of five-year terms. This was widely interpreted as part of an expansion of Xi's power, effectively making him president and [[paramount leader]] for life.<ref name="BBC_noTL"/> Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align the presidency with his more powerful posts of General Secretary of the Party and CMC Chairman, which do not have term limits.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Tom|title=China's Xi Jinping says he is opposed to life-long rule|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2b449400-413a-11e8-803a-295c97e6fd0b|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|quote=President insists term extension is necessary to align government and party posts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417192157/https://www.ft.com/content/2b449400-413a-11e8-803a-295c97e6fd0b|archive-date=17 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
