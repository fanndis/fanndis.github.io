{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''European Union Customs Union''' ('''EUCU''') is a [[customs union]] which consists of all the [[member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] (EU), [[Monaco]] and{{snd}} until the end of its Brexit transition period{{snd}} the [[United Kingdom]] and some of its dependencies.{{efn|[[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] "is treated as territory of Cyprus for customs, VAT and excise purposes". [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], the [[Jersey]], the [[Isle of Man]] and the other [[British Overseas Territories]] are not in the customs union.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/faq/customs/faq_1178_en.htm FAQ: Customs, Taxation and Customs Union], European Commission. Retrieved 20 August 2016.</ref>}} Some detached territories of EU members do not participate in the customs union, usually as a result of their geographic separation.{{efn|For example, the one [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Germany within Switzerland.}} In addition to the EUCU, the EU is in customs unions with [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]], and [[Turkey]] (with the exceptions of certain goods),{{efn|See [[European Union–Turkey Customs Union]].}} through separate [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] agreements.<ref name=CT&U>[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_duties/rules_origin/customs_unions/index_en.htm Customs unions, Taxation and Customs Union], European Commission. Retrieved 20 August 2016.</ref>

There are no [[tariff|tariffs]] or [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] between members of the customs union and{{snd}} unlike a [[free-trade area]]{{snd}} members of the customs union impose a [[common external tariff]] on all goods entering the union.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Erskine |first=Daniel H |date=2006 |title=The United States-EC Dispute Over Customs Matters: Trade Facilitation, Customs Unions, and the Meaning of WTO Obligations |journal=Florida Journal of International Law |volume=18 |pages=432–485 |ssrn=987367 }}</ref>

The [[European Commission]] negotiates for and on behalf of the Union as a whole in international trade deals (such as [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|that with Canada]] and [[European Union free trade agreements|many others]]), rather than each member state negotiating individually. It also represents the Union in the [[World Trade Organization]] and any trade disputes mediated through it.

During the [[Brexit transition period]], which runs until 31 December 2020,{{Update after|2020|reason=Transition period ended}} the [[United Kingdom]] remains in the customs union.

== Non-EU participants ==
[[Monaco]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the British dependencies of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Jersey]] are integral parts of the EU's customs territory.<ref name=CT&U />

== EU territories with an opt-out ==
While all EU member states are part of the customs union, not all of their respective territories participate. Territories of member states which have remained outside of the EU ([[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories of the European Union]]) generally do not participate in the customs union.<ref name=territories>[https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/territorial-status-eu-countries-certain-territories_en Territorial status of EU countries and certain territories]{{snd}} [[European Commission]], retrieved 18 December 2018</ref>

However, some territories within the EU do not participate in the customs union:
*[[Büsingen am Hochrhein]] (a German exclave within Switzerland, part of the Switzerland–Liechtenstein customs area)<ref name="Directive 2006/112/EC">Article 6 of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32006L0112 Council Directive 2006/112/EC], 28 November 2006</ref><ref name="952/2013">{{cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32013R0952&rid=1 |title=REGULATION (EU) No 952/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code, Article 4 |page=11 |format=PDF |publisher=EURLEX |date=October 2013 |access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref>
*[[Livigno]]<ref name="Directive 2006/112/EC" /><ref name="952/2013" />
*[[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] (the two Spanish autonomous cities in Africa).<ref name="Directive 2006/112/EC" /><ref name="952/2013" />

The following are not listed in Regulation 952/2013 but may be non-participant in some aspects for other reasons:
*[[Heligoland]]<ref name="Directive 2006/112/EC" /><ref name=territories />
<!-- NB that the Azores, Canaries and Madeira /are/ in the EUCU, but have local VAT rates. -->

== Union Customs Code ==
{{Main|Union Customs Code}}
The [[Union Customs Code]] (UCC), intended to modernise customs procedures, entered into force on 1 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_code/union_customs_code/ucc/index_en.htm |title=Union Customs Code – Taxation and customs union – European Commission |website=Taxation and customs union}}</ref> Implementation will take place over a period of time and full implementation is anticipated by 31 December 2020 at the latest.<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/union-customs-code/ucc-introduction_en UCC: an Introduction], accessed 29 January 2017</ref> The European Commission has stated that the aims of the UCC are simplicity, service and speed.

== Common external tariffs ==
The EU Customs Union sets the tariff rates for imports to the EU from other countries. These rates are detailed and depend on the specific type of product imported, and can also vary by the time of year.<ref>[https://circabc.europa.eu/faces/jsp/extension/wai/navigation/container.jsp Taric and Quota Data & Information] {{snd}} [[European Commission]] Communication and Information Resource Centre for Administrations, Businesses and Citizens.</ref> The full [[WTO]] [[Most Favoured Nation]] tariff rates apply only to those countries that do not have a [[European Union free trade agreements|Free Trade Agreement with the EU]], or are not on a WTO recognised exemption scheme such as [[Everything but Arms]] (an EU support arrangement for [[Least Developed Countries]]).
