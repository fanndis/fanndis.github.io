==Etymology==

Some have called Edinburgh the ''Athens of the North'' for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the Castle Rock of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[northwestern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name.

When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the [[Votadini]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ritchie |first=J.

In the 17th century, Edinburgh's boundaries were still defined by the city's defensive [[Edinburgh town walls|town walls]].

==Geography==

===Cityscape===
Situated in Scotland's [[Central Belt]], Edinburgh lies on the Firth of Forth's southern shore. The city centre is {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km}} southwest of the shoreline of [[Leith]] and {{convert|26|mi|km}} inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the [[North Sea]] at [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{Cite map |title=Geographia Atlas of the World |year=1984 |publisher=Geographia Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-09-202840-3 |page=99}}</ref> While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on [[Hills in Edinburgh|seven hills]], namely [[Calton Hill]], [[Corstorphine Hill]], Craiglockhart Hill, [[Braid Hills|Braid Hill]], [[Blackford Hill]], Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Seven Hills of Edinburgh |url=http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509080149/http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |archive-date=9 May 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013 |publisher=[[VisitScotland]]}}</ref> giving rise to allusions to the [[seven hills of Rome]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 2003 |title=Voltaire said: Athens of the North |url=http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427212622/http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |archive-date=27 April 2013 |accessdate=28 March 2013 |publisher=Scotland.org}}</ref>

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the [[Pentland Hills]] and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.

===Areas===
Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh Areas |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/areas |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115223740/http://edinburghguide.com/areas |archive-date=15 January 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=edinburghguide.com}}</ref> Many areas, such as [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]], contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as [[tenement]]s, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh area guide |url=http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218202447/http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |archive-date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=timeout.com}}</ref>

[[File:Edinburgh map.png|thumb|Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh]]

The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of [[Princes Street Gardens]]. To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

Edinburgh's Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed buildings]] within the city,<ref name="www.edinburgh.org world-heritage-site" /> a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The [[Royal Mile]] runs downhill and terminates at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or [[wynd]]s) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Old and New Towns of Edinburgh |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120141829/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |archive-date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles' Cathedral, the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|City Chambers]] and the [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Law Courts]]. Other places of historical interest nearby are [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and the [[Grassmarket]]. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northwestern European cities.

The castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest "high rise" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as ''lands'' were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chambers |first=Robert |url=https://archive.org/details/noticesmostrema00chamgoog |title=Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh: from 1385 to 1824&nbsp;... |publisher=C.

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a "New Town" was won by [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig]], a 27-year-old architect.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cruft, Kitty |title=James Craig 1739–1795: Correction of his Date of Birth |journal=Book of the Old Edinburgh Club |volume=New Series Vol. 5 |pages=103–5}}</ref> The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by [[St Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St Andrew Square]] and [[Charlotte Square]] respectively. The latter, designed by [[Robert Adam]], influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scottish Architects Homecoming |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119084414/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |archive-date=19 November 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2011 |publisher=Historic Scotland}}</ref> [[Bute House]], the official residence of the [[First Minister of Scotland]], is on the north side of Charlotte Square.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bute House |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120143843/http://edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |archive-date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=edinburghguide.com}}</ref>

The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the [[Nor Loch]], which was created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their [[sewage]]. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch,<ref name="princeshist" /> but this idea was abandoned.<ref>{{Cite web |title=From monks on strike to dove's dung |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513214124/http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129 |archive-date=13 May 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=scotsman.com}}</ref> Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the [[loch]] to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as [[The Mound]].

In the middle of the 19th century the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]] were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley]] stations were driven through it.

The Southside is a residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, [[Marchmont]], [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]], [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]], [[Sciennes]], [[The Grange, Edinburgh|the Grange]] and [[Blackford, Edinburgh|Blackford]]. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the [[Burgh Muir]], and was developed as a residential area after the opening of the [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|South Bridge]] in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]] just north of Marchmont and [[The Meadows (park)|the Meadows]]), and [[Napier University]] (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and "bed and breakfast" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, [[Church Hill, Edinburgh|Church Hill]] in Morningside, was the home of [[Muriel Spark]]'s Miss Jean Brodie,<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |url=http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209070917/http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |archive-date=9 February 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=geraldinemcewan.com}}</ref> and [[Ian Rankin]]'s [[Inspector Rebus]] lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inspector Rebus Novels |url=http://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303085742/https://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |archive-date=3 March 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=ianrankin.net}}</ref>

[[File:The Shore, Leith.JPG|thumb|The Shore, Leith]]

[[Leith]] was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Edinburgh Corporation |title=Edinburgh 1329–1929, Sexcentenary of Bruce Charter |publisher=Oliver And Boyd |year=1929 |location=Edinburgh |page=xxvii}}</ref> The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Story of Leith XXXIII.

With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a beach and [[promenade]] and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs and a restored Victorian swimming pool, including [[Turkish bath]]s.

The [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Settlements|urban area]] of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the [[The City of Edinburgh Council|City of Edinburgh Council]] boundary, merging with [[Musselburgh]] in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], [[Tranent]], [[Prestonpans]], [[Dalkeith]], [[Bonnyrigg]], [[Loanhead]], [[Penicuik]], [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] and [[Dunfermline]]. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh & South East Scotland City region with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.<ref name="NRS LA Estimate" /><ref name="City Region Definition" />

Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as "the windy city", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow.<ref name="temperature" /> Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.<ref name="temperature" /> Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by [[haar (fog)|haar]], a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as [[European windstorm]]s, can affect the city between October and May.<ref name="temperature" />

Located slightly north of the city centre, the weather station at the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]] (RBGE) has been an official weather station for the [[Met Office]] since 1956.
The Met Office operates its own weather station at Gogarbank on the city's western outskirts, near [[Edinburgh Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh Gogarbank Climate Averages 1981–2010 |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909205528/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn |archive-date=9 September 2015 |accessdate=11 August 2015 |publisher=Met Office}}</ref> This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.

Early 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.<ref name="dwellings">{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh Comparisons – Dwellings |url=http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318032701/http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009 |accessdate=8 February 2009 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council}}</ref>

From the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as [[Dumbiedykes]], [[Leith]], and [[Fountainbridge]], led to the creation of new estates such as [[Stenhouse, Edinburgh|Stenhouse]] and [[Saughton]], [[Craigmillar]] and [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]], [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]] and [[Muirhouse]], [[Piershill]], and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND |url=http://www.localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117002911/http://localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |archive-date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=localhistories.org}}</ref>

Banking has been a mainstay of the Edinburgh economy for over 300 years, since the [[Bank of Scotland]] was established by an act of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] in 1695. Today, the financial services industry, with its particularly strong insurance and investment sectors, and underpinned by Edinburgh-based firms such as [[Scottish Widows]] and [[Standard Life Aberdeen]], accounts for the city being the UK's second financial centre after London and Europe's fourth in terms of equity assets.<ref name="financial">{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh's financial services sector |url=http://www.edinburgh-inspiringcapital.com/invest/key_business_sectors/financial_services.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116235214/http://www.edinburgh-inspiringcapital.com/invest/key_business_sectors/financial_services.aspx |archive-date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2010 |publisher=Edinburgh Brand}}</ref> The [[NatWest Group]] (formerly Royal Bank of Scotland Group) opened new global headquarters at [[Gogarburn]] in the west of the city in October 2005.

Tourism is also an important element in the city's economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August each year during the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s, which attracts 4.4&nbsp;million visitors,<ref name="Edinburgh Economy Watch April 2010" /> and generates over £100m for the local economy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 October 2005 |title=2004 Festival Economic Impact Study results |url=http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=923 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195132/http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=923 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=23 March 2007 |publisher=Edinburgh Festival Fringe}}</ref>

As the centre of Scotland's government and [[Scots law|legal system]], the public sector plays a central role in Edinburgh's economy. Many departments of the Scottish Government are in the city. Other major employers include [[NHS Scotland]] and [[local government of Scotland|local government]] administration.<ref name="Edinburgh by Numbers" /> When the £1.3bn Edinburgh & South East Scotland City Region Deal was signed in 2018, the region's Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution to the Scottish economy was cited as £33bn, or 33% of the country's output.
