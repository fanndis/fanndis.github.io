'''''Fearless''''' is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The album was released on November 11, 2008, by [[Big Machine Records]]. Swift wrote most of the songs during the time when she was promoting her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] performing as an [[opening act]] for other [[country music|country]] artists. Of the 13 tracks on the standard edition, eight were solely written by Swift, and the other were co-written by Swift with [[Liz Rose]], [[Hillary Lindsey]], [[Colbie Caillat]], and [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]]. Swift also made her debut as a [[record producer]], co-producing all songs with [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]].

''Fearless'' is a [[country pop]] album that incorporates elements of crossover [[Pop music|pop]] that commentators found appealing to a broader, mainstream audience. It incorporates acoustic instruments such as [[banjo]], [[fiddle]], and [[Acoustic guitar|guitar]] in its production, and lyrically depicts Swift's perceptions of her romantic relationships. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting ability resulting in radio-friendly songs. The most awarded album in the history of country music, ''Fearless'' won Album of the Year at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|Grammys]], the [[Country Music Association Awards]], and the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]]. The Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] made Swift, then 20 years old, the youngest artist to win the award at the time.

''Fearless'' spent 11 weeks atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was the best-selling album of 2009 in the United States, making Swift—19 years old at the time—the youngest artist to have the best-selling album of a calendar year. The album is certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for earning over 10 million [[album-equivalent units]] in the United States. Worldwide, it is one of the [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|best-selling albums of the 21st century]], having sold over 12 million copies worldwide. ''Fearless'' spawned five singles, including two successful crossover hits "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]" and "[[You Belong with Me]]", which reached the higher-tier positions on record charts worldwide. Three other singles, "[[White Horse (Taylor Swift song)|White Horse]]", "[[Fifteen (song)|Fifteen]]", and the [[Fearless (Taylor Swift song)|title track]], entered the top 40 on the US Hot 100. The album's corresponding tour, the [[Fearless Tour]], ran from April 2009 to June 2010 and grossed $66.5 million.

==Background==
Prior to stardom, Swift received a [[publishing contract]] with [[Sony Music|Sony]]/[[ATV Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p816977|pure_url=yes}}|title=Taylor Swift – Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 1, 2010}}</ref> Over the course of that period, Swift composed over 250 songs, either alone or collaborating with other songwriters, mostly with [[Liz Rose]] or [[Robert Ellis Orrall]],<ref name="unrated">{{cite web|url=http://www.unratedmagazine.com/Document.cfm?Page=Articles/index.cfm&Article_ID=495|title=Taylor Swift – A Place In This World|first=Jackie Lee|last=King|date=July 2007|work=[[UnRated Magazine|UnRated]]|access-date=June 18, 2011|archive-date=March 24, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130324233135/http://www.unratedmagazine.com/Document.cfm?Page=Articles/index.cfm&Article_ID=495|url-status=live}}</ref> and refused to give them away to already established acts with intentions of someday singing them herself. When later signed to [[Big Machine Records]], Swift compiled her ''Taylor Swift'' album of material written during her publishing contract, and expected to do the same for her second album. She said, "I've been very selfish about my songs. I had this dream of this project [''Taylor Swift''] coming out for so many years now that I just stockpiled. I'm so happy that I did because now we have a second album full of songs and a third album full of songs, and I don't have to lift a finger."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1546980/when-she-thinks-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-savors-payoff.jhtml|title=When She Thinks "Tim McGraw," Taylor Swift Savors Payoff: Hardworking Teen to Open for George Strait Next Year|date=December 1, 2006|first=Edward|last=Morris|work=[[CMT News]]|access-date=March 11, 2010|archive-date=March 24, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130324233825/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1546980/when-she-thinks-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-savors-payoff.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> However, when embarking on her first and second tour as [[opening act]] for [[Rascal Flatts]] and [[George Strait]], respectively, Swift continued to compose numerous songs. "I've written a lot of songs by myself lately, especially since I've been alone so much on the road," she said. "I do love writing on the road – I usually write at the concert venue. I'll find a quiet place in some room at the venue, like the locker room."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/taylorswift123.htm|title=Special Interview (2007): Taylor Swift Discusses Her Debut Album, Early Hits, And How She Got Started|first=Dale|last=Kawashima|website=Songwritinguniverse.com|access-date=December 17, 2010|archive-date=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324060932/http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/taylorswift123.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

As a result of writing subsequent to touring, Swift self-penned most of the material. "I've written like eight songs for the second album by myself. If you're in [[Arkansas]], who's there to write with?"<ref name="billboardq&a">{{cite web |url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046063/the-billboard-qa-taylor-swift |title= The Billboard Q&A: Taylor Swift |work= Billboard |access-date= June 21, 2011 |archive-date= July 5, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130705032846/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046063/the-billboard-qa-taylor-swift |url-status= live }}</ref> During vacation days from touring, Swift collaborated with Rose,<ref name="billboardq&a" /> musician [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]], and singer-songwriter [[Colbie Caillat]].<ref name="cmtwhysongwritingsings">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1591866/why-taylor-swifts-songwriting-sings.jhtml|title=Why Taylor Swift's Songwriting Sings|first=Alison|last=Bonaguro|date=July 30, 2008|work=CMT News|access-date=July 1, 2011|archive-date=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130325212847/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1591866/why-taylor-swifts-songwriting-sings.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the writing process, she was heavily influenced by [[Sheryl Crow]]'s candidness and truthful, yet vulnerable storytelling, and [[Brad Paisley]]'s touching, yet humorous nature; she opened for Paisley.<ref name="unrated" /> She sought to prolong with centering romantic love the theme of the album. Primarily, she did not want to alienate her fans with songs about life on the road, for she could never relate to songs of the sort when younger. She continued, "I really try to write more about what I feel and guys and love because that's what fascinates me more than anything else – love and what it does to us and how we treat people and how they treat us. So pretty much every song on the album has a face that I associate with it."<ref name="theoaklandpress">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/03/26/entertainment/doc4baba3395e3ef490410773.txt?viewmode=default|title=Living 'Fearless' Taylor Swift talks about her whirlwind rise to the top|first=Gary|last=Graff|date=March 26, 2010|work=[[The Oakland Press]]|publisher=[[Journal Register Company]]|access-date=July 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716215636/http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/03/26/entertainment/doc4baba3395e3ef490410773.txt?viewmode=default|archive-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Despite her revelation of not having kissed a male in two years, Swift said the album was not wrung dry of such inspiration because she still underwent breakups and felt its core emotions.

==Development and lyrics==
Swift conceived the title track with Rose and songwriter [[Hillary Lindsey]] while touring.

It is an understated ballad, and the only song on ''Fearless'' to be written in [[Verse-chorus form|simple verse form]]. The song was inspired by an incident during middle school, when Swift called several of her peers on the phone and asked if they wanted to go shopping with her. However, every girl had a different excuse for why they couldn't go. Eventually, Swift's mother agreed to take her to the local mall. When they arrived, Swift saw all of the girls she had called on the phone, goofing around in [[Victoria's Secret]].<ref name="GQm">{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story|title=Taylor Swift on "Bad Blood," Kanye West, and How People Interpret Her Lyrics|author=Chuck Klosterman|work=[[GQ]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=October 15, 2015|access-date=October 18, 2015|archive-date=October 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018020927/http://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="sessionsinterview">{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/taylor-swift-sessions-interview/462880/|title=Taylor Swift Sessions Interview|first=Melinda|last=Newman|date=December 19, 2008|work=[[AOL]]|access-date=March 25, 2011|archive-date=December 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225202826/http://music.aol.ca/article/taylor-swift-sessions-interview/462880/|url-status=live}}</ref> "[[Change (Taylor Swift song)|Change]]" was solely composed by Swift about her hopes and aspirations to succeed, although signed to the smallest record label in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Packaging and release==
[[File:Taylor Swift - Fearless Tour - Los Angeles 05.jpg|thumb|250px|Swift performing "[[You're Not Sorry]]" on the Fearless Tour.]]
After completing the album's first track, Swift reconsidered her personal definition of the word "fearless".<ref name="mtvowed">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1599032/20081110/swift__taylor.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Says She 'Owed It' To Her Fans To Be Open About Joe Jonas Breakup|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=November 11, 2008|website=[[MTV News]]|access-date=May 25, 2010|archive-date=March 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312093907/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1599032/20081110/swift__taylor.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> To her, "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that you have a lot of fears, but you jump anyway."<ref name="mtvowed" /> She then started contemplating the word to title the album, and to assure she was making the correct decision, applied to every song on the album. Finding a fearless element to the themes and messages behind the songs, Swift decided to title the album ''Fearless''.<ref name="sessionsinterview" /> On the liner notes, she further explained the album title,
{{quote|This album is called ''Fearless'', and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, Fearless is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears, Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again... even though every time you've tried before, you've lost. It's Fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even though you can't breathe without them. I think it's Fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's Fearless to stop believing them. It's Fearless to say "you're NOT sorry". I think loving someone despite what people think is Fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is Fearless. Letting go is Fearless. Then, moving on and being alright... That's Fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily ever after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is Fearless.<ref name="liner" />}}

As with her debut album, ''Taylor Swift'', Swift was very involved with the album packaging. The album's images were photographed by Joseph Anthony Barker, Ash Newell and [[Sheryl Nields]] while the cover and graphic designs were executed by Leen Ann Ramey for Ramey Design.<ref name="liner" /> ''Fearless'' was released on November 11, 2008 in the United States and Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYGOEM/|title=Fearless: Taylor Swift|publisher=Amazon|access-date=June 8, 2012|archive-date=January 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109013937/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYGOEM|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B001JTTYEY/|title=Fearless: Taylor Swift |publisher=Amazon |access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> and on November 15, 2008, in Australia. The album was then re-released on February 27, 2009, in Australia as a limited edition with bonus tracks originally from ''Taylor Swift'' and a new artwork. An international edition was released March 2, 2009, in Spain, and numerous countries followed in the consequent weeks.

Swift had already started composing songs for her next album, what would become ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010), but had also written songs she believed did not correspond with her scope of the record.
