The [[metropolis]] is an [[global city|alpha global city]] as listed by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. In 2019, the population of the city of Johannesburg was 5,635,127, making it the [[List of municipalities in South Africa|most populous city]] in South Africa.<ref name=population/> In the same year, the population of Johannesburg's [[urban agglomeration]] was put at 8,000,000.<ref name=population/> land area of the municipal city ({{convert|1645|km2|abbr=on||disp=or}}) is large in comparison with those of other major cities, resulting in a moderate population density of {{convert|2364|/km2|abbr=out|}}.

The city was established in 1886 following the discovery of gold on what had been a farm. Due to the extremely large gold deposit found along the [[Witwatersrand]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ritchie |first1=Kevin |title=A jubilee that truly sparkles |url=https://www.iol.co.za/travel/south-Africa/northern-cape/a-jubilee-that-truly-sparkles-1332007 |publisher=IOL|date=2 July 2012}}</ref> within ten years, the population had grown to 100,000 inhabitants.

A separate city from the late 1970s until 1994, [[Soweto]] is now part of Johannesburg. Originally an acronym for "South-Western Townships", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg-Proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as [[Apartheid]].

== Etymology ==

Controversy surrounds the origin of the name. There was quite a number of people with the name "Johannes" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the [[Volksraad]] and was Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883–1900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.<ref name="Jo01">{{Cite web|title=How was Johannesburg named?|url=https://www.joburg.org.za:443/play_/Pages/Play%20in%20Joburg/Culture%20and%20Heritage/Links/How-was-Johannesburg-named.aspx|website=www.joburg.org.za|language=en-ZA|access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref>

Precise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated [[Rissik Street Post Office]] is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/thread/rissik-street-post-office-johannesburg|title=Rissik Street Post Office Johannesburg - The Heritage Portal|website=www.theheritageportal.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111105718/http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Johannesburg City Hall|City Hall]] is also located on Rissik Street.

== History  ==
{{Main|History of Johannesburg|Timeline of Johannesburg}}
[[File:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886]]
The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherers who used stone tools. There is evidence that they lived there up to ten centuries ago.<ref>See http://mk.org.za/mkhist1.htm</ref>  Stone-walled ruins of Sotho–Tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] in which Johannesburg is situated.<ref>Mason, Revil, Origins of Black People of Johannesburg and the Southern Western Central Transvaal, AD 300-1880, Occasional Paper No. 16 of the Archeological Research Unit (University of the Witwatersrand), 1986.</ref>

By the mid-18th century, the broader region was largely settled by various [[Sotho–Tswana]] communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from what is now [[Botswana]] in the west, to present day [[Lesotho]] in the south, to the present day [[Northern Sotho language|Pedi]] areas of the Northern Province.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of [[Sotho–Tswana]] towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal province in which Johannesburg is situated.

Many Sotho–Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the [[mfecane]] or difaqane wars),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/mfecane.htm|title=Difaqane / Mfecane Wars - 1818-1835|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] (often referred to as the Matabele, the name given them by the local Sotho–Tswana), set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern-day Rustenburg.

=== Gold rush and naming of the city ===
{{main|Witwatersrand Gold Rush}} The main Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in June 1884 on the farm Vogelstruisfontein by Jan Gerritse Bantjes that triggered the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the founding of Johannesburg in 1886. The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area. Jan, Johann and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility. Precise records for the choice of name were lost.<ref name=Joburg>{{cite web|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&id=275&Itemid=51|title=How was Johannesburg named?|publisher=Official Website of the City of Johannesburg|year=2015|accessdate=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417124059/http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&id=275&Itemid=51|archive-date=17 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Within ten years, the city of Johannesburg included 100,000 people.<ref name="ReidLane2004"/>

In September 1884, the Struben brothers discovered the Confidence Reef on the farm Wilgespruit near present-day Roodepoort, which further boosted excitement over gold prospects.<ref name="DGJ01">{{Cite book|title=A Concise Historical Dictionary of Greater Johannesburg|last1=Musiker|first1=Naomi|last2=Musiker|first2=Reuben|publisher=Francolin|year=2000|isbn=978-1868590711|location=Cape Town}}</ref>{{rp|254}} The first gold to be crushed on the Witwatersrand was the gold-bearing rock from the Bantjes mine crushed using the Struben brothers stamp machine. Also, news of the discovery soon reached Kimberley and directors Cecil Rhodes with Sir Joseph Robinson rode up to investigate rumours for themselves. They have guided to the Bantjes camp with its tents strung out over several kilometres and stayed with Bantjes for two nights.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In 1884, they purchased the first pure refined gold from Bantjes for £3,000. Incidentally, Bantjes had since 1881 been operating the Kromdraai Gold Mine in the Cradle of Humankind together with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar where they first discovered gold in 1881, and which also offered another kind of discovery - the early ancestors of all mankind.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Some report Australian George Harrison as the first to make a claim for gold in the area that became Johannesburg, as he found gold on a farm in July 1886. He did not stay in the area.<ref name="George Harrison">{{cite web|url=http://www.travelhouseuk.co.uk/news/travel-insight/johannesburg-the-city-built-on-gold.htm|title=Johannesburg: The City Built On Gold|author=Victor Hunt|publisher=Travelhouse UK|date=7 December 2013}}</ref>

Gold was earlier discovered some {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of present-day Johannesburg, in [[Barberton, South Africa|Barberton]]. [[Prospecting|Gold prospectors]] soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the [[Witwatersrand]] offered by Bantjes. The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col [[Ignatius Ferreira]], was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because the water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following upon the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of [[Ferreirasdorp]]. The first settlement at Ferreira's Camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of 3,000 by 1887.<ref name="ReidLane2004">{{cite book|author1=Andrew M.

=== Rapid growth, Jameson Raid and the Second Boer War ===
Like many late 19th-century mining towns, Johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place, populated by white miners from all continents, African tribesmen recruited to perform unskilled mine work, African women beer brewers who cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers, a very large number of European prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished Afrikaners, tradesmen, and Zulu "AmaWasha", Zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work.<ref>{{cite book|first=Charles|last=van Onselen|title=New Nineveh and New Babylon}}</ref> As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the [[Boer]]-dominated Transvaal government in Pretoria and the British, culminating in the [[Jameson Raid]] that ended in fiasco at [[Doornkop]] in January 1896. In the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) saw British forces under Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south-west of its then-limits, near present-day Krugersdorp.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Fighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust – today's Nancefield, [[Eldorado Park, Gauteng|Eldorado Park]] and Naturena – the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=401&func=select&id=5|title=Battle for Johannesburg|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/ebooks/0%202009may27%20Two%20Battles%20for%20Johannesburg%20_final%20draft_.pdf|title=Hidden in Plain Sight: Johannesburg's Battlefields|author=Engelbrecht, Leon|date=27 May 2009|accessdate=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417133321/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/ebooks/0%202009may27%20Two%20Battles%20for%20Johannesburg%20_final%20draft_.pdf|archive-date=17 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

During the war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg's Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as "Asian", but as "Coloured". The population in 1904 was 155,642, of whom 83,363 were [[White people|Whites]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Johannesburg |volume=19 |page=432}}</ref>

=== Post-Union history ===
[[File:Johannesburg-c1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pritchard Street c. 1940]]
In 1917, Johannesburg became the headquarters of the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo-American Corporation]] founded by [[Ernest Oppenheimer]] which ultimately became one of the world's largest corporations, dominating both gold-mining and diamond-mining in South Africa. Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Hillbrow]] went high-rise. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as [[Soweto]]. New freeways encouraged massive suburban sprawl to the north of the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the late 1960s and early 1970s, tower blocks (including the [[Carlton Centre]] and the [[Southern Life Centre]]) filled the skyline of the central business district.

Under the system of ''apartheid'' (Afrikaans for "apartness", though the system was founded by the British), a comprehensive system of racial segregation was imposed upon South Africa starting in 1948. The economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of cheap black workers who performed most of the semi-skilled and unskilled work, and which forced the government to make some exceptions to ''apartheid'' in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa's economic capital.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 86">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 86.</ref> In the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for blacks outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 86"/> [[Soweto]], a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of rural blacks came to Johannesburg.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 92">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 92.</ref> It was estimated in 1989 that the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 92"/>

In March 1960, Johannesburg witnessed widespread demonstrations against ''apartheid'' in response to the [[Sharpeville massacre]].<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 80">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 80.</ref> On 11 July 1963, the [[South African Police]] raided a house in the Johannesburg suburb of [[Rivonia]] where nine members of the banned [[African National Congress]] (ANC) were arrested on charges of planning sabotage. Their arrest led to the famous [[Rivonia Trial]].<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 92"/> The nine arrested included one Indo-South African, one coloured, two whites and five blacks, one of whom was the future president [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 91">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 91.</ref> At their trial, the accused freely admitted that they were guilty of what they were charged with, namely of planning to blow up the hydro-electric system of Johannesburg to shut down the gold mines, but Mandela argued to the court that the ANC had tried non-violent resistance to ''apartheid'' and failed, leaving him with no other choice.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 91"/> The trial made Mandela into a national figure and a symbol of resistance to ''apartheid''.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 91"/>
 	
On 16 June 1976, demonstrations broke out in Soweto over a government decree that black school-children be educated in Afrikaans instead of English, and after the police fired on the demonstrations, rioting against ''apartheid'' began in Soweto and spread into the greater Johannesburg area.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 93.</ref> About 575 people, the majority of whom were black, were killed in the [[Soweto uprising]] of 1976.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 80"/> Between 1984–86, South Africa was in turmoil as a series of nationwide protests, strikes and riots took place against  ''apartheid'', and the black townships around Johannesburg were scenes of some of the fiercest struggles between the police and anti-''apartheid'' demonstrators.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 100.</ref>

The central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres. [[Sandton City]] was opened in 1973, followed by Rosebank Mall in 1976, and [[Eastgate Shopping Centre, Johannesburg|Eastgate]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amethyst.co.za/JhbGuide/Johannesburg.htm|title=History of Johannesburg|publisher=Amethyst.co.za|date=5 April 2003|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref>

On 12 May 2008, a series of riots started in the township of [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]], in the north-eastern part of Johannesburg, when locals attacked migrants from [[Mozambique]], Malawi and [[Zimbabwe]], killing two people and injuring 40 others.

=== Redevelopment of industrial heritage ===
The redevelopment of Newtown was inevitable and part of the reason why the City and heritage bodies decided to keep the façades of the old buildings and apportion new meaning to it was that part of the identity of the area was forged in the old buildings. It was known throughout its redevelopment as the Newtown cultural precinct it was therefore important to stage, old renovated buildings as the setting of the new precinct. Demolishing the old structures and replacing them with new buildings would not have achieved the same effect. Everyone played their part in the marketing, branding and the new identity of the precinct, the City, heritage bodies, heritage practitioners, private companies all played a part. The old warehouse industrial buildings that once lay decaying in Newtown are now synonymous with culture and flair.

Like many cities around the world, there is an increasing focus on the rejuvenation of the inner city of Johannesburg.  One of these initiatives is the Maboneng District located on the south-eastern side of the CBD.  Originally a hub for art, it has expanded to include restaurants, entertainment venues and retail stores as well as accommodation and hotels.  Maboneng calls itself "a place of inspiration – a creative hub, a place to do business, a destination for visitors and a safe, integrated community for residents.  A beacon of strength in Africa's most economically prosperous city".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mabonengprecinct.com|title=Maboneng {{!}} The heart and essence of the city of Joburg|website=Maboneng|language=en-US|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref>

== Geography ==
=== Topography ===
[[File:JohannesburgGP-Aerial.jpg|thumb|January 2008 Johannesburg aerial view looking towards the south-east]]
Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the [[Highveld]], at an elevation of {{convert|1753|m|ft}}. The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.

Johannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers – the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with "fontein", meaning "spring" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams&nbsp;– giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, "the ridge of white waters". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>

The site was not chosen solely for its streams, however. One of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Johannesburg-South-Africa|title=Johannesburg|last=Campbell|first=James T.|date=19 August 2015|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>

=== Cityscape ===
The city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2013}}</ref> Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD.  Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.

Due to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the [[multiple nuclei model]] in [[human geography]] terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of {{convert|6|km2|0|abbr=out}}. It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the [[Carlton Centre]], [[Marble Towers]], [[Trust Bank Building]], [[Ponte City Apartments]], [[Southern Life Centre]] and [[11 Diagonal Street]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Johannesburg CBD|date=2019-03-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannesburg_CBD&oldid=889728393|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>

Johannesburg's city centre retains its elements of a rectangular grid pattern that was first officially recorded in 1886.<ref name=":0"/> Streets are narrow and filled with high rises built in the mid- to late 1900s. Old Victorian-era buildings first built in the late 1800s have been torn down long ago.<ref name=":0"/> The 1900s brought along with it the introduction of many different architectural styles and structures. The Johannesburg Art Gallery and Supreme Court Building being two examples. These were important Beaux-Arts structures, with the style put in place by (at the time) colonial parent, the British Empire.<ref name=":0"/> South Africa didn't borrow architectural techniques exclusively from Britain, however. They were also inspired by American models and styles, having built several structures like the ESKOM Building and the Corner House to emulate the prowess of New York City, located in the United States.<ref name=":0"/>

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Architecture of Johannesburg}}
Johannesburg is home to some of Africa's tallest structures, such as the [[Sentech Tower]], [[Hillbrow Tower]], the [[Carlton Centre]] and [[Ponte City Apartments]]. The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as [[IBM]], [[Absa Group Limited|Absa]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[Willis Group]], [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]], [[Nedbank]] and [[Standard Bank]]. Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].

=== Religion ===
Among the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Zion Christian Church]], [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Baptist Union of Southern Africa]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa]] ([[World Methodist Council]]), [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Church of Africa]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg]] ([[Catholic Church]]) and the [[Johannesburg South Africa Temple]] ([[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]).<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa SouthAfrica], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques, [[Hindu]] temples, A Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.

Johannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau, and has a [[oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwb''). The city enjoys a sunny climate, with the summer months (October to April) characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings, and the winter months (May to September) by dry, sunny days followed by cold nights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safarinow.com/cms/johannesburg-gauteng/irie.aspx|title=Johannesburg & Gauteng Weather and Climate |publisher=Safarinow.com |accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref> Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high elevation, with an average maximum daytime temperature in January of {{convert|25.6|C}}, dropping to an average maximum of around {{convert|16|C}} in June. The [[UV index]] for Johannesburg in summers is extreme, often reaching 14–16 due to the high elevation and its location in the subtropics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uvawareness.com/uv-index/uv-index.php?location=johannesburg|title=UV index of Johannesburg|publisher=uvawareness|accessdate=13 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222081241/http://www.uvawareness.com/uv-index/uv-index.php?location=johannesburg|archive-date=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with mild days and cool nights, dropping to {{convert|4.1|C|1}} in June and July. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing [[frost]]. Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in the twentieth century during May 1956, August 1962, June 1964 and September 1981. In the 21st century, there was light sleet in 2006, as well as snow proper on 27 June 2007 (accumulating up to {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=|disp=or}} in the southern suburbs)<ref>{{cite web|author=SABCnews.com |title=Joburg covered by snow as temperature drops |url=http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,151555,00.html |accessdate=16 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629130254/http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0%2C2172%2C151555%2C00.html |archive-date=29 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and 7 August 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bauer|first=Nickolaus|title=Snow in the city delights Jo'burg residents|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-07-snow-in-joburg|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=7 August 2012}}</ref>

Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|713|mm|1}}, which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months.

=== Suburbs ===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2020}}
{{Main|Suburbs of Johannesburg}}
[[File:Bezuidenhout Valley, Johannesburg.jpg|thumb|[[Bezuidenhout Valley]]]] 
Johannesburg's suburbs are the product of urban sprawl and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-04-30-apartheid-legacy-of-urban-sprawl-is-the-challenge-our-cities-face/|title=Apartheid legacy of urban sprawl is the challenge our cities face|work=Daily Maverick}}</ref> While the [[Central Business District (Johannesburg)|Central Business District]] and the immediate surrounding areas were formerly desirable living areas, the spatial accommodation of the suburbs has tended to see a flight from the city and immediate surrounds. The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].

Greater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|spell=in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=":0"/> Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.<ref name=":0"/>

The suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the local African middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city with the city starting to sprawl northwards and multiple secondary CBDs forming in the north towards Pretoria.

Traditionally the northern and north-western suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as [[Hyde Park, South Africa|Hyde Park]], [[Sandhurst, South Africa|Sandhurst]], [[Northcliff]], [[Hurlingham, Gauteng|Hurlingham]], [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] made his home. The north-western area, in particular, is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once the centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].

To the southwest of the city centre is [[Soweto]], a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement. To the south of Johannesburg is [[Lenasia]], a predominantly Asian neighbourhood which was constructed during apartheid specifically to house Asians. Closer to Alexandria communities like Glenazel and Norwood have been integral in the urban landscape of Johannesburg.

== Economy ==
[[File:Johannesburg Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange|JSE]]]]
Johannesburg is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa's gross domestic product, and accounts for 40% of Gauteng's economic activity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}<!--"page not found" link<ref name="sa2010-joburg">{{cite web|url=http://www.sa2010.gov.za/southafrica/hostcities.php|title=Johannesburg|work=2010 Communication Project Management Unit|publisher=Government Communication and Information System (GCIS)|accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref>--> In a 2008 survey conducted by [[MasterCard]], Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/wcoc/pdf/WCoC_Brochure_FINAL.pdf|title=Mastercard - Global Leading Company in Payment Solutions Offering Credit, Debit, Prepaid Cards & More|website=www.mastercard.com}}</ref>

Mining was the foundation of the [[Witwatersrand]]'s economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the [[city limits]], most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the [[JSE Limited|JSE]] although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.

The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], the biggest of which is the [[Lesotho Highlands Water Project]], but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.

The container terminal at [[City Deep, Gauteng|City Deep]] is known to be the largest "[[dry port]]" in the world,{{Citation needed|reason=Johannesburg not mentioned in dry port article, largest dry port in world is significant claim|date=March 2015}} with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]] arriving in Johannesburg.

Johannesburg's largest shopping centres, measured by gross leasable area (GLA, the uniform measure of centre size as determined by the International Council of Shopping Centers) are Sandton City, Eastgate, Mall of Africa, Westgate and Cresta. [[Melrose Arch]] is one of its most prestigious.{{citation_needed|date=October 2012}} Other centres include [[Hyde Park Corner (shopping centre)|Hyde Park Corner]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], [[Southgate Shopping Centre|Southgate]], The Glen Shopping Centre, Johannesburg South, and Clearwater Mall. There were also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in [[Midrand]], but these have been indefinitely delayed due to the opening of [[Mall of Africa]]. "Zonk'Izizwe" means "All Nations" in [[Zulu language]], indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://architectafrica.com/bin0/features-GreenstoneMall-Bentel-05.html|title=GREENSTONE MALL : BENTEL INTERNATIONAL: Architect Africa Features Page|publisher=Architectafrica.com|accessdate=2 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208015832/http://www.architectafrica.com/bin0/features-GreenstoneMall-Bentel-05.html|archive-date=8 December 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Cradlestone Mall is a new mall named for its location which is close to the [[Cradle of Humankind]], a World Heritage Site.

[[File:Johannesburg 2006 regions with legend.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The seven regions of the city]]

Upon the creation of the Metropolitan Municipality in 2000 the city was subdivided into eleven regions, simply named Region 1 to Region 11. These were reorganized in 2006 into the current seven regions named alphabetically Region A to Region G, as shown on the map (left).<ref>{{Cite web|author=Abraham, Anish|date=11 May 2006|title=Jozi plans major restructuring|publisher=City of Johannesburg|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/2006/may/may11_structure.stm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627140019/http://www.joburg.org.za/2006/may/may11_structure.stm|archive-date=27 June 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{As of|2006}} the seven regions are:
* ''Region A'': Diepsloot, Kya Sand;
* ''Region B'': Randburg, Rosebank, Emmarentia, Greenside, Melville, Northcliff, Rosebank, Parktown, Parktown North;
* ''Region C'': Roodepoort, Constantia Kloof, Northgate;

In the 2016 municipal elections, the ruling party, the ANC, lost their majority in Johannesburg for the first time since taking power in 1994, claiming only 44.12% of the vote. The Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance both agreed to vote for the DA mayoral candidate, [[Herman Mashaba]], who was sworn into power as the first Democratic Alliance mayor of Johannesburg on 22 August 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/08/22/Victory-for-DA-as-Herman-Mashaba-is-elected-Mayor-of-Johannesburg|title=Victory for DA as Herman Mashaba is elected Mayor of Johannesburg|first=Clement|last=Manyathela|website=ewn.co.za|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> The ANC returned to the city's executive on 4 December 2019 following the election of its regional chair, [[Geoff Makhubo]], to the mayoralty.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Deklerk |first1=Aphiwe |title=ANC's Geoff Makhubo is the new Joburg mayor |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2019-12-04-ancs-geoff-makhubo-is-the-new-joburg-mayor/ |accessdate=4 December 2019 |agency=TimesLIVE |date=4 December 2019}}</ref>

=== Crime ===
After the [[Group Areas Act]] was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by [[urban blight]]. Thousands of poor black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like [[Soweto]] and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by [[landlord]]s, especially in high-density areas, such as [[Hillbrow]]. Many corporations and institutions, including the [[JSE Securities Exchange|stock exchange]], moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like [[Sandton]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Johannesburg Stock Exchange History - Property24.com|url = http://www.property24.com/articles/johannesburg-stock-exchange-history/16977|website = www.property24.com|access-date = 18 February 2016}}</ref>

Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include [[closed-circuit television]] on street corners. As of 11 December 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] surveillance.<ref name="iol.co.za">{{cite news|url = https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/joburg-surveillance-zooms-in-428633|work = IOL News|title =Joburg Surveillance Zooms In|date= 11 December 2008|last = Gifford|first = Gill}}</ref> The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle travelling through the Central business district (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The JMPD claims that the average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is 60 seconds.<ref name="iol.co.za"/>

=== Attractions ===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2015}}
{{See also|Category: Museums in Johannesburg|Category: Sports venues in Johannesburg|Category: Shopping centres in Johannesburg}}
Johannesburg has not traditionally been known as a tourist destination, but the city is a transit point for connecting flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], and the [[Kruger National Park]]. Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on [[History of South Africa|history]] museums, such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] (with related visits to [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]]) and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].

Visitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the [[Carlton Centre]], in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At {{convert|223|m|abbr=off}}, it is the highest office building in Africa, however soon to be eclipsed by [[The Leonardo (Sandton)]], and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. Also a large draw for tourists is [[Gold Reef City]], a [[theme park]] which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an [[gold mine|underground mine]] tour; other attractions include a large [[amusement park]] and a popular [[African dance|tribal dancing]] show.

On the culture front, the city has several [[art museum]]s, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The [[Joburg Theatre]] is South Africa's foremost [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|"receiving house"]] of live entertainment—presenting world class theatre, both local and international. The suburbs of [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], [[Parkhurst, Gauteng|Parkhurst]], [[Norwood, Gauteng|Norwood]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Greenside, Gauteng|Greenside]] are popular for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.

Shopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as [[Sandton City]], [[Mall of Africa]], and [[Nelson Mandela Square]], to various markets and [[flea market]]s, such as the [[Oriental Plaza]] and the [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank Flea Market]]; the latter are popular for souvenirs and [[African art]]. See [[#Retail|above]].

=== Parks and gardens ===
{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}
Parks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks|Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo]].<ref name="cityparks-whoweare">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world. It has been estimated that there are six million trees in the city with the number growing every year &nbsp;– 1.2&nbsp; million on pavements and sidewalks, and a further 4.8&nbsp;million in private gardens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/conf_expo/world_summit/urbanforest.htm|title=South Africa's official gateway - investment, travel, country information|accessdate=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203064143/http://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/conf_expo/world_summit/urbanforest.htm|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> City Parks continues to invest in planting trees, particularly those previously disadvantaged areas of Johannesburg which were not positive beneficiaries of apartheid Johannesburg's urban planning.

[[Johannesburg Botanical Garden]], located in the suburb of [[Emmarentia, Gauteng|Emmarentia]], is a popular recreational park.

== Sport ==
Johannesburg's most popular sports by participation are [[association football]], [[cricket]], [[rugby union]], and [[running]]. Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs.

=== Football ===

=== Cricket ===
Cricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the [[Highveld Lions]] represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the [[North West Province|North West]] at the [[Wanderers Stadium]] which was the venue for the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] Final in which [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] successfully defended their title against [[India national cricket team|India]]. Wanderers Stadium hosted what many cricket fans consider the greatest ever [[One Day International cricket|ODI]] match in which South Africa successfully chased down 434 runs.

[[File:The M2 in Johannesburg.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M2 (Johannesburg)|M2]] in the afternoon as it passes through the [[Central Business District (Johannesburg)|Central Business District]]]]
=== Transportation ===
Johannesburg is a young and sprawling city, with its public transportation built in its infancy, geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
==== Roads ====
{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}
[[File:N1 road South Africa.jpg|thumb|The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] is a major freeway in Johannesburg]]
Johannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]]. The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous "beltways" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank|eMalahleni]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, "The Concrete Highway". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=sanral>{{cite web|title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26|publisher=SA National Roads Agency|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> It is claimed<ref name=sanral/><ref>{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=18 perish in road accidents|url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=NewsDay|date=10 May 2013}}</ref> that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.

Johannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It has the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]], [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]], [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]], [[N17 road (South Africa)|N17]], [[R21 (Gauteng)|R21]], [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24]] and the [[R59 (Free State)|R59]], all leading to Johannesburg. The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] and [[M2 road (Johannesburg)|M2]] freeways were built to direct traffic towards the city centre. These two freeways are congested due to mass urbanisation.

==== Bus and taxi transit ====
Johannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by [http://www.mbus.co.za/ Metrobus], a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.

In 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount  ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5&nbsp; km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2|title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash|work=Fin24}}</ref>

Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase the use of metered taxis in the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The minibus "taxis" are the ''de facto'' standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s The minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by [[Taxi wars in South Africa|turf wars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yoinsta.com/tag/knysna|title=Posts filled under #knysna|last=YoInsta|website=yoinsta.com|access-date=28 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228112329/https://yoinsta.com/tag/knysna|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==== Rail ====
The [[Metrorail Gauteng]] [[commuter rail]] system connects central Johannesburg to [[Soweto]], [[Pretoria]], and most of the satellite towns along the [[Witwatersrand]]. The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], are served by the rapid [[railway|rail]] link [[Gautrain]].

[[File:Gautrain..., O R Tambo Intl Airport South Africa.jpg|thumb|left|Gautrain station at OR Tambo Airport]]
A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has made provision for a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the [[OR Tambo International Airport]]. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's [[Johannesburg Park Station|Park Station]] (underground), [[Rosebank (Gautrain station)|Rosebank]] (underground), [[Sandton (Gautrain station)|Sandton]] (underground), [[Marlboro (Gautrain station)|Marlboro]] (above-ground and raised), [[Midrand (Gautrain station)|Midrand]], [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria]] Station and [[Hatfield (Gautrain station)|Hatfield]]. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via [[Rhodesfield (Gautrain station)|Rhodesfield]] (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, and is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.

The east–west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north–the south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.

The rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Rapid Rail|url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/|publisher=Gautrain}}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new major railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Railway country. 150 Years of Rail in South Africa|url=http://www.transnetfreightrail-tfr.net/Heritage/150years/150YearsRail.pdf|publisher=Transnet}}</ref>

In 2010, a [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] was proposed between Johannesburg and [[Durban]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html|accessdate=19 September 2010|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding}}</ref> In 2020 the government announced plans for high-speed rail from Johannesburg to [[Soweto]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-10-25|title=South Africa’s Rail Expansion Plan Links Soweto to Johannesburg|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-25/south-africa-s-rail-expansion-plan-links-soweto-to-johannesburg|access-date=2020-10-25}}</ref> 

==== Freight ====
City Deep Terminal is the name of Africa's largest [[dry port]] and was officially opened by the South African Railways Services (SARS) in 1977. The container terminal is connected to the Port of Durban, Port of Ngqurha, Port of Cape Town, as well as Southern Africa by road and rail. At least forty percent of container export/imports run on the Natal Corridor (Natcor) which is directly linked by rail to City Deep.

==== Airports ====
Johannesburg is served principally by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first Boeing 747-200 ZS-SAN and also 747SP ZS-SPC and now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.

=== Telecommunication ===
Johannesburg has 4 major cellular telecommunications operators: [[Vodacom]], [[MTN Group|MTN]], [[Cell C]], and [[Telkom Mobile]]. Vodacom's global headquarters is located in [[Midrand]]. It was formed in 1994, just after the South African elections of 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanwireless.com/vodacom_history.htm|title=Vodacom History|publisher=Africanwireless.com|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref>

== Education ==
[[File:The Wits University East Campus (archived).jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of the Witwatersrand]]]]
Johannesburg has a well-developed higher education system of both [[private university|private]] and [[public university|public universities]]. Johannesburg is served by the public universities [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and the [[University of Johannesburg]].

[[University of Johannesburg]] was formed on 1 January 2005, when three separate universities and campuses—[[Rand Afrikaans University]], [[Technikon Witwatersrand]], and the Johannesburg campuses of [[Vista University]]—were merged.

===Print===
The city is home to several media groups which own a number of newspaper and magazine titles. The two main print media groups are Independent Newspapers and Naspers (Media24). The country's electronic media is also headquartered in the greater metropolitan region. ''[[Beeld]]'' is a leading Afrikaans newspaper for the city and the country,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} while the Sunday newspaper ''[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]'' is the third largest selling newspaper in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

''[[The Sowetan]]'' is one of a number of titles catering for the black market although in recent years it competes against newly arrived [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]]. The ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' is an investigative liberal newspaper while ''[[The Citizen (newspaper, South Africa)|The Citizen]]'' is a tabloid-style paper, and ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' is a local newspaper that mostly covers [[Gauteng]]-related issues.
