'''Pakistan'''<ref>As to official name being just "Pakistan" and not "Dominion of Pakistan": Indian Independence Act 1947, Section1.-(i) As from the fifteenth day of August, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, two independent Dominions shall be set up in India, to be known respectively as ''India'' and ''Pakistan''."</ref> ({{lang-ur|{{nq|مملکتِ پاکستان}}|mumlikāt-ē pākistān}}), also called the '''Dominion of Pakistan''', was an independent federal [[dominion]] in [[South Asia]] that was established in 1947 as a result of the [[Pakistan movement]], followed by the simultaneous [[partition of British India]] to create a new country called Pakistan. The dominion, which included much of modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], was conceived under the [[two-nation theory]] as an independent country composed of the Muslim-majority areas of the former [[British India]].

At the dominion's creation in 1947, it did not include the [[princely states of Pakistan]], which acceded slowly over the next year. Dominion status ended in 1956 with the creation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which was administratively split into [[West Pakistan]] and [[East Pakistan]]. In 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|East Pakistan seceded from the union]] to become Bangladesh.

==Partition of British India==
Section 1 of the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided that from "the fifteenth day of August, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, two independent dominions shall be set up in India, to be known respectively as ''India'' and ''Pakistan''." The [[Dominion of India]] held seventy-five percent of the territory and eighty percent of the population of the former [[British India]]. As it was already a member of the United Nations, India continued to hold its seat there and did not apply for a new membership. The British monarch became head of state of the new dominion, with Pakistan sharing a king with the United Kingdom and the other [[Dominion]]s of the British Commonwealth, but the monarch's constitutional roles were delegated to the [[Governor-General of Pakistan]], and most real powers resided with the new government headed by [[Jinnah]].

Before August 1947, about half of the area of present-day Pakistan was part of the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India]], in which the agents of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]] as [[Emperor of India]] had full authority, while the remainder were [[Princely states of Pakistan|princely states]] in [[subsidiary alliance]]s with the British, enjoying internal self-government. The British abandoned these alliances in August 1947, leaving the states entirely independent, and between 1947 and 1948 the states all acceded to Pakistan, while retaining internal self-government for several years.

==Territory==
{{main|Partition of India}}
The dominion began as a federation of five provinces: [[East Bengal]] (later to become [[Bangladesh]]), [[Punjab, Pakistan|West Punjab]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[Sindh]], and the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] (NWFP).  Each province had its own governor, who was appointed by the Governor-General of Pakistan. In addition, over the following year the princely states of Pakistan, which covered a significant area of West Pakistan, acceded to Pakistan. They included [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]], [[Khairpur (princely state)|Khairpur]], [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]], [[Dir (princely state)|Dir]], [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]], [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]], [[Makran (princely state)|Makran]], and the [[Kalat (princely state)|Khanate of Kalat]].

===Radcliffe Line===
{{main|Radcliffe Line}}
The controversial [[Radcliffe Award]], not published until 17 August 1947 specified the Radcliffe Line which demarcated the border between the parts of British India allocated to the two new independent [[Dominion of India|dominions of India]] and Pakistan. The Radcliffe Boundary Commission sought to separate the Muslim-majority regions in the east and northwest from the areas with a Hindu majority. This entailed the partition of two British provinces which did not have a uniform majority&nbsp;— [[Bengal]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The western part of Punjab became the Pakistani province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and the eastern part became the Indian state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. Bengal was similarly divided into [[East Bengal]] (in Pakistan) and [[West Bengal]] (in India).

==Reign of Elizabeth II==

During the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953, she was crowned as Queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries, including Pakistan,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGLN1kREJ2Q|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref> which was still a dominion at the time, whereas India was not, as the [[dominion of India]] had become a republic under the new Indian constitution of 1950.

Pakistan ceased being a dominion on [[Republic Day (Pakistan)|23 March 1956]] on the adoption of a [[Constitution of Pakistan|republican constitution]].<ref name="Bowman2000">{{cite book|author=John Stewart Bowman|title=Columbia chronologies of Asian history and culture|url=https://archive.org/details/columbiachronolo00john|url-access=registration|accessdate=22 March 2011|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11004-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/columbiachronolo00john/page/372 372]}}</ref> However, Pakistan became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth of Nations]].

The Queen visited Pakistan as [[Head of the Commonwealth]] in 1961 and 1997, accompanied by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].

Pakistan left the Commonwealth in 1972 over the issue of the former [[East Pakistan]] province becoming independent as Bangladesh. It rejoined in 1989, then was [[Suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations|suspended from the Commonwealth]] twice: firstly from 18 October 1999 to 22 May 2004 and secondly from 22 November 2007 to 22 May 2008.
