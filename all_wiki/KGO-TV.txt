'''KGO-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 7 ([[very high frequency|VHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 12), is an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], United States and serving the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The station is owned by the [[ABC Owned Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. KGO-TV's studios are located at the ABC Broadcast Center immediately west of San Francisco's [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] north of the city's [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]], and its transmitter is located atop [[Sutro Tower]].

==History==
KGO-TV first signed on the air on May 5, 1949 as the San Francisco Bay Area's second-oldest television station, signing on five months after [[KPIX-TV|KPIX]] (channel 5) and the 50th in the United States. In fact, KPIX had a hand in getting KGO-TV on the air, as the [[CBS]]-affiliated (and now CBS-owned) station produced informational programming on how to receive and view ABC's channel 7. KGO-TV's original studios were located in the renovated Sutro Mansion near [[Mount Sutro]] in San Francisco, next to the transmitter tower it shared with KPIX.

Channel 7 was the fourth of ABC's five original [[owned-and-operated station]]s to sign-on, after outlets in [[WABC-TV|New York City]], [[WLS-TV|Chicago]] and [[WXYZ-TV|Detroit]], and before [[KABC-TV|Los Angeles]]. In addition, it is the only ABC station to keep its original [[call signs in North America|call letters]], which were inherited from [[KGO (AM)|KGO radio]] (810 AM). In addition to airing ABC programming, KGO-TV also aired syndicated programs from the [[Paramount Television Network]]; among the Paramount programs aired were ''[[Time For Beany]]'',<ref name="TDR">{{cite news|title=Video Notes|last=Walker|first=Ellis|date=1953-12-21|work=The Daily Review|location=Hayward, CA}}</ref> ''Hollywood Reel'',<ref name="TT1950">{{cite news|title=Tonight on TV|date=1950-04-28|work=The Times|pages=15|location=San Mateo, CA}}</ref> ''Sandy Dreams'',<ref name="OT50">{{cite news|title=Show Time|last=Franklin|first=Bob|date=1950-11-16|work=Oakland Tribune|pages=63|location=Oakland, CA}}</ref> ''Hollywood Wrestling'',<ref name="billboard1955e">{{cite journal|date=1955-10-08|title=The Nation's Top Television Programs|journal=Billboard|pages=12}}</ref> and ''Cowboy G-Men''.<ref name="TOT1954">{{cite news|title=TV Programs|date=1954-05-12|work=The Oakland Tribune|pages=26 D|location=Oakland, CA}}</ref>

Channel 7 had a limited broadcasting schedule during its first year on the air. It was not until September 1950 that the station announced, in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]],'' that it would broadcast on all seven days of the week.<ref>''San Francisco Chronicle'', September 1950</ref> For much of the 1950s, the station signed on late in the morning or early afternoon, especially on the weekends, because the ABC network didn't offer many daytime programs then. For many years, Saturday programming began with ''King Norman's Kingdom of Toys'', a popular children's program hosted by the owner of a San Francisco toy store, Norman Rosenberg, from 1954 until 1961. He died in December 2016 at the age of 98.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 3, 2017|title=Bay Area children's TV show host 'King Norman' dies|url=https://abc7news.com/1685002/|access-date=2020-04-07|website=ABC 7 San Francisco|language=en}}</ref>

In 1954, KGO-TV moved to one of the most modern broadcasting facilities on the West Coast at the time at 277 Golden Gate Avenue, formerly known as the Eagle Building. The building was demolished between 2010 and 2011. As an ABC-owned station, KGO-TV originated a few network daytime shows, including programs hosted by fitness expert [[Jack La Lanne]], singer [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], and entertainer [[Gypsy Rose Lee]]. [[Television syndication|Syndicated]] [[game show]]s ''Oh My Word'' and ''The Anniversary Game'' were produced at KGO-TV by [[Production companies owned by the American Broadcasting Company#Circle Seven Productions|Circle Seven Productions]]. In the mid-1950s, KGO-TV telecast live weeknight [[variety show]]s hosted by KSFO [[disc jockey]] [[Don Sherwood (disc jockey)|Don Sherwood]], until Sherwood was fired for making a political comment in defiance of a warning from station management. In September 1962, KGO began carrying ABC's first [[color television|color]] program, the animated series ''[[The Jetsons]],'' followed by ''[[The Flintstones]]''. In the mid 1960s, KGO became the first Bay Area station to broadcast local programs in color, including its newscasts. In 1985, KGO-TV began broadcasting from its current studios at 900 Front Street, sharing the facility with radio stations KGO ([[KGO (AM)|AM 810]]), KSFO and KMKY (the former two are now owned by [[Cumulus Media]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.citadelbroadcasting.com/citadel_broadcasting.aspx?call=KGO |title=Station Search - Citadel Broadcasting<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708160028/http://www.citadelbroadcasting.com/citadel_broadcasting.aspx?call=KGO |archive-date=2011-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

By 2012, the radio stations had vacated 900 Front Street. In late 2014, [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[KRON-TV]] (channel 4) moved its operations from 1001 Van Ness Avenue, a building it had occupied since 1967, to the ABC Broadcast Center, leasing from KGO-TV/ABC the space on the third floor that had been occupied by the radio stations. KRON-TV also uses one of the two studios on the first floor for production of its news programming.

For most of its existence, KGO-TV was the only network-owned television station in the Bay Area, even throughout the time when ABC underwent ownership changes: [[Capital Cities Communications]] bought out ABC and merged with the network in 1985, the combined company Capital Cities/ABC was then sold to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996. As such, the station did not heavily preempt network programming unlike its local competitors or its sister stations—such as [[Philadelphia]]'s [[WPVI-TV]], [[Houston]]'s [[KTRK-TV]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]'s [[KFSN-TV]]—which were known for doing so in those days (as of 2007, some exceptions to this policy may be made when [[breaking news]] events or selected [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] programs warrant exclusive coverage, in which case [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KOFY-TV]] (channel 20), may pick up the pre-empted ABC programming scheduled for the time period). The distinction of being the Bay Area's only O&O station ended in 1995 when several other stations in the San Francisco-Oakland market became network-owned stations over the next twenty years—including KBHK (now [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]]) becoming a charter member of [[UPN]] (in which [[BHC Communications|the station's then-owner]] was a partner) in 1995, KPIX becoming a CBS O&O with the network's 1995 merger with Westinghouse, KNTV becoming an [[NBC]] O&O in 2002 after being bought by the network after it disaffiliated from [[KRON-TV]], and [[KTVU]] becoming a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] O&O in 2015 after being acquired by the [[Fox Television Stations|network]] alongside sister station [[KICU-TV]] a year prior (although KICU remains an independent station due to KRON-TV's affiliation with [[MyNetworkTV]]). After ABC sold Detroit's WXYZ-TV to [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps–Howard Broadcasting]] in 1986 as part of the Capital Cities/ABC merger, KGO-TV went on to be the longest-serving ABC O&O outside of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.

===KGO in the Salinas–Monterey–Santa Cruz market===
{{See also|KSBW}}
In 1999, KGO-TV—seeking to gain advertising revenue in the [[South Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|South Bay]]—reached an agreement with the [[Granite Broadcasting|Granite Broadcasting Corporation]], then-owner of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'s ABC affiliate [[KNTV]] to pay Granite to drop KNTV's ABC affiliation, resulting in KGO-TV becoming the network's exclusive Bay Area outlet. This resulted in the [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]–[[Monterey, California|Monterey]]–[[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] market losing over-the-air reception of ABC programs since KNTV had also served those communities (the station temporarily affiliated with [[The WB]], before replacing [[KRON-TV]] as the Bay Area's NBC affiliate in January 2002). In response, a [[cable television|cable]]-only ABC affiliate was set up for the areas affected, that simulcast KGO-TV's programming (including ABC programming and local newscasts), with the exception of programs that channel 7 was only allowed to show within the San Francisco market under [[syndication exclusivity]] rules. On December 20, 2010, [[Hearst Television]], owners of NBC affiliate [[KSBW]], signed an affiliation agreement with ABC to bring the network's programming to KSBW's second [[digital subchannel]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140356/http://www.ksbw.com/station/26197122/detail.html KSBW To Offer ABC, NBC Programming]</ref> The new subchannel (branded on-air as "Central Coast ABC") debuted on April 18, 2011, effectively displacing KGO from cable providers in California's [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]], which replaced the station with KSBW's ABC-affiliated subchannel.

===Logos===
KGO-TV was one of the earliest ABC stations to use the original [[Circle 7 logo]] (along with sister station WBKB (now [[WLS-TV]]) in Chicago). According to ''Broadcasting'' magazine, KGO unveiled this logo, created by San Francisco design consultant [[G. Dean Smith]], on August 27, 1962.<ref>"[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1962/1962-08-27-BC.pdf New '7' Logo Designed for KGO-TV (ch. 7)]," Broadcasting, Aug. 27, 1962, p. 72.</ref> When the station incorporated ABC into its branding in the late 1990s (initially as "Channel 7 ABC" from 1996 to 1997, then as "ABC 7"), the station—along with several other ABC stations broadcasting on channel 7 that used the original version of the Circle 7 logo—simply attached the ABC logo to the Circle 7.

====Localish====
In May 2010, KGO-TV began carrying the Disney/ABC-owned Live Well HD (later Live Well Network, now [[Localish]]) on its second [[digital subchannel]]; KGO-TV also produces the cooking show ''Good Cookin' with Bruce Aidells'' for the network. In 2007, KGO was among the few commercial television stations in California that scheduled an alternative set of programs on a digital subchannel; at the time, the 7.2 subchannel ran simulcasts and rebroadcasts of most KGO newscasts and other locally produced programs, along with repeats of [[ABC News]] programs in non-traditional timeslots (for example, the weeknight editions of ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' aired at 7 p.m., while ''[[Nightline]]'' aired most weekdays at 9 a.m. and 7:30&nbsp;p.m.). Some programs seen on channel 7.2, such as the ''[[Commonwealth Club of California|Commonwealth Club]] Speaker's Luncheon'' and reruns of the 1960s ABC primetime western ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'', were not shown on Channel 7.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KGO-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 7, on June 12, 2009, as part of the [[Digital television transition in the United States|federally mandated transition from analog to digital television]].<ref name="Analog to Digital">[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf List of Digital Full-Power Stations]</ref> The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition [[UHF]] channel 24 to VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations.<ref name="FCCForm387">[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101234084&formid=387&fac_num=34470 CDBS Print<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As a result, KGO-TV is the only Bay Area television station to retain the same channel allocation post-transition and the only other station alongside KNTV to remain on the VHF dial (KQED moved from VHF channel 9 to UHF channel 30).

KGO-TV has a construction permit for a fill-in translator on UHF Channel 35, serving the southern portion of the viewing area, including San Jose,<ref>https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101329805&formid=346&fac_num=34470</ref> for antenna viewers, until the [[digital transition]]. It has since returned to RF channel 7. RF 7 is a VHF channel; its reception can be difficult for people with UHF HDTV antennas.

==Programming==
[[File:At San Francisco 2015 029.jpg|thumb|Antennas outside the KGO studios in San Francisco]]

The station carries a high-profile lineup of daytime programming with shows such as ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (the first program is distributed by the station's corporate cousin, [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]], while the latter two are distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]] and produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]]). Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune have aired on KGO-TV since both shows moved to the station from [[KRON-TV]] in 1992. ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' aired on KGO-TV throughout the program's tenure from 1986 to 2011. The station was among the handful of ABC affiliates to have aired the syndicated ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', first-run on the network, until the game show's cancellation in 2019. It also paired ''[[The Phil Donahue Show|Donahue]]'' with ''Oprah'' on the station's afternoon lineup in the late 1980s, after the station acquired ''Donahue'' from KTVU; however, in the fall of 1995, KGO-TV became the first affiliate in the country to drop the talk show, one year before its cancellation ([[New York City]]'s NBC O&O [[WNBC]] dropped ''Donahue'' as well shortly afterwards, even though the program originated from WNBC's studios at [[Rockefeller Center]] during this era).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- About Donahue -->

KGO also airs the pre-show of the [[Academy Awards]] (which is produced by Los Angeles sister station [[KABC-TV]]). The station had sometimes aired the [[Bay to Breakers]] race during the 1980s, and the ''KGO Cure-a-thon'' with its radio partner, [[KGO (AM)|KGO-AM 810]]. KGO-TV was the first station to produce documentaries of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] on April 8, 2006.

In the 1970s and 1980s, KGO-TV produced weekday talk/variety shows in the 9:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot following ''[[Good Morning America]]''. ''A.M. San Francisco'' ran from 1975 to 1987/1988, when it was replaced by ''Good Morning, Bay Area'', hosted by Susan Sikora. Hosts of ''A.M. San Francisco'' included the husband-and-wife team of Fred LaCosse and Terry Lowry (other ABC owned-and-operated stations produced their own ''A.M.'' programs in the 1980s; for example, ''A.M. Chicago'' at WLS-TV evolved into ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', and ''Live with Kelly and Ryan'' evolved from a similar ''A.M.'' program on WABC). For a week or two in the summer of 1988, ''A.M. Los Angeles'' was simulcast on KGO-TV, with a few KGO-TV produced segments.

===Sports programming===
Owing to its common ownership with [[ESPN]], Channel 7 holds the right of first refusal to ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games involving the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The station carried coverage of the 49ers' victories in [[Super Bowl XIX]], which was played locally at [[Stanford Stadium]], and [[Super Bowl XXIX]]. Also, Channel 7 airs ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' contests involving the [[Golden State Warriors]] via the network's contract with the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. KGO-TV has aired the Warriors' championship victories in the [[2015 NBA Finals|2015]], [[2017 NBA Finals|2017]] and [[2018 NBA Finals]].

The station [[Major League Baseball on ABC|carried]] the [[1989 World Series]], a matchup between the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] and [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] which would be interrupted by the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] shortly before Game 3 was to begin at [[Candlestick Park]].

===''The View from the Bay''===
From June 26, 2006 to September 10, 2010, KGO-TV broadcast a locally produced weekday variety show called ''[[The View from the Bay]]'', hosted by [[Spencer Christian]] and [[Janelle Wang]]. The hour-long show focused on local attractions as well as interviews and other interests in the Bay Area. Aimed at female viewers, the show aired weekdays at 3 p.m., and was also live streamed online.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222045028/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/channel?section=view_from_the_bay&id=5755208 http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/channel?section=view_from_the_bay&id=5755208]</ref> Los Angeles sister station KABC-TV also aired the program weeknights at 10 p.m. on its second digital subchannel, with the program also airing at various times on digital subchannels of other ABC O&O stations. The program was also syndicated to the Live Well Network in 2010, retitled as ''Everyday Living''.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20100726032410/http://livewellhd.com/everydayliving/channel?id=7186766</ref>

===''7 Live''===
''The View from the Bay'' was replaced by a new local afternoon talk program called ''7 Live'' on September 13, 2010 (which was similar in format to one of [[MSNBC]]'s earliest programs, ''[[The Site]]''), taking the former program's previous 3 p.m. timeslot. The program was hosted by longtime KGO-AM radio host [[Brian Copeland]] and Lizzie Bermudez, who stood at a computerized podium and alternatively acted as "sidekick" or "sounding board" to Copeland and shared material from her computer; Bermudez focused on technology and pop culture segments. ''7 Live'' had an innovative format with a studio audience called "The Voice Box" and viewer-submitter e-mail, Facebook and Twitter comments that were read by the hosts during the program. Copeland spent most of the program walking about the studio, peppering his material with humorous comments. Each edition of ''7 Live'' generally ended with Copeland sharing a "Thought of the Day."{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->

Jennifer Jolly served as the technology/social media co-host from a computerized podium (on a par with Bermudez) from its premiere until August 2011, when she became a frequent technology and social media guest contributor for the now-defunct CBS morning news program, ''[[The Early Show]]''. The program played off the "seven" theme by sometimes incorporating a seven-item list (referred to as "The List") into the program. ''7 Live'' was canceled by KGO, due to low ratings, airing its last broadcast on April 27, 2012.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->

==News operation==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KGO open.png|225px|thumb|right|KGO's former newscast title card; seen nightly at 11.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 19 December 2016}}]] -->
KGO-TV presently broadcasts 42½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). KGO-TV also produced an hour-long 9 p.m. newscast for independent station [[KOFY-TV]] (channel 20) from January 8, 2007 until July 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 30, 2019|title=Two ABC O&O's end live news on their partner stations|url=https://changingnewscasts.wordpress.com/2019/07/30/two-abc-oando-end-news-partner-stations/|website=changing news casts}}</ref> The program usually rebroadcast stories previously shown during the 6 p.m. newscast and national and international news reports from ABC News.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->

KGO-TV had followed the lead of its [[New York City]] sister station, [[WABC-TV]], and adopted the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format for its newscasts in the late 1960s; however, the ''Eyewitness News'' title had already been used on KPIX-TV at that time until 2013, which inherited its version of the format from its Philadelphia sister station [[KYW-TV]]. As a result, KGO-TV instead called its newscasts ''Channel 7 News Scene'' throughout the 1970s, and ''Channel 7 News'' from 1982 to 1998, when it switched to the current ''ABC 7 News'' branding. Along with the other ABC O&Os, KGO-TV also used an edited version of the "Tar Sequence" from the soundtrack of ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' as the theme music for its newscasts starting in 1969.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- The whole paragraph --> After its [[Chicago]] sister station, [[WLS-TV]], began to reuse the ''Eyewitness News'' branding, KGO-TV became the only ABC O&O that does not use the ''Eyewitness News'' or ''Action News'' brand for its newscasts as with other ABC O&O stations.

The station broadcast a 4:30&nbsp;p.m. newscast named ''Early News'' in 1970, anchored by Ray Tannehill and [[John Reed King]], with [[Pete Giddings]] covering weather and [[Bob Fouts]] presenting sports. Lu Hurley provided live helicopter traffic coverage, one of the first television programs in the San Francisco Bay Area to offer traffic reports. KGO-TV was one of the last ABC affiliates that broadcast the network's evening news program in the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot. By early 1992, ''World News Tonight'' had been displaced to 5:30&nbsp;p.m., replacing the last half of the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. news hour. KGO-TV has long broadcast an 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast; it was originally a half-hour program, before expanding to 35 minutes in the early 1990s. In the 2000s, a staple of the 11 p.m. Sunday newscast was Richard Hart's segment about technological developments, alternatively titled "Next Step" and "Drive to Discover."{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->

The station currently utilizes the market's first helicopter equipped to shoot and transmit [[High-definition television|high definition]] video, branded as "Sky 7HD", which made its on-air debut in February 2006. Due to logistical and equipment limitations, video from the helicopter is only available in [[4:3]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] at times (when this occurs, the helicopter is branded simply "Sky 7"). KGO became the second television station in the Bay Area (after [[KTVU]]) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[standard-definition television|high definition]] on February 17, 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->

On July 20, 2007, longtime evening news anchor and KGO radio talk show host [[Pete Wilson (broadcaster)|Pete Wilson]] died at age 62, following a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] that he suffered during a hip replacement procedure at [[Stanford University Medical Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California]]. The station aired extensive tributes to Wilson when his death was publicly announced the following day. His final newscast and radio show were on July 18, 2007.

In 2008, KGO became the first station in the market to start its early morning newscast before 5 a.m., with the expansion of its weekday morning program to 4:30&nbsp;a.m. Around that same time and prompted by a sluggish economy and the station's conversion to the "Ignite" automated control room system, on May 26, 2011, KGO debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast, which filled the timeslot formerly held by ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' (which ended its 25-year syndication run the previous day).<ref>[https://archive.today/20130205124520/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/51351/kgo-san-francisco-launching-4-pm-news KGO San Francisco Launching 4 P.M.

KGO broadcast a special seven-minute "minicast" at midnight during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], called ''ABC 7 News Special Edition'', as an effort to counterprogram the special midnight local newscast on NBC-owned [[KNTV]] that followed the network's primetime Olympics coverage. The special newscast did not air on nights when NBC's Olympic coverage ended before midnight (August 8, for example, resulting in no KGO midnight newscast on August 9). At least one other ABC-owned station, [[KABC-TV]] downstate in Los Angeles, also produced a seven-minute midnight newscast during the 2012 Olympics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- The whole paragraph --> On August 8, 2014, KGO struck a partnership with [[Univision]] O&O [[KDTV-DT]] to cross-promote newscast and share news context second behind its Philadelphia sister station [[WPVI-TV]] which in December partnered with [[WUVP-DT]] to produce a live 11 p.m. newscast.<ref>{{Cite web|title=KGO–TV & KDTV work together|url=http://corporate.univision.com/2014/08/abc-kgo-tv-and-univision-kdtv-tv-work-together-to-better-serve-the-bay-area/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814055335/http://corporate.univision.com/2014/08/abc-kgo-tv-and-univision-kdtv-tv-work-together-to-better-serve-the-bay-area/|archive-date=2014-08-14|access-date=2014-08-13|website=corporate univision}}</ref>
