'''''The Road to Serfdom''''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Der Weg zur Knechtschaft'') is a book written between 1940 and 1943 by Austrian-British [[economist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Since its publication in 1944, ''The Road to Serfdom'' has been an influential and popular exposition of [[liberalism]]. It has been translated into more than 20 languages and sold over two million copies (as of 2010).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo4138549.html|title=The Road to Serfdom|last=|first=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2006/12/thefadingoffriedman/|title=The fading of Friedman|author=Paul Ormerod|authorlink=Paul Ormerod|date=16 December 2006|publisher=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]|accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books|title=Bestsellers in Books|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=10 December 2010|quote=On 9 June 2010, the book became the #1 book sold at Amazon.com, achieving [[Bestseller|best seller]] status.}}</ref> The book was first published in Britain by [[Routledge]] in March 1944, during [[World War II]], and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it "that unobtainable book", also due in part to wartime paper rationing.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Ebenstein|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp8Uq8ve3EsC&pg=PA128 128]}}</ref> It was published in the United States by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in September 1944 and achieved great popularity. At the arrangement of editor [[Max Eastman]], the American magazine ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling ''The Road to Serfdom'' to reach a wider popular audience beyond academics.

''The Road to Serfdom'' was to be the popular edition of the second volume of Hayek's treatise entitled "The Abuse and Decline of Reason",<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Ebenstein|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp8Uq8ve3EsC&pg=PA107 107]}}</ref> and the title was inspired by the writings of the 19th century French classical liberal thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] on the "road to servitude".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp8Uq8ve3EsC&pg=PA116|title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2003|isbn=9780226181509|page=116}}</ref> In the book, Hayek {{nowrap|"[warns]}} of the danger of [[tyranny]] that inevitably results from government control of economic [[decision-making]] through [[Planned economy|central planning]]."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ebeling|first=Richard M.|date=May 1999|title=Friedrich A.

Hayek challenged the view among British Marxists that [[fascism]] (including [[Nazism]]) was a [[capitalist]] reaction against [[socialism]]. He argued that fascism, Nazism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual. 

Initially written as a response to the [[Beveridge Report|report]] written by [[William Beveridge]], the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician and dean of the [[London School of Economics]] where Hayek worked at the time, the book made a significant impact on 20th-century political discourse, especially American [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] economic and political debate, being often cited today by commentators. Subject to much attention, the ideas advocated in ''The Road to Serfdom'' have been criticized and defended by many academics since the book was published.

== Publication ==
Writing in the era of the [[Great Depression]], the rise of autocracies in [[Soviet Union|Russia]], [[National Fascist Party#Fascist government|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], and [[World War II]], Hayek  wrote a memo to the director of the [[London School of Economics]], [[William Beveridge]], in the early 1930s to dispute the then-popular claim that [[fascism]] represented the dying gasp of a failed [[capitalist system]]. The memo grew into a magazine article, and he intended to incorporate elements of the article into a book much larger than ''The Road to Serfdom''. However, he ultimately decided to write ''The Road to Serfdom'' as its own book.

The book was originally published for a British audience by [[Routledge Press]] in March 1944 in the United Kingdom. The book was subsequently rejected by three publishers in the United States<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|pp=1}}</ref>, and it was only after economist [[Aaron Director]] spoke to friends at the University of Chicago that the book was published in the U.S by the [[University of Chicago Press]] on September 18, 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/04/040913.director.shtml|title=Aaron Director, Founder of the field of Law and Economics|website=www-news.uchicago.edu|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/320553.html|title=The Publication History of The Road to Serfdom by F.

But the initial printing run of 2,000 copies was quickly sold out, and 30,000 copies were sold within six months. {{As of|2007|alt=In 2007}}, the University of Chicago Press estimated that more than 350,000 copies had been sold.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qg61T_I1mwsC&pg=PA1 1]}}</ref>

A 20-page version of the book was then published in the April 1945 issue of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'',<ref>{{OCLC|76656715 }}</ref> with a press run of several million copies. A 95-page abridged version was also published in 1945 and 1946.<ref>{{OCLC|802584460|13355651}}</ref> In February 1945, a picture-book version was published in [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'' magazine]], later made into a [[pamphlet]] and distributed by [[General Motors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorersfoundation.org/glyphery/62.html|title=The Road to Serfdom, by F.

The introduction to the 50th anniversary edition is written by [[Milton Friedman]] (another recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] 1976).

In 2007, the University of Chicago Press issued a "Definitive Edition", Volume 2 in the ''Collected Works of F. A. Hayek'' series. In June 2010, the book achieved new popularity by rising to the top of the [[Amazon.com]] bestseller list following extended coverage of the book on ''[[The Glenn Beck Program]]''. Since that date, it has sold another 250,000 copies in its print and digital editions.

== Summary ==
Hayek argues that [[Western democracies]], including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], have "progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and political freedom has never existed in the past".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=16}}</ref> Society has mistakenly tried to ensure continuing prosperity by centralized planning, which inevitably leads to totalitarianism. "We have in effect undertaken to dispense with the forces which produced unforeseen results and to replace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism of the market by collective and ‘conscious’ direction of all social forces to deliberately chosen goals."<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=24}}</ref> Socialism, while presented as a means of assuring equality, does so through "restraint and servitude", while "democracy seeks equality in liberty".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=29}}</ref> Planning, because it is coercive, is an inferior method of regulation, while the competition of a [[free market]] is superior "because it is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=41}}</ref>

[[Centralized planning]] is inherently undemocratic in Hayek's view, because it requires "that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=77}}</ref> The power of these minorities to act by taking money or property in pursuit of centralized goals, destroys the Rule of Law and individual freedoms.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|pp=80–96}}</ref> Where there is centralized planning, "the individual would more than ever become a mere means, to be used by the authority in the service of such abstractions as the '[[social welfare]]' or the 'good of the community'".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=106}}</ref> Even the very poor have more personal freedom in an open society than a centrally planned one.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=115}}</ref> "While the last resort of a competitive economy is the [[bailiff]], the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is the hangman."<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=139}}</ref> Socialism is a hypocritical system, because its professed humanitarian goals can only be put into practice by brutal methods "of which most socialists disapprove".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=191}}</ref> Such centralized systems also require effective propaganda, so that the people come to believe that the state's goals are theirs.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=168}}</ref>

Hayek argues that the roots of National Socialism lie in socialism,<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|pp=1183–198}}</ref> and then draws parallels to the thought of British leaders:
<blockquote>The increasing veneration for the state, the admiration of power, and of bigness for bigness' sake, the enthusiasm for "organization" of everything (we now call it "planning") and that "inability to leave anything to the simple power of organic growth"&nbsp;... are all scarcely less marked in England now than they were in Germany.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=200}}</ref></blockquote>

Hayek believed that after World War II, "wisdom in the management of our economic affairs will be even more important than before and that the fate of our civilization will ultimately depend on how we solve the economic problems we shall then face".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=128}}</ref> The only chance to build a decent world is "to improve the general level of wealth" via the activities of [[free market]]s.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=230}}</ref> He saw international organization as involving a further threat to individual freedom.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|pp=240–260}}</ref> He concluded: "The guiding principle that a policy of freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy remains as true today as it was in the nineteenth century."<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=262}}</ref>

=== Role of government ===
Although Hayek believed that government intervention in markets would lead to a loss of freedom, he recognized a limited role for government to perform tasks for which he believed free markets were not capable:
<blockquote>The successful use of competition as the principle of social organization precludes certain types of coercive interference with economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes may very considerably assist its work and even requires certain kinds of government action.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=42}}</ref></blockquote>

While Hayek is opposed to regulations that restrict the freedom to enter a trade, or to buy and sell at any price, or to control quantities, he acknowledges the utility of regulations that restrict legal methods of production, so long as these are applied equally to everyone and not used as an indirect way of controlling prices or quantities, and without forgetting the cost of such restrictions:
<blockquote>To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of competition. The only question here is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the [[social costs]] they impose.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=43}}</ref></blockquote>

He notes that there are certain areas, such as the environment, where activities that cause damage to third parties (known to economists as "negative [[externalities]]") cannot effectively be regulated solely by the marketplace:
<blockquote>Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question, or to those willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=44}}</ref></blockquote>

The government also has a role in preventing fraud:
<blockquote>Even the most essential prerequisite of its [the market's] proper functioning, the prevention of fraud and deception (including exploitation of ignorance), provides a great and by no means fully accomplished object of legislative activity.<ref name="HayekThe">{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=45}}</ref></blockquote>

The government also has a role in creating a safety net:
<blockquote>There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/hayek_on_social_insurance.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Hayek on Social Insurance}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/opinion/krugman-free-to-die.html Free to Die] By PAUL KRUGMAN, New York Times, 15 September 2011</ref></blockquote>

He concludes: "In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing."<ref name="HayekThe"/>

=== Clarifications ===
Since publication, Hayek has offered a number of clarifications on words that are frequently misinterpreted:
* "Socialism", as Hayek used it, refers to [[state socialism]] and is used to mean state control of the economy, not a [[welfare state]]<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|pp=54–55}} From the preface to the 1976 edition.</ref>
* "Classical liberal ideals", means [[liberty]], [[freedom]] and [[individual rights]], as Hayek understood them<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|p=45}} From the foreword to the 1956 American paperback edition.</ref>

The Labour leader [[Clement Attlee]] responded in his election broadcast by claiming that what Churchill had said was the "second-hand version of the academic views of an Austrian professor, Friedrich August von Hayek".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertystory.net/LSTHINKHAYEKLIFE.htm|title=Hayek, life and times|publisher=libertystory.net|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> The [[Conservative Central Office]] sacrificed 1.5 tons of their precious paper ration allocated for the 1945 election so that more copies of ''The Road to Serfdom'' could be printed, although to no avail, as Labour won a landslide victory.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[David Willetts]]|author2=Richard Forsdyke|title=After the Landslide: Learning the Lessons of 1906 and 1945|publisher=Centre for Policy Studies|date=1999|page=59|url=https://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111221165304-Afterthelandslidesep1999DavidWilletts.pdf|type=PDF}}</ref>

Political historian [[Alan Brinkley]] had this to say about the impact of ''The Road to Serfdom'':<ref name=hayekcenterpage5 />
<blockquote>The publication of two books&nbsp;... helped to galvanize the concerns that were beginning to emerge among intellectuals (and many others) about the implications of [[totalitarianism]]. One was [[James Burnham]]’s [[The Managerial Revolution]]&nbsp;... [A second] Friedrich A. Hayek’s ''The Road to Serfdom''&nbsp;... was far more controversial—and influential. Even more than Burnham, Hayek forced into public discourse the question of the compatibility of democracy and [[statism]]&nbsp;... In responding to Burnham and Hayek&nbsp;... liberals [in the statist sense of this term as used by some in the United States] were in fact responding to a powerful strain of Jeffersonian anti-statism in American political culture&nbsp;... The result was a subtle but important shift in liberal [i.e. American statist] thinking.</blockquote>

=== Reviews ===
''The Road to Serfdom'' has been the subject of much praise and much criticism. It was placed fourth on the list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the 20th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/100best/100_books.html|title=NR's List of the 100 Best Non-Fiction Books of the Century|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317101120/http://old.nationalreview.com/100best/100_books.html|archivedate=2011-03-17|work=National Review|publisher=townhall.com}}</ref> compiled by ''[[National Review]]'' magazine, was ranked number 16 in reader selections of the hundred best non-fiction book of the twentieth century administered by [[Modern Library]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnonfiction.html |title=100 list of the 100 best non-fiction books by Modern Library |publisher=Random House|date= |accessdate=2012-06-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013605/http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction|archivedate=2012-03-06}}</ref> and appears on a recommended reading list for the [[libertarian right]] hosted on the [[Political Compass]] test website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicalcompass.org/libRightBooks|title=The Political Compass|last=Compass|first=The Political|website=www.politicalcompass.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref>

[[John Maynard Keynes]] said of it: "In my opinion it is a grand book&nbsp;... Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it: and not only in agreement with it, but in deeply moved agreement."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Thomas W. Hazlett|issue=July 1992|url=http://reason.com/hayekint.shtml|title=The Road from Serfdom – Forseeing the Fall F.A. Hayek interviewed by Thomas W.

Your greatest danger ahead is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States."<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth R.

[[George Orwell]] responded with both praise and criticism, stating, "in the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often – at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough – that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of." Yet he also warned, "[A] return to 'free' competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than that of the state."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Review of the Road to Serfdom by F. A. Hayek, etc|journal=As I Please, 1943–1945: The Collected Essays, Journalism & Letters|volume=3}}</ref>

[[Milton Friedman]] described ''The Road to Serfdom'' as "one of the great books of our time," and said of it:
<blockquote>I think the Adam Smith role was played in this cycle [i.e. the late twentieth century collapse of socialism in which the idea of free-markets succeeded first, and then special events catalyzed a complete change of socio-political policy in countries around the world] by Friedrich Hayek’s ''The Road to Serfdom''.<ref name=hayekcenterpage5>{{cite web |url=http://hayekcenter.org/?page_id=5 |title=Quotes on Hayek |website=hayekcenter.org}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Herman Finer]], a [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] socialist, published a rebuttal in his ''The Road to Reaction'' in 1946. Hayek called Finer's book "a specimen of abuse and invective which is probably unique in contemporary academic discussion".<ref>{{cite journal|author=George H. Nash|url=http://www.isi.org/lectures/text/pdf/hayek4-3-04.pdf|title=Hayek and the American Conservative Movement|date=3 April 2004|location=Indianapolis}}</ref>

In his review (collected in ''The Present as History'', 1953) [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Paul Sweezy]] joked that Hayek would have you believe that if there was an over-production of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] arguments of [[Stafford Beer]] in his 1973 CBC Massey Lectures, ''Designing Freedom'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-1973-cbc-massey-lectures-designing-freedom-1.2946819|title=The 1973 CBC Massey Lectures, "Designing Freedom"|website=cbc.ca}}</ref> – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of [[Herbert A. Simon]] and [[Albert Ando]] on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.<ref>See (full references on [[Herbert A. Simon]] entry) Simon's papers in his collected ''Models of Bounded Rationality'', a qualitative discussion in his ''Sciences of the Artificial'', and a full presentation of the mathematical theory by P.J. Courtois in his ''Decomposability: queueing and computer system applications'' (Academic Press, 1977). The papers in the section "The Structure of Causal Systems" of Vol. 3 of ''Models of Bounded Rationality'' (MIT Press, 1997) provide a summary and review of Simon's work in this area.</ref>

[[Mises Institute]] economist [[Walter Block]] has observed critically that while ''The Road to Serfdom'' makes a strong case against centrally planned economies, it appears only lukewarm in its support of a [[free market]] system and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], with Hayek even going so far as to say that "probably nothing has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez-faire capitalism". In the book, Hayek writes that the government has a role to play in the economy through the monetary system (a view that he later withdrew),<ref>{{cite book|author=Friedrich August von Hayek|title=The Denationalization of Money – The Argument Refined – An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Denationalisation%20of%20Money%20The%20Argument%20Refined_5.pdf?file=1&type=document|isbn=9781610165204|publisher=The Institute Of Economic Affairs|date=1990}}</ref> work-hours regulation, social welfare, and institutions for the flow of proper information. Through analysis of this and many other of Hayek's works, Block asserts that: "in making the case against socialism, Hayek was led into making all sort of compromises with what otherwise appeared to be his own philosophical perspective – so much so, that if a system was erected on the basis of them, it would not differ too sharply from what this author explicitly opposed".<ref name=blockserfdom>{{Cite journal | last = Block | first = Walter | authorlink = Walter Block | title = Hayek's Road to Serfdom | journal = [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 339–365 | publisher = [[Center for Libertarian Studies]] | year = 1996 | url = https://mises.org/journals/jls/12_2/12_2_6.pdf | accessdate = 2010-02-17}}</ref>

=== Criticism ===
[[Jeffrey Sachs]] argues that [[empirical evidence]] suggests [[welfare state]]s, with high rates of taxation and social outlays, outperform the comparatively free-market economies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Jeffrey Sachs]]|date=October 2006|title=The Social Welfare State, beyond Ideology|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-social-welfare-state|journal=[[Scientific American]]}}</ref> [[William Easterly]] wrote a rebuttal criticizing Sachs for misrepresenting Hayek's work and for criticizing the book on issues it did not actually address, such as welfare programs for the elderly or sick, something Hayek was not entirely opposed to. Easterly noted that the Road to Serfdom was about the dangers of centralized planning and nationalization of industry, including the media.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116355956112023480|title=Dismal Science''|author=[[William Easterly]]|date=15 November 2006|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> In Sachs' counter-rebuttal, he argued that he was addressing Hayek's forward in the 1976 adaptation which stated that efforts to bring about large-scale welfare states would bring about serfdom, although much more slowly than under centralized planning. Sachs cited the Nordic states which remained economically free and relatively capitalist, despite a large welfare state that Hayek was wrong about such programs leading to serfdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/sachs-on-hayek-and-easterly.html|title=Why Hayek Was Wrong: Sachs Responds to Easterly|author=Greg Mankiw|date=27 November 2006|work=Greg Mankiw's Blog – Random Observations for Students of Economics}}</ref> 

[[Gordon Tullock]] has argued Hayek's analysis incorrectly predicted governments in much of Europe in the late 20th century would descend into [[totalitarianism]]. He uses [[Sweden]], in which the government at that time controlled 63 percent of [[GNP]], as an example to support his argument that the basic problem with ''The Road to Serfdom'' is "that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any loss of non-economic freedoms." While criticizing Hayek, Tullock still praises the classical liberal notion of economic freedom, saying, "Arguments for political freedom are strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn’t make one set of arguments depend on the other."<ref name="Tullock">{{cite book|title=Freedom Democracy and Economic Welfare|date=5–8 October 1986|publisher=[[The Fraser Institute]]|editor-last=Walker|editor-first=Michael A.|series=Proc. of an International Symposium on Economic, Political, and Civil Freedom|place=[[Napa Valley, California|Napa Valley]]|page=61|contribution=Freedom, Democracy, and Economic Welfare|postscript=<!--None-->|accessdate=2010-04-12|contribution-url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/research-news/display.aspx?id=13053|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310081028/http://www.fraserinstitute.org/research-news/display.aspx?id=13053|archivedate=2012-03-10}}</ref> However, according to [[Robert Skidelsky]], Hayek "safeguarded himself from such retrospective refutation". Skidelsky argues that Hayek's argument was contingent, and that, "By the 1970s there was some evidence of the slippery slope&nbsp;... and then there was [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]. Hayek's warning played a critical part in her determination to 'roll back the state.'"<ref name="Skidelsky">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-R9tSD1cK0C|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hayek|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9781139827584|editor-last=Feser|editor-first=Edward|pages=82–110|postscript=<!--None-->|author-link=Robert Skidelsky}}</ref>

Economic sociologist [[Karl Polanyi]] made a case diametrically opposed to Hayek, arguing that unfettered markets had undermined the social order and that economic breakdown had paved the way for the emergence of dictatorship.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/greattransformat00karl|title=The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time|author1=Karl Polanyi|author2=Joseph E.

[[Barbara Wootton]] wrote ''Freedom under Planning''<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chester I. Barnard|date=January 1946|title=Freedom under planning|journal=Southern Economic Journal|publisher=Southern Economic Association|volume=12|issue=3|doi=10.2307/1052278|jstor=1052278|pp=290–300}}</ref> after reading an early copy of ''The Road to Serfdom'', provided to her by Hayek. In the introduction to her book, Wootton mentioned ''The Road to Serfdom'' and claimed that "Much of what I have written is devoted to criticism of the views put forward by Professor Hayek in this and other books."{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=5}} The central argument made in ''Freedom under Planning'' is that "there is nothing in the conscious planning of economic priorities which is inherently incompatible with the freedoms which mean most to the contemporary Englishman or American. [[Civil liberties]] are quite unaffected. We can, if we wish, deliberately plan so as to give the fullest possible scope for the pursuit by individuals and social groups of cultural ends which are in no way state-determined."{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=158}} Wootton criticizes Hayek for claiming that planning ''must'' lead to oppression, when, in her view, that is merely one ''possibility'' among many. She argues that "there seems hardly better case for taking for granted that planning will bring the worst to the top than for the opposite assumption that the seats of office will be filled with angels".{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=163}} Thus, Wootton acknowledges the possibility that planning may exist alongside tyranny, but claims that it is equally possible to combine planning with freedom. She concludes that "A happy and fruitful marriage between freedom and planning can, in short, be arranged."{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=159}} However, [[Frank Knight]], founder of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school of economics]], disputes the claim that ''Freedom under Planning'' contradicts ''The Road to Serfdom''. He wrote in a scholarly review of the Wootton book: "Let me repeat that the Wootton book is in no logical sense an answer to ''The Road to Serfdom'', whatever may be thought of the cogency of Hayek's argument, or the soundness of his position."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Knight, Frank|authorlink=Frank Knight|year=1946|title=Freedom Under Planning|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=54|issue=5|pages=451–454|doi=10.1086/256402}}</ref>

[[Eric Zencey]] wrote that the free market economy Hayek advocated is designed for an infinite planet, and when it runs into physical limits (as any growing system must), the result is a need for centralized planning to mediate the problematic interface of economy and nature. "Planning is planning, whether it's done to minimize [[poverty]] and injustice, as socialists were advocating then, or to preserve the minimum flow of [[ecosystem services]] that civilization requires, as we are finding increasingly necessary today."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=20 April 2010|title=The Other Road to Serfdom|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/4/22/858654/-The-Other-Road-to-Serfdom-|publisher=[[The Daily Kos]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>
