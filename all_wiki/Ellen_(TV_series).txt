'''''Ellen''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] that aired on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network|network]] from March 29, 1994, to July 22, 1998, consisting of 109 episodes. The title role is Ellen Morgan, played by [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] [[Ellen DeGeneres]], a [[neuroticism|neurotic]] [[bookstore]] owner in her thirties. The title of the series was '''''These Friends of Mine''''' for the first season, but it was subsequently changed to avoid confusion with the [[NBC]] series ''[[Friends]]'', which premiered in September 1994.

The series centered on Ellen's dealing with her quirky friends, her family, and the problems of daily life, set in [[Los Angeles]]. The series is notable for being one of the first in the US with a main character to come out as gay, which DeGeneres' character did in the 1997 episode "[[The Puppy Episode]]", which aired shortly after DeGeneres publicly revealed that she was gay in real life. This event received a great deal of media exposure, ignited controversy, and prompted ABC to place a [[parental advisory]] at the beginning of each episode.

The series' theme song (used in season 3 onwards) is a version of "[[So Called Friend]]" by Scottish band [[Texas (band)|Texas]] with altered lyrics. A running gag during the third and fourth seasons was that each episode had a distinct/different [[opening credits]] sequence (often with singing and dancing), resulting from Ellen's ongoing search for the perfect opening credits.

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of Ellen episodes}}

==="The Puppy Episode"===
{{Main|The Puppy Episode}}
In 1997, ''Ellen'' made television history when the title character [[Coming out|came out]] as a [[lesbian]] in the famous "[[The Puppy Episode|Puppy Episode]]" (DeGeneres herself came out concurrent with the episode on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''). To ensure a memorable moment, the coming out scene was made into a gag where, at an airport, Ellen turns and tells [[Laura Dern]]'s character "I'm gay!" – only to realize that she had turned right into the public address microphone, announcing her sexuality to the entire terminal. Ellen DeGeneres's mother Betty can briefly be seen as one of the people in the terminal with a shocked reaction to the announcement.<ref>{{cite news|title= Risks and Benefits Seen for an Out-of-the-Closet 'Ellen'|work=LA Times|date=March 3, 1997|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-03/entertainment/ca-34276_1_ellen-morgan|accessdate=August 23, 2010 | first=Brian | last=Lowry}}</ref>

The episode was ranked No. 35 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time]].<ref>{{cite journal|year=1997|title= Special Collectors' Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time|journal=[[TV Guide]]|issue=June 28 – July 4}}</ref>

The revelation ignited a storm of controversy, prompting ABC to place a [[parental advisory]] at the beginning of each episode.

''Ellen'' was successful enough in its early seasons to warrant annual renewal, due largely to DeGeneres's perceived appeal and comic ability, but only with Ellen's coming out did the show make its way into the wide public consciousness and hit a critical plateau. After the initial coming out frenzy, however, the show's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] declined, and ABC began feeling the pain of a backlash regarding the "gay content" being exhibited. The final episodes of ''Ellen'' were criticized for focusing too much on gay issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jumptheshark.com/topic/ellen-general-comments/605 |title=Ellen in Jump The Shark |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010051734/http://www.jumptheshark.com/topic/ellen-general-comments/605 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 }}</ref> Eventually, even some members of the LGBT community, including [[Chaz Bono]] (who at the time was the media director for [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]]), began to criticize the show's serious new tone as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetout.com/entertainment/news/?sernum=544 |title=Planet Out |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411054800/http://www.planetout.com/entertainment/news/?sernum=544 |archivedate=April 11, 2008 }}</ref> ABC cancelled the show in May 1998 after five seasons.

The episode "Secrets & Ellen" is part of a crossover with ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'', ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'', and ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' set in Las Vegas. It features [[Brett Butler (actress)|Brett Butler]] as Grace Kelly and [[Drew Carey]] as himself.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
Note: Between seasons one and two, there was not only a title change from ''These Friends of Mine'' to ''Ellen'', but several characters disappeared without explanation.

* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Ellen Inez Morgan: Ellen is the main character of the sitcom. In season one, Ellen works in a Los Angeles bookstore called "Buy the Book". In the second season, she purchases the bookstore from her boss and becomes its owner. Throughout season four, hints were made to her sexuality and near the end of season 4 in "The Puppy Episode," Ellen announced she was a lesbian. For the first one and a half seasons, Ellen lived in an apartment with roommate Adam. She lived alone after Adam moved out and then with her cousin Spence. Towards the end of season four, she bought her own house. Ellen's personality was likable and cheerful, but also somewhat clumsy and awkward, and with a persistent need to be liked. Her trademark behavior (and the main object of her comedy) was that she would [[digression|digress]], rambling and babbling, especially when nervous or embarrassed. An example of both her clumsiness and her need to please is found in the episode where she had [[Martha Stewart]] over for a dinner party and Ellen became highly stressed trying to organize the perfect dinner.
* [[Joely Fisher]] as Paige Clarke: Appearing in seasons two through five, Paige is Ellen's somewhat vain and promiscuous best friend who works for a [[movie studio]]. Paige planned to tie the knot with her boyfriend Matt Liston, but dumped him at the altar after resuming an affair she had with Ellen's cousin Spence. When Ellen comes out of the closet, Paige has the hardest time dealing with it (even harder than Ellen's parents). In the fourth-season finale, Paige finally comes to terms with it. Paige also likes to try on clothes and work on her singing voice. Her singing voice is powerful enough to blow things off tables, as seen in season 2 episode 13.
* [[Holly Fulger]] as Holly Jamison: Appearing only in the first season, Holly is Ellen's friend. Shy and self-conscious, she tries to avoid any trouble and is desperate to get along with the people around her. She actually would love to be the center of attention, though she doesn't dare to overcome her shyness. Her surname was never spoken or seen in the show.
* [[Arye Gross]] as Adam Green: Appearing in seasons one through three, Adam is Ellen's roommate and they have been friends since college. A photographer, he is completely unsuccessful with women and is frequently dumped. In the middle of the third season, Adam moves to England to work as a photographer for ''The Sun Times'', but upon his departure, he reveals that he was harboring a crush on Ellen. She in turn lies that she has one on him too, but he finds out the truth and that creates tension between the two of them until shortly before he leaves.
* [[David Anthony Higgins]] as Joe Farrell: Appearing in all five seasons, Joe is a dour, sarcastic Canadian who works as the [[barista]] at the coffee shop inside Ellen's bookstore. His personal life is only touched upon, usually for comic relief in constant reference to misadventures he had in [[Moose Jaw]]. In the third season he becomes a member of the core group which aside from him consists of Ellen, Spence, Paige, and Audrey.
* [[Clea Lewis]] as Audrey Penney: Audrey is Ellen's squeaky-voiced and exceedingly perky neighbor and later co-worker, seen usually in the color [[pink]] and whose catchphrase was the enthusiastic greeting "Hi, Ellen!". Ellen has something of a [[love–hate relationship]] with Audrey, often annoyed at her overly upbeat demeanor. But after Ellen comes out, Audrey is extremely supportive (and excited, saying that she thinks "it's SUPER!"), and she throws herself into the [[LGBT]] culture, ironically with more reverence than Ellen did. In her initial appearance in the first season, her personality and appearance were quite different and Ellen complained about Audrey's dour and negative personality, but upon her reappearance later in season two she has developed her upbeat and perky demeanor. In season one, Ellen also refers to Audrey's husband, but he never appears, their off-screen divorce between seasons one and two possibly explaining Audrey's change of personality, and Audrey later dates several people, including Adam and [[Ron Palillo]]. It is revealed that she comes from a very well-off family, though she rejected her inheritance so that she could continue being an assistant at the bookstore.
* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Spencer "Spence" Kovak: Ellen's volatile but well-intentioned cousin from New York, who joined the cast in the third season. His arrival in Ellen's life coincides with the aftermath of a large [[Los Angeles]] earthquake that leads to the destruction and subsequent remodeling of the book store. Spence was training as a doctor, but was fired from his job for punching a patient and as a result spent the beginning of the third season bored and depressed. He begins training as a lawyer but after saving someone's life decides to resume his career in medicine. He and Paige had a [[love-hate relationship]] that began as constant fighting but later they became lovers and stayed such until a few episodes before the end of the series when the relationship ended amicably.
* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as Anita Warrell: Ellen's friend and a main character in the show's first season. Like Holly, she does not appear in subsequent seasons and is not mentioned again. She was mentioned by Holly to be much more attractive than her but, unlike Holly, most of her romantic relationships were never shown on screen.

===Recurring===
* [[Steven Gilborn]] as Harold Cornelius Morgan: Ellen's father. He is often somewhat clueless about what is going on around him. At one point, he and Ellen's mother Lois announce that they want to divorce, much to Ellen's dismay. They later reconcile.
* [[Alice Hirson]] as Lois Ellington Morgan: Ellen's mother, Lois spends much of her time nosing and interfering in Ellen's life. Before Ellen comes out of the closet, Lois is obsessed with finding Ellen a husband. At one point, she wants to divorce her husband, but they later reconcile.
* [[Lisa Darr]] as Laurie Manning: Ellen's girlfriend. Laurie appears in eight episodes in the fifth and final season of Ellen. She and her daughter Holly (Kayla Murphy) become an increasingly important part of Ellen's life.
* [[Bruce Campbell]] as Ed Billik: Ed appeared in season four only as the new manager of Ellen's bookstore. He was a strict business type who frequently butted heads with Ellen over their management styles.
* [[Patrick Bristow]] as Peter Barnes: Ellen's friend. He was a charity worker in the second season and a recurring role until the end of the series.
* [[Jack Plotnick]] as Barrett: Paige's assistant in season three. It is implied that he also goes on to marry Peter Barnes.

===Syndication===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Reruns of the show first started airing on [[Lifetime Television|Lifetime]] in the fall of 1998, and stopped in 2001. Starting October 4, 2003, during DeGeneres's surge in popularity through her role in ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and her new daytime [[The Ellen DeGeneres Show|talk show]], Lifetime began airing reruns again, on 1AM-2AM ET Sunday mornings, starting with the second season. Before long, it went into the 1:30AM-2AM ET time slot Monday-Friday. The reruns stopped two episodes into the controversial final season.  [[Oxygen Network|Oxygen]] then picked up the entire series to air starting October 4, 2004, daily at midnight and noon ET, but it has since been removed from the schedule. In September 2013, ''Ellen'' began airing on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] Monday-Saturday from 9-11am.

Reruns of the show aired in the UK on [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]] until the channel closed in September 2007. These were shown only on weekend mornings, along with other [[Touchstone Pictures]] productions. No other UK channels are currently airing the show.

In Australia episodes air on [[111 HITS]] weekdays in a daytime timeslot. New Zealand is currently airing double episode reruns on TVNZ TV2 every Monday night.

In Canada, it is currently being aired by [[TVtropolis]].

As of April 2015, the show can be seen weekday afternoons on the comedy-focused [[digital subchannel]] [[LAFF]]. As of May 2018, Ellen is no longer a part of LAFF's television lineup.

On October 11, 2017, the entire series was made available for streaming on [[Hulu]] as part of 'National Coming Out Day'. It has since been removed from the streaming service.
