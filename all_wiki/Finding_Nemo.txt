==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be 400-700 words in length. -->

Nemo is a young [[Amphiprioninae|clownfish]] who lives with his father Marlin in an [[sea anemone|anemone]] in the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Nemo, despite being hampered by a lame right fin, is eager to explore life around the ocean. Marlin, however, is overprotective of him, having lost his wife Coral and all their other eggs in a [[barracuda]] attack, leaving Nemo as his only child. On Nemo's first day of school, Marlin unintentionally embarrasses him, and while Marlin is distracted with the teacher, Mr. [[Manta ray|Ray]], Nemo defiantly sneaks away from the reef toward a speedboat, where he is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin tries to chase the boat and meets Dory, a [[Paracanthurus|blue tang]] who suffers from [[anterograde amnesia|acute short-term memory loss]], who offers her help. During an encounter with three [[sharks]] who have sworn to abstain from eating other fish, Marlin notices a diver's mask that fell from the boat that took Nemo. Marlin and Dory fight over the mask, giving Dory a nose bleed, which [[Shark#Smell|sends one of the sharks]] into a feeding frenzy, and Marlin and Dory narrowly escape, but are knocked unconscious when the sharks accidentally set off a ring of old [[naval mines]].

Meanwhile, Nemo is placed in an aquarium in a dentist's office in [[Sydney, Australia]], where he meets the Tank Gang, including [[yellow tang]] Bubbles, [[starfish]] Peach, [[cleaner shrimp]] Jacques, [[Tetraodontidae|blowfish]] Bloat, [[royal gramma]] Gurgle, and [[damselfish]] Deb, led by Gill, a [[Moorish idol]]. That night, Nemo learns he is to be given to the dentist's young niece, Darla, whose rough treatment has [[Fishkeeping#Animal_welfare|killed]] most of her previous fish. Gill devises a risky escape plan: Nemo, who can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing the dentist to put the fish into plastic bags while he cleans the tank, giving them the opportunity to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts the maneuver, but fails and is almost killed, leaving Gill guilt-ridden.

Marlin and Dory wake up unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep sea trench. Swimming after it, Marlin is chased by an [[anglerfish]], while Dory reads the address and recites it repeatedly to commit it to memory. Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of [[Monodactylidae|moonfish]], but Marlin disregards their instructions to take what he believes is a safer route, leading them into a forest of [[jellyfish]] where they end up unconscious from all the jellyfish [[Cnidocyte|stings]]. Marlin and Dory wake up to find themselves on the East Australian Current with a group of friendly [[sea turtles]] including Crush and his son, Squirt. Marlin tells them about his quest, impressing them, and the story is relayed across the ocean, all the way to the dentist's office, where a [[pelican]] named Nigel tells the Tank Gang. Inspired by his father's bravery, Nemo makes another attempt to jam the filter and succeeds, and soon the aquarium's contents are covered in [[green algae]].

Marlin and Dory exit the [[East Australian Current]] and are engulfed by a [[blue whale]]. Dory communicates with the whale, who carries them to [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbor]] and expels them through its [[Blowhole_(anatomy)|blowhole]]. There, they meet Nigel, who help the pair escape from a group of [[gull|seagulls]] and takes them to the dentist's office. Meanwhile, the dentist has installed a new high-tech filter, foiling the Tank Gang's escape. Darla arrives, and the dentist prepares to give Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel causes a disturbance, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After the dentist throws Nigel out, Gill helps Nemo escape through a drain that leads to the ocean.

Thinking that Nemo is dead, Marlin thanks and bids farewell to Dory and begins his journey home. Marlin's departure causes Dory to lose her memory. She meets Nemo as he reaches the ocean, but does not remember him. However, Dory's memory returns when she reads the word "Sydney" on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught by a [[fishing trawler]] with a school of [[grouper]]. With Marlin’s blessing, Nemo enters the net and he and Marlin order the fish to swim down in order to break the boat's [[fishing net|net]] to escape. After returning home to the reef, Marlin and Dory watch Mr. Ray take Nemo and his friends on a field trip. At the dentist's, the filter has broken, and the gang, having been put in bags, roll out of the window and into the harbor. Still stuck, they ponder what happens next.

==Production==

The inspiration for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director [[Andrew Stanton]]'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<ref name="commentary">''Finding Nemo'', 2004 DVD, commentary</ref> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<ref>The Pixar Story by Leslie Iwerks, 2007 documentary</ref> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<ref name="commentary"/>

In an interview with [[National Geographic|''National Geographic'' magazine]], Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an [[Sea anemone|anemone]]:

{{quote|It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish—it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2010/01/clownfish-anemone-symbiotic-relationship/ Beautiful Friendship] ''National Geographic'' magazine, January 2010</ref>
}}

In addition, clownfish are colourful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<ref name="commentary"/> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. As a result, ''Finding Nemo'' began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director [[Lee Unkrich]] called "very unusual for an animated film".<ref name="commentary"/> The artists took [[scuba diving]] lessons to study the coral reef.<ref name="commentary"/>

Stanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died, but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.<ref name="commentary"/> The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he's from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children's storybook that shares exactly the same details.<ref name="commentary"/>

[[File:Andrew Stanton cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Stanton]] wrote and directed the film.]]
The casting of [[Albert Brooks]], in Stanton's opinion, "saved" the film.<ref name="commentary"/> Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn't funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.

The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and [[Bob Peterson (animator)|Bob Peterson]] while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast [[Ellen DeGeneres]] when he watched an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in which he saw her "change the subject five times before finishing one sentence".<ref name="commentary"/> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]] and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<ref name="commentary" />

Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's [[Storyboard|story reel]], and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office.<ref name="commentary"/> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director [[Brad Bird]]. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was "this generation's [[Thumper (Disney)|Thumper]]" and immediately cast Nicholas.<ref name="commentary"/>

[[Megan Mullally]] was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]] on the television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/megan%20mullally%20dropped%20from%20finding%20nemo|title=Megan Mullally&nbsp;– Megan Mullally Dropped From Finding Nemo|publisher=WENN|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>

To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii and received in-house lectures from an [[ichthyologist]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lovgren|first=Stefan|title=For Finding Nemo, Animators Dove into Fish Study|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0530_030530_findingnemo.html|work=National Geographic News|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> As a result, Pixar's animator for Dory, [[Gini Cruz Santos]], integrated "the fish movement, human movement, and facial expressions to make them look and feel like real characters."<ref name=Annieawards>31st Annual Annie Awards, [http://annieawards.org/31st-annie-awards 31st Annual Annie Award Nominees and Winners (2003)].

{{Main|Finding Dory}}
In 2005, after disagreements between Disney's [[Michael Eisner]] and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] over the distribution of Pixar's films, Disney announced that they would be creating a new animation studio, [[Circle 7 Animation]], to make sequels to the seven Disney-owned Pixar films (which consisted of the films released between 1995's ''[[Toy Story]]'' and 2006's ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2005/08/08/655.aspx|title=The Skinny on Circle Seven|first=Jim|last=Hill|date=August 7, 2005|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref> The studio had put ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Monsters University|Monster's Inc. 2: Lost in Scaradise]]'' into development, and had hired screenwriter Laurie Craig to write a draft for ''Finding Nemo 2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2012/bob-hilgenberg-and-rob-muir-on-the-rise-and-fall-of-disneys-circle-7-animation/|title=Bob Hilgenberg and Rob Muir on the Rise and Fall of Disney's Circle 7 Animation|first=Josh|last=Armstrong|date=March 5, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref> Circle 7 was subsequently shut down after [[Robert Iger]] replaced Eisner as CEO of Disney and arranged the acquisition of Pixar.

In July 2012, it was reported that [[Andrew Stanton]] was developing a sequel to ''Finding Nemo'', to be titled ''Finding Dory'',<ref name="sequel">{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/john-carter-helmer-andrew-stanton-dives-back-into-animation-with-finding-nemo-sequel|title='John Carter' Helmer Andrew Stanton Dives Back into Animation With 'Finding Nemo' Sequel |publisher=Deadline.com |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> with Victoria Strouse writing the script, and the film scheduled to be released in 2016.<ref name="FN2">{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Andrew Stanton to Direct Pixar's 'Finding Nemo' Sequel|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andrew-stanton-pixar-finding-nemo-sequel-350267|accessdate=July 17, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 17, 2012}}</ref> The same day the news of a potential sequel broke, Stanton called into question the accuracy of the reports. The message said, "Didn't you all learn from ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]''? Everyone calm down. Don't believe everything you read. Nothing to see here now. #skyisnotfalling".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/07/18/12811046-sequel-to-finding-nemo-maybe-toy-story-4-not-so-fast | title=Sequel to 'Finding Nemo'?

When that went away, everything slid up. I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to ''Carter'' not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit".<ref>{{cite news|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|title=Director Andrew Stanton looks back on 'John Carter's' rocky path|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-john-carter-director-20120908,0,4090564,full.story|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 8, 2012}}</ref> In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that Albert Brooks would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|title=Albert Brooks Hooks Deal To Reprise In 'Finding Nemo 2'|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/02/albert-brooks-hooks-deal-to-reprise-in-finding-nemo-2/|accessdate=February 12, 2013|work=Deadline|date=February 12, 2013}}</ref>

In April 2013, Disney announced the sequel ''Finding Dory'', confirming that DeGeneres and Brooks would be reprising their roles as Dory and Marlin, respectively.
