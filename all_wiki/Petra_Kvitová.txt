'''Petra <!-- Please do not add a middle name without a source --> Kvitová''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈpɛtra ˈkvɪtovaː}}; born 8 March 1990) is a [[Czech people|Czech]] professional [[tennis]] player. Known for her powerful left-handed groundstrokes and variety, Kvitová turned professional in 2006 and has won 27 <!-- Do not add "WTA"; Grand Slam titles are not tour titles -->career singles titles, two of which are [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles, the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championships]] in [[2011 Wimbledon Championships|2011]] and in [[2014 Wimbledon Championships|2014]]. She also won a bronze medal at the [[Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]]. Her career-high ranking of world No. 2 was reached on 31 October 2011.

Kvitová first gained notice upon defeating then-world No. 1 [[Dinara Safina]] in the third round of the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]]. This was followed by her first Grand Slam semifinal appearance at the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships]] where she came up short to eventual champion [[Serena Williams]]. Then, during her breakthrough season in [[2011 Petra Kvitová tennis season|2011]], Kvitová won her first Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon Championships, defeating [[Maria Sharapova]] in the final, thus becoming the first player of either gender born in the 1990s to win a Grand Slam tournament title, and was the only such player with a Grand Slam singles title to her name until the [[2016 French Open]], where [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] triumphed. At the end of the season, she won the [[2011 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]], thus becoming the third player to win the tournament on debut, the others being Williams and Sharapova. She also helped lead the [[Czech Republic Fed Cup team|Czech Republic]] to victory in the [[2011 Fed Cup World Group|Fed Cup]] final that same year, making it the Czech Republic's first Fed Cup title as an independent nation.

In 2012, Kvitová made the semifinals of the [[2012 Australian Open|Australian]] and [[2012 French Open|French Opens]], and was crowned [[2012 US Open Series|US Open Series]] champion. That same year, she also won the [[2012 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]] alongside [[Tomáš Berdych]]. In [[2014 Petra Kvitová tennis season|2014]], she won her second and most recent Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon Championships, defeating [[Eugenie Bouchard]] in the final. In 2015, Kvitová achieved the feat of making the quarterfinals at all four Grand Slams during her career after advancing to her first quarterfinal at the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where she lost to eventual champion [[Flavia Pennetta]]. In 2016, she won the [[2016 WTA Elite Trophy|WTA Elite Trophy]] in her first appearance at the tournament, thus becoming the first player ever to win both categories of year-end championships on debut. In 2019, she reached her first Grand Slam final in almost five years, at the [[2019 Australian Open|Australian Open]] where she finished runner-up to [[Naomi Osaka]].

Kvitová began [[2020 WTA Tour|2020]] at the [[2020 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]].

Kvitová uses the pinpoint service stance and is known for her fast and well-placed serves. As a left-handed player, she executes the shot well by serving out wide away from her opponent, especially on the advantage-side of the court to her opponent's backhand, and then coming forward to finish off the point with a winner down the line. She is also noted for her exceptional timing. On forehands, she prefers to take the ball early, thus allowing her to produce down-the-line winners effectively. On backhands, she utilizes all the important muscle groups to produce shots with exceptional amount of power. When returning, she uses a short compact motion which allows her to return aggressively regardless of the serve speed. She is also known to attack weak second serves by producing powerful winners. She also possesses notable amount of variety in her game. Her volleys tend to come more from her forehand, her stronger side, which she executes by moving her racket in a straight line, also allowing her to disguise the shot well enough from her opponents. In the slice department, she has the ability to keep the ball low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make up for her lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. Her game suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.<ref>{{citation |url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/patrick-mouratoglou/kvitova-next-big-boss-2211.html |title=Kvitova: The next big boss |accessdate=16 October 2011 |date=16 October 2011 |work=Yahoo! |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119184140/https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/patrick-mouratoglou/kvitova-next-big-boss-2211.html |archive-date=19 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.onlinetennisinstruction.com/petra-kvitova.html |title=Petra Kvitova Biography And Detailed Game Analysis |accessdate=19 November 2016 |date=19 November 2016 |work=Yahoo! |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118085551/http://www.onlinetennisinstruction.com/petra-kvitova.html |archive-date=18 November 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

However, due to her high-risk game and aggressive style of play she is known to produce a high number of unforced errors in matches. Movement is another weakness in her game though it has shown significant improvement over the last couple of years as she is now able to run down more balls than before. She is known for her inconsistencies, inability to maintain focus on and off during matches as well as impatience mid-rally. Kvitová sometimes struggles against defensive players, including [[Angelique Kerber]] and [[Simona Halep]], who prolong points to the extent that Kvitová feels she must hit a winner, thus increasing the chances of producing an unforced error. Against such opponents, she has been shown to break down physically due to her opponent's use of court craft, consistency and patience on court.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.courant.com/sports/hc-connecticut-open-night-semifinal-0827-20160826-story.html |title=Radwanska Overwhelms Defending Champion Kvitova In Connecticut Open Semifinals |accessdate=26 August 2016 |date=26 August 2016 |work=Hartford Courant |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830224224/http://www.courant.com/sports/hc-connecticut-open-night-semifinal-0827-20160826-story.html |archive-date=30 August 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

However, when Kvitová is at her best, she is extremely dangerous, as seen in the final of the [[2015 Mutua Madrid Open|2015 Madrid Open]] against [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] where she hit 33 winners in the 66-minute contest, an average of a winner every two minutes.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/05/09/petra-kvitova-wins-madrid-open-svetlana-kuznetsova |title=Petra Kvitova dominates Svetlana Kuznetsova to win Madrid Open title |accessdate=9 May 2015 |date=9 May 2015 |work=SI Tennis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125121352/http://www.si.com/tennis/2015/05/09/petra-kvitova-wins-madrid-open-svetlana-kuznetsova |archive-date=25 November 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Wozniacki exacted revenge by winning their next two meetings – in the third round of [[2013 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]] in 2013 and the round-robin stage of the [[2014 WTA Finals]]. After that, Kvitová won their next four meetings in a row, all on hard courts – the [[2015 Connecticut Open|New Haven]] semifinals in 2015, second round of the [[Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Rio Olympics]] in 2016, third round of [[2017 China Open (tennis)|Beijing]] in 2017 and the semifinals of [[2018 Qatar Total Open|Doha]] in 2018, the latter where Wozniacki served for the match twice.

Kvitová then went on to win their next two clashes in straight sets – in the quarterfinals of [[2013 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]] and the round-robin stage of the [[2013 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]], both in 2013.
