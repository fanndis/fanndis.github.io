Gazprom was created in 1989, when the [[Soviet Ministry of Gas Industry]] was converted to a [[corporation]], becoming the first state-run corporate enterprise in the [[Soviet Union]]. After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution]], Gazprom was privatized, retaining its Russia-based assets. At that time, Gazprom evaded taxes and state regulation and engaged in [[asset stripping]]. The company later returned to government control in the early 2000s, and since then, the company is involved in the [[Government of Russia|Russian Government]]'s diplomatic efforts, setting of gas prices, and access to pipelines.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Crumley |date=7 January 2009 |title=Russia's Gazprom Diplomacy: Turning Off Europe's Heat |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1870111,00.html |url-status=live |magazine=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018063859/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1870111,00.html |archive-date=18 October 2015 |access-date=25 April 2015}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
In 1943, during [[World War II]], the government of the [[Soviet Union]] developed a domestic gas industry. In 1965, it [[command economy|centralized]] [[gas exploration]], development, and distribution within the Ministry of Gas Industry. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Ministry of Gas Industry found large natural gas reserves in [[Siberia]], the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] region and the [[Volga Region]]. The Soviet Union became a major gas producer.<ref name="history">{{Cite web |title=Gazprom – A Troubled Giant |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1064448.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016002734/http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1064448.html |archive-date=16 October 2012 |access-date=14 September 2012 |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}</ref> In August 1989, under the leadership of [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]], the Ministry of Gas Industry was renamed the ''State Gas Concern Gazprom'', and became the Soviet Union's first state run [[corporation|corporate]] enterprise.<ref name="faq_jsc">{{Cite web |title=Gazprom Joint Stock Company |url=http://eng.gazpromquestions.ru/?id=10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122202622/http://eng.gazpromquestions.ru/?id=10 |archive-date=22 January 2009 |access-date=18 October 2009 |publisher=Gazprom}}</ref><ref name="marshall" /> In late 1991, when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]], gas industry assets were transferred to newly established national companies, such as [[Naftogaz|Ukrgazprom]] and [[Türkmengaz|Turkmengazprom]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aarentsen |first=Maarten |title=National reforms in European gas |year=2003}}</ref> Gazprom kept assets located in [[Russia]] and secured a [[monopoly]] in the gas sector.<ref name="marshall" />

=== Privatization ===
In December 1992, when [[Boris Yeltsin]], the [[Russian President]], appointed [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]], Gazprom's Chairman, his [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]], the company's political influence increased. [[Rem Viakhirev]] took the chairmanship of Gazprom's Board of Directors and Managing Committee.<ref name="marshall" /> Following the [[Decree of the President of Russia|Decree of the President of the Russian Federation]] of 5 November 1992, and the [[Order of the Government of Russia|Resolution]] of the [[Government of Russia]] of 17 February 1993, Gazprom became a [[joint-stock company]]. Gazprom began to distribute [[share (finance)|share]]s under the [[voucher privatization|voucher method]]. (Each Russian citizen received [[voucher]]s to purchase shares of formerly state-owned companies). By 1994, 33% of Gazprom's shares had been bought by 747,000 members of the public, mostly in exchange for vouchers. Fifteen percent of the stock was allocated to Gazprom employees. The state retained 40% of the shares. That amount was gradually lowered to thirty-eight percent.<ref name="marshall" /> Trading of Gazprom's shares was heavily regulated. Foreigners were prohibited from owning more than nine-percent of the shares. In October 1996, 1% of Gazprom's equity was offered for sale to foreigners as [[Global Depository Receipt]]s. In 1997, Gazprom offered a [[bond (finance)|bond]] issue of US$2.5&nbsp;billion.

Chernomyrdin, as [[Prime Minister of Russia]], ensured Gazprom avoided tight state regulation. Gazprom evaded taxes, and the Government of Russia received little in [[dividend]]s. Gazprom managers and board members, such as Chernomyrdin and the Gazprom [[Chief Executive Officer]], [[Rem Viakhirev]], engaged in [[asset-stripping]]. Gazprom assets were shared amongst their relatives. [[Itera]], a gas trading company also received Gazprom assets.<ref name="goldman_p61">Goldman, p.61</ref> In March 1998, for reasons unrelated to his activities at Gazprom, Chernomyrdin was fired by Yeltsin.<ref name="goldman_p101">Goldman, p.101</ref> On 30 June 1998, Chernomyrdin was made Chairman of the Board of Directors of Gazprom.

===State control===
[[File:RUS gasmap.gif|thumb|Major Russian natural gas basins in 2000]]
When, in June 2000, [[Vladimir Putin]] became the President of Russia, he acted to gain control over [[Russian oligarch|Russia's oligarchs]], and increase the Government of Russia's control in important companies through a program of [[national champions]].<ref name="goldman_pp104" /> Putin fired Chernomyrdin from his position as the Chairman of the Gazprom board. The Russian Government's stock in Gazprom gave Putin the power to vote out Vyakhirev. Chernomyrdin and Vyakhirev were replaced by [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and [[Alexei Miller]]. They were Putin's prior employees in [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name="goldman_pp104">Goldman, pp.104–105</ref> Putin's actions were aided by the [[shareholder activism]] of [[Hermitage Capital Management]] Chief Executive Officer [[Bill Browder|William Browder]], and the former Russian Finance Minister [[Boris Fedorov|Boris Fyodorov]]. Miller and Medvedev were to stop asset stripping at Gazprom and to recover losses. Itera was denied access to Gazprom's pipelines and came close to [[bankruptcy]]. Itera agreed to return stolen assets to Gazprom for a fee.<ref name="goldman_pp141">Goldman, pp.141–142</ref>

In April 2001, Gazprom acquired [[NTV Russia|NTV]], Russia's only nationwide state-independent television station from [[Vladimir Gusinsky]]'s company, Media-Most holdings.<ref>{{Cite news |date=3 April 2001 |title=Russian TV station loses freedom |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1257833.stm |url-status=live |access-date=31 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108080301/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1257833.stm |archive-date=8 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=8 April 2001 |title=Russian NTV viewers on the streets |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1267083.stm |access-date=31 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Tremlett |first=Giles |date=24 April 2001 |title=Putin is out to get me, says media tycoon World news, The Guardian |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,477468,00.html |access-date=31 January 2010}}</ref>

===Price disputes===
On 1 January 2006, at 10:00 (Moscow time), during the [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]], Gazprom ceased the supply of gas to the Ukrainian market. Gazprom called on the government of Ukraine to increase its payment for natural gas in line with increases in global fuel prices. During the night of 3 January 2006, and early morning of 4 January 2006, [[Naftogas|Naftogas of Ukraine]] and Gazprom negotiated a deal that temporarily<ref>{{Cite news |date=5 March 2008 |title=Gazprom restores Ukraine gas flow |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7276589.stm |url-status=live |access-date=31 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219230534/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7276589.stm |archive-date=19 December 2008}}</ref> resolved the long-standing gas price conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

On 3 April 2006, Gazprom announced it would triple the price of natural gas to Belarus after 31 December 2006. In December 2006, Gazprom threatened to cease supply of gas to Belarus at 10&nbsp;am Moscow time on 1 January 2007, unless Belarus increased payments from $47 to $200 per 1,000&nbsp;cubic metres or to cede control over its distribution network.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6189379.stm Russian gas demands irk Belarus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110202051/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6189379.stm |date=10 January 2007 }}, [[BBC News]], 18 December 2006.</ref> Some analysts suggested Moscow was penalising [[Alexander Lukashenko]], the President of Belarus, for not delivering on pledges of [[Union of Russia and Belarus|closer integration with Russia]],<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ea29b9e2-8ae2-11db-8940-0000779e2340.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106233145/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ea29b9e2-8ae2-11db-8940-0000779e2340.html|date=6 January 2007}}</ref> while others noted that other countries like Armenia were paying as much for their gas as Belarus would with the new price levels.<ref>{{Cite web |title=dn.kiev.ua/ |url=http://dn.kiev.ua/economics/world/armen_09.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814195109/http://dn.kiev.ua/economics/world/armen_09.html |archive-date=14 August 2011 |access-date=31 January 2010 |publisher=Dn.kiev.ua}}</ref>

On 13 March 2008, after a three-day period where gas supplies to Ukraine were halved, Gazprom agreed to supply Ukraine with gas for the rest of the year. The contract removed intermediary companies.<ref>{{Cite news |date=13 March 2008 |title=Business &#124; Gazprom and Ukraine sign gas deal |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7293642.stm |url-status=live |access-date=28 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018063859/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7293642.stm |archive-date=18 October 2015}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Yukos Oil fraud===
Yuganskneftegaz was the core production subsidiary of the [[Yukos|Yukos Oil Company]], which was previously run by a Russian businessman, [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]. In 2003, the Russian tax authorities charged Yukos and Khodorkovsky with tax evasion. On 14 April 2004, Yukos was presented with a bill for over US$35 bn in back taxes and a demand to pay the entire bill the same day. Requests by Yukos to defer payment, allow payment by installments or to discharge the debt by sale of peripheral assets, including its shareholding in the [[Sibneft]] oil company, were also refused.

The bailiffs froze Yukos' shares in Yuganskneftegaz and on 19 November 2004, they placed a notice in the Russian government newspaper ''[[Rossiyskaya gazeta]]''. Yuganskneftegaz would be sold at an auction thirty days later on 19 December 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Российский фонд федерального имущества (далее – Продавец) извещает о проведении торгов по продаже арестованных акций ОАО "Юганскнефтегаз" |url=http://www.rg.ru/2004/11/19/uganskneftegaz-dok.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030232805/http://www.rg.ru/2004/11/19/uganskneftegaz-dok.html |archive-date=30 October 2014 |access-date=30 October 2014}}</ref> The conditions for participation in the auction included an advance deposit of US$1.7 bn and prior clearance by the Russian [[Federal Antimonopoly Service]]. In early December 2004, Gazprom submitted an application to participate in the auction via its wholly owned subsidiary, [[Gazpromneft]].

On 15 December 2004, Yukos filed for a bankruptcy protection in a [[Houston]] court, and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting Gazprom from participating in the auction. On 16 December 2004, a group of Western banks withdrew their financial support for Gazprom's application. On the same day, Baikalfinansgrup, a previously unknown company, applied to participate in the auction.

On 19 December 2004, only two companies appeared at the auction, [[Gazpromneft]] and Baikalfinansgrup. [[Gazpromneft]] declined to place any offer. Baikalfinansgrup acquired Yuganskneftegaz on its first bid. On 23 December 2004, Baikalfinansgrup was acquired by Rosneft. Rosneft later disclosed in its annual financial statement that it had financed the acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rosneft Financial Statement |url=http://www.rosneft.com/english/company/GAAP2004_english.pdf |access-date=13 March 2014}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> At the time, [[Sergey Bogdanchikov]] was the president of Rosneft and the chief executive officer of [[Gazpromneft]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bogdanchikov Appointed Head of Gazpromneft – Kommersant Moscow |url=http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=500&id=-2970 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030225432/http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=500&id=-2970 |archive-date=30 October 2014 |access-date=30 October 2014}}</ref>

Shortly after the auction, the planned merger between Gazprom and Rosneft was abandoned, and Bogdanchikov resigned his post as chief executive officer of Gazpromneft.

On 7 February 2006, in response to a question by a Spanish journalist, [[Vladimir Putin]] disclosed that Rosneft had used Baikalfinansgrup as a vehicle to acquire [[Yuganskneftegaz]] in order to protect itself against litigation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Президент России |url=http://www.kremlin.ru/appears/2006/02/07/1759_type63379_101129.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817065003/http://www.kremlin.ru/appears/2006/02/07/1759_type63379_101129.shtml |archive-date=17 August 2009 |access-date=30 October 2014}}</ref>

===Greenpeace protest against arctic drilling===
