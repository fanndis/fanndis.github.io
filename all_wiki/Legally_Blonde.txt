'''''Legally Blonde''''' is a 2001 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Robert Luketic]] in his feature-length directorial debut. Written by [[Karen McCullah|Karen McCullah Lutz]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]] from [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]]'s 2001 [[Legally Blonde (novel)|novel of the same name]], it stars [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Selma Blair]], [[Matthew Davis]], [[Victor Garber]], and [[Jennifer Coolidge]].  Witherspoon plays [[Elle Woods]], a [[Fraternities and sororities#Sororities|sorority]] girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III by getting a [[Juris Doctor]] degree at [[Harvard Law School]], and in the process, overcomes [[Blonde stereotype|stereotypes against blondes]] and triumphs as a successful lawyer through unflappable self-confidence and fashion/beauty knowhow.

The outline of ''Legally Blonde'' originated from Brown's experiences as a blonde going to [[Stanford Law School]] while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''  magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her peers. In 2000, Brown met producer [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], who helped her develop her manuscript into a novel. Platt brought in screenwriters McCullah Lutz and Smith to adapt the book into a motion picture. The project caught the attention of director Luketic, an Australian newcomer who came to Hollywood on the success of his quirky debut short film ''[[Titsiana Booberini]]''. "I had been reading scripts for two years, not finding anything I could put my own personal mark on, until ''Legally Blonde'' came around," Luketic said.

The film was released on July 13, 2001, and was a hit with audiences, grossing $141 million worldwide on an $18 million budget, as well as receiving moderately positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going to Witherspoon's performance. It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy]]. Witherspoon received a Golden Globe nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], and the 2002 [[MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Award]] for [[2002 MTV Movie Awards#Best Female Performance|Best Female Performance]].

The box office success led to [[Legally Blonde (franchise)|a series of films]]: a 2003 sequel, ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde]]'', and a 2009 [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] spin-off, ''[[Legally Blondes]]''. Additionally, ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde: The Musical]]'' premiered on January 23, 2007, in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and opened in [[New York City]] at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 29, 2007, starring [[Laura Bell Bundy]].

As of May 2020, Witherspoon has been in discussions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce a third installment in the ''Legally Blonde'' film series.

==Plot==
<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.-->
[[Fashion merchandising]] student and [[sorority]] girl [[Elle Woods]] is taken to an expensive restaurant by her boyfriend, the governor's son, Warner Huntington III. She expects Warner to propose, but he breaks up with her instead. He intends to go to Harvard Law School and become a successful politician, and believes that Elle is not "serious" enough for that kind of life. Elle believes she can win Warner back if she shows herself capable of achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the [[Law School Admission Test]]<ref>"LSAT scores can range from a low of 120 to a perfect score of 180." https://www.thoughtco.com/whats-a-good-lsat-score-3211993#</ref> and, combined with her 4.0 GPA, is accepted to [[Harvard Law School]].

Upon arriving at Harvard, Elle's [[Southern California|SoCal]] personality is a complete contrast to her [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] classmates, who refuse to take her seriously. Elle soon encounters Warner, but discovers he is engaged to his old girlfriend, Vivian Kensington, who considers Elle a fool. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships,  but Warner tells her that she is wasting her time because she is not smart enough. Realizing that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, Elle finds motivation to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject.

The following semester, Professor Callahan, the school's most respected teacher, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile case. Among those chosen are Elle, Warner, and Vivian. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who is one of Elle's role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce an alibi (she later reveals to Elle that she was having liposuction, a fact that would ruin her reputation, which Elle promises not to disclose). Vivian earns a new respect for Elle, and even reveals that Warner couldn't get into Harvard without his father's help. Emmett Richmond, Callahan's junior partner, has also taken notice of Elle's potential. One night, Callahan attempts to seduce Elle, who now believes that is the reason why she got the internship. Devastated, she quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. When Emmett explains how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, Brooke fires Callahan and replaces him with Elle (under the guidance of Emmett, as she is only a law student, citing a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients as long as they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney). Elle begins to cross-examine Brooke's step-daughter Chutney, and notices important inconsistencies in her story: Chutney testified that she was home during her father's murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after getting her hair permed that morning. Elle says that washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the [[ammonium thioglycolate]], and points out that Chutney's curls are still intact. With her story falling apart, Chutney confesses that she had killed her father by accident, but she actually intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone who was the same age as she is.

After the trial, Chutney is sent to jail and Warner approaches Elle and asks her to take him back, since she has proven herself. Elle rejects him, realizing that he is shallow and a "complete bonehead". She and Vivian, however, become good friends – especially after she dumps Warner. Two years later, Elle gives the graduation speech. Emmett has started his own law firm and has been dating Elle for two years, with plans to propose to her later that night.

Brown said that when she first arrived at Stanford, she discovered she had made a big mistake. "I was in my first week of law school, in 1993, and I saw this flyer for "The Women of Stanford Law," so I was like, 'I'll go and meet some nice girls. Whatever.' I went to the meeting, and these were not women. These were really angry people. The woman who was leading it spent three years at Stanford trying to change the name '[[wikt:semester|semester]]' to 'ovester.' I started laughing and I realized everyone in the room took it very seriously. So I didn't make any friends there."<ref name="sf-chronicle"/>

Brown wrote letters to her parents about these experiences and originally thought about writing a book of essays about her law school experience until a literary agent advised her to adapt them into a novel.<ref name="Silverman 2003">{{cite web | last=Silverman | first=Amy | title=Legally Brown | website=Phoenix New Times | date=October 30, 2003 | url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/legally-brown-6407263 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701045425/https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/legally-brown-6407263|archive-date=July 1, 2018| access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref> Brown took a community college writing class, put together a manuscript, and shopped the book around but was unsuccessful.<ref name="Silverman 2003"/> She later resubmitted her manuscript again, this time in pink, which got the attention of an agent,<ref name="sf-chronicle"/> and "movie people went nuts."<ref name="Silverman 2003"/> Amanda's mother, Suzanne, remembers the day of the bidding war and thought she would be lucky to get $10,000 but the final figure was considerably more.<ref name="Silverman 2003"/>

She thinks the world's great, she's great, everyone's great and nothing can change that. She's truly an irrepressible modern heroine."<ref name="marc-platt"/>

Screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith spent two days on Stanford's campus in the spring of 2000 doing research for their screenplay based on Brown's novel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=38510 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406210026/https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=38510|archive-date=April 6, 2020|title=Blonde Ambition |work=Stanford Alumni |accessdate=October 2, 2018 }}</ref> Director [[Robert Luketic]], an Australian newcomer who came to Hollywood on the success of his quirky debut short film ''[[Titsiana Booberini]],'' was drawn to the project while looking for a breakthrough film.

===Development===
[[File:Reese Witherspoon 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Witherspoon was Luketic's first choice to play Elle Woods, but she needed to audition multiple times to convince Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.]]
Luketic explained that when the studio first green-lit the project, they weren't aware that the film would be structured as a progressively feel-good, [[women's empowerment]] movie.<ref name="John-Moore-2016">{{cite web | last=Moore | first=John | last2= | first2= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413021048/https://www.denvercenter.org/news-center/legally-blonde-director-on-the-hair-that-ate-hollywood/|archive-date=April 13, 2020| title='Legally Blonde' director on 'The Hair That Ate Hollywood' | website=Denver Center for the Performing Arts | date=May 11, 2016 | url=https://www.denvercenter.org/news-center/legally-blonde-director-on-the-hair-that-ate-hollywood/ | access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> "Initially, they thought it was going to be much more wet T-shirts and boobs than it actually turned out to be," said Luketic.<ref name="John-Moore-2016"/>

[[Charlize Theron]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Christina Applegate]], [[Milla Jovovich]] and [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] were all considered for the lead role<ref name="John-Moore-2016"/> but Luketic said he "knew on page five of the script that [he] wanted Reese to play Elle."<ref name="Urban Cinefile 2020"/> "I wanted someone with gravitas and brains," he explained.<ref name="John-Moore-2016"/> "There had to be more behind the face, and Reese just fit the bill."<ref name="John-Moore-2016"/> Despite Luketic's enthusiasm for Witherspoon to be cast as the lead, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] wasn't convinced.<ref name="THR-2019">{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728064248/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-reese-witherspoon-took-charge-her-career-changed-hollywood-1260203|archive-date=July 28, 2020|title=How Reese Witherspoon Took Charge of Her Career and Changed Hollywood | website=The Hollywood Reporter | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-reese-witherspoon-took-charge-her-career-changed-hollywood-1260203 | access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Witherspoon's performance as [[Tracy Flick]] in ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' put her at risk of being typecast by the studio heads.<ref name="THR-2019"/> "They thought I was a [[wikt:shrew|shrew]]," Witherspoon told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. Witherspoon had been passed over for several other post-''Election'' roles. "My manager finally called and said, 'You've got to go meet with the studio head because he will not approve you. He thinks you really are your character from ''Election'' and that you're repellent.' And then I was told to dress sexy."<ref name="THR-2019"/> Witherspoon went through several rounds of auditions for the part, even meeting with executives in character with a Southern California accent. "I remember a room full of men who were asking me questions about being a coed and being in a sorority," Witherspoon recalled. "Even though I had dropped out of college four years earlier and I have never been inside a sorority house."<ref name="THR-2019"/>

Luketic remembered meeting with her to discuss how she'd approach the role. "We met at a hotel on [[Sunset Boulevard]] and discussed the film...we were both concerned about some aspects, like how can the audience feel sorry for a rich girl driving a [[Porsche]]; and she had to dress in a very particular way that wasn’t distracting or off-putting...And every decision came from a certain innocence [of the character]."<ref name="Urban Cinefile 2020"/>

The final product came after "something like 10 drafts of the script. I worked with the writers (Kirsten Smith, Karen McCullah Lutz, working from Amanda Brown’s novel) who stayed on after we started shooting," Luketic explained. "And we’d have re-thinks and re-writes, often in the middle of the night."<ref name="Urban Cinefile 2020"/>

The screenwriters envisioned Luke Wilson as they were coming up with Elle's love interest. "They auditioned a bunch of other guys and we're like, 'How about auditioning Luke Wilson for the Luke Wilson role?'" McCullah Lutz said.<ref name="EW.com 2018">{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200419023652/https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/09/legally-blonde-viewing-party/|archive-date=April 19, 2020|title=What we learned from watching 'Legally Blonde' with the people who made it | website=EW.com | date=April 9, 2018 | url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/09/legally-blonde-viewing-party/ | access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>

How would a fashion-obsessed, fish out of water assimilate into Harvard and a law firm without compromising her personal style?

The "bend and snap" scene — where Elle explains to Paulette how to get her crush's attention — almost didn't make it into the movie.<ref name="bend and snap">{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/02/legally-blonde-bend-and-snap-story/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606064826/https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/02/legally-blonde-bend-and-snap-story/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 6, 2020 |title=Legally Blonde writers explain how the bend and snap was created |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=April 2, 2018 |accessdate=October 2, 2018 }}</ref>
"[Producer] Marc [Platt] wanted a B plot for Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge)," McCullah Lutz told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. "At first we were like, 'Should the store be robbed?'" Co-writer Kirsten Smith observed, "I think we spent a week or two trying to figure out what the B plot and this big set piece should be. There were crime plots. We were pitching scene after scene and it all felt very tonally weird."<ref name="bend and snap"/>

Later, while brainstorming at a bar in Los Angeles, McCullah Lutz came up with a solution: "What if Elle shows [Paulette] a move so she can get the UPS guy?" On the spur of the moment, Smith invented a move, standing up and demonstrating what would become the bend and snap. Smith explains, "It was a spontaneous invention. It was a completely drunken moment in a bar." Director Robert Luketic later adapted the "bend and snap" move into a dance number for the film.

"... It was a fully choreographed number by [[Toni Basil]], and she was awesome," Witherspoon recalls. "She did the whole dance."<ref name="bend-and-snap-et-interview">{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608043142/https://www.etonline.com/news/193152_reese_witherspoon_does_the_bend_and_snap_honor_of_legally_blonde_turning_15|archive-date=June 8, 2020|last=Macke |first=Johnni |url=https://www.etonline.com/news/193152_reese_witherspoon_does_the_bend_and_snap_honor_of_legally_blonde_turning_15 |title=Reese Witherspoon Does the Bend and Snap in Honor of 'Legally Blonde' Turning 15 |work=Entertainment Tonight |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2018 }}</ref> "I remember just reading it and thinking it was the most hysterical thing ever," she added.

I have a feeling I will be doing the bend and snap until I am 95."<ref name="bend-and-snap-et-interview"/>

The film originally ended at the courthouse right after Woods won the case, with Elle on the courthouse steps sharing a victory kiss with Emmett, then cutting one year into the future to her and a now-blonde Vivian starting their own Blonde Legal Defense Club at law school. After test audiences revealed they didn't like this ending, McCullah Lutz and Smith consulted with Luketic, Platt and other members of the production team while still in the lobby of the movie theater and they all agreed a new conclusion was necessary. "It was just kind of a weak ending," explained screenwriter McCullah Lutz. "The kiss didn't feel right because it's not a rom-com — it wasn't about their relationship. So test audiences were saying, 'We want to see what happens — we want to see her succeed.'

===Legal accuracy===
''Legally Blonde'' has received mixed reviews among legal scholars for its depiction of law school and the accuracy of its application of the law.

Devin Stone, better known online as LegalEagle, a [[YouTuber]] and American lawyer, observed that the application process portrayed in the movie in which Elle Woods sent the Harvard Law School admissions board a video essay was not possible. "There's no way to upload that on the law school application system," Stone noted.<ref name="Stone 2020">{{cite AV media |people=Devin Stone |date=2020 |title= Real Lawyer Reacts to Legally Blonde |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpJRvawgNI |accessdate=July 30, 2020 |time= |location= |publisher=LegalEagle |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=YouTube title:Real Lawyer Reacts to Legally Blonde}}</ref> "During orientation, Harvard Law School actually played the clip of Elle's admissions video with the admissions committee deciding to let her in, and then they swore that's not how they made decisions," explained Jameyanne Fuller, a student at Harvard Law School.<ref name="Lembo 2019">{{cite web | last=Lembo | first=Allie | archive-url=https://archive.today/20200731043445/https://www.insider.com/what-legally-blonde-got-right-about-law-school-2019-2|archive-date=July 31, 2020|title=8 things 'Legally Blonde' got right about law school and 6 it got wrong | website=Insider | date=February 4, 2019 | url=https://www.insider.com/what-legally-blonde-got-right-about-law-school-2019-2 | access-date=July 31, 2020}}</ref>

Certain elements of law school are also omitted from the film. "The movie totally skipped first semester exams which is like the most stressful time in law school ever," said Fuller.<ref name="Lembo 2019"/>

Stone said Woods had no authority to act as a lawyer when she represented Paulette Bonafonté over custody of her dog from her ex-husband and called her conduct a "huge ethical violation." "She hasn't finished law school, she's never passed the [[Bar examination|bar]] and she has absolutely no right to call herself an attorney," Stone observed. "That's called the unauthorized [[practice of law]]. If anyone finds out that she committed this...while she was at Harvard Law School, she'd probably be barred from entering the bar in virtually any state in the United States."<ref name="Stone 2020"/>

Contrary to what's shown in the film, Woods would not be able to question a witness on the stand during a criminal trial, W. Bradley Wendel, a law professor at  [[Cornell Law School]], explained in his book, ''Professional Responsibility: Examples & Explanations.''<ref name="Wendel 2007">{{cite book | last=Wendel | first=W.B. | title=Professional Responsibility: Examples & Explanations | publisher=Aspen Publishers, Incorporated | series=Examples & explanations series | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7355-6244-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2ArON9PgJYC | access-date=July 31, 2020 | page=28}}</ref>

"In the real world, the judge in ''Legally Blonde'' would not have permitted the defendant to fire the [[Alan Dershowitz]]-like lawyer in the middle of trial and retain the law student, never mind that no state permits first-year law students to represent clients in court," Wendel wrote.<ref name="Wendel 2007"/> The film cites Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3.03 as precedent for Woods being able to represent a client while under the supervision of a licensed attorney,<ref name="Mass.gov 2012">{{cite web | title=Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03: Legal assistance to the Commonwealth and to indigent criminal defendants and to indigent parties in civil proceedings | website=Mass.gov | date=October 15, 2012 | url=https://www.mass.gov/supreme-judicial-court-rules/supreme-judicial-court-rule-303-legal-assistance-to-the-commonwealth | access-date=July 31, 2020}}</ref> but the ruling only applies to third-year law students.<ref name="Lembo 2019"/>

"A first-year law student would never be able to question witnesses in a criminal court. The most she would be doing as a 1L (first-year student) would be research and drafting memos or motions, maybe," said Emma Therrien, a student at [[Lewis & Clark Law School]].<ref name="Lembo 2019"/>
