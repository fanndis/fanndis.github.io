== Taxonomy ==
[[File:albino monarch butterfly.jpg|thumb|White [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] of the monarch in Hawaii called white monarch]]
The name "monarch" is believed to have been given in honor of King [[William III of England]], as the butterfly's main color is that of the king's secondary title [[Prince of Orange]].<ref name="Jean Ruth Adams"/> The monarch was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|''Systema Naturae'' of 1758]] and placed in the genus ''[[Papilio]]''.<ref name="Carl Linnaeus"/> In 1780, [[Jan Krzysztof Kluk]] used the monarch as the [[type species]] for a new genus, ''[[Danaus (butterfly)|Danaus]]''.

[[Danaus]] ([[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|Δαναός}}), a great-grandson of [[Zeus]], was a mythical king in [[Egypt]] or [[Libya]], who founded [[Ancient Argos|Argos]]; ''[[Plexippus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Πλήξιππος}}) was one of the 50 sons of [[Aegyptus]], the twin brother of Danaus. In [[Homeric Greek]], his name means "one who urges on horses", i.e., "rider" or "[[chariot]]eer".<ref>{{LSJ|plh/cippos|πλήξιππος|ref}}</ref> In the 10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'', at the bottom of page 467,<ref name="Linnaeus, C. (1758)"/> Linnaeus wrote that the names of the ''Danai festivi'', the division of the genus to which ''Papilio plexippus'' belonged, were derived from the sons of Aegyptus. Linnaeus divided his large genus ''Papilio'', containing all known butterfly species, into what we would now call subgenera. The ''Danai festivi'' formed one of the "subgenera", containing colorful species, as opposed to the ''Danai candidi'', containing species with bright white wings. Linnaeus wrote: "{{lang|la|Danaorum Candidorum nomina a filiabus Danai Aegypti, Festivorum a filiis mutuatus sunt.}}" (English: "The names of the ''Danai candidi'' have been derived from the daughters of Danaus, those of the ''Danai festivi'' from the sons of Aegyptus.")

Robert Michael Pyle suggested ''Danaus'' is a masculinized version of [[Danaë]] (Greek {{wikt-lang|grc|Δανάη}}), Danaus's great-great-granddaughter, to whom Zeus came as a shower of gold, which seemed to him a more appropriate source for the name of this butterfly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pyle |first=Robert Michael |title=Chasing Monarchs: Migrating with the Butterflies of Passage |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO9eXQI0ZxQC&pg=PA148|year=2001 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books |isbn=978-0-618-12743-6 |pages=148–149 }}</ref>

There are three species of monarch butterflies:
* ''D. plexippus'', described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the species known most commonly as the monarch butterfly of North America. Its range actually extends worldwide and can be found in Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and the [[Pacific Islands]].
* ''[[Danaus erippus|D. erippus]]'', the southern monarch, was described by [[Pieter Cramer]] in 1775. This species is found in tropical and subtropical latitudes of South America, mainly in Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and southern Peru. The South American monarch and the North American monarch may have been one species at one time. Some researchers believe the southern monarch separated from the monarch's population some 2 [[mya (unit)|mya]], at the end of the [[Pliocene]]. [[Sea level]]s were higher, and the entire [[Amazon River|Amazonas]] lowland was a vast expanse of [[brackish]] swamp that offered limited butterfly habitat.<ref name=smith/>
* ''[[Danaus cleophile|D. cleophile]]'', the Jamaican monarch, described by [[Jean-Baptiste Godart]] in 1819, ranges from [[Jamaica]] to [[Hispaniola]].<ref name="IUCN"/>

Six subspecies and two color morphs of ''D. plexippus'' have been identified:<ref name="nic.funet.fi"/>
* ''D. p. plexippus'' – nominate subspecies, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the migratory subspecies known from most of North America.
** ''D. p. p.'' form ''nivosus'', the white monarch commonly found on [[Oahu]], Hawaii, and rarely in other locations.<ref name="Lawrence Gibbs"/>
** ''D. p. p.'' (as yet unnamed) – a color morph lacking some wing vein markings.<ref name="Jacob Groth"/>
* ''D. p. nigrippus'' ([[Richard Haensch]], 1909) – as ''forma'': ''Danais'' {{sic}} ''archippus'' f. ''nigrippus''. Hay-Roe et al. in 2007 identified this taxon as a subspecies:<ref name="Hay-Roe, Miriam M. 2007"/>
* ''D. p. megalippe'' ([[Jacob Hübner]], [1826]) – nonmigratory subspecies, and is found from [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] southwards, throughout the [[Caribbean]] and [[Central America]] to the [[Amazon River]].
* ''D. p. leucogyne'' ([[Arthur Gardiner Butler|Arthur G. Butler]], 1884) − St. Thomas
* ''D. p. portoricensis'' [[Austin Hobart Clark]], 1941 − Puerto Rico
* ''D. p. tobagi'' Austin Hobart Clark, 1941 − Tobago

The percentage of the white morph in Oahu is nearing 10%. On other Hawaiian islands, the white morph occurs at a relatively low frequency. White monarchs (''nivosus'') have been found throughout the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the United States.<ref name="Lawrence Gibbs"/>

Some taxonomists disagree on these classifications.<ref name=smith /><ref name="Hay-Roe, Miriam M. 2007"/>

Monarchs belong in the subfamily [[Danainae]] of the family [[Nymphalidae]]; [[Danainae]] was formerly considered a separately family [[Danaidae]].<ref name="P.R. Ackery"/>

A 2015 paper identified genes from wasp [[bracovirus]]es in the genome of the North American monarch<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gasmi|first1=Laila|last2=Boulain|first2=Helene|last3=Gauthier|first3=Jeremy|last4=Hua-Van|first4=Aurelie|last5=Musset|first5=Karine|last6=Jakubowska|first6=Agata K.|last7=Aury|first7=Jean-Marc|last8=Volkoff|first8=Anne-Nathalie|last9=Huguet|first9=Elisabeth|date=17 September 2015|title=Recurrent Domestication by Lepidoptera of Genes from Their Parasites Mediated by Bracoviruses|journal=PLOS Genet|volume=11|issue=9|pages=e1005470|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005470|pmc=4574769|pmid=26379286}}</ref> leading to articles about monarch butterflies being [[genetically modified organism]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28190-if-viruses-transfer-wasp-genes-into-butterflies-are-they-gm/|title=If viruses transfer wasp genes into butterflies, are they GM?|last=Le Page|first=Michael|date=17 September 2015|publisher=The New Scientist|access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/gmo-butterflies-made-naturally-parasitic-wasps-333221?rm=eu|title=Wasps Have Genetically Modified Butterflies, Using Viruses|last=Main|first=Douglas|date=17 September 2015|publisher=Newsweek|access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref>

== Description ==
[[File:Monarch on boneset.jpg|thumb|Monarch butterfly]]

The monarch's wingspan ranges from {{convert|8.9|to(-)|10.2|cm}}.<ref name="Garber"/> The upper sides of the [[Insect wing|wings]] are tawny orange, the veins and margins are black, and there are two series of small white spots in the margins. Monarch forewings also have a few orange spots near their tips. Wing undersides are similar, but the tips of forewings and hindwings are yellow brown instead of tawny orange and the white spots are larger.<ref name=Braby/> The shape and color of the wings change at the beginning of the migration and appear redder and more elongated than later migrants.<ref name="Satterfield"/> Wings size and shape differ between migratory and non-migratory monarchs. Monarchs from eastern North America have larger and more angular forewings than those in the western population.<ref name="Xerces Society"/> Monarchs are commonly and easily mistaken for the similar [[Viceroy (butterfly)|viceroy butterfly]] – the two species are [[Müllerian mimic]]s.

Monarch flight has been described as "slow and sailing",<ref name=Klots>{{cite book|last1=Klots|first1=Alexander B.|title=A Field Guide to the Butterflies of North America, East of the Great Plains|url=https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetobutt00alex|url-access=registration|date=1951|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|isbn=978-0395078655|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetobutt00alex/page/78 78], 79|edition=Tenth}}</ref> with a flight speed estimated at approximately 9&nbsp;km/h or 5.5&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2016/12/31/How-fast-does-a-monarch-fly-A-close-look-at-the-science |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=31 December 2016 |access-date=6 January 2017}}</ref> For comparison, the average human jogs at a rate of {{convert|6–8|mph|order=flip|abbr=on}}.

Adults are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Males are slightly larger than females<ref name="Xerces Society"/><ref name=Braby/> and have a black patch or spot of [[androconia]]l scales on each hindwing (in some butterflies, these patches disperse pheromones, but are not known to do so in monarchs). The male's black wing veins are lighter and narrower than those of females.<ref name="ref1"/>

One variation, the "white monarch", observed in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and the United States, is called "nivosus" by [[lepidopterist]]s. It is grayish white in all areas of its wings that are normally orange and is only about 1% or less of all monarchs, but populations as high as 10% exist on Oahu in Hawaii.<ref name="Lawrence Gibbs"/>

The monarch has six legs like all insects, but uses only its middle legs and hindlegs as the forelegs are vestigial, as in all [[Nymphalidae]], and held against its body.<ref name="Gene Darby"/>

=== Detailed measurements ===
[[File:Male and female monarch measurements.gif|thumb|Male and female monarch measurements]]

A study in 2015 examined a preserved collection of male and female monarch specimens from eastern North America to evaluate the sex-based differences in fine-scale wing and body structure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=A. K.|last2=Holden|first2= Michael T.|year=2015|url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2015/591705.pdf|title=Measuring Intraspecific Variation in Flight-Related Morphology of Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus): Which Sex Has the Best Flying Gear?|journal=Journal of Insects|volume=2015|issue=59170|pages=1–6|publisher=Hindawi Publishing Corporation|doi=10.1155/2015/591705|access-date=October 17, 2020}}</ref>
The study found significant differences in overall wing size and in the physical dimensions of wings. Males tended to have larger wings than females, and were heavier than females, on average. Both males and females had similar thorax dimensions (wing muscles are contained in the thorax). Female monarchs tended to have thicker wings, which is thought to convey greater tensile strength. This would make female wings less likely to be damaged during migration. Also, females had lower wing loading than males ([[wing loading]] is a value derived from the ratio of wing size to body mass), which would mean females require less energy to fly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2015/11/03/New-study-just-published-describing-why-female-monarchs-are-better-fliers |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=3 November 2015}}</ref>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:String of Monarchs, Pismo Preserve.jpg|thumb|350px|String of monarchs wintering at the [[Pismo State Beach]] Monarch Preserve, 2015]]
The range of the western and eastern populations of ''D. plexippus plexippus'' expands and contracts depending upon the season. The range differs between breeding areas, migration routes, and winter roosts.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>{{rp|(p18)}} However, no genetic differences between the western and eastern monarch populations exist;<ref name="Jeffrey L 2011"/> reproductive isolation has not led to subspeciation of these populations, as it has elsewhere within the species' range.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>{{rp|(p19)}}

Overwintering populations of ''D. plexippus plexippus'' are found in Mexico, California, along the Gulf Coast, year round in Florida, and in Arizona where the habitat has the specific conditions necessary for their survival.<ref name=rcgt>Cech, Rick and Tudor, Guy (2005).

Overwintering, roosting butterflies have been seen on basswoods, elms, sumacs, locusts, oaks, osage-oranges, mulberries, pecans, willows, cottonwoods, and mesquites.<ref name="Robert Michael Pyle"/> While breeding, monarch habitats can be found in agricultural fields, pasture land, prairie remnants, urban and suburban residential areas, gardens, trees, and roadsides – anywhere where there is access to larval host plants.<ref name="Sue Halpern"/> 

Habitat restoration is a primary goal in monarch conservation efforts. Habitat requirements change during migration. During the fall migration, butterflies must have access to nectar-producing plants. During the spring migration, butterflies must have access to larval food plants and nectar plants.

== Life cycle ==
The monarch butterfly undergoes four stages of complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]:

=== Eggs ===
The eggs are derived from materials ingested as larvae and from the [[spermatophore]]s received from males during mating.<ref name=o3>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 3</ref> Eggs are laid singly on the underside of a young leaf of a milkweed plant during the spring and summer months.<ref name="NatGeo"/> The eggs are cream colored or light green, ovate to conical in shape, and about 1.2×0.9&nbsp;mm in size. The eggs weigh less than 0.5&nbsp;mg each and have raised ridges that form longitudinally from the point to apex to the base. Though each egg is {{frac|1|1000}} the mass of the female, she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs.<ref name=o3/> The number of eggs laid by a female, who may mate several times, ranges from 290 to 1180.<ref name=o23>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 23</ref> Females lay their eggs on the underside of the milkweed leaves; the offspring's consumption of the milkweed benefits health and helps defend them against predators.<ref name="T. Lefevre"/><ref name="Jaap de Roode"/> Eggs take 3 to 8 days to develop and hatch into larva or [[caterpillar]]s.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>{{rp|(p21)}} Monarchs will lay eggs along the southern migration route.<ref name=o51>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 51</ref>

=== Larvae ===
The caterpillar goes through five major distinct stages of growth, and after each one it [[molt]]s. Each caterpillar, or [[instar]], is larger than the previous after molting, as it eats and stores energy in the form of fat and nutrients to carry it through the nonfeeding pupal stage. Each instar lasts about 3 to 5 days, depending on various factors such as temperature and food availability.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Vertical Caterpillar 2000px.jpg|thumb|upright|Fifth instar with the white spots visible on the prolegs]]

'''The first instar''' caterpillar that emerges from the egg is pale green and translucent. It lacks banding coloration or tentacles. The larvae or caterpillar eats its egg case and begins to feed on [[milkweed]]. It is during this stage of growth that the caterpillar begins to sequester [[cardenolide]]s. The circular motion a caterpillar uses while eating milkweed prevents the flow of [[latex]] that could entrap it. The first instar is usually between 2 and 6&nbsp;mm long.

'''The second instar''' larva develops a characteristic pattern of white, yellow and black transverse bands. It is no longer translucent but is covered in short [[setae]]. Pairs of black tentacles begin to grow, one pair on the thorax and another pair on the abdomen. Like the first instar, second instar larvae usually eat holes in the middle of the leaf, rather than at the edges. The second instar is usually between 6&nbsp;mm and 1&nbsp;cm long.

'''The third instar''' larva has more distinct bands and the two pairs of tentacles become longer. Legs on the thorax differentiate into a smaller pair near the head and larger pairs further back. These third-stage caterpillars begin to eat along the leaf edges. The third instar is usually between 1 and 1.5&nbsp;cm long.

'''The fourth instar''' has a different banding pattern. It develops white spots on the [[proleg]]s near the back of the caterpillar. It is usually between 1.5 and 2.5&nbsp;cm long.

'''The fifth instar''' larva has a more complex banding pattern and white dots on the prolegs, with front legs that are small and very close to the head. A caterpillar at this stage has an enormous appetite, being able to consume a large milkweed leaf in a day. Its length ranges from 2.5 to 4.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Swallowtail Caterpillar, Monarch Caterpillar & Queen Caterpillar in Florida (27224446333).jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison between an [[Papilio polyxenes|eastern black swallowtail caterpillar]] (top), a monarch caterpillar (middle), and a [[Queen (butterfly)|queen caterpillar]] (bottom).]]

As the caterpillar completes its growth, it is 4.5&nbsp;cm long (large specimens can reach 5&nbsp;cm) and 7 to 8&nbsp;mm wide, and weighs about 1.5&nbsp;grams, compared to the first instar, which was 2 to 6&nbsp;mm long and 0.5 to 1.5&nbsp;mm wide. Fifth-instar larvae increase in weight 2000 times from first instars. Fifth-stage instar larva can chew through the petiole or midrib of milkweed leaves and stop the flow of latex. After this, they eat more leaf tissue. Before pupation, larvae must consume milkweed to increase their mass, after which they stop feeding and search for a pupation site.

=== Pupa ===
[[File:Danaus plexippus emerging from chrysalis 04.jpg|thumb|upright=0.66|Adult monarch emerges from its [[chrysalis]] shell]]
To prepare for the [[pupa]] or [[chrysalis]] stage, the caterpillar chooses a safe place for pupation, where it spins a silk pad on a downward-facing horizontal surface. At this point, it turns around and securely latches on with its last pair of hindlegs and hangs upside down, in the form of the letter J. After "J-hanging" for about 12–16 hours, it will suddenly straighten out its body and go into [[peristalsis]] some seconds before its skin splits behind its head. It then sheds its skin over a period of a few minutes, revealing a green chrysalis. At first, the chrysalis is long, soft, and somewhat amorphous, but over a few hours it compacts into its distinct shape – an opaque, pale-green chrysalis with small golden dots near the bottom, and a gold-and-black rim around the dorsal side near the top.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|first=B.|date=1964|title=Humidity, Darkness, and Gold Spots as Possible Factors in Pupal Duration of Monarch Butterflies|journal=J. Lepidopterists' Soc|volume=18|pages=230–232}}</ref> At first, its exoskeleton is soft and fragile, but it hardens and becomes more durable within about a day. At this point, it is about 2.5&nbsp;cm (1") long and 10–12&nbsp;mm (3/8–7/16") wide, weighing about 1.2&nbsp;grams. At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8–15 days (usually 11–12 days). During this pupal stage, the adult butterfly forms inside. Within a day or so before emerging is due, the exoskeleton first becomes translucent and the chrysalis more bluish. Finally, within 12 hours or so, it becomes transparent, revealing the black and orange colors of the butterfly inside before it [[Eclosion|ecloses]] (emerges).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pocius|first1=V M|last2=Debinski|first2=D M|last3=Pleasants|first3=J M|last4=Bidne|first4=K G|last5=Hellmich|first5=R L|last6=Brower|first6=L P|date=2017-09-07|title=Milkweed Matters: Monarch Butterfly (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) Survival and Development on Nine Midwestern Milkweed Species|journal=Environmental Entomology|volume=46|issue=5|pages=1098–1105|doi=10.1093/ee/nvx137|pmid=28961914|pmc=5850784|issn=0046-225X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Adult ===
An adult butterfly emerges after about two weeks as a chrysalis, and hangs upside down for a few hours until its wings are dry. Fluids are pumped into the wings, which expand, dry, and stiffen. The monarch extends and retracts its wings, and once conditions allow, flies and feeds on a variety of nectar plants. During the breeding season, adults reach sexual maturity in four or five days. However, the migrating generation does not reach maturity until overwintering is complete.<ref name="monarchlab.org"/> Monarchs typically live for two to five weeks during their breeding season.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>{{rp|(pp22-23)}} Larvae growing in high densities are smaller, have lower survival, and weigh less as adults compared with those growing in lower densities.<ref name="D.T. Flockhart"/> Monarch metamorphosis from egg to adult occurs during the warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During the development, both larvae and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>{{rp|(pp21-22)}} However, this is a natural attrition rate for most butterflies, since they are low on the food chain.

==== Reproduction ====
[[File:Monarch butterfly mating.webm|thumb|Monarch butterfly mating]]

Females and males typically mate more than once. Females that mate several times lay more eggs.<ref name=":1"/> Mating for the overwintering populations occurs in the spring, prior to dispersion. Mating is less dependent on pheromones than other species in its genus.<ref name="animaldiversity1"/> Male search and capture strategies may influence copulatory success, and human-induced changes to the habitat can influence monarch mating activity at overwintering sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Solensky|first=Michelle J.|date=November 2004|title=The Effect of Behavior and Ecology on Male Mating Success in Overwintering Monarch Butterflies (''Danaus plexippus'')|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|volume=17|issue=6|pages=723–743|doi=10.1023/b:joir.0000048985.58159.0d|s2cid=31954178|issn=0892-7553}}</ref>

Courtship occurs in two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the butterflies copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes.<ref name="Emmel, Thomas C."/> Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females may be able to avoid mating, though some have more success than others.<ref name=":37"/><ref name=":38"/> During copulation, a male transfers his [[spermatophore]] to a female. Along with [[sperm]], the spermatophore provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in egg laying. An increase in spermatophore size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that produce larger spermatophores also fertilize more females' eggs.<ref name=":4"/>

''Asclepias curassavica'', or tropical milkweed, is often planted as an ornamental in butterfly gardens. Year-round plantings in the USA are controversial and criticised, as they may be the cause of new overwintering sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast, leading to year-round breeding of monarchs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2010/689301|title=Citizen Science Observations of Monarch Butterfly Overwintering in the Southern United States|journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology|volume=2010|page=1|year=2010|last1=Howard|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Aschen|first2=Harlen|last3=Davis |first3=Andrew K.|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is thought to adversely affect migration patterns, and to cause a dramatic buildup of the dangerous parasite, ''[[Ophryocystis elektroscirrha]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=25589600|pmc=4308991|year=2015|last1=Satterfield|first1=D.

Monarchs obtain moisture and minerals from damp soil and wet gravel, a behavior known as [[mud-puddling]]. The monarch has also been noticed puddling at an oil stain on pavement.<ref name=isc/>

== Migration ==
{{Further|Monarch butterfly migration}}
In North America, monarchs migrate both north and south on an annual basis, in a long-distance journey that is fraught with risks.<ref name=":0" /> The population east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] attempts to migrate to the [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] of the [[Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve]] in the Mexican state of [[Michoacán]] and parts of Florida. The western population tries to reach [[wikt:overwinter|overwintering destinations]] in various coastal sites in central and southern [[California]]. The overwintered population of those east of the Rockies may reach as far north as [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]] during the spring migration. The second, third and fourth generations return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring.<ref>{{cite web|title=North American Monarch Conservation Plan|url=http://www.mlmp.org/Resources/pdf/5431_Monarch_en.pdf|publisher=Commission for Environmental Cooperation|access-date=17 October 2014}}</ref> Captive-raised monarchs appear capable of migrating to overwintering sites in Mexico,<ref>{{Citation

One study suggests that this allows the butterflies the ability to detect ultraviolet polarized skylight in order to orient themselves with the sun for their long [[Insect migration|migratory]] flight.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sauman|first1=Ivo|last2=Briscoe|first2=Adriana D.|last3=Zhu|first3=Haisun|last4=Shi|first4=Dingding|last5=Froy|first5=Oren|last6=Stalleicken|first6=Julia|last7=Yuan|first7=Quan|last8=Casselman|first8=Amy|last9=Reppert|first9=Steven M.|date=5 May 2005 |title=Connecting the Navigational Clock to Sun Compass Input in Monarch Butterfly Brain|journal=Neuron|volume=46|issue=3|pages=457–467|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.03.014|pmid=15882645|s2cid=17755509|issn=0896-6273}}</ref>

These butterflies are capable of distinguishing colors based on their wavelength only, and not based on intensity; this phenomenon is termed "true color vision". This is important for many butterfly behaviors, including seeking nectar for nourishment, choosing a mate, and finding [[Asclepias|milkweed]] to lay eggs on. One study found that floral color is more easily recognized at a distance by butterflies searching for nectar than floral shape. This is may be because flowers have highly contrasting colors to the green background of a vegetative landscape.<ref name=":2" /> On the other hand, leaf shape is important for oviposition so that the butterflies can ensure their eggs are being laid on milkweed.

Beyond the perception of color, the ability to remember certain colors is essential in the life of monarch butterflies. Researchers have found that these insects can easily learn to associate color and, to a lesser extent shape, with sugary food rewards. When searching for [[nectar]], color is the first cue that draws the insect's attention toward a potential food source, and shape is a secondary characteristic that promotes the process. When searching for a place to lay one's eggs, the roles of color and shape are switched. There may also be a difference between male and female [[Butterfly|butterflies]] from other species in terms of the ability to learn certain colors; however, there is no differences between the sexes for monarch butterflies.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Cepero|first1=Laurel C.|last2=Rosenwald|first2=Laura C.|last3=Weiss|first3=Martha R.|date=1 July 2015 |title=The Relative Importance of Flower Color and Shape for the Foraging Monarch Butterfly (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|volume=28|issue=4|pages=499–511|doi=10.1007/s10905-015-9519-z|s2cid=18380612|issn=1572-8889}}</ref>

== Defense against predators ==
In both caterpillar and butterfly form, monarchs are [[aposematism|aposematic]]—warding off predators with a bright display of contrasting colors to warn potential predators of their undesirable taste and poisonous characteristics. Large larvae are able to avoid wasp predation by dropping from the plant or by jerking their bodies.<ref>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 44</ref>

=== Aposematism ===
[[File:Oleandrin-skeletal.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of [[oleandrin]], one of the [[cardiac glycoside]]s]]
Monarchs are foul tasting and poisonous due to the presence of [[cardenolide]]s in their bodies, which the caterpillars ingest as they feed on milkweed.<ref name="animaldiversity1" /> Monarchs and other cardenolide resistant insects rely on a resistant form of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na+/ K+-ATPase]] enzyme to tolerate significantly higher concentrations of cardenolides than nonresistant species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Karageorgi|first1=Marianthi|last2=Groen|first2=Simon C.|last3=Sumbul|first3=Fidan|last4=Pelaez|first4=Julianne N.|last5=Verster|first5=Kirsten I.|last6=Aguilar|first6=Jessica M.|last7=Hastings|first7=Amy P.|last8=Bernstein|first8=Susan L.|last9=Matsunaga|first9=Teruyuki|last10=Astourian|first10=Michael|last11=Guerra|first11=Geno|date=October 2019|title=Genome editing retraces the evolution of toxin resistance in the monarch butterfly|journal=Nature|volume=574|issue=7778|pages=409–412|doi=10.1038/s41586-019-1610-8|pmid=31578524|pmc=7039281|issn=1476-4687}}</ref> By ingesting a large amount of plants in the genus ''[[Asclepias]]'', primarily milkweed, monarch caterpillars are able to sequester cardiac glycosides, or more specifically [[cardenolide]]s, which are steroids that act in heart-arresting ways similar to [[digitalis]].<ref name=parsons_digitalis>{{cite journal|last=Parsons|first=J.A.|pmid=14298120 |pmc=1357291| title=A Digitallis-like Toxin in the Monarch Butterfly ''Danaus plexippus'' L|journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=178|year=1965 |issue=2|pages=290–304|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007628}}</ref> It has been found that monarchs are able to sequester cardenolides most effectively from plants of intermediate cardenolide content rather than those of high or low content.<ref name=malcolm_evolutionary>{{cite journal | last=Malcolm | first=S.

After the caterpillar becomes a butterfly, the toxins shift to different parts of the body.

=== Captive rearing ===
One of the most direct ways humans are interacting with monarchs is by rearing them in captivity, which has become increasingly popular, although there are risks to this activity, and this has become a controversial topic. On one hand there are many positive aspects of captive rearing. Monarchs are bred in schools and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events and weddings.<ref>

On the other hand this practice becomes problematic when monarchs are "mass-reared". Stories in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in 2015 and ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine in 2016 have summarized the controversy around this issue.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Platt TakePart |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/butterfly-releases_us_561de4eae4b028dd7ea5bcc2 |title=When Butterflies Shouldn't Fly Free |work=The Huffington Post |date=14 October 2015 |access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/06/21/are-we-loving-monarchs-to-death/#.WHJdexsrLIU |title=Are We Loving Monarchs to Death? – The Crux |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date=21 June 2016 |access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref> The frequent media reports of monarch declines has empowered many homeowners to attempt to rear as many monarchs as possible in their homes and then release them to the wild in an effort to "boost the monarch population". Some individuals have taken this practice to the extreme, with massive operations that rear thousands of monarchs at once, like one in [[Linn County, Iowa]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Love, Orlan |url=http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/business/agriculture/monarch-moonshot-officials-hope-to-make-linn-county-center-of-butterfly-production-and-habitat-20160825 |title= Monarch Moonshot: Officials hope to make Linn County center of butterfly production and habitat |publisher=The Gazette |date=25 August 2016 |access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref> However, the practice of rearing "large" numbers of monarchs in captivity for release into the wild is not condoned by monarch scientists, because of the risks of genetic issues and disease spread.<ref>[http://monarchjointventure.org/images/uploads/documents/Monarch_Rearing_Instructions.pdf Rearing Monarchs Responsibly: A conservationist's guide to raising monarchs for science and education]. Monarch Joint Venture, University of Minnesota</ref> One of the biggest concerns of mass-rearing is the potential for spreading the monarch parasite, ''[[Ophryocystis elektroscirrha]]'', into the wild. This parasite can rapidly build up in captive monarchs, especially if they are housed together. The spores of the parasite also can quickly contaminate all housing equipment, so that all subsequent monarchs reared in the same containers then become infected. One researcher stated that rearing more than 100 monarchs constitutes "mass-rearing" and should not be done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2015/09/07/What-everyone-needs-to-know-about-rearing-monarchs-from-a-science-standpoint |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=7 September 2015}}</ref>

In addition to the disease risks, researchers believe these captive-reared monarchs are not as fit as wild ones, owing to the unnatural conditions they are raised in. Homeowners often raise monarchs in plastic or glass containers in their kitchens, basements, porches, etc., and under artificial lighting and controlled temperatures. Such conditions would not mimic what the monarchs are used to in the wild, and may result in adult monarchs that are unsuited for the realities of their wild existence. In support of this, a recent study by a [[Citizen science|citizen scientist]] found that captive-reared monarchs have a lower migration success rate than wild monarchs do.<ref name=steffy/>

A study published in 2019 shed light on the fitness of captive-reared monarchs, by testing reared and wild monarchs on a tethered flight apparatus that assessed navigational ability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tenger-Trolander|first1=Ayşe|last2=Lu|first2=Wei|last3=Noyes|first3=Michelle|last4=Kronforst|first4=Marcus R.|date=16 July 2019 |title=Contemporary loss of migration in monarch butterflies|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=116|issue=29|pages=14671–14676|doi=10.1073/pnas.1904690116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6642386|pmid=31235586}}</ref> In that study, monarchs that were reared to adulthood in artificial conditions showed a reduction in navigational ability. This happened even with monarchs that were brought into captivity from the wild for a few days. A few captive-reared monarchs did show proper navigation. This study revealed the fragility of monarch development: if the conditions are not suitable, their ability to properly migrate could be impaired. The same study also examined the genetics of a collection of reared monarchs purchased from a butterfly breeder, and found they were dramatically different from wild monarchs, so much so that the lead author described them as "franken-monarchs".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasbutterflyranch.com/2019/07/02/study-of-genetic-franken-monarchs-provokes-online-ire-and-debate/|title=Study of "genetic franken monarchs" provokes online ire and debate|last=Maeckle {{!}}|first=Monika|date=2 July 2019 |website=texasbutterflyranch |access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>

An unpublished study in 2019 compared behavior of captive-reared versus wild monarch larvae.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2019/08/10/Effects-of-captive-rearing-on-caterpillar-anti-predator-behavior---an-inside-look-at-some-preliminary-data|title=Effects of captive-rearing on caterpillar anti-predator behavior - an inside look at some preliminary data|website=monarchscience |access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> The study showed that reared larvae exhibited more defensive behavior than wild larvae. The reason for this is unknown, but it could relate to the fact that reared larvae are frequently handled and/or disturbed.

The monarch butterfly is not currently listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ([[CITES]]) or protected specifically under U.S. domestic laws.<ref name="fws.gov"/> On 14 August 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Food Safety filed a legal petition requesting [[Endangered Species Act]] protection for the monarch and its habitat,<ref name="Xerces Society"/> based largely on the long-term trends observed at overwintering sites. The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] initiated a status review of the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act with a due date for information submission of 3 March 2015. The decision on whether to list the monarch is still pending, and a new deadline for completion of an internal FWS species status report is December 2020.

The number of monarchs overwintering in Mexico has shown a long-term downward trend. Since 1995, coverage numbers have been as high as {{convert|18|ha|acre|0}} during the winter of 1996–1997, but on average about {{convert|6|ha|acre|0}}. Coverage declined to its lowest point to date ({{convert|0.67|ha|acre|2}}) during the winter of 2013–2014, but rebounded to {{convert|4.01|ha|acre|0}} in 2015–2016. The average population of monarchs in 2016 was estimated at 200&nbsp;million. Historically, on average there are 300&nbsp;million monarchs. The 2016 increase was attributed to favorable breeding conditions in the summer of 2015. However, coverage declined by 27% to {{convert|2.91|ha|acre|2}} during the winter of 2016–2017. Some believe this was because of a storm that had occurred during March 2016 in the monarchs' previous overwintering season,<ref>(1) {{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228234901/http://www.learner.org/jnorth/monarch/spring2016/05/monarch-butterfly-population-size.html|archive-date=28 February 2016|url=http://www.learner.org/jnorth/monarch/spring2016/05/monarch-butterfly-population-size.html|work=Journey North|title=Monarch Population Size Announced|date=26 February 2016|last=Howard|first=Elizabeth|access-date=5 June 2017}}<br/>(2) {{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605224347/http://monarchjointventure.org/news-events/news/eastern-monarch-population-numbers-drop-27|archive-date=5 June 2017|url=http://monarchjointventure.org/news-events/news/eastern-monarch-population-numbers-drop-27|title=Eastern Monarch Population Numbers Drop 27%|work=News|publisher=The Monarch Joint Venture|date=16 February 2017|access-date=5 June 2017}}<br/>(3) {{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822070321/http://monarchlab.org/resources-links/blog/where-are-all-the-monarchs|archive-date=22 August 2016|url=http://monarchlab.org:80/resources-links/blog/where-are-all-the-monarchs|title=Where Are All The Monarchs?|work=Monarch Lab|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] Extension|date=14 July 2016|access-date=5 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> though this seems unlikely since most current research shows that the overwintering colony sizes do not predict the size of the next summer breeding population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2019/11/04/Another-monarch-study-published-showing-the-spring-migration-holds-the-key-to-everything|title=Another monarch study published showing the spring migration holds the key to everything|website=monarchscience |access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>

A study in 2016 claimed that the long-term trend in the size of the overwintering sites is cause for concern.

In [[Ontario]], Canada, the monarch butterfly is listed as a species of special concern.<ref name="Monarch Butterfly Status in Ontario"/> In fall 2016, the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] proposed that the monarch be listed as endangered in Canada, as opposed to its current listing as a "species of concern" in that country. This move, once enacted, would protect critical monarch habitat in Canada, such as major fall accumulation areas in southern Ontario, but it would also have implications for citizen scientists who work with monarchs, and for classroom activities. If the monarch were federally protected in Canada, these activities could be limited, or require federal permits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2016/12/18/Monarchs-to-be-listed-as-endangered-in-Canada---is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-citizen-science |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=18 December 2016 |access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref> In Nova Scotia, the monarch is listed as endangered at the provincial level, as of 2017.

== Threats ==

There is increasing concern related to the ongoing decline of monarchs at their overwintering sites; based on a 2014 twenty-year comparison, the overwintering numbers west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] have dropped more than 50 percent since 1997 and the overwintering numbers east of the Rockies have declined by more than 90 percent since 1995.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>

In February 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provided a statistic showing that nearly a billion monarchs have vanished from the overwintering sites since 1990. At that time, one of the main reasons cited was the herbicides used by farmers and homeowners on milkweed, a plant used as a food source, a home and a nursery by the monarchs.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/08/26/nearly-a-billion-monarch-butterflies-have-vanished-now-their-haven-in-mexico-is-also-disappearing/|title = As pesticides wipe out Monarch butterflies in the U.S., illegal logging is doing the same in Mexico|date = 26 August 2015|work = The Washington Post|last = Fears|first = Darryl}}</ref> A 2016 study also attributed the last decade's ten-fold decline in overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch population to the loss of breeding habitat, namely the many species of milkweed (''Asclepias'' species) that developing larvae require for food; however, scientists believe there are other factors as well. A number of researchers believe milkweed loss during the breeding season is the cause because declines in milkweed abundance are highly correlated with the adoption of herbicide-tolerant [[genetically modified maize|genetically modified corn]] and soybeans, which now constitute 89% and 94% of these crops, respectively, in the U.S.<ref name=Semmens/> However, correlative evidence does not prove causation, and other possible causes of the overwintering declines have been proposed. A 2018 study has suggested that the decline in milkweed predates the arrival of GM crops.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Puzey|first1=J. R.|last2=Dalgleish|first2=H. J.|last3=Boyle|first3=J.

=== Habitat loss due to herbicide use ===

A number of conservationists attribute the disappearance of [[Asclepias|milkweed species]] to agricultural practices in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], where [[Genetically modified crops|genetically modified seeds]] are bred to resist herbicides that eliminate milkweed nearby. Growers eliminate milkweed that previously grew between the rows of food crops. Corn and soybeans are resistant to the effect of the herbicide [[glyphosate]]. The increased use of these crop strains is correlated with the decline in monarch populations between 1999 and 2010.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pleasants|first1=John M.|last2=Oberhauser|first2=Karen S.|title=Milkweed loss in agricultural fields because of herbicide use: effect on the monarch butterfly population|journal=Insect Conservation and Diversity|year=2012|url=http://www.mlmp.org/results/findings/pleasants_and_oberhauser_2012_milkweed_loss_in_ag_fields.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4598.2012.00196.x|volume=6|issue=2|pages=135–144|s2cid=14595378|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904235825/http://www.mlmp.org/Results/Findings/Pleasants_and_Oberhauser_2012_milkweed_loss_in_ag_fields.pdf|archive-date=4 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Brennen">{{cite web |last=Brennen |first=Shannon |title=For Love of Nature: Annual monarch butterfly migration in peril| url= http://www.newsadvance.com/lifestyles/for-love-of-nature-annual-monarch-butterfly-migration-in-peril/article_e71ebf0e-019a-11e4-b8c9-0017a43b2370.html |publisher=The News & Advance, Lynchburg, Virginia |access-date=4 July 2014}}</ref>

=== Losses during migration ===

While herbicide-use has been proposed as one factor causing the decline in overwintering numbers of eastern monarchs, it is not the only possibility. Another is that the monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. This idea has been embraced by a number of leading monarch researchers, largely because of recent evidence showing that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades, based on long-term citizen science data.<ref name="Ries 2015">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/aesa/sav055|title=The Disconnect Between Summer and Winter Monarch Trends for the Eastern Migratory Population: Possible Links to Differing Drivers|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|volume=108|issue=5|page=691|year=2015|last1=Ries|first1=Leslie|last2=Taron|first2=Douglas J.|last3=Rendón-Salinas|first3=Eduardo|s2cid=85597731}}</ref><ref name="Inamine 2016">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/oik.03196|title=Linking the continental migratory cycle of the monarch butterfly to understand its population decline|journal=Oikos|volume=125|issue=8|page=1081|year=2016|last1=Inamine|first1=Hidetoshi|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|last3=Springer|first3=James P.|last4=Agrawal|first4=Anurag A.|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4598.2011.00158.x|title=Are migratory monarchs really declining in eastern North America?

=== Predators ===
While monarchs have a wide range of natural predators, none of these are suspected of causing harm to the overall population, or are the cause of the long-term declines in winter colony sizes.

Larvae feed exclusively on milkweed and consume protective cardiac glycosides. Toxin levels in ''Asclepias'' species vary. Not all monarchs are unpalatable, but exhibit [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian]] or [[Automimicry|automimics]]. Cardiac glycosides levels are higher in the abdomen and wings. Some predators can differentiate between these parts and consume the most palatable ones.<ref name="Barbosa">{{cite book |last=Barbosa |first=Pedro |author2=Deborah Kay Letourneau |title=Novel Aspects of Insect-plant Interactions |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fZbhllItE4C&pg=PA45 |year=1988 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |isbn=978-0-471-83276-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/novelaspectsofin1988unse/page/29 29–31] |chapter=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/novelaspectsofin1988unse/page/29 }}</ref> Bird predators include [[brown thrasher]]s, [[grackle]]s, [[American robin|robins]], [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinals]], [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[scrub jay]]s, [[pinyon jay]]s,<ref name="Barbosa" /> [[black-headed grosbeak]], and [[New World oriole|orioles]].<ref name="jas" />

Several species of birds have acquired methods that allow them to ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the cardiac glycosides. The oriole is able to eat the monarch through an [[exaptation]] of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify [[cardenolide]]s by taste and reject them.<ref name="Brower1988">{{cite journal|last=Brower|first=Lincoln|title=Avian Predation on the Monarch Butterfly and Its Implications for Mimicry Theory|journal=American Society of Naturalists|year=1988|volume=131|pages=S4–S6|doi=10.1086/284763|s2cid=84642806}}</ref> The grosbeak, on the other hand, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, orioles and grosbeaks will periodically have high levels of cardenolides in their bodies, and they will be forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50 percent and indicates that monarch [[aposematism]] has a legitimate purpose.<ref name="Brower1988" />

Some mice are able to withstand large doses of the toxin. Overwintering adults become less toxic over time making them more vulnerable to predators. In Mexico, about 14% of the overwintering monarchs are eaten by birds and mice.<ref name="rcgt" />

In North America, eggs and first-instar larvae of the monarch are eaten by larvae and adults of the [[Introduced species|introduced]] Asian lady beetle (''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'').<ref>{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=R.

One monarch researcher emphasizes that predation on eggs, larvae or adults is natural, since monarchs are part of the food chain, thus people should not take steps to kill predators of monarchs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2016/04/05/Very-interesting-study-on-monarch-predators-recently-published |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=5 April 2016}}</ref>

On [[Oahu]], a white [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] of the monarch has emerged. This is because of the introduction, in 1965 and 1966, of two [[bulbul]] species, ''[[Pycnonotus cafer]]'' and ''[[Pycnonotus jocosus]]''. They are now the most common insectivore birds, and probably the only ones preying on insects as large as the monarch. Monarchs in [[Hawaii]] are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may also be [[Physiological tolerance|tolerant]] of the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of [[apostatic selection]] (i.e., the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of [[camouflage]] (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stimson |first=John |author2=Mark Berman |year=1990 |title= Predator induced colour polymorphism in ''Danaus plexippus'' L.

Monarch chrysalises are parasitized by [[Pteromalidae|pteromalid wasps]], specifically ''[[Pteromalus cassotis]]''.<ref name="pteromalidae">{{cite journal|last1=Stenoien|first1=Carl|last2=McCoshum|first2=Shaun|last3=Caldwell|first3=Wendy|last4=De Anda|first4=Alma|last5=Oberhauser|first5=Karen|title=New reports that Monarch butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae, Linnaeus) are hosts for a pupal parasitoid (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea, Walker)|journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date=January 2015|volume=88|issue=1|pages=16–26|doi=10.2317/JKES1402.22.1|s2cid=52231552}}</ref> These wasps lay their eggs in the pupae while the chrysalis is still soft. Up to 400 adults emerge from the chrysalis after 14–20 days,<ref name="pteromalidae" /> killing the monarch.

The bacterium ''[[Micrococcus]] [[Micrococcus flacidifex danai|flacidifex danai]]'' also infects larvae. Just before pupation, the larvae migrate to a horizontal surface and die a few hours later, attached only by one pair of prolegs, with the thorax and abdomen hanging limp. The body turns black shortly after. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' has no invasive powers, but causes [[secondary infection]]s in weakened insects. It is a common cause of death in laboratory-reared insects.<ref name = Brewer/>

The [[protozoa]]n ''[[Ophryocystis elektroscirrha]]'' is another parasite of the monarch. It infects the [[subcutaneous tissue]]s and propagates by spores formed during the pupal stage. The spores are found over all of the body of infected butterflies, with the greatest number on the abdomen. These spores are passed, from [[vertical transmission|female to caterpillar]], when spores rub off during egg laying and are then ingested by caterpillars. Severely infected individuals are weak, unable to expand their wings, or unable to eclose, and have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary in populations. This is not the case in laboratory rearing, where after a few generations, all individuals can be infected.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leong |first= K. L. H. |author2=M. A. Yoshimura, H. K. Kaya and H.

=== Confusion of host plants ===

The black swallow-wort (''[[Cynanchum louiseae]]'') and pale swallow-wort (''[[Cynanchum rossicum]]'') plants are problematic for monarchs in North America. Monarchs lay their eggs on these relatives of native vining milkweed (''[[Cynanchum laeve]]'') because they produce stimuli similar to milkweed. Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillars are poisoned by the toxicity of this [[invasive plant]] from Europe.<ref>[http://monarchjointventure.org/images/uploads/documents/Swallow-wort_flyer.pdf Invasive species alert: Black swallow-wort (''Cynanchum louisea'') and pale swallow-wort (''Cynanchum rossicum'')]. monarchjointventure.org]</ref>

=== Loss of overwintering habitat ===

The area of forest occupied has been declining and reached its lowest level in two decades in 2013. The decline is continuing but is expected to increase during the 2013–2014 season. Mexican environmental authorities continue to monitor [[illegal logging]] of the [[oyamel]] trees. The oyamel is a major species of evergreen on which the overwintering butterflies spend a significant time during their winter [[diapause]], or suspended development.<ref>Paz, Fátima (18 June 2014) [http://www.cambiodemichoacan.com.mx/nota-227099 En espera de aprobación de la Profepa por tala ilegal en la Reserva de la Mariposa Monarca]. cambiodemichoacan.com.mx</ref>

A 2014 study acknowledged that while "the protection of overwintering habitat has no doubt gone a long way towards conserving monarchs that breed throughout eastern North America", their research indicates that habitat loss on breeding grounds in the United States is the main cause of both recent and projected population declines.<ref name="University of Guelph">{{cite web | url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/news/2014/06/habitat_loss_on.html | title=Habitat Loss on Breeding Grounds Cause of Monarch Decline, U of G Study Finds | publisher=University of Guelph | date=4 June 2014 | access-date=17 March 2015}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Climate variations during the fall and summer affect butterfly reproduction. Rainfall, and freezing temperatures affect milkweed growth. Omar Vidal, director general of WWF-Mexico, said "The monarch's lifecycle depends on the climatic conditions in the places where they breed. Eggs, larvae and pupae develop more quickly in milder conditions. Temperatures above 35{{nbsp}}°C (95{{nbsp}}°F) can be lethal for larvae, and eggs dry out in hot, arid conditions, causing a drastic decrease in hatch rate."<ref>[http://worldwildlife.org/stories/monarch-population-hits-lowest-point-in-more-than-20-years Monarch Population Hits Lowest Point in More Than 20 Years]. WWF (29 January 2014)</ref> If a monarch's body temperatures is below 30{{nbsp}}°C (86{{nbsp}}°F) a monarch cannot fly. To warm up they will sit in the sun or rapidly shiver their wings to warm themselves.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defenders.org/monarch-butterfly/basic-facts |title=Basic Facts About Monarch Butterflies}}</ref>

There is concern that [[climate change]] will dramatically affect the monarch migration. A study from 2015 examined the impact of warming temperatures on the breeding range of the monarch, and showed that in the next 50 years the monarch host plant will expand its range further north into Canada, and that the monarchs will follow this.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118614|pmid=25705876|pmc=4338007|title=Climate Change May Alter Breeding Ground Distributions of Eastern Migratory Monarchs (''Danaus plexippus'') via Range Expansion of ''Asclepias'' Host Plants|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=2|pages=e0118614|year=2015|last1=Lemoine|first1=Nathan P.|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1018614L}}
</ref> While this will expand the breeding locations of the monarch, this will also have the effect of increasing the distance that monarchs must travel to reach their overwintering destination in Mexico, and this could result in greater mortality during the migration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2015/08/10/The-quietlypublished-paper-on-climate-change-and-monarchs |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=10 August 2015}}</ref>

Milkweeds grown at increased temperatures have been shown to contain higher cardenolide concentrations making the leaves too toxic for the monarch caterpillars, but these increased concentrations are likely in response to increased insect herbivory which is also caused by the increased temperatures, so it is unknown whether increased temperatures in isolation will make milkweed too toxic for monarch caterpillars.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hahn|first1=Philip G.|last2=Agrawal|first2=Anurag A.|last3=Sussman|first3=Kira I.|last4=Maron|first4=John L.|date=January 2019|title=Population Variation, Environmental Gradients, and the Evolutionary Ecology of Plant Defense against Herbivory|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=193|issue=1|pages=20–34|doi=10.1086/700838|issn=1537-5323|pmid=30624107|s2cid=54076888|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4df6bcc517b75bc560c50e42e7d67a242d3415dd}}</ref> Additionally, milkweed grown at carbon dioxide levels of 760 parts per million (ppm) plants were found to produce a different mix of the toxic cardenolides, one that was less effective against monarch parasites.<ref name="Climate change, pesticides put monarch butterflies at risk of extinction">{{cite web | title = Climate change, pesticides put monarch butterflies at risk of extinction | publisher=National Geographic | url =https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/12/monarch-butterflies-risk-extinction-climate-change/ | access-date = 31 December 2018 | date=21 December 2018 }}</ref>

== Conservation efforts ==
{{see also|Monarch butterfly conservation in California}}
Although numbers of breeding monarchs in eastern North America have apparently not decreased, reports of declining numbers of overwintering butterflies have inspired efforts to conserve the species.<ref name="Ries 2015"/><ref name="Inamine 2016"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> Because of concerns over the overwintering numbers, the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], the [[Center for Food Safety]], the [[Xerces Society]] and [[Lincoln Brower]] have filed a petition to the [[United States Department of the Interior]] to protect the monarch by having it federally protected.<ref name="Xerces Society"/>

On 20 June 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] issued a presidential memorandum entitled "Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators". The memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force, to be co-chaired by the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] and the [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]], and stated:<blockquote>The number of migrating Monarch butterflies sank to the lowest recorded population level in 2013–14, and there is an imminent risk of failed migration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Obama|first=President Barack|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/20/presidential-memorandum-creating-federal-strategy-promote-health-honey-b|title=Presidential Memorandum – Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators|date=20 June 2014|work=Office of the Press Secretary|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[White House|The White House]]|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

In May 2015, the Pollinator Health Task Force issued a "National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators". The strategy lays out current and planned federal actions to achieve three goals, two of which are:<blockquote>• Monarch Butterflies: Increase the Eastern population of the monarch butterfly to 225 million butterflies occupying an area of approximately 15 acres (6 hectares) in the overwintering grounds in Mexico, through domestic/international actions and public-private partnerships, by 2020.<br />• Pollinator Habitat Acreage: Restore or enhance 7 million acres of land for pollinators over the next 5 years through Federal actions and public/private partnerships.</blockquote>

Many of the priority projects that the national strategy identifies will focus on the [[Interstate 35|I-35]] corridor extending for {{convert|1,500|mi|km}} from Texas to Minnesota that provides spring and summer breeding habitats in the monarch's key migration corridor.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pollinator Health Task Force|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/Pollinator%20Health%20Strategy%202015.pdf|title=National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[The White House]]|date=19 May 2015|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref>

There have been a number of national and local efforts underway to establish pollinator habitat along highways and roadways, although this effort is controversial. Conservationists are lobbying transportation departments and utilities to reduce their use of herbicides and specifically encourage milkweed to grow along roadways and power lines. Reducing roadside mowing and application of herbicides during the butterfly breeding season will encourage milkweed growth.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tennessee Makes Way for Monarchs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/opinion/tennessee-wildflowers-nature.html?te=1&nl=david-leonhardt&emc=edit_ty_20190916?campaign_id=39&instance_id=12416&segment_id=17060&user_id=579ae23cfcbd75c9aac87cb571cc201c&regi_id=72995439 |access-date=16 September 2019 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> Conservationists lobby agriculture companies to set aside areas that remain unsprayed to allow the butterflies to breed.<ref name="Brennen"/> This practice is controversial because of the high risk of butterfly mortality near roads, as several studies have shown that millions of monarchs and other butterflies are killed by cars every year.<ref name="monarchscience"/> There is also evidence that monarch larvae living near roads experience physiological stress conditions, as evidenced by elevations in their heart rate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Andrew K.|last2=Schroeder|first2=Hayley|last3=Yeager|first3=Ian|last4=Pearce|first4=Jana|date=31 May 2018 |title=Effects of simulated highway noise on heart rates of larval monarch butterflies, ''Danaus plexippus'': implications for roadside habitat suitability|journal=Biology Letters |volume=14|issue=5|pages=20180018|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2018.0018|pmc=6012697|pmid=29743264}}</ref>

For example, in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarchs prefer to reproduce on common milkweed (''[[Asclepias syriaca]]''), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. Because monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when milkweed foliage is old and tough, ''A. syriaca'' needs to be cut back in June through August to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak.<ref name="Monarch Joint Venture"/><ref>(1) {{cite web|url=http://midatlanticgardener.com/alonso-abugattas-native-plant-wildlife/|title=Milkweeds (mostly Asclepias spp.)|work=Alonso Abugattas Shares Native Plant Picks for Wildlife|year=2016|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Gardener|access-date=17 October 2020|quote=Milkweeds are in vogue now to help the Monarch butterflies and the 11 other caterpillar species who feed on the plants.

Although monarch caterpillars will feed on butterfly weed (''Asclepias tuberosa'') in butterfly gardens, the plant has rough leaves and is typically not a heavily used host plant. The plant is therefore less suitable for use in butterfly gardens and monarch waystations than are other milkweed species.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Tony|url=https://monarchbutterflygarden.net/milkweed-plant-seed-resources/asclepias-tuberosa-butterfly-weed/|title=''Asclepias tuberosa'': Butterfly Weed for Monarchs and More|work=Monarch Butterfly Garden|publisher=MonarchButterflyGarden.net|access-date=17 October 2010|quote=Rough leaves for monarch caterpillars, not typically a heavily used host plant}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816204046/https://monarchbutterflygarden.net/milkweed-plant-seed-resources/asclepias-tuberosa-butterfly-weed/|date=16 August 2017}}.</ref>  In addition, the plant's lack of cardiac glycosides may also make the plant unattractive to egg-laying monarchs.<ref name=Abugattas/>
