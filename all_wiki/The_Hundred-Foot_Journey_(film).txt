'''''The Hundred-Foot Journey''''' is a 2014 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Lasse Hallström]] from a screenplay written by [[Steven Knight]], adapted from Richard Morais' 2010 novel [[The Hundred-Foot Journey|of the same name]]. The film stars [[Helen Mirren]], [[Om Puri]], [[Manish Dayal]] and [[Charlotte Le Bon]] and is about a battle of two restaurants in a village: one by an Indian family and the other, a lofty [[Michelin Guide|Michelin-starred]] restaurant.

Produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]] for [[DreamWorks Pictures]] through their respective production companies, [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Harpo Films]], in association with [[Participant Media]] and [[Reliance Entertainment]], it was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on August 8, 2014,<ref name="rel1" /> and grossed $94 million at the worldwide box office.

==Plot==
A Konkani Muslim Kadam family ran a restaurant in [[Mumbai]]. The second-oldest son, Hassan Haji ([[Manish Dayal]]), was being groomed to replace his ammi ([[Juhi Chawla]]) as the restaurant's main cook. He shops with her for sea-food and is a connoisseur of sea-food from childhood who can same smell fish to find out the best quality one. However, a mob attacks and firebombs the restaurant over an election dispute. Abbu Kadam ([[Om Puri]]) and his family evacuate the guests, but ammi dies in the fire. Seeking [[political asylum|asylum]] in Europe, the family first settles in London, where their residence proves ill-suited for a restaurant. They depart for [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]].

Shortly after entering France, the brakes on Abbu's van fail near [[Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val]] in the [[Midi-Pyrénées]]. Marguerite ([[Charlotte Le Bon]]), a [[sous chef]] at an upscale French restaurant named "Le Saule Pleureur" ("The Weeping Willow"), passes by and offers to help the Kadams find an auto repair shop and a guest house. She brings the Kadams to her apartment and treats them to cold food but no pork, even though pork is a French delicacy. Abbu is amazed at the quality of the food in the village and its availability and discovers that Marguerite made the food herself.

Abbu learns of an abandoned restaurant building available for purchase.  It is located directly across the street — only a hundred feet (30&nbsp;m) — from Le Saule Pleureur.  Madame Mallory ([[Helen Mirren]]), proprietor of Le Saule Pleureur and purporting to act as caretaker for the owners of the abandoned restaurant, asks the Kadams to leave because it is "private property". Abbu sits with his family at a French restaurant drinking only water and not touching alcohol, because sharab is haram. Abbu buys the property, even though the rest of his family is against it, and names the restaurant "Maison Mumbai".

Mallory asks for their menu and by the time of their opening night has bought all the locally available ingredients they would need to serve. A cold war erupts between Abbu and Mallory. The war peaks on [[Bastille Day]] when one of Mallory's chefs, Jean-Pierre, and two others vandalize the Kadams' restaurant by spray-painting words which translate to "France for the French" on the outer wall and firebombing the interior. Hassan catches the arsonists in the act and scares them off, but his hands and legs are burned.  The following morning Mallory, who deduced who is responsible for the arson and vandalism, dismisses Jean-Pierre and personally cleans the graffiti from Maison Mumbai.

Hassan, having heard from Marguerite that Mallory hires potential chefs by taste-testing an omelette and deciding whether the person is indeed a great chef, asks if he may cook an omelette for her to his recipe. Due to his injured hands, Mallory helps under Hassan's supervision. After tasting the omelette, which had Indian influences to it, Mallory recognizes Hassan's potential and invites him to work for her as an apprentice, and confesses that she deliberately sabotaged his apology on behalf of his father, when he recreated a classic pigeon dish. Abbu is initially against the move, but ultimately strikes a deal with her as to Hassan's pay.

Hassan's cooking, which gradually evolves into a fusion of [[Indian cuisine]] and [[French cuisine]], results in Mallory's restaurant receiving its second [[Michelin Guide#Stars|Michelin star]]. The award draws national attention to Hassan's cooking, and he is offered and accepts a job in Paris. Abbu and Mallory make amends and begin seeing each other, but Hassan's relationship with Marguerite has soured.

Hassan's cooking in Paris quickly receives critical acclaim, fueling speculation of a third Michelin Star for the Paris restaurant, but his work is increasingly bogged down by thoughts of his family and Marguerite (with whom he had an ongoing romance). Hassan returns home a year later and reunites with Marguerite. He invites Marguerite to join him in a business venture—buying a stake in Mallory's restaurant, along with operational control. Hassan believes this will help the restaurant earn its third star. That evening, Hassan and Marguerite prepare dinner at Mallory's restaurant and bring the dishes across the road to the courtyard of Maison Mumbai for all to enjoy.
