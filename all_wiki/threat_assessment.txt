'''Threat Assessment''' is the practice of determining the credibility and seriousness of a [[Predictive profiling|potential threat]], as well as the probability that the [[threat]] will become a reality.<ref name=NASP>{{cite web|title=Threat Assessment: Predicting and Preventing School Violence|url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/factsheets/threatassess_fs.aspx|publisher=[[National Association of School Psychologists]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=USSS>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL THREAT ASSESSMENT CENTER|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac.shtml|publisher=[[United States Secret Service]]|accessdate=16 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203184946/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac.shtml|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> Threat assessment is separate to the more established practice of violence-[[risk assessment]], which attempts to predict an individual's general capacity and tendency to react to situations violently. Instead, threat assessment aims to interrupt people on a pathway to commit "predatory or instrumental violence, the type of behavior associated with targeted attacks," according to J. Reid Meloy, PhD, co-editor of the ''International Handbook of Threat Assessment''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International handbook of threat assessment|others=Meloy, J.

== Components ==
Threat assessment involves several major components(1-4):
* Identification: Identifying threats to commit a potential unfavorable act. Authorities must also convey that tips will be dealt with carefully and responsibly; understanding that people who report threats may fear that they could wrongly implicate someone else, entangle themselves in trouble or both. 
* Initial Assessment: Determining the seriousness of the threat. This could involve security professionals, school counselors, supervisors or human resources managers talking to the person of concern and his or her peers and supervisors, as well as looking to social media sites, to better assess whether or not the person is planning violence, as well as to assess the subject's current life situations. 
* Case Management: Developing intervention plans to address the underlying issue, such as bullying, anxiety and/or depression, which mental health professionals are trained to handle. In the cases where the assessment reveals a true threat, law enforcement and other professionals develop a plan to disrupt the potential pathway to violence. In the short term, that could mean alerting potential victims and restraining the subject. In the long term, it means to redirect someone who might be on such a path.  However, this can be considered a violation of one's civil right to be free in his property, person, and effects (The United States Constitution).
* Follow-up Assessment and Safety Planning: Depending on the threat, explicit or implied, past history or current threats of violence, according to Joseph A. Davis, Ph.D., author and editor of "Stalking Crimes and Victim Protection" (Taylor-Francis/Routledge Press, 2001, 538 pages), the person determining the viability of a threat needs to critically evaluate the ongoing nature of the threat by continuously looking at the R-S-I-F indicators. That is, the RECENCY-SEVERITY-INTENSITY-FREQUENCY aspects of the threat by the threatener [6]

== Areas of need ==
Threat assessment is relevant to many businesses and other venues, including schools. Threat assessment professionals, who include psychologists and law enforcement agents, work to identify and help potential offenders, guiding students to overcome underlying sources of [[anger]], [[Depression (mood)|hopelessness]] or [[Depression (mood)|despair]]. These feelings can increase a student's risk of [[suicide]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[Substance abuse|drug use]], [[physical abuse]], dropping out and criminal activity. Threat assessment also applies to risk management. Information security risk managers often perform a threat assessment before developing a plan to mitigate those threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/auditing/overview-threat-risk-assessment-76|title=Overview of Threat Risk Assessment|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sans.org|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref>
