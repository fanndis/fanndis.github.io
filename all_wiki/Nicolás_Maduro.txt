==== 2006 detention in New York ====
In September 2006, while attempting to travel back to [[Venezuela]] via Miami, Florida, Foreign Minister Maduro was briefly detained by [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] officers at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] for around 90 minutes, after paying for three air tickets in cash. Both Foreign Minister Maduro and President [[Hugo Chávez]] were in New York City attending the 61st session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], where President Chávez called US President [[George W. Bush]] "the devil" during [[2006 Chávez speech at the United Nations|his speech]].<ref name="CNN06">{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/09/23/fm.detained/index.html|title=Venezuelan official briefly detained at New York airport|date=24 September 2006|work=[[CNN]]}}</ref>

The incident began when Maduro tried to pick up an item that had been screened at a security checkpoint at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK International Airport]], security personnel told Maduro that he was prohibited from doing so. Maduro later identified himself as a diplomat from the Venezuela government, but officials still escorted him to a room for conducting secondary screening.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2006/09/24/Venezuela-official-held-at-US-airport/42641159094634/|title=Venezuela official held at U.S. airport|date=24 September 2006|work=[[United Press International]]}}</ref> At one point, authorities ordered Maduro and other Venezuelan officials to spread their arms and legs and be frisked, but Maduro and others forcefully refused. His diplomatic passport and ticket were retained for a time, and finally given back to him.<ref name="NBCN06" />

Speaking at the Venezuelan mission to the UN after his release, Maduro called the US government as "racist" and "Nazi" while at the same time accusing the US of not respecting Latin American countries. He claims that his detention by the US authorities was illegal and has filed a complaint at the United Nations. Both US and UN officials called the incident regrettable but said Maduro had been identified for "secondary screening". A UN diplomat said that Maduro was not authorized to speak publicly while his trip was delayed because he had showed up late without a ticket, prompting the screening.<ref name="NBCN06">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14973226/ns/world_news-americas/t/chavez-us-detained-venezuelan-official/#.XPTeUogzaUl|title=Chavez: U.S. detained Venezuelan official|date=24 September 2006|work=[[NBC News]]}}</ref> Moreover, Maduro said the incident prevented him from traveling home on the same day.

President [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] was informed about the incident, saying his detention was a provocation from [[2006 Hugo Chávez speech at the United Nations|"the devil"]] and stated that the authorities detained Maduro over his links [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|to a failed coup in 1992]], a charge that President Chavez denied.<ref name="NBCN06" />

=== Vice President of Venezuela ===
Prior to his appointment to the vice presidency, Maduro had already been chosen by Chávez in 2011 to succeed him in the presidency if he were to die from cancer. This choice was made due to Maduro's loyalty to Chávez and because of his good relations with other chavista hard-liners such as [[Elías Jaua]], former minister [[Jesse Chacón]] and [[Jorge Rodríguez (politician)|Jorge Rodríguez]]. Bolivarian officials predicted that following Chávez's death, Maduro would have more difficulties politically and that instability in the country would arise.<ref>{{cite news|title=Publicista brasileña revela que en 2011 ya se sabía que Maduro sería el sucesor de Chávez|url=http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/publicista-brasilena-revela-que-2011-ya-se-sabia-que-maduro-seria-el-sucesor-chavez-n4121955|access-date=20 May 2017|work=[[Diario Las Americas]]|date=15 May 2017|language=es}}</ref>

Chávez appointed Maduro [[Vice President of Venezuela]] on 13 October 2012, shortly after his victory in that month's [[2012 Venezuelan presidential election|presidential election]]. Two months later, on 8 December 2012, Chávez announced that his recurring cancer had returned and that he would be returning to [[Cuba]] for emergency surgery and further medical treatment. Chávez said that should his condition worsen and a new presidential election be called to replace him, Venezuelans should vote for Maduro to succeed him. This was the first time that Chávez named a potential successor to his movement, as well as the first time he publicly acknowledged the possibility of his demise.<ref>{{cite news |author=James, Ian |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/12/08/venezuela-chavez-cancer/1756293/ |title=Venezuela's Chavez Says Cancer Back, Plans Surgery |work=USA Today |date=8 December 2012 |access-date=8 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Crooks, Nathan |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-09/venezuela-s-chavez-says-new-cancer-cells-detected-in-cuba-exams.html |title=Venezuela's Chavez Says New Cancer Cells Detected in Cuba Exams |publisher=Bloomberg |date=8 December 2012 |access-date=8 December 2012}}</ref>

Chávez's endorsement of Maduro sidelined [[Diosdado Cabello]], a former vice president and powerful [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|Socialist Party]] official with ties to the [[National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela|armed forces]], who had been widely considered a top candidate to be Chávez's successor. After Maduro was endorsed by Chávez, Cabello "immediately pledged loyalty" to both men.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20664349 "Profile: Nicolas Maduro"].

{{Main|Presidency of Nicolás Maduro}}

[[File:Nicolás Maduro 19 April 2013.png|thumb|Maduro taking the [[oath of office]] as president of Venezuela on 19 April 2013]]
The succession to the presidency of Maduro in 2013, according to Corrales and Penfold, was due to multiple mechanisms established by Maduro's predecessor, Chávez. Initially, oil prices were high enough for Maduro to maintain necessary spending for support, specifically with the military. Foreign ties that were established by Chávez were also used by Maduro as he applied skills that he had learned while serving as a foreign minister. Finally, the PSUV and government institutions aligned behind Maduro, and "the regime used the institutions of repression and [[autocracy]], also created under Chávez, to become more repressive [[wikt:vis-à-vis|vis-à-vis]] the opposition".<ref name="DRAGONp13">{{cite book|last1=Corrales|first1=Javier|last2=Penfold|first2=Michael|title=Dragon in the Tropics: The Legacy of Hugo Chávez|date=2 April 2015|publisher=[[Brookings Institution Press]]|isbn=978-0815725930|page=13}}</ref>

Porras (Maduro's former chief of staff) said in 2019 that Maduro "delivered practically nothing in terms of public policy, in terms of direction" during his first term because, in Porras' opinion, "he does not have a clear vision for the country.

The 62 petitioners, including former ambassador [[Diego Arria]], businessman [[Marcel Granier]] and opposition former military, assuring that according to the Colombian constitution Maduro is "Colombian by birth" for being "the son of a Colombian mother and for having resided" in the neighboring country "during his childhood".<ref>{{cite news|title=¿Maduro es colombiano?: polémica llega al parlamento venezolano|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-16496040|date=30 January 2016|access-date=10 May 2018|work=El Tiempo}}</ref> The same year several former members of the Electoral Council sent an open letter to Tibisay Lucena requesting to "exhibit publicly, in a printed media of national circulation the documents that certify the strict compliance with Articles 41 and 227 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that is to say, the birth certificate and the Certificate of Venezuelan Nationality by Birth of Nicolás Maduro Moros in order to verify if he is Venezuelan by birth and without another nationality".

On 28 October 2016, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice issued a ruling stating that according to "incontrovertible" proofs it has "absolute certainty" that Maduro was born in Caracas, in the parish of La Candelaria, known then as the Libertador Department of the Federal District, on 23 November 1962.<ref name="EN" /> The ruling does not reproduce Maduro's birth certificate but it quotes a communication signed on 8 June by the Colombian Vice minister of foreign affairs, Patti Londoño Jaramillo, where it states that "no related information was found, nor civil registry of birth, nor citizenship card that allows to infer that president Nicolás Maduro Moros is a Colombian national". The Supreme Court warned the deputies and the Venezuelans that "sowing doubts about the origins of the president" may "lead to the corresponding criminal, civil, administrative and, if applicable, disciplinary consequences" for "attack against the State".<ref name=":3" />

On 11 January 2018, the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile]] decreed the nullity of the 2013 presidential elections after lawyer Enrique Aristeguita Gramcko presented evidence about the presumed non-existence of ineligibility conditions of Nicolás Maduro to be elected and to hold the office of the presidency. Aristeguieta argued in the appeal that, under Article 96, Section B, of the Political Constitution of Colombia, Nicolás Maduro Moros, even in the unproven case of having been born in Venezuela, is "Colombian by birth" because he is the son of a Colombian mother and by having resided in that territory during his youth.

Two nephews of Maduro's wife, Efraín Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were found guilty in a US court of conspiracy to import cocaine in November 2016, with some of their funds possibly assisting Maduro's presidential campaign in the [[2013 Venezuelan presidential election]] and potentially for the [[2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election]]s, with the funds mainly used to "help their family stay in power".<ref name=INSIGHT>{{cite web|last1=Yagoub|first1=Mimi|title=Venezuela Military Officials Piloted Drug Plane|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/venezuela-military-officials-piloted-drug-plane|website=[[InSight Crime]]|access-date=25 November 2015|date=20 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=ABCnov19>{{cite news|last1=Blasco|first1=Emili J.|title=La Casa Militar de Maduro custodió el traslado de droga de sus sobrinos|url=http://www.abc.es/internacional/abci-casa-militar-maduro-custodio-traslado-droga-sobrinos-201511190248_noticia.html|access-date=25 November 2015|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=19 November 2015}}</ref><ref name="REUT18nov">{{cite news|last1=Raymond|first1=Nate|title=Venezuelan first lady's nephews convicted in U.S. drug trial|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-usa-crime-idUSKBN13D2PK|access-date=19 November 2016|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=19 November 2016}}</ref> One informant stated that the two often flew out of Terminal 4 of [[Simón Bolívar International Airport (Venezuela)|Simon Bolivar Airport]], a terminal reserved for the president.<ref name=INSIGHT /><ref name=ABCnov19 />

After Maduro's nephews were apprehended by the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] for the illegal distribution of cocaine on 10 November 2015, carrying diplomatic passports, Maduro posted a statement on Twitter criticizing "attacks and imperialist ambushes", saying "the Father land will continue on its path".<ref>{{cite news|title = U.S. arrests Nicolas Maduro's family members |url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/americas/venezuela-president-family-members-arrested/index.html|publisher = CNN|access-date = 30 November 2015}}</ref> [[Diosdado Cabello]], a senior official in Maduro's government, was quoted as saying the arrests were a "kidnapping" by the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Arrest of Nicolas Maduro Relatives a 'Kidnapping,' Venezuelan Official Says|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/arrest-of-nicolas-maduro-relatives-a-kidnapping-venezuelan-official-says-1447712823|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal|access-date = 30 November 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Anatoly|last = Kurmanaev}}</ref>

On 18 May 2018, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] placed sanctions in effect against high-level official [[Diosdado Cabello]]. OFAC stated that Cabello and others used their power within the Bolivarian government "to personally profit from extortion, money laundering, and embezzlement", with Cabello allegedly directing drug trafficking activities with Venezuelan Vice President [[Tareck El Aissami]] while dividing drug profits with President Nicolás Maduro.

On 26 March 2020, the [[United States Department of Justice]] charged Maduro and other Venezuelan officials and some Colombian former FARC members, for what [[William Barr]] described as "narco-terrorism": the shipping of [[cocaine]] to the US to wage a health war on US citizens. According to Barr, Venezuelan leaders and the FARC faction organised an "air bridge" from a Venezuelan airbase transporting cocaine to Central America and a sea route to the Caribbean. The US government offered $15&nbsp;million for any information that would lead to his arrest. The indictment has been criticized as purely political – more cocaine is shipped from Colombia through Central America than Venezuela, but the US has more positive relationships with their leaders – and as serving to hinder Venezuela properly organizing their response to, and accessing aid to help during, the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Venezuela]]. In particular, Maduro had been offering to hold talks with the opposition about handling the outbreak in the country shortly before the indictment, and then called this off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/nicolas-maduro-us-indictment-venezuela-drug-trafficking-leaders|title=US indicts Nicolás Maduro and other top Venezuelan leaders for drug trafficking|date=26 March 2020|website=The Guardian|access-date=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="nyt2020">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/venezuela-president-drug-trafficking-nicolas-maduro.html|title=Venezuelan President Is Charged in the U.S. With Drug Trafficking|first1=Katie|last1=Benner|first2=William K.|last2=Rashbaum|first3=Benjamin|last3=Weiser|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="npr2020">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821933849/u-s-unseals-drug-trafficking-charges-against-venezuelas-president-maduro|title=U.S. Unseals Drug Trafficking Charges Against Venezuela's President Maduro|website=NPR.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52053799|title=US charges Venezuelan leader with 'narco-terrorism'|date=26 March 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=26 March 2020}}</ref>

In August 2017, [[Luisa Ortega Díaz]], Chief Prosecutor of Venezuela from 2007 until her sacking in August 2017, accused Maduro of profiting from the [[shortages in Venezuela]]. The government-operated [[Local Committees for Supply and Production]] (CLAP), which provides food to impoverished Venezuelans, made contracts with Group Grand Limited, a company that Ortega said was "presumably owned by Nicolás Maduro" through front-men Rodolfo Reyes, Álvaro Uguedo Vargas and Alex Saab. Group Grand Limited, a Mexican entity, was paid by the Venezuelan government for basic foods which it supplied to CLAP. Maduro accused Ortega of working with the United States to damage his government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/maduro-seria-dueno-empresa-mexicana-distribuidora-los-clap_200140|title=Maduro podría ser dueño de empresa méxicana distribuidora de los CLAP|date=23 August 2017|work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|access-date=24 August 2017|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article168977357.html|title=Venezuela's ex-prosecutor Luisa Ortega accuses Maduro of profiting from nation's hunger|last1=Wyss|first1=Jim|date=23 August 2017|work=[[Miami Herald]]|access-date=24 August 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/brazils-chief-prosecutor-institutional-rape-venezuela-49376967|title=Venezuela's ousted prosecutor accuses Maduro of corruption|last1=Prengaman|first1=Peter|date=23 August 2017|agency=Associated Press|access-date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824001526/https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/brazils-chief-prosecutor-institutional-rape-venezuela-49376967|archive-date=24 August 2017|url-status=dead|work=[[ABC News]]|language=en}}</ref>

An April 2019 communication from the [[United States Department of State]] highlighted a 2017 [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]] investigation finding that the government paid US$42 for food that cost under US$13, and that "Maduro's inner circle kept the difference, which totaled more than $200 million dollars in at least one case", adding that food boxes were "distributed in exchange for votes".<ref name=MaduroViola/> On 18 October 2018, Mexican prosecutors accused the Venezuelan government and Mexican individuals of buying poor-quality food products for CLAP and exporting them to Venezuela to double their value for sale.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-prosecutors-find-fraud-venezuela-food-aid-program-58597223|title=Mexico prosecutors find fraud in Venezuela food aid program|date=18 October 2018|work=[[ABC News]]|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021111557/https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-prosecutors-find-fraud-venezuela-food-aid-program-58597223|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Nicolás Maduro won the second presidential election after the death of Hugo Chávez, with 50.61% of the votes against the opposition's candidate [[Henrique Capriles Radonski]] who had 49.12% of the votes.
