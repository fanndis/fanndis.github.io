The '''Grammy Award''' (stylized as '''GRAMMY''', originally called '''Gramophone Award'''), or just '''Grammy''', is an award presented by [[the Recording Academy]] to recognize achievements in the [[music industry]]. The trophy depicts a [[gilded]] [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. The Grammys are the first and biggest award of the Big Three networks' major music awards held annually (between the [[American Music Award]]s in fall, and [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] in summer).

It is considered one of the [[EGOT|four major annual American entertainment awards]], along with the [[Academy Awards]] (film), the [[Emmy Award]]s (television), and the [[Tony Award]]s (theater and Broadway).

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor and respect the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, [[The Recording Academy|the Academy]] overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012.

The [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] were held on January 26, 2020, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].

==History==
The Grammys had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610020129/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|archive-date=June 10, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would not earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]]. After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the [[phonograph]], [[Thomas Edison]]. They eventually settled on using the name of the invention of [[Emile Berliner]], the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], for the awards, which were first given for the year 1958.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnRPAAAAIBAJ&pg=1440,1446700&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Record Academy Plans TV Spectacular of Its Own|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 8, 1959|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ca9NAAAAIBAJ&pg=7065,1739274&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Recording Stars Plan Eddie To Join Oscar And Emmy|date=August 9, 1957|newspaper=The Deseret News|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&pg=3612,4838071&dq=paul+weston+grammy&hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|publisher=The Robesonian|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first award ceremony]] was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959 - [[Beverly Hilton Hotel]] in Beverly Hills California, and [[Park Central Hotel|Park Sheraton Hotel]] in New York City,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-may-238.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 (May) |work=Grammy }}</ref> and 28 Grammys were awarded.

==Gramophone trophy==
The gold-plated trophies, each depicting a [[gilded]] [[Phonograph|gramophone]], are made and assembled by hand by Billings Artworks in [[Ridgway, Colorado]]. In 1990, the original Grammy design was revamped, changing the traditional soft lead for a stronger alloy less prone to damage, making the trophy bigger and grander.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/grammy_making.php |title=Making the Grammy |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year=2006 |access-date=August 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423143542/http://www.billingsartworks.com/grammy_making.php |archive-date=April 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Billings developed a [[zinc]] alloy named grammium, which is trademarked.<ref>{{cite journal|title=And the Grammy Comes From...|last=Williams|first=Nick|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 13, 2016|pages=56–57|volume=128|issue=4}}</ref> The trophies with the recipient's name engraved on them are not available until after the award announcements, so "stunt" trophies are re-used each year for the broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/about.php |title=About Billings Artworks |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year=2006 |access-date=August 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423143518/http://www.billingsartworks.com/about.php |archive-date=April 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Best|first1=Tamara|title=How the Grammy Awards Are Made: 4 Craftsmen and 'Grammium'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/arts/music/grammy-award-maker-john-billings.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref>

By February 2009, a total of 7,578 Grammy trophies had been awarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2787&newsCategoryID=1 |title=Neil Portnow's 50th Grammy's Telecast Remarks |publisher=grammy com |date=February 10, 2008 |access-date=August 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221031851/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2787&newsCategoryID=1 |archive-date=February 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Categories==
{{main|List of Grammy Award categories}}

The "General Field" are four awards which are not restricted by genre.

* [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] is awarded to the performer, songwriter(s), and the production team of a full album if other than the performer.
* [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] is awarded to the performer and the production team of a single song if other than the performer.
* [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] is awarded to the songwriter(s) of a single song.
* [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] is awarded to a promising breakthrough performer who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording that establishes the public identity of that artist (which is not necessarily their first proper release).

Of the three artists who won all four awards, two of them won all four at once: [[Christopher Cross]] in 1981, and [[Billie Eilish]] in 2020 making her the youngest artist to do so at the age of 18. [[Adele]] won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and the other three in 2012 and 2017.

Other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres, as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.

Because of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. The many other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast "Premiere Ceremony" earlier in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.

===2012 category restructuring===
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}

On April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY® CONTINUES EVOLUTION OF GRAMMY® AWARDS|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}</ref> The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.

In the [[Rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.

In [[R&B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&B album and other R&B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&B Album]] category.<ref>{{cite web |title=Explanation For Category Restructuring |url=https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring |website=GRAMMY.com |language=en |date=5 April 2011}}</ref>

In [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.

The most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |date=June 4, 2009 |access-date=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190520/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |archive-date=June 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="NYT090605">{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>

In the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.

In the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.

There were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word "gospel" in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore, the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process|title=The Academy Continues Evolution Of GRAMMY Awards Process|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}</ref>

===Since 2012===
Since 2012 there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has gone up from 78 in 2012 to 84 since 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/60th-grammy-awards-full-nominees-list|title=See The Full List Of 60th GRAMMY Nominees|date=2017-11-27|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}</ref>

In 2020, during the [[George Floyd protests]], several urban, rap, and Latin music categories were renamed.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2020/06/10/873805210/the-grammys-changed-some-categories-will-they-make-any-difference The Grammys Changed Some Categories. Will They Make Any Difference?]</ref>

==Entry process and selection of nominees==
Media companies registered with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and individual members of NARAS (artists and other professionals working in the industry who meet certain criteria) may enter recordings for consideration. Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, involving more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is entered in the correct category.

The resulting lists of eligible entries are circulated to Voting Members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.<ref name="VotingProcess">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.

Whereas members of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings. Instead, they receive access to a private online listening function.

==Final voting==
After nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].<ref name="VotingProcess" /> Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two or more nominees who tie are all considered winners). Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.

In both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries they may not vote in either round of voting.

The eligibility period for the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]] is September 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020.

==Certificates==
In many categories, certificates are awarded to those who are not eligible for a Grammy statuette but who did contribute to the winning recording. These certificates are known as Participation Certificate or Winners Certificate. Those who are eligible for a certificate can apply for one in the weeks following the annual Grammy ceremony.

==Grammy Legend==
{{main|Grammy Legend Award}}

A special Grammy Award of merit is awarded intermittently to recognize "ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field".<ref name="Grammy Legend Award">{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |title=Grammy Legend Award |publisher=Grammy.com |access-date=December 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207040854/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |archive-date=December 7, 2010 |df= }}</ref>  It has been called the '''Grammy Legend Award''' and the '''Grammy Living Legend Award''' at different ceremonies.  {{As of|2018|post=,}} only fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.

==Venue==
{{main|List of Grammy Award ceremony locations}}

[[Image:Staples Center - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200px|right|upright|alt=|The [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]] has served as the venue for the Grammy Awards since 2000]]

Prior to 1971 the Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day. Originally [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] were the host cities. [[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.

The 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles’ [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.

In 2000, the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[Grammy Museum at L.A. Live|The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year. Since 2000, the Grammy Awards have only take place outside of Los Angeles twice, with [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]] hosting the awards in [[45th Annual Grammy Awards|2003]] and in [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|2018]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/new-york-city-host-2018-grammys|title=When are the 2018 GRAMMYs?|date=9 May 2017|website=Grammy.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>

The annual awards ceremony at the Staples Center forces sports teams such as [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Los Angeles Sparks]] to play an extended length of road games.

==Criticism==
The Grammy Awards has received criticism from prominent recording artists and music journalists.

===Commercialism===
When [[Pearl Jam]] won a Grammy in the category ''[[Best Hard Rock Performance]]'' in 1996, the band's lead singer [[Eddie Vedder]] commented on stage: "I don't know what this means. I don't think it means anything."<ref>Travers, Peter. [https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/videos/grammy-the-movies-20080208 "Grammy & The Movies"]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. February 8, 2008.</ref> [[Glen Hansard]], leader of the Irish rock group [[The Frames]], stated in 2008 that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music "that's fully industry based". He said he wasn't that interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/columnists/contenderqa/env-en-songs6feb06,0,4879961.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Todd |last=Martens |title=Glen Hansard, Eddie Vedder crash Grammy Awards |date=February 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221000127/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/columnists/contenderqa/env-en-songs6feb06%2C0%2C4879961.story |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Maynard James Keenan]], lead singer of [[progressive rock]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of their awards.

{{quote|I think the Grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry. They cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses. They don't honor the arts or the artist for what he created. It's the music business celebrating itself. That's basically what it's all about.}}

===Artist Snubs===
The Grammys have been constantly criticized for snubbing awards and nominations from certain artists. At the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards]], artist [[Mariah Carey]] was nominated for six awards for her album ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for her single "[[One Sweet Day]]". While critics believed Carey would be "cleaning up" that year, Carey ultimately lost all her nominations that night much to the shock of critics and Carey herself. <ref>{{Citation

He described West's album as "the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record".<ref name="Roberts">{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Randall|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/11/critics-notebook-your-grannys-awards.html|title=Critic's Notebook: Grammy Awards?

{{quote|The major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all-inclusive, but more significantly, they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population...

In an article for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]] also responded to the snub and expressed his general displeasure with the awards, stating "I don't pretend to understand the Grammys. I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues. I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars, but not the big awards for music. My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when, to the shock of many, Kanye's masterpiece ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year."<ref name="Touré"/> He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to [[Kremlinology]] and commented on The Recording Academy's exclusion of more "mature" hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees, noting that it occasionally opts to nominate "pop-friendly" hip hop albums instead.<ref name="Touré">{{cite news |author=Touré |authorlink=Touré (journalist) |url=http://ideas.time.com/2011/12/02/grammys-fallout-the-subtle-snubbing-of-kanye/ |title=Touré: Why The Grammys Snubbed Kanye West's Twisted Fantasy |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref>

In a 2011 profile for ''[[The New York Times]]'' following the [[53rd Grammy Awards]], frontman [[Justin Vernon]] of indie band [[Bon Iver]] was asked his opinion of the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group, to which he responded:<ref name="Caramanica">{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/the-bon-iver-grammy-quandary/ |title=The Bon Iver Grammy Quandary |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=The 6th Floor |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref>

{{quote|You know I was thinking about that a couple of months ago, someone asked me that, and I was like "I would go and I would" – and I don't think the Bon Iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a Grammy – "I would get up there and be like, 'This is for my parents, because they supported me,' because I know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there. But I kinda felt like going up there and being like: "Everyone should go home, this is ridiculous. You should not be doing this. We should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important." That's what I would say.}}

He reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the Grammys, saying:<ref name="Caramanica"/>

{{quote|[Ninety-eight]<!-- Changed from "98" because numbers that begin a sentence are spelled out, per [[WP:NUMERAL]]. --> percent of the people in that room, their art is compromised by the fact that they're thinking that, and that they're hoping to get that award.

Like, I have a friend who's a voter who was like, "I had to be a voter because I don't trust the other voters." And I was like, "Me either!" And it's just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it.}}

Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards.<ref name="Caramanica"/> After winning the award, Vernon said in his acceptance, "It's really hard to accept this award. There's so much talent out here [...] and there's a lot of talent that's not here tonight. It's also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable up here."<ref name="Lee">{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Amy |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/bon-iver-grammys_n_1272975.html |title=Grammys 2012: Bon Iver Wins Best New Artist, Feels Conflicted About It |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref>

In his article "Everything Is Praised Again", Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' criticized Grammy voters for being "conservative" and disregarding more "forward-looking" music, and wrote in response to the 54th Grammy Awards, "for the umpteenth time, the Grammys went with familiarity over risk, bestowing album of the year honors (and several more) on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change."<ref name="Caramanica2"/> He cited the Grammy successes of [[Lauryn Hill]]'s ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'' (1998), [[Norah Jones]]' ''[[Come Away with Me]]'' (2003), and [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011) as examples of "the Grammys dropp[ing] a boatload of awards on a young female singer-songwriter and her breakthrough album". Of Kanye West's absence from the ceremony, Caramanica stated, "He didn't even bother to show up for the broadcast, which was well enough, because hip-hop was almost completely marginalized."<ref name="Caramanica2">{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/arts/music/at-the-54th-grammy-awards-everything-old-is-praised-again.html |title=At the 54th Grammy Awards, Everything Old Is Praised Again |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref>

In an article for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', music executive and author [[Steve Stoute]] criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having "lost touch with contemporary popular culture" and noted "two key sources" for it: "(1) over-zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and (2) fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic."<ref name="Stoute">{{cite news |last=Stoute |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Stoute |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-stoute/steve-stoute-grammys_b_825377.html |title=Steve Stoute: An Open Letter to Neil Portnow, NARAS and the Grammy Awards |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref> Stoute accused them of snubbing artists with more cultural impact, citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in [[Eminem]]'s ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000) and Kanye West's ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' (2007) in the Album of the Year category, and stated:<ref name="Stoute" />

{{quote|As an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians, singers, songwriters, producers and technical specialists, we have come to expect that the Grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture. Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.}}

In 2020, Canadian artist Abel Tesfaye, known by his stage name as [[The Weeknd]] was completely shut out from the Grammys when his fourth studio album, ''[[After Hours (The Weeknd album)|After Hours]]'', received zero nominations at The [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]]. This comes to a complete shock to critics, fans, and Tesfaye himself, who's had a successful run in 2020 with the success of both his album and the single "[[Blinding Lights]]". Tesfaye responded via social media calling the Grammys "corrupt". <ref >{{cite news |last=Aniftos |first=Rania |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/9489770/the-weeknd-lashes-out-recording-academy |title=The Weeknd Calls Out Recording Academy After Nominations Snub: 'The Grammys Remain Corrupt' |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 24, 2020 |accessdate=November 26, 2020}}</ref> Speculation arose that the recent announcement of his upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Weeknd Received Zero Grammy Nominations, Responds on Twitter |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/the-weeknd-snub-2021-grammy-nominations.html |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> [[Harvey Mason Jr.]] responded by saying:<blockquote>We understand that The Weeknd is disappointed at not being nominated. I was surprised and can empathize with what he’s feeling. His music this year was excellent, and his contributions to the music community and broader world are worthy of everyone’s admiration. We were thrilled when we found out he would be performing at the upcoming Super Bowl and we would have loved to have him also perform on the Grammy stage the weekend before. Unfortunately, every year, there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists. But as the only peer-voted music award, we will continue to recognize and celebrate excellence in music while shining a light on the many amazing artists that make up our global community. To be clear, voting in all categories ended well before The Weeknd’s performance at the Super Bowl was announced, so in no way could it have affected the nomination process.  All Grammy nominees are recognized by the voting body for their excellence, and we congratulate them all.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Weeknd Lashes Out at Recording Academy: "The Grammys Remain Corrupt" |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-weeknd-lashes-out-at-recording-academy-the-grammys-remain-corrupt?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter |access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

The Grammys' eligibility period – which runs from October 1 to September 30 each year<ref>{{Cite web|title = FAQs|url = https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/voting-process/faqs#two |website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref> – is also a perennial source of complaints and confusion. Because records that are released in the last quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards (the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time), fans often think a favorite artist has been snubbed (e.g., Adele, whose ''25'' was released in November 2015 and so was not nominated that year despite massive sales<ref>{{Cite web|title = Here's Why Adele Wasn't Nominated for Any Grammys This Year |url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adele-grammys-snub-why-wasnt-846425|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = |date = 7 December 2015|first = Erin|last = Strecker}}</ref>). Conversely, the same issue means that the Grammys often recognize work that no longer feels current by the time it wins. [[Taylor Swift]]'s ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', for example, won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album was released in October 2014. The same was the case with [[Adele]]’s ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]''. It was released in November 2015 but received the award in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Truth Behind This Year's Maddening Grammy Nominations|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/brianmcmanus/the-truth-behind-this-years-maddening-grammy-nominations#.qyONGwObxO |website = BuzzFeed|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>

===Accusations of racial bias===
{{Main|Accusations of racial bias in Grammy Awards}}
The Grammys have also been accused of being unfavorable and [[Racism in Grammy Awards|racist]] to [[African American|black]] recording artists. Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] accused the awards in a 2017 interview of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist due to his previous work and heritage. He criticized the snubbing of "[[One Dance]]" for the prestigious award of Record of the Year and the nomination of "[[Hotline Bling]]" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] despite it not being a rap song.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/drake-meets-semtex-for-more-talk|title=Drake Meets Semtex For More Talk|newspaper=A Nation of Billions|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of "sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Adele, Beyoncé, and the Grammys' Fear of Progress |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/adele-beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-progress-25-lemonade/516426/ |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date=February 13, 2017 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> Drake did not attend the 2017 Awards Ceremony where he was nominated.

The Grammys were also criticized after the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]] when [[Adele]]'s ''25'' won Album of the Year over [[Beyoncé]]'s album ''[[Lemonade (Beyonce album)|Lemonade]]'', which many music publications felt should have won the award. Steve Knopper of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine believed that she lost due to the Grammy voters being all white males and as well as for her pro-Black performance during the [[Super Bowl 50 halftime show]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-2017-5-reasons-why-adele-won-album-of-the-year-instead-of-beyonce-118375/|title= Grammys 2017: 5 Reasons Why Adele Won Album of the Year Instead of Beyonce
|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' also criticized Beyoncé's loss stating that "black artists have struggled to win album of the year". They also felt ''25'' won only due to the album's record-breaking sales rather than having a cultural significance and a large impact that ''Lemonade'' had in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2017/02/13/why-beyonce-lemonade-lost-the-grammys-why-she-should-have-won/97847070/|title=Why Beyoncé's 'Lemonade' lost the Grammys - and why she should have won|work=USA Today|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> Adele also expressed that ''Lemonade'' should have won over her for Album of the Year, stating in her acceptance speech:

===Issues with female artists===
The Grammys have also received criticism for their treatment of female artists. Notably at the [[60th Grammy Awards]], New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] made media headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She rumored that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to [[Tom Petty]] but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Award and stated that each of the male nominees were allowed solo performances. Lorde's mother also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article which stated that only nine percent of nominees at the previous six Grammy Awards were women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-lorde-turned-grammy-performance-2230515|title=Here's why Lorde turned down a Grammy performance - NME|date=January 28, 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Following the 60th ceremony, many media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist [[SZA (singer)|SZA]] who did not win in any of her five nominated categories and to the [[Best Pop Solo Performance]] category which was composed of four female nominees but won by [[Ed Sheeran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/grammys-essay-women-artists-2018|title=How the 2018 Grammys failed women artists|publisher=}}</ref> In an interview, [[Neil Portnow]], President of the Recording Academy attracted controversy by stating that female artists need to "step up" in order to win awards. Portnow's comments drew criticism from many female musicians including [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Vanessa Carlton]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] and [[Charli XCX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up|title=Pink, Sheryl Crow and more slam Grammys boss for telling women to 'step up'|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|date=January 30, 2018|website=the Guardian}}</ref> They also prompted the hashtag #GrammysSoMale on social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5122993/grammys-so-male-reactions/|title=The Internet Is Calling Out the Grammys With #GrammysSoMale|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}</ref> 

Before the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]] singer [[Ariana Grande]] decided to not perform and attend that years ceremony over a disagreement about the song choices for her performance. An anonymous source told ''Variety'' that Grande felt "insulted" when producers refused to allow the singer perform her latest single "[[7 Rings]]".  They compromised by having her perform the song as part of a medley, but the condition that the producers choose the second song caused Grande to pull out of the show. The source said the same stipulations were not imposed on the other performers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/ariana-grande-not-attending-grammys-after-disagreements-with-producers-1203129734/|title=Ariana Grande Not Attending Grammys After Disagreements With Producers|first=Jem|last=Aswad|date=February 5, 2019|website=Variety}}</ref> A few days later, Grande accused Grammy producer [[Ken Ehrlich]] for lying about why she dropped out of the show. Ehrlich had said that Grande "felt it was too late for her to pull something together". Grande responded:
{{Block quote|I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken, it was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.

Despite the controversy, Grande ended up winning [[Best Pop Vocal Album]] and in 2020 performed at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] when she was nominated for five awards, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] but won none.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/ariana-grande-perform-2020-grammy-awards-jan-26|title= Ariana Grande To Perform At 2020 GRAMMY Awards On Jan. 26|work=CBS News|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref>

===2020 controversy===
Recording Academy CEO [[Deborah Dugan]] was placed on leave, after a complaint of bullying from a member of staff (according to an anonymous ''New York Times'' source), on January 16, 2020, ten days before the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name="LaT">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-01-16/grammys-deborah-dugan-recording-academy-fired|title= Ousted Grammys chief: 'We will expose what happens when you "step up" at the Recording Academy'|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>  Dugan had lodged a complaint internally alleging a broken system of voting that was subject to conflicts of interest, and spending that was unnecessary.<ref name="LaT" />    On the nominations for the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Dugan stated that the voting process was an "outrageous conflict of interest" with several nominated artists sitting on the voting boards of their prospective categories. She claimed that "one artist who initially ranked 18 out of 20 in the 2019 'Song of the Year' category ended up with a nomination". She also claimed that a few artists like [[Ed Sheeran]] and [[Ariana Grande]] had the votes to be nominated for the category, but were ultimately omitted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/deborah-dugan-speaks-filing-lawsuit-recording-academy-68460397|title= Deborah Dugan speaks out after filing lawsuit against Recording Academy with Grammy allegations|work=Good Morning America|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

==TV broadcasts and ratings==
Prior to the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called ''The Best on Record'' were broadcast on [[NBC]]. The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/atgrammysbehinds0000ehrl }}</ref> [[CBS]] bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by the late [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.

The Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011, that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract, the network would also air a "nominations concert" special in the last week of November where the nominees are released during the special that is exclusive to CBS, rather than the traditional early-morning press conference with a release of the nominations seen with most major awards ceremonies which any network takes as part of a [[press pool]]. This was pulled off after the 2016 concert due to low ratings and criticism about the announcement format, and as of the 2017 nominations, they are revealed during a roundtable conversation about the nominations with Recording Academy representatives during ''[[CBS This Morning]]''. In [[58th Grammy Awards|2016]], the Grammys became the first awards show to be broadcast live in all U.S. territories, and for decades, alongside the [[Academy Awards]], [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and [[Tony Awards]], have aired live in more than 150 countries worldwide.

From 2004 to 2019, the Grammys were held on the second Sunday of February (the week after the [[Super Bowl]]), with two exceptions: if that day was February 14 ([[Valentine's Day]]), it was moved to the following day; if it was a [[Winter Olympics]] year, it was held earlier on the last Sunday of January (the week before the [[Super Bowl]]). Starting in 2020, the [[Academy Award]]s ceremony will move back to the second Sunday of February, forcing the Grammys to move back to the last Sunday of January to avoid a conflict with either the Oscars or the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.showbiz411.com/2018/08/08/oscars-vs-grammys-academy-awards-takes-traditional-grammy-award-date-for-2020|title=Grammy Awards Furious Oscars Ambushed Them on Traditional Date: "It was a very disrespectful move on their part"|date=August 8, 2018|publisher=Showbiz411}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/grammy-awards-air-dates-2020-2021-cbs-1202487764/|title=Grammy Awards Sets Dates For 2020 & 2021|date=October 23, 2018|magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> To allow sufficient time for preparation, the cutoff date for eligible recordings will move from September 30 to August 31.

When the televised Grammys came into renown in 1975, a relationship between Grammy Award winners and subsequent [[record sales]] began.<ref name=Watson>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Mary|title=Award Ceremony as an Arbiter of Commerce and Canon in the Popular Music Industry|journal=Popular Music|date=2006|volume=1|issue=25|pages=41–56|doi=10.1017/S0261143005000747}}<!--|accessdate=July 19, 2015--></ref> Many articles of ''Billboard'' magazine communicate the commercial impact of winning a Grammy—improved record sales.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hampp|first1=Andrew|title=Grammys Bump More Than Sales|journal=Billboard Magazine|date=2013|page=27}}</ref>

However, it was not until after 1984 that Grammy recipients' records displayed a substantial increase in sales. This was largely due to an agreement made by NARAS and the National Association of Record Merchandisers (NARM). Under this agreement "record labels provided stickers, posters and other point-of-purchase material emblazoned 'Grammy Nominee' or 'Grammy Award Winner' that retailers could use in order to improve marketing effects."<ref name=Watson />
