'''Alma mater''' ({{Lang-la|[[Wikt:almus#Latin|alma]] [[Wikt:mater#Latin|mater]]|translation=nourishing mother|link=no}}; pl. [rarely used] {{Lang|la|almae matres}}) is an [[allegory|allegorical]] Latin phrase for a [[university]], school, or [[college]] that one formerly attended.<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/alma_mater?filter=dictionary&query=Alma "alma"], oxforddictionaries.com.

Before its current usage, ''alma mater'' was an [[epithet|honorific title]] for various Latin [[mother goddess]]es, especially [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] or [[Cybele]],<ref name=OED>''Shorter [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition</ref> and later in Catholicism for the [[Virgin Mary]]. It entered academic usage when the [[University of Bologna]] adopted the motto ''Alma Mater Studiorum'' ("nurturing mother of studies"), which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unibo.it/en/university/who-we-are/our-history/our-history|title=Our history  – University of Bologna|website=Unibo.it|access-date=8 November 2017}}</ref> It is related to ''[[alumnus]]'', a term used for a university graduate that literally means a "nursling" or "one who is nourished".<ref>{{cite book |last=Cresswell |first=Julia |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4i3zV4vnBAC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12 |access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:Legate John, Alma Mater Cantabrigia Emblem 1600 (Golden Chaine print).jpg|thumb|upright|John Legate's Alma Mater for Cambridge in 1600]]
Although ''alma'' (nourishing) was a common epithet for [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Cybele]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and other mother goddesses, it was not frequently used in conjunction with ''mater'' in classical Latin.<ref name="Sollors">{{cite book |last=Sollors |first=Werner |author-link=Werner Sollors |title=Beyond Ethnicity: Consent and Descent in American Culture |url=https://archive.org/details/beyondethnicityc00soll |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |isbn= 9780198020721 |page=[https://archive.org/details/beyondethnicityc00soll/page/78 78]}}</ref> In the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'', the phrase is attributed to Lucretius' ''[[De rerum natura]]'', where it is used as an epithet to describe an earth goddess:
<poem lang="la" style="margin-left:1em; float:left;">Denique caelesti sumus omnes semine oriundi
omnibus ille idem pater est, unde alma liquentis
umoris guttas mater cum terra recepit (2.991–93)</poem>
<poem style="margin-left:1em; float:left;">We are all sprung from that celestial seed,
all of us have same father, from whom earth,
the nourishing mother, receives drops of liquid moisture</poem>{{Clear|left}}

After the [[fall of Rome]], the term came into Christian liturgical usage in association with the [[Virgin Mary]]. "[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]" is a well-known 11th century [[antiphon]] devoted to Mary.<ref name="Sollors" />

The earliest documented use of the term to refer to a university in an English-speaking country is in 1600, when the [[University of Cambridge]] printer, John Legate, began using an emblem for the [[Cambridge University Press|university's press]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes |first=Henry Paine |title=Cambridge stationers, printers, bookbinders, &c. |year=1919 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Bowes & Bowes |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cambridgestation00stokrich#page/12/mode/2up |access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=S.

==Special usage==
Many historic European universities have adopted ''Alma Mater'' as part of the Latin translation of their official name. The [[University of Bologna]] Latin name, {{Lang|la|Alma Mater Studiorum}} (nourishing mother of studies), refers to its status as the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest continuously operating university in the world]]. Other European universities, such as the [[Leipzig University|Alma Mater Lipsiensis]] in Leipzig, Germany, or [[Jagiellonian University|Alma Mater Jagiellonica]], Poland, have similarly used the expression in conjunction with geographical or foundational characteristics. At least one, the [[Alma Mater Europaea]] in [[Salzburg]], Austria, an international university founded by the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 2010, uses the term as its official name.

In the United States, the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], has been called the "Alma Mater of the Nation" because of its ties to the country's founding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|title=William & Mary – History & Traditions|publisher=wm.edu}}</ref> At [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], and the [[University of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, British Columbia, the main student government is known as the Alma Mater Society.

==Monuments==
[[File:Alma Mater Restored 2014.jpg|thumb|right|''Alma Mater'' (1929, Lorado Taft), [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]]]
The ancient Roman world had many statues of the Alma Mater, some still extant (e.g., at the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome).

Modern sculptures are found in prominent locations on several American university campuses. For example, there is a bronze statue of ''[[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' by [[Daniel Chester French]] situated on the steps of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Low Library]]; the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] also has an ''[[Alma Mater (Illinois sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' statue by [[Lorado Taft]]. An altarpiece mural in Yale University's [[Sterling Memorial Library]], painted in 1932 by [[Eugene Savage]], depicts the ''Alma Mater'' as a bearer of light and truth, standing in the midst of the personified arts and sciences.

There is an ''Alma Mater'' sculpture on the steps of the monumental entrance to the [[Universidad de La Habana]], in Havana, Cuba. The statue was cast in 1919 by [[Mario Korbel]], with Feliciana Villalón Wilson as the inspiration for ''Alma Mater'', and it was installed in its current location in 1927, at the direction of architect Raul Otero.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cremata Ferrán|first1=Mario|title=Dos rostros, dos estatuas habaneras|url=http://www.opushabana.cu/index.php/articulos/36-articulos-casa-de-papel/4031-mario-cremata-ferran|website=Opus Habana|access-date=21 January 2015}}</ref>
