==Changes==
The Television Academy announced a few minor changes in the rules of some categories and the addition of a new category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rules Changes for 2019 Emmys|url=https://www.emmys.com/news/awards-news/rules-changes-2019-emmys|website=emmys.com|accessdate=16 July 2019|date=13 December 2018}}</ref>

* The addition of a new category, Outstanding Music Composition for a Documentary Series or Special (Original Dramatic Underscore) recognizing the unique creative process and evaluation criteria for documentary scoring, versus scoring for scripted series or specials.
* The category [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography|Outstanding Choreography]] has been restructured and divided in two, Outstanding Choreography for Variety and Reality Programming (for Variety Series, Variety Special, Structured Reality, Unstructured Reality and Competition Program) and Outstanding Choreography for Scripted Programming (for Comedy Series, Drama Series, Limited Series and Television Movie), both being juried awards.
