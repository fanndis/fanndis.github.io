'''Rita Rudner''' (born September 17, 1953) is an American comedian. Beginning her career as a Broadway dancer, Rita Rudner noticed the lack of female comedians in [[New York City]] and turned to stand-up comedy where she has flourished for over three decades. Her performance on a variety of [[HBO]] specials and numerous appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', helped establish Rudner as one of the premier comics to emerge from the comedy boom of the 1980s.

==Early life==

She spent many hours researching her favorite comedians, including [[Woody Allen]] and [[Jack Benny]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} She enjoys [[Jewish humour|Jewish humor]], but reserves her Jewish jokes for Jewish audiences.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
