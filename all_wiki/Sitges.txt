'''Sitges''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈsidʒəs}}) is a town about 35 kilometres southwest of [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]], renowned worldwide for its [[Sitges Film Festival|Film Festival]] and [[Carnival]]. Located between the [[Garraf Massif]] and the sea, it is known for its beaches, nightspots, and historical sites.

While the roots of Sitges' artistic reputation date back to the late 19th century, when painter [[Santiago Rusiñol]] took up residence there during the summer, the town became a centre for the 1960s [[counterculture]] in mainland Spain, in [[Francoist State|Francoist Spain]], and became known as "[[Ibiza]] in miniature".

Today, Sitges' economy is based on tourism and culture offering more than 4,500 hotel beds, half of them in four-star hotels.

Almost 35% of the approximately 26,000 permanent inhabitants are from the Netherlands, the UK, France and Scandinavia, whose children attend international schools in the area. There are 17 beaches. Sitges was also the site of the annual [[Bilderberg Group|Bilderberg conference]] held in June 2010.

Sitges has been referred to as the [[Saint-Tropez]] of Spain,<ref name="Sitges as San Tropez">{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Mark|title=Sitges is Hot Property|url=http://blog.lucasfox.com/sitges/sitges-hot-property/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330151143/http://blog.lucasfox.com/sitges/sitges-hot-property/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-03-30|work=blog.lucasfox.com|publisher=lucasfox.com|accessdate=9 August 2011|date=August 2011}}</ref> with property prices approaching those of the most expensive [[Europe]]an cities, the main reason for this being the  setting by the sea and the surrounding ''[[Parc Natural del Garraf]]''. Proximity to [[Barcelona International Airport|Barcelona-El Prat Airport]] is also a major advantage.

==History==
Human presence in the area dates to at least the [[Neolithic]] era, and an [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] settlement from the 4th century. In the 1st century BC it included two separated villages, later absorbed by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], a castle was built in Sitges, owned by the [[bishopric of Barcelona]], which later ceded it to count [[Mir Geribert]] (1041). In the 12th century the town fell under the rule of the Sitges family. The latter held it until 1308, when Agnes of Sitges sold the town to [[Bernat de Fonollar]], after whose death it went to the Pia Almoina, a charitable institution, to which it belonged until 1814.

Sitges' economy was mostly based on the production of wine until the economic boom of the 1960s, after which it became a tourist resort.

In 1958, the Liberals (see [[Liberalism in Colombia]] ) and Conservatives (see [[Conservatism in Colombia]]) both met in the city of Sitges and the nearby city of [[Benidorm]] to sign a peace treaty instituting Colombia's [[Consociationalism|Consociationalist]] democracy in agreement called the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Declaration-of-Sitges|title=Declaration of Sitges {{!}} Colombian history|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>

==Carnival==
For over a century, Sitges has celebrated Carnestoltes, or [[Carnival]], between the months of February and March, according to the liturgical calendar.
The festivities begin on Dijous Gras, or Fat Thursday, with King Carnestoltes’ arrival. They continue until the burial of the sardine — late afternoon on [[Ash Wednesday]].

[[Folk dances]] and xatonades (traditional local salad served with assorted omelets) are also characteristic carnival elements. The two most important moments are the Rua de la Disbauxa, or the Debauchery Parade, on Sunday night and the Rua de l'Extermini, or Extermination Parade, on Tuesday night. Around forty floats with more than 2,000 participants fill Sitges. It is one of people favorites times of year because of this celebration. Many people come from all around to see it.

==Gastronomy==
''[[Xató]]'' is Sitges' most typical dish. Its first recorded mention is in local newspaper ''Eco de Sitges'' report on [[Maundy Thursday]], published on 16 February 1896. The report refers to a meal that three days before had gathered together a selected group of Catalan artists and intellectuals, including [[Santiago Rusiñol]], [[Miquel Utrillo]] and [[Gaietà Buigas]]. The name "xató" comes from an expression pronounced years before by [[Canudas]], a member of the Rusiñol's group.

The main ingredients of xató are [[endive]] salad, cod, tuna, anchovies, aubergine and black olives. However, the essence of the dish is its sauce, made with scalded chillies, toasted almonds, garlic, olive oil, salt, vinegar and hot peppers. The complete xató meal consists of some different omelettes or fricandó (a typical Catalan hot meal) and as a dessert, coca de lardons (typical Catalan cake, made from pork scratchings), served with a bottle of [[Penedès]] [[black wine]].

Sitges cuisine includes many Catalan sailors' dishes such as rice Sitges style, stewed sepia with potatoes and [[aioli|allioli]] (Catalan garlic sauce), bull de tonyina (made with tuna fish), fideuada (similar to paella, but with noodles and seafood) or stuffed peppers with cod.

[[Malvasia]] is a delicate liquor wine served in Sitges, primarily with dessert. The name "malvasia" comes from the Peloponnesian port [[Monemvasía]]. In Sitges, the Hospital Sant Joan Baptista continues producing and marketing malvasia according to the traditional method from its own vines and within its own cellars. The proceeds go to charity. The annual production is approximately 4,000 bottles.

==Motor racing==
Sitges is part of the long history of motor racing in [[Catalonia]]. From 1908–1920 events were staged over public roads from Sitges to [[Lloret de Mar|Canyelles]] to [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]], and from [[Mataro]] to [[Vilassar de Mar]] and [[Argentona]]. In 1922 and 1923 the [[Real Moto Club de Catalunya]] ran the [[Spanish Grand Prix|Penya Rhin Grand Prix]] over a 9-mile circuit around the town of [[Vilafranca del Penedès]] until it was replaced by a short lived purpose built circuit, the banked [[Sitges Terramar|Autodromo Sitges Terramar]], which is still visible at {{Coord|41|14|18.35|N|1|46|50.20|E|region:ES_type:landmark}}. [[Albert Divo]] won the only [[Spanish Grand Prix]] held at the banked 'Sitges Terramar' driving a [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]].
