"'''Bad Blood'''" is a song by recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fifth studio album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). Swift wrote the song with its producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. The album version is a [[pop music|pop]] song with stomping drums talking about betrayal by a close friend. Upon the release of ''1989'', media outlets speculated that the song was about [[Katy Perry]], with whom Swift was involved in a [[:wikt:feud|feud]] that received widespread media coverage. Critics received "Bad Blood" with mixed reviews—some criticized the repetitive lyrics and generic production, while others considered the song one of the album's highlights.

A remix version of "Bad Blood" featuring American rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]] was released as the fourth [[single (music)|single]] from ''1989'' on May 17, 2015, by [[Big Machine Records|Big Machine]] and [[Republic Records]]. The remix version received praise for Lamar's verses and the reworked instrumentation, but some critics considered Lamar—known for his aggressive flow—out of place on a pop song. "Bad Blood" was supported by a high-budget music video, which was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and produced by Swift. The video features an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of singers and fashion models whom the media called Swift's "squad", and received media coverage for its futuristic production inspired by [[neo-noir]] styles. It won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]], and two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Collaboration|Best Collaboration]].

"Bad Blood" was a chart success, reaching number one on [[record charts]] in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Scotland. In the United States, the single peaked atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and two ''Billboard'' airplay charts, [[Adult Top 40]] and [[Mainstream Top 40]]. It received [[List of music recording certifications|multi-platinum certifications]] in Australia, Canada, and the United States. The song received a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]]. Retrospectively, critics have panned "Bad Blood" as one of the weakest songs in Swift's catalog, feeling that it fails to showcase Swift's ability as a songwriter.

==Background and release==
[[Taylor Swift]]'s fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', was inspired by 1980s [[synth-pop]]. The album's electronic production using [[synthesizer]]s, programmed [[drum machine|drums]], and processed backing vocals marked a departure from the [[country music|country]] styles of her previous releases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-reveals-five-things-to-expect-on-1989-65750/ |title=Taylor Swift Reveals Five Things to Expect on '1989'| first=Josh|last=Eells| work=[[Rolling Stone]]| date=September 16, 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116173655/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-reveals-five-things-to-expect-on-1989-65750/ | archivedate=November 16, 2018| accessdate=November 16, 2018}}</ref><ref name="medium"/><ref name="bb">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/women-in-music-2014/6363514/billboard-woman-of-the-year-taylor-swift-on-writing-her|title=Billboard Woman of the Year Taylor Swift on Writing Her Own Rules, Not Becoming a Cliche and the Hurdle of Going Pop|first=Alan|last=Light|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 5, 2014|access-date=February 27, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226012450/https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/women-in-music-2014/6363514/billboard-woman-of-the-year-taylor-swift-on-writing-her|archive-date=December 26, 2014}}</ref> On ''1989'', Swift and Swedish producer [[Max Martin]] served as [[executive producer]]s.<ref name="medium">{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/the-oral-history-of-taylor-swift-s-1989-d9869cc13adc?sf22314340=1#.cd4wstjmz|title=The Oral History of Taylor Swift's '1989'|first=Paul|last=Zollo|work=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|date=February 13, 2016|accessdate=March 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404113417/https://medium.com/cuepoint/the-oral-history-of-taylor-swift-s-1989-d9869cc13adc?sf22314340=1#.cd4wstjmz|archive-date=April 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Martin and his frequent collaborator [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]] produced seven out of thirteen songs on the album's standard edition, including "Bad Blood".<ref name="notes"/> The album was released in October 2014 to commercial success, selling over one million copies within a week.<ref name="bb"/>

Retrospectively, critics have considered "Bad Blood" one of Swift's weakest songs in her repertoire. [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed the song at the bottom of his 2019 ranking of Swift's whole catalog, describing it as "melodically parched, lyrically unfinished, rhythmically clunky".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Rob |title=All 153 of Taylor Swift's Songs, Ranked |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/taylor-swift-songs-ranked-rob-sheffield-201800/bad-blood-2014-196114/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=May 2, 2020 |date=December 12, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''{{'s}} Jane Song wrote that they wished "the song hadn't been released as a single, even with Kendrick's verse".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/taylor-swift/best-taylor-swift-songs/#158-bad-blood-1989|title=All 158 Taylor Swift Songs, Ranked|first=Jane|last=Song|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=2020-02-11|accessdate=2020-11-19}}</ref> In a 2020 ranking of Swift's songs, ''New York'' writer Nate Jones similarly deemed the song among Swift's worst, writing, "The lyric here indulges the worst habits of late-period Swift&nbsp;– an eagerness to play the victim, a slight lack of resemblance to anything approaching real life&nbsp;– attached to a schoolyard-chant melody that will never leave your head, even when you may want it to." Jones also disliked the remix version for "[hollowing] out the production".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Nate |title=All 145 Taylor Swift Songs, Ranked From Worst to Best |url=https://www.vulture.com/article/all-taylor-swift-songs-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=May 2, 2020 |date=February 4, 2020 |archive-date=September 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913234630/https://www.vulture.com/article/all-taylor-swift-songs-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Set in a fictional [[London]], The music video starts with Catastrophe (Swift) and her partner, Arsyn (Gomez), fighting off a group of men in a corporate office for a mysterious briefcase. When all of the men are defeated, Arsyn double crosses Catastrophe by stealing the briefcase in her hand and kicking her out of a window. The song begins with Catastrophe lying on a broken car, as Welvin da Great begins his rap verse and Lucky Fiori smokes a cigar. Catastrophe is shown being nursed back to health by a trio of girls called The Trinity, and after some time, she is ready to start training for her revenge. When her training is complete, Catastrophe and her friends strike out to exact their revenge on Arsyn and her masked henchwomen. The two teams approach each other in what seems to be slow motion while an enormous explosion goes off in the background, blotting out the London skyline, and the video ends with Catastrophe and Arsyn simultaneously striking each other in the face.<ref name="4music">{{citation|title=This Week's Fresh Music Top 20|publisher=[[4Music]]|date=June 21, 2015}}</ref>
