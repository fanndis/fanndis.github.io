There is currently a strong [[scientific consensus]] that the [[Global warming|Earth is warming]] and that this warming is mainly caused by human activities. This consensus is supported by various studies of [[Opinion#Scientific opinion|scientists' opinions]] and by position statements of scientific organizations, many of which explicitly agree with the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) synthesis reports.

==Consensus points==
The current scientific consensus is that:
* Earth's climate has warmed significantly since the late 1800s.{{efn|Changes in global temperature are usually expressed in terms of ''temperature anomalies''. "In climate change studies, temperature anomalies are more important than absolute temperature. A temperature anomaly is the difference from an average, or baseline, temperature. The baseline temperature is typically computed by averaging 30 or more years of temperature data."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/dyk/anomalies-vs-temperature|title=Did You Know?|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration|website=www.ncdc.noaa.gov|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>}}
* Human activities (primarily [[greenhouse gas]] emissions) are the [[attribution of climate change|primary cause]].
* Continuing emissions will increase the likelihood and severity of [[Effects of global warming|global effects]].
* People and nations can act individually and collectively to  [[Climate change mitigation|slow the pace of global warming]], while also [[Climate change adaptation|preparing for unavoidable]] climate change and its consequences.

Several studies of the consensus have been undertaken.<ref name="ConsensusOnConsensus2016">{{Cite journal |last1=Cook|first1=John |last2=Oreskes|first2=Naomi |last3=Doran|first3=Peter T. |last4=Anderegg|first4=William R.

National and international [[Academy of Sciences|science academies]] and [[Learned society|scientific societies]] have assessed current [[scientific opinion]] on [[global warming]]. These assessments are generally consistent with the conclusions of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

Some scientific bodies have recommended specific policies to governments, and science can play a role in informing an effective response to climate change. Policy decisions, however, may require [[value judgement]]s and so are not included in the scientific opinion.<ref name="tar value judgements"/><ref name="NRC on policy"/>

No scientific body of national or international standing maintains a formal opinion dissenting from any of these main points. The last national or international scientific body to drop dissent was the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]],<ref name="AQAonAAPG" /> which in 2007<ref name="aapg19"/> updated its statement to its current non-committal position.<ref name="Oreskes07p68"/> Some other organizations, primarily those focusing on geology, also hold [[#Non-committal|non-committal positions]].

Synthesis reports are assessments of scientific literature that compile the results of a range of stand-alone studies in order to achieve a broad level of understanding, or to describe the state of knowledge of a given subject.<ref name="Integration and Synthesis: Assessing Climate Change Impacts in Northern Canada"/>

=== Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2014 ===
{{main|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC Fifth Assessment Report}}

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report followed the same general format as the Fourth Assessment Report, with three Working Group reports and a Synthesis report.<ref name="IPCC_AR5_Synth"/> The Working Group I report (WG1) was published in September 2013.<ref name="IPCC_AR5_Synth"/> The report's ''Summary for Policymakers'' stated that warming of the climate system is 'unequivocal' with changes unprecedented over decades to millennia, including warming of the atmosphere and oceans, [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|loss of snow and ice]], and [[sea level rise]]. [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions, driven largely by economic and population growth, have led to greenhouse gas concentrations that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. These, together with other anthropogenic drivers, are "extremely likely" (where that means more than 95% probability) to have been the dominant cause of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century.<ref name="IPCC-AR5-SYN">{{cite web|title=Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>

It said that
{{quote|Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the [[climate system]], increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.

Reporting on the publication of the report, ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that
{{quote|In the end it all boils down to risk management. The stronger our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the lower the risk of extreme climate impacts.

=== Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 ===
In February 2007, the IPCC released a summary of the forthcoming [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]]. According to this summary, the Fourth Assessment Report found that human actions are "very likely" the cause of global warming, meaning a 90% or greater probability. Global warming in this case was indicated by an increase of 0.75 degrees in average global temperatures over the last 100 years.<ref name="Warming 'very likely' human-made"/>

The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] stated that:

''The New York Times'' reported that "the leading international network of climate scientists has concluded for the first time that global warming is 'unequivocal' and that human activity is the main driver, 'very likely' causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950".<ref name="rosenthal"/>

A retired journalist for ''The New York Times'', William K. Stevens wrote: "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the likelihood was 90 percent to 99 percent that emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks, were the dominant cause of the observed warming of the last 50 years. In the panel's parlance, this level of certainty is labeled 'very likely'. Only rarely does scientific odds-making provide a more definite answer than that, at least in this branch of science, and it describes the endpoint, so far, of a progression.".<ref name="On the Climate Change Beat, Doubt Gives Way to Certainty"/>

The [[Associated Press]] summarized the position on sea level rise:

Thirteen federal agencies, led by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), worked together under the auspices of the [[United States Global Change Research Program]] (USGCRP) to prepare the country's [[Fourth National Climate Assessment]], published in two volumes as described below.

The ''Climate Science Special Report: Fourth National Climate Assessment, Volume I'' (October 2017) provided the following summary: 
<blockquote>This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.</blockquote>

====Background====
:''Formerly: [[Climate Change Science Program]]''

The [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]] reported in June 2009<ref name="globalchange"/> that:

{{quote|Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.}}

The 2009 report, which is about the effects that climate change is having in the United States, also said:

{{quote|Climate-related changes have already been observed globally and in the United States. These include increases in air and water temperatures, reduced frost days, increased frequency and intensity of heavy downpours, a rise in sea level, and reduced snow cover, glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. A longer ice-free period on lakes and rivers, lengthening of the growing season, and increased [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere have also been observed. Over the past 30 years, temperatures have risen faster in winter than in any other season, with average winter temperatures in the Midwest and northern Great Plains increasing more than {{convert|7|F-change|C-change}}. Some of the changes have been faster than previous assessments had suggested.}}

=== Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ===
In 2004, the intergovernmental [[Arctic Council]] and the non-governmental [[International Arctic Science Committee]] released the synthesis report of the [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]]:<ref name="Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment New Scientific Consensus: Arctic Is Warming Rapidly"/>

{{quote|Climate conditions in the past provide evidence that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are associated with rising global temperatures. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and secondarily the clearing of land, have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping ("greenhouse") gases in the atmosphere...There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.<ref name="amap"/>}}

== Policy ==
{{See also|Avoiding dangerous climate change}}

There is an extensive discussion in the [[scientific literature]] on what policies might be effective in responding to climate change.<ref name="ar4 policy assessment">The literature has been assessed by the IPCC, e.g., see:

In general, however, risk increases with increases in both the rate and the magnitude of climate change.</blockquote>

=== Concurring ===
==== Academies of science (general science) ====
Since 2001, 34 [[national academies|national science academies]], three regional academies, and both the international [[InterAcademy Council]] and [[International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences]] have made formal declarations confirming human induced global warming and urging nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The 34 national science academy statements include 33 who have signed joint science academy statements and one individual declaration by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in 2007.

===== Joint national science academy statements =====
* 2001 Following the publication of the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]], seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled "The Science of Climate Change", explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science. The statement, printed in an editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on May 18, 2001,<ref name="Editorial: The Science of Climate Change"/> was signed by the science academies of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Caribbean, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.<ref name="The Science of Climate Change"/>
* 2005 The national science academies of the [[G8]] nations, plus Brazil, China and India, three of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world, signed a statement on the global response to climate change. The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action, and explicitly endorsed the IPCC consensus. The eleven signatories were the science academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<ref name="nationalacademies"/>
* 2007 In preparation for the [[33rd G8 summit]], the national science academies of the [[G8+5]] nations issued a declaration referencing the position of the 2005 joint science academies' statement, and acknowledging the confirmation of their previous conclusion by recent research. Following the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]], the declaration states, "It is unequivocal that the climate is changing, and it is very likely that this is predominantly caused by the increasing human interference with the atmosphere. These changes will transform the environmental conditions on [[Earth]] unless counter-measures are taken." The thirteen signatories were the national science academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<ref name="pik-potsdam"/>
* 2007 In preparation for the [[33rd G8 summit]], the [[Network of African Science Academies]] submitted a joint "statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change": {{quote|A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability. | The thirteen signatories were the science academies of [[Cameroon]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], as well as the [[African Academy of Sciences]] | <ref name="autogenerated1"/>}}
* 2008 In preparation for the [[34th G8 summit]], the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a declaration reiterating the position of the 2005 joint science academies’ statement, and reaffirming "that climate change is happening and that anthropogenic warming is influencing many physical and biological systems". Among other actions, the declaration urges all nations to "[t]ake appropriate economic and policy measures to accelerate transition to a [[low carbon society]] and to encourage and effect changes in individual and national behaviour". The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 joint statement.<ref name="nationalacademies5"/>
* 2009 In advance of the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|UNFCCC]] negotiations to be held in [[Copenhagen]] in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, "Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change". The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that "climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global {{CO2}} emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid". The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements.<ref name="nationalacademies6"/>

===== Polish Academy of Sciences =====
In December 2007, the General Assembly of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (Polska Akademia Nauk), which has not been a signatory to [[#Joint National Science Academy Statements|joint national science academy statements]] issued a declaration endorsing the IPCC conclusions, and stating:
{{quote|it is the duty of Polish science and the national government to, in a thoughtful, organized and active manner, become involved in realisation of these ideas.

Problems of global warming, climate change, and their various negative impacts on human life and on the functioning of entire societies are one of the most dramatic challenges of modern times.

PAS General Assembly calls on the national scientific communities and the national government to actively support Polish participation in this important endeavor.<ref name="Stanowisko Zgromadzenia Ogólnego PAN z dnia 13 grudnia 2007 r"/>}}

===== Additional national science academy and society statements =====
* [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] as the world's largest general scientific society, adopted an official statement on climate change in 2006: {{quote|The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society....The pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the last five years. The time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now.<ref name="aaas board"/>}}
* [[Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies]] in 2008 published ''FASTS Statement on Climate Change''<ref name="FASTS Statement on Climate Change"/> which states: {{quote|Global climate change is real and measurable...To reduce the global net economic, environmental and social losses in the face of these impacts, the policy objective must remain squarely focused on returning greenhouse gas concentrations to near pre-industrial levels through the reduction of emissions. The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity.}}
* [[United States National Research Council]] through its Committee on the Science of Climate Change in 2001, published ''Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions''.<ref name="CCSAASKQ">{{cite book |author=Committee on the Science of Climate Change, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council |title=Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington DC |year=2001 |isbn=0-309-07574-2 |url=http://books.nap.edu/html/climatechange |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010628070322/http://books.nap.edu/html/climatechange/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-06-28 }}</ref> This report explicitly endorses the IPCC view of attribution of recent climate change as representing the view of the scientific community: {{quote|The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are expected to continue through the 21st century... The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue.<ref name="CCSAASKQ"/>}}
* [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] having signed onto the first joint science academy statement in 2001, released a separate statement in 2008 in order to clear up "the controversy over climate change and its causes, and possible confusion among the public": {{quote|The globe is warming because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Measurements show that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are well above levels seen for many thousands of years. Further global climate changes are predicted, with impacts expected to become more costly as time progresses. Reducing future impacts of climate change will require substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name="Climate change statement from the Royal Society of New Zealand"/>}}
* The [[Royal Society]] of the United Kingdom has not changed its concurring stance reflected in its participation in [[#Joint national science academies' statements|joint national science academies' statements]] on anthropogenic global warming. According to the [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]], "The most prestigious group of scientists in the country was forced to act after fellows complained that doubts over man made global warming were not being communicated to the public".<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> In May 2010, it announced that it "is presently drafting a new public facing document on climate change, to provide an updated status report on the science in an easily accessible form, also addressing the levels of certainty of key components."<ref name="RS-CC"/> The society says that it is three years since the last such document was published and that, after an extensive process of debate and review,<ref name="Society to review climate message"/><ref name="Some excitable climate-change deniers just don't understand what science is"/> the new document was printed in September 2010. It summarises the current scientific evidence and highlights the areas where the science is well established, where there is still some debate, and where substantial uncertainties remain. The society has stated that "this is not the same as saying that the climate science itself is in error – no Fellows have expressed such a view to the RS".<ref name="RS-CC"/>  The introduction includes this statement: {{quote|There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation.}}

===== International science academies =====
* [[African Academy of Sciences]] in 2007 was a signatory to the "statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change". This joint statement of African science academies, was organized through the [[Network of African Science Academies]]. Its stated goal was "to convey information and spur action on the occasion of the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, Germany, in June 2007". {{quote|A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joint statement by the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) to the G8 on sustainability, energy efficiency and climate change|url=http://www.interacademies.net/file.aspx?id=4825|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=2007|quote=A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change... Although we recognize that this nexus poses daunting challenges for the developed world, we firmly believe that these challenges are even more daunting for the most impoverished, science-poor regions of the developing world, especially in Africa.}}</ref>}}
* [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 2007 issued a formal declaration on climate change titled ''Let's Be Honest'': {{quote|Human activity is most ''likely'' responsible for climate warming. Most of the climatic warming over the last 50 years is ''likely'' to have been caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Documented long-term climate changes include changes in Arctic temperatures and ice, widespread changes in precipitation amounts, ocean salinity, wind patterns and [[extreme weather]] including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones. The above development potentially has dramatic consequences for mankind's future.<ref name="euro-acad"/>}}
* [[European Science Foundation]] in a 2007 position paper<ref name="European Science Foundation Position Paper ''Impacts of Climate Change on the European Marine and Coastal Environment — Ecosystems Approach''"/> states: {{quote|There is now convincing evidence that since the industrial revolution, human activities, resulting in increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases have become a major agent of climate change&nbsp;... On-going and increased efforts to mitigate climate change through reduction in greenhouse gases are therefore crucial.}}
* [[InterAcademy Council]] As the representative of the world's [[Academy of Sciences|scientific and engineering academies]],<ref name="nytimes"/><ref name="interacademycouncil"/> the InterAcademy Council issued a report in 2007 titled ''Lighting the Way: Toward a Sustainable Energy Future''. {{quote|Current patterns of energy resources and energy usage are proving detrimental to the long-term welfare of humanity. The integrity of essential natural systems is already at risk from climate change caused by the atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref name="interacademycouncil7"/> Concerted efforts should be mounted for improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon intensity of the world economy.<ref name="interacademycouncil8"/>}}
* [[International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences]] (CAETS) in 2007, issued a ''Statement on Environment and Sustainable Growth'':<ref name="caets">{{cite web |url=http://www.caets.org/nae/naecaets.nsf/(weblinks)/WSAN-78QL9A?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210053304/http://www.caets.org/nae/naecaets.nsf/(weblinks)/WSAN-78QL9A?OpenDocument |archivedate=2008-12-10 }}</ref> {{quote|As reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century is very likely due to human-produced emission of greenhouse gases and this warming will continue unabated if present anthropogenic emissions continue or, worse, expand without control.

===== American Geophysical Union =====
The [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) adopted a statement on ''Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Tamara S. |last1=Ledley |first2=Eric T. |last2=Sundquist |first3=Stephen E. |last3=Schwartz |first4=Dorothy K. |last4=Hall |first5=Jack D. |last5=Fellows |first6=Timothy L. |last6=Killeen |title=Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases |journal=EOS |date=September 28, 1999 |volume=80 |issue=39 |pages=453–454, 457–458 |doi=10.1029/99EO00325 |quote=There is no known geologic precedent for large increases of atmospheric C0<sub>2</sub> without simultaneous changes in other components of the carbon cycle and climate system.[...] Changes in the climate system that are confidently predicted in response to increases in greenhouse gases include increases in mean surface air temperature, increases in global mean rates of precipitation and evaporation, rising sea level, and changes in the biosphere. |url=http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/pubs/BNL66903.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2016 |bibcode=1999EOSTr..80Q.453L |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009000325/http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/pubs/BNL66903.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A new statement, adopted by the society in 2003, revised in 2007,<ref name="agu"/> and revised and expanded in 2013,<ref>{{cite web|title=Human-induced Climate Change Requires Urgent Action|url=http://www.agu.org/news/press/pr_archives/2013/2013-38.shtml|work=Position Statement|publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> affirms that rising levels of greenhouse gases have caused and will continue to cause the global surface temperature to be warmer:

{{quote|Human activities are changing Earth's climate. At the global level, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases have increased sharply since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel burning dominates this increase. Human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8{{nnbsp}}°C (1.5{{nnbsp}}°F) over the past 140 years. Because natural processes cannot quickly remove some of these gases (notably carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere, our past, present, and future emissions will influence the climate system for millennia.

While important scientific uncertainties remain as to which particular impacts will be experienced where, no uncertainties are known that could make the impacts of climate change inconsequential. Furthermore, surprise outcomes, such as the unexpectedly rapid loss of Arctic summer sea ice, may entail even more dramatic changes than anticipated.}}

===== American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America =====
In May, 2011, the [[American Society of Agronomy]] (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and [[Soil Science Society of America]] (SSSA) issued a joint position statement on climate change as it relates to agriculture:

{{quote|A comprehensive body of scientific evidence indicates beyond reasonable doubt that global climate change is now occurring and that its manifestations threaten the stability of societies as well as natural and managed ecosystems. Increases in ambient temperatures and changes in related processes are directly linked to rising anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere.

Unless the emissions of GHGs are curbed significantly, their concentrations will continue to rise, leading to changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables that will undoubtedly affect agriculture around the world.

Climate change has the potential to increase weather variability as well as gradually increase global temperatures. Both of these impacts have the potential to negatively impact the adaptability and resilience of the world's food production capacity; current research indicates climate change is already reducing the productivity of vulnerable cropping systems.<ref name="soils"/>}}

===== European Federation of Geologists =====
In 2008, the European Federation of Geologists<ref name="eurogeologists"/> (EFG) issued the position paper ''Carbon Capture and geological Storage '':

{{quote|The EFG recognizes the work of the IPCC and other organizations, and subscribes to the major findings that climate change is happening, is predominantly caused by anthropogenic emissions of {{CO2}}, and poses a significant threat to human civilization.

It is clear that major efforts are necessary to quickly and strongly reduce {{CO2}} emissions. The EFG strongly advocates renewable and sustainable energy production, including geothermal energy, as well as the need for increasing energy efficiency.

CCS [Carbon Capture and geological Storage] should also be regarded as a bridging technology, facilitating the move towards a carbon free economy.<ref name="eurogeologists9"/>}}

===== European Geosciences Union =====
In 2005, the Divisions of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences of the [[European Geosciences Union]] (EGU) issued a position statement in support of the [[scientific opinion on climate change#Joint science academies’ statement 2005|joint science academies’ statement]] on global response to climate change. The statement refers to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), as "the main representative of the global [[scientific community]]", and asserts that the IPCC

{{quote|represents the state-of-the-art of climate science supported by the major science academies around the world and by the vast majority of science researchers and investigators as documented by the [[peer-reviewed]] scientific literature.<ref name="www"/>}}

Additionally, in 2008, the EGU issued a position statement on [[ocean acidification]] which states, "Ocean acidification is already occurring today and will continue to intensify, closely tracking [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric {{CO2}}]] increase. Given the potential threat to [[marine ecosystems]] and its ensuing impact on human society and economy, especially as it acts in conjunction with [[anthropogenic global warming]], there is an urgent need for immediate action." The statement then advocates for strategies "to limit future release of {{CO2}} to the atmosphere and/or enhance removal of excess {{CO2}} from the atmosphere".<ref name="www10"/> And, in 2018 the EGU issued a statement concurring with the findings of the [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C]], with Jonathan Bamber, president of the organisation, noting: “EGU concurs with, and supports, the findings of the SR15 that action to curb the most dangerous consequences of human-induced climate change is urgent, of the utmost importance and the window of opportunity extremely limited.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.egu.eu/news/438/egus-reaction-to-ipcc-report-on-global-warming-of-15c/|title=EGU's reaction to IPCC report on Global Warming of 1.5°C|website=European Geosciences Union (EGU)|language=en|date=9 October 2018|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>

===== Geological Society of America =====
In 2006, the [[Geological Society of America]] adopted a position statement on global [[climate change]]. It amended this position on April 20, 2010, with more explicit comments on need for {{CO2}} reduction.
{{quote|Decades of scientific research have shown that climate can change from both natural and anthropogenic causes. The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s. If current trends continue, the projected increase in global temperature by the end of the twenty first century will result in large impacts on humans and other species. Addressing the challenges posed by climate change will require a combination of adaptation to the changes that are likely to occur and global reductions of {{CO2}} emissions from anthropogenic sources.<ref name="geosociety"/>}}

===== Geological Society of London =====
In November 2010, the [[Geological Society of London]] issued the position statement ''Climate change: evidence from the geological record'':

{{quote|The last century has seen a rapidly growing global population and much more intensive use of resources, leading to greatly increased emissions of gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, from the burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal), and from agriculture, cement production and deforestation. Evidence from the geological record is consistent with the physics that shows that adding large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere warms the world and may lead to: higher sea levels and flooding of low-lying coasts; greatly changed patterns of rainfall; increased acidity of the oceans; and decreased oxygen levels in seawater.

There is now widespread concern that the Earth's climate will warm further, not only because of the lingering effects of the added carbon already in the system, but also because of further additions as human population continues to grow. Life on Earth has survived large climate changes in the past, but extinctions and major redistribution of species have been associated with many of them. When the human population was small and nomadic, a rise in sea level of a few metres would have had very little effect on Homo sapiens. With the current and growing global population, much of which is concentrated in coastal cities, such a rise in sea level would have a drastic effect on our complex society, especially if the climate were to change as suddenly as it has at times in the past. Equally, it seems likely that as warming continues some areas may experience less precipitation leading to drought. With both rising seas and increasing drought, pressure for human migration could result on a large scale.<ref name="geolsoc"/>}}

===== International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics =====
In July 2007, the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) adopted a resolution titled "The Urgency of Addressing Climate Change". In it, the IUGG concurs with the "comprehensive and widely accepted and endorsed scientific assessments carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and regional and national bodies, which have firmly established, on the basis of scientific evidence, that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change". They state further that the "continuing reliance on combustion of fossil fuels as the world's primary source of energy will lead to much higher atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which will, in turn, cause significant increases in surface temperature, sea level, ocean acidification, and their related consequences to the environment and society".<ref name="iugg"/>

===== National Association of Geoscience Teachers =====
In July 2009, the National Association of Geoscience Teachers<ref name="nagt"/> (NAGT) adopted a position statement on climate change in which they assert that "Earth's climate is changing [and] "that present warming trends are largely the result of human activities":

{{quote|NAGT strongly supports and will work to promote education in the science of climate change, the causes and effects of current global warming, and the immediate need for policies and actions that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.<ref name="nagt11"/>}}

==== Meteorology and oceanography ====
===== American Meteorological Society =====
The [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS) statement adopted by their council in 2012 concluded:

{{quote|There is unequivocal evidence that Earth's lower atmosphere, ocean, and land surface are warming; sea level is rising; and snow cover, mountain glaciers, and Arctic sea ice are shrinking. The dominant cause of the warming since the 1950s is human activities. This scientific finding is based on a large and persuasive body of research. The observed warming will be irreversible for many years into the future, and even larger temperature increases will occur as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Avoiding this future warming will require a large and rapid reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing warming will increase risks and stresses to human societies, economies, ecosystems, and wildlife through the 21st century and beyond, making it imperative that society respond to a changing climate. To inform decisions on adaptation and mitigation, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the global climate system and our ability to project future climate through continued and improved monitoring and research. This is especially true for smaller (seasonal and regional) scales and weather and climate extremes, and for important hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and water availability.

Technological, economic, and policy choices in the near future will determine the extent of future impacts of climate change. Science-based decisions are seldom made in a context of absolute certainty. National and international policy discussions should include consideration of the best ways to both adapt to and mitigate climate change. Mitigation will reduce the amount of future climate change and the risk of impacts that are potentially large and dangerous. At the same time, some continued climate change is inevitable, and policy responses should include adaptation to climate change. Prudence dictates extreme care in accounting for our relationship with the only planet known to be capable of sustaining human life.<ref name="ametsoc"/>}}

A 2016 survey found that two-thirds of AMS members think that all or most of climate change is caused by human activity.<ref>{{cite book

===== Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society =====
The [[Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]] has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude:

{{quote|Global climate change and global warming are real and observable ... It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been largely responsible for the observed warming since 1950. The warming associated with increases in greenhouse gases originating from human activity is called the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by more than 30% since the start of the industrial age and is higher now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. This increase is a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale [[deforestation]] and other human activity.<ref name="amos"/>}}

===== Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences =====
In November 2005, the [[Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences]] (CFCAS) issued a letter to the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] stating that

{{quote|We concur with the climate science assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 ... We endorse the conclusions of the IPCC assessment that 'There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities'. ... There is increasingly unambiguous evidence of changing climate in Canada and around the world. There will be increasing impacts of climate change on Canada's natural ecosystems and on our socio-economic activities. Advances in climate science since the 2001 IPCC Assessment have provided more evidence supporting the need for action and development of a strategy for adaptation to projected changes.<ref name="cfcas"/>}}

===== Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society =====
In November 2009,  a letter to the Canadian Parliament by The [[Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]] states:
{{quote|Rigorous international research, including work carried out and supported by the Government of Canada, reveals that greenhouse gases resulting from human activities contribute to the warming of the atmosphere and the oceans and constitute a serious risk to the health and safety of our society, as well as having an impact on all life.<ref name="cmos"/>}}

===== Royal Meteorological Society (UK) =====
In February 2007, after the release of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] issued an endorsement of the report. In addition to referring to the IPCC as "[the] world's best climate scientists", they stated that climate change is happening as "the result of emissions since industrialization and we have already set in motion the next 50 years of global warming – what we do from now on will determine how worse it will get."<ref name="rmets"/>

===== World Meteorological Organization =====
In its ''Statement at the Twelfth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change'' presented on November 15, 2006, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) confirms the need to "[[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]]". The WMO concurs that "scientific assessments have increasingly reaffirmed that human activities are indeed changing the composition of the atmosphere, in particular through the burning of fossil fuels for energy production and transportation". The WMO concurs that "the present atmospheric concentration of {{CO2}} was never exceeded over the past 420,000 years"; and that the IPCC "assessments provide the most authoritative, up-to-date scientific advice".

===== American Quaternary Association =====
The [[American Quaternary Association]] (AMQUA) has stated

{{quote|Few credible scientists now doubt that humans have influenced the documented rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution. The first government-led U.S. Climate Change Science Program synthesis and assessment report supports the growing body of evidence that warming of the atmosphere, especially over the past 50 years, is directly impacted by human activity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Council of the American Quaternary Association |title=Petroleum Geologists' Award to Novelist Crichton Is Inappropriate |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]] |volume=87 |issue=36 |pages=364 |doi=10.1029/2006EO360008 |year=2006 |bibcode=2006EOSTr..87..364B }}</ref>}}

===== International Union for Quaternary Research =====
The statement on climate change issued by the [[International Union for Quaternary Research]] (INQUA) reiterates the conclusions of the IPCC, and urges all nations to take prompt action in line with the [[UNFCCC]] principles.

{{quote|Human activities are now causing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases—including carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, and nitrous oxide—to rise well above pre-industrial levels&nbsp;... Increases in greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise&nbsp;... The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action&nbsp;... Minimizing the amount of this carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere presents a huge challenge but must be a global priority.<ref name="inqua"/>}}

{{quote|There is now widespread agreement that the Earth is warming, due to emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. It is also clear that current trends in energy use, development, and population growth will lead to continuing – and more severe – climate change.}}

{{quote|The changing climate will inevitably affect the basic requirements for maintaining health: clean air and water, sufficient food and adequate shelter. Each year, about 800,000 people die from causes attributable to [[urban air pollution]], 1.8 million from [[diarrhoea]] resulting from lack of access to clean water supply, sanitation, and poor hygiene, 3.5 million from [[malnutrition]] and approximately 60,000 in natural disasters. A warmer and more variable climate threatens to lead to higher levels of some air pollutants, increase transmission of diseases through unclean water and through contaminated food, to compromise agricultural production in some of the least developed countries, and increase the hazards of extreme weather.}}
==== The ''Bulletin of the Atomic scientists'' and "Doomsday clock" ====
A group of scientists launched a project named the "''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''" that contains the "[[Doomsday Clock]]" after the bombardment of Hiroshima and Nagasaky. The biggest is the danger to humanity the clock moves closer to midnight and vice versa. The target is to show the extent of danger to humanity, create awareness in public that will lead to solutions. In the beginning the organization focused on the danger of nuclear war, but in the 21th century, it has begun to deal with other issues like climate change and disinformation on the internet.

On 23 January 2020 the organization moved the doomsday clock to 100 seconds before midnight, closer than ever. It explained that it did it because of 3 factors:
* Increasing danger of nuclear war,
* Increasing danger from climate change, and
* Increasing danger from disinformation in the internet regarding the issues in points 1 and 2 and other "disruptive technologies".

The organization, praised the climate movement of [[Climate Strike|young people]] and called to citizens and governments to act for solving the problems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Closer than ever: It is 100 seconds to midnight |url=https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/ |website=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref>

==== American Association of Petroleum Geologists ====
As of June 2007, the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]] (AAPG) Position Statement on climate change stated:

{{quote|the AAPG membership is divided on the degree of influence that anthropogenic {{CO2}} has on recent and potential global temperature increases&nbsp;... Certain climate simulation models predict that the warming trend will continue, as reported through NAS, AGU, AAAS and AMS. AAPG respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data. These data do not necessarily support the maximum case scenarios forecast in some models.<ref name="aapg"/>}}

Prior to the adoption of this statement, the AAPG was the only major scientific organization that rejected the finding of significant human influence on recent climate, according to a statement by the Council of the American Quaternary Association.<ref name="AQAonAAPG"/> Explaining the plan for a revision, AAPG president Lee Billingsly wrote in March 2007:

{{quote|Members have threatened to not renew their memberships&nbsp;... if AAPG does not alter its position on global climate change&nbsp;... And I have been told of members who already have resigned in previous years because of our current global climate change position&nbsp;... The current policy statement is not supported by a significant number of our members and prospective members.<ref name="aapg14"/>}}

AAPG President John Lorenz announced the "sunsetting" of AAPG's Global Climate Change Committee in January 2010.  The AAPG Executive Committee determined:

{{quote|Climate change is peripheral at best to our science&nbsp;... AAPG does not have credibility in that field&nbsp;... and as a group we have no particular knowledge of global atmospheric geophysics.<ref name="2010_tpgmarapr"/>}}

==== American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG) ====
The official position statement from AIPG on the Environment states that "combustion of fossil fuel include and the generation of GHGs [greenhouse gases] including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).  Emissions of GHGs are perceived by some to be one of the largest, global environmental concerns related to energy production due to potential effects on the global energy system and possibly global climate. Fossil fuel use is the primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of GHGs since industrialization".<ref>{{cite web |title=AIPG Position Statements |url=http://aipg.org/posstatements |accessdate=2018-02-01}}</ref>

In March 2010, AIPG's Executive Director issued a statement regarding polarization of opinions on climate change within the membership and announced that the AIPG Executive had made a decision to cease publication of articles and opinion pieces concerning climate change in AIPG's news journal, ''The Professional Geologist''.<ref name="aipg17"/>

Various surveys have been conducted to evaluate scientific opinion on [[global warming]]. They have concluded that the majority of scientists support the idea of anthropogenic climate change.

In 2004, the geologist and historian of science [[Naomi Oreskes]] summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change.<ref name="Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change"/> She analyzed 928 [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 and concluded that there is a scientific consensus on the reality of [[anthropogenic climate change]].

Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Seventy-five per cent of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories (either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view); 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. None of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be "remarkable". According to the report, "authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point."

In 2007, [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Interactive]] surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the [[American Meteorological Society]] or the [[American Geophysical Union]] for the [[Statistical Assessment Service]] (STATS) at [[George Mason University]]. 97% of the scientists surveyed agreed that global temperatures had increased during the past 100 years; 84% said they personally believed human-induced warming was occurring, and 74% agreed that "currently available scientific evidence" substantiated its occurrence. Catastrophic effects in 50–100 years would likely be observed according to 41%, while 44% thought the effects would be moderate and about 13 percent saw relatively little danger. 5% said they thought human activity did not contribute to greenhouse warming.<ref name="Survey Tracks Scientists' Growing Climate Concern"/><ref name="Climate Scientists Agree on Warming, Disagree on Dangers, and Don't Trust the Media's Coverage of Climate Change">{{cite web |last=Lichter |first=S.

Dennis Bray and [[Hans von Storch]] conducted a survey in August 2008 of 2058 climate scientists from 34 different countries.<ref name="A Survey of the Perspectives of Climate Scientists Concerning Climate Science and Climate Change"/> A web link with a unique identifier was given to each respondent to eliminate multiple responses. A total of 373 responses were received giving an overall response rate of 18.2%. No paper on climate change consensus based on this survey has been published yet (February 2010), but one on another subject has been published based on the survey.<ref name="Prediction' or 'Projection; The nomenclature of climate science"/>

The survey was made up of 76 questions split into a number of sections.
There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public.
Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from "not at all" to "very much".

To the question "How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?", 67.1% said they very much agreed, 26.7% agreed to some large extent, 6.2% said to they agreed to some small extent (2–4), none said they did not agree at all. To the question "How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will
be, a result of anthropogenic causes?" the responses were 34.6% very much agree, 48.9% agreeing to a large extent, 15.1% to a small extent, and 1.35% not agreeing at all.

A poll performed by [[Peter Doran]] and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. 76 out of 79 [[climatologists]] who "listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change" believed that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Seventy-five of 77 believed that human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures have risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. [[Economic geologist]]s and [[meteorologist]]s were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent, respectively, believing in significant human involvement. The authors summarised the findings:

{{quote|It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes.<ref name="DZ_EOS_2009"/>}}

A 2010 paper in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States'']] (PNAS) reviewed publication and citation data for 1,372 climate researchers and drew the following two conclusions:

<blockquote>(i) 97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC (Anthropogenic Climate Change) outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.<ref name="Expert credibility in climate change"/></blockquote>

A 2013 paper in [[Environmental Research Letters]] reviewed 11,944 abstracts of scientific papers matching "global warming" or "global climate change". They found 4,014 which discussed the cause of recent global warming, and of these "97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming".<ref name="Cook_etal_13"/> This study was criticised in 2016 by [[Richard Tol]] <ref name="Tol p=048001">{{cite journal | last=Tol | first=Richard S J | title=Comment on 'Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature' | journal=Environmental Research Letters | publisher=IOP Publishing | volume=11 | issue=4 | date=1 April 2016 | issn=1748-9326 | doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048001 | page=048001| doi-access=free }}</ref>, but strongly defended by a companion paper in the same volume.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=John|last2=Oreskes|first2=Naomi|last3=Doran|first3=Peter T.|last4=Anderegg|first4=William R.

== Existence of a scientific consensus ==
A question that frequently arises in popular discussion is whether there is a [[scientific consensus]] on climate change.<ref name="Oreskes_consensus"/>  Several scientific organizations have explicitly used the term "consensus" in their statements:
* [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 2006: "The conclusions in this statement reflect the scientific consensus represented by, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the Joint National Academies' statement."<ref name="aaas board"/>
* [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]]: "In the judgment of most climate scientists, Earth's warming in recent decades has been caused primarily by human activities that have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.&nbsp;... On climate change, [the National Academies’ reports] have assessed consensus findings on the science&nbsp;..."<ref name="nas"/>
* Joint Science Academies' statement, 2005: "We recognise the international scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."<ref name="nationalacademies21"/>
* Joint Science Academies' statement, 2001: "The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science. We recognise IPCC as the world's most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus."<ref name="The Science of Climate Change"/>

While ‘climate change’ can be due to natural forces or human activity, there is now substantial evidence to indicate that human activity – and specifically increased greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions – is a key factor in the pace and extent of global temperature increases.  Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, [[Heat wave|heatwaves]] and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the [[Food security|food]] and [[water supply]], resource conflicts and population shifts.  Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[Ross River virus]] and food-borne infections such as [[Salmonellosis]]) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health.  Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health. Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."</ref>

If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth's physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.  Because the complexity of the climate makes accurate prediction difficult, the APS urges an enhanced effort to understand the effects of human activity on the Earth's climate, and to provide the technological options for meeting the climate challenge in the near and longer terms. The APS also urges governments, universities, national laboratories and its membership to support policies and actions that will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.</ref>

<ref name="FASTS Statement on Climate Change">{{citation |url=http://www.fasts.org/images/policy-discussion/statement-climate-change.pdf |title=FASTS Statement on Climate Change |year=2008}} "Global climate change is real and measurable. Since the start of the 20th century, the global mean surface temperature of the Earth has increased by more than 0.7°C and the rate of warming has been largest in the last 30 years.  Key vulnerabilities arising from climate change include water resources, food supply, health, coastal settlements, biodiversity and some key [[ecosystems]] such as coral reefs and alpine regions. As the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases increases, impacts become more severe and widespread. To reduce the global net economic, environmental and social losses in the face of these impacts, the policy objective must remain squarely focused on returning greenhouse gas concentrations to near pre-industrial levels through the reduction of emissions.  The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity."</ref>

Carbon dioxide concentrations were relatively stable for the past 10,000 years but then began to increase rapidly about 150 years ago…as a result of fossil fuel consumption and land use change.  Of course, changes in atmospheric composition are but one component of global change, which also includes disturbances in the physical and chemical conditions of the oceans and land surface. Although global change has been a natural process throughout Earth's history, humans are responsible for substantially accelerating present-day changes. These changes may adversely affect human health and the [[biosphere]] on which we depend.

As a consequence of global warming, they warn that a "rise in sea levels due to melting of ice caps is expected to occur. Rises in temperature will have complex and frequently localised effects on weather, but an overall increase in extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation patterns are probable, resulting in flooding and drought. The spread of [[tropical diseases]] is also expected."   Subsequently, the Institute of Biology advocates policies to reduce "greenhouse gas emissions, as we feel that the consequences of climate change are likely to be severe."</ref>

The world's most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels. Since the time of the Industrial Revolution about 200 years ago, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 280 parts per million to 370 parts per million, an increase of around 30%.  On the basis of available data, climate scientists are now projecting an average global temperature rise over this century of 2.0 to 4.5°C. This compared with 0.6°C over the previous century – about a 500% increase... This could lead to changing, and for all emissions scenarios more unpredictable, weather patterns around the world, less frost days, more extreme events (droughts and storm or flood disasters), and warmer sea temperatures and melting glaciers causing sea levels to rise.  ... Professional engineers commonly deal with risk, and frequently have to make judgments based on incomplete data. The available evidence suggests very strongly that human activities have already begun to make significant changes to the earth's climate, and that the long-term risk of delaying action is greater than the cost of avoiding/minimising the risk."</ref>
