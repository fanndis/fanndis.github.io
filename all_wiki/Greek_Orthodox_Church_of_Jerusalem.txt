The '''Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem''' ({{lang-ar|كنيسة الروم الأرثوذكس في القدس}} ''Kanisatt Ar-rum al-Urtudoks fi al-Quds'', literally '''[[Rûm]]i Orthodox Church of Jerusalem'''; {{lang-he-n|הפטריארכיה היוונית-אורתודוקסית של ירושלים}}), officially called simply the '''Patriarchate of Jerusalem''' ({{lang-el|Πατριαρχεῖον Ἱεροσολύμων}}, ''Patriarcheîon Hierosolýmōn''), is an [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|church]] within the wider communion of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. It is headed by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], the incumbent being [[Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem|Theophilos III]] since 2005. [[Christians]] believe that it was in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] that the Church was established on the day of [[Pentecost]] with the descent of the [[Holy Spirit]] on the [[disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s of [[Jesus]] Christ ({{Bibleverse||Acts|2:1-41}}) and that the [[Gospel]] of Christ spread from Jerusalem. The church celebrates its liturgy in the [[Byzantine Rite]], whose original language is [[Koine Greek]], the original language of the [[New Testament]], and follows its own calendar of feasts, preserving the [[Julian calendar]] (that is thirteen days behind the Western (Gregorian) calendar). It is also often called "Σιωνίτις Εκκλησία" ({{lang-el|Sionitis Ecclesia}}, i.e. the "Church of [[Zion]]").

The number of Orthodox Christians in the [[Holy Land]] is estimated at about 500,000. A majority of Church members are [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] and [[Jordanians]], and there are also many [[Russians]], [[Romanians]], and [[Georgian people|Georgians]].  The Church's hierarchy is dominated by [[Greeks|Greek]] clergy, which in effect excludes the Arab majority from the Church's upper ranks. This has been a point of endless contention between Greeks in the patriarchate, who are backed in this regard by the [[Greek government]], [[Israel]] and the [[Turkey]]-based [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], and the native Palestinian clergy- some of whom seek to nationalize their Church's leadership. (see [[Arab Orthodox]]).

The headquarters of the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

On the [[Jerusalem in Christianity|importance of Jerusalem]], the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' reads:
{{quote|During the [[Early Christianity|first Christian centuries]] the [[Church (building)|church]] at this place was the centre of Christianity in Jerusalem, "Holy and glorious Sion, mother of all churches." Certainly no spot in [[Christendom]] can be more venerable than the place of the [[Last Supper]], which became the first Christian church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Jerusalem (A.D. 71–1099) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-10-01 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref>}}

==History==
{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=jurisdictions}}
[[File:Jerusalem Holy Sepulchre BW 20.JPG|thumb|left|View of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]
[[File:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[James, brother of Jesus]], first Bishop of Jerusalem]]

In the [[Apostolic Age]], Christianity consisted of an indefinite number of local churches that in the initial years looked to Jerusalem as its main centre and point of reference. (See also [[Jerusalem in Christianity]] and [[Early centers of Christianity]]) Some found their way to Antioch, where they undertook [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] efforts, and to whom the term "Christians" was first used.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Acts|11:19-26|NIV}}</ref>

Before the outbreak of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66-73 AD) and the destruction of [[Herod's Temple]] in 70 by [[Titus]], Christians led by [[Simeon of Jerusalem|Simeon]] fled to [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] in [[Decapolis]] ([[Jordan]]),<ref>According to [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]].[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Schism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> where they remained until 135.

The Jews of Judea again revolted against Rome in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136). By or during that time, the Christians had returned to Jerusalem. However, to punish the Jews for their revolt and to prevent further unrest, Jerusalem was made a [[Colonies in antiquity|Roman colony]] and renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]] by [[Hadrian]]. In 135, the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] appointed [[Marcus of Jerusalem|Marcus]] as the first bishop of the renamed Church of [[Aelia Capitolina]]. He was the first gentile bishop of the Church of Jerusalem (or Aelia Capitolina), all the previous ones having been Jewish.<ref name="Eusebius">[[Eusebius]], ''The History of the Church'' (Tr. A. G. Williamson, Penguin Books, 1965. {{ISBN|0-14-044535-8}}), see summary in Appendix A.</ref> The persecution of Jews by Roman authorities in [[Judea]] increased, with most of the Jewish and Christian population of Judea being enslaved and dispersed throughout the Roman Empire. The importance and place of Jerusalem in the life of the Christian Church diminished, though a Jewish and Christian remnant always remained in the city and the land.

Despite the strife, persecutions and meager population, bishops continued to be elected or named. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] provides the names of an unbroken succession of thirty-six Bishops of Jerusalem up to the year 324. The first sixteen of these bishops were Jewish&mdash;from [[James the Just]] to [[Judah Kyriakos|Judas]] († 135)&mdash;and the remainder were Gentiles.<ref name=Eusebius /> The [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]s of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] continued to appoint the bishops of [[Aelia Capitolina]] until 325.

At the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, though the [[bishop]] of Aelia Capitolina was still subordinate to the [[Metropolitan archbishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]], the Council accorded the bishop a certain undefined precedence in its seventh [[canon law|canon]].

In a decree issued from the seventh session of the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council]] (the [[Council of Chalcedon]]) in 451 the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]] was elevated to the rank of [[Patriarch]], ranked fifth after the Sees of [[Latin Church|Rome]], [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], and [[Church of Antioch|Antioch]] (see [[Pentarchy]]). Since then, the Church of Jerusalem has remained an [[autocephalous]] church. Jerusalem was established as a patriarchate because of the holiness of the place; the special significance acquired between the First and Fourth Ecumenical Councils; the erection of magnificent churches; the conversion of a large proportion of the population of Roman and Byzantine Syria-Palestina to Christianity; the coming together of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] from around the world; the importance of outstanding bishops, monks, and teachers of the Church of Jerusalem; the struggles of the [[Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre]] on behalf of Orthodoxy; and the support of various Emperors of Byzantium.

The Persians occupied Jerusalem in 614 and took Patriarch [[Zacharias of Jerusalem|Zachariah]] prisoner, along with the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladium]] of Christianity, the Precious Cross. [[Chrysostomos Papadopoulos]] writes in his history of the Patriarchate: "The Churches and the monasteries, inside and outside Jerusalem, were destroyed; the Christians were brutally slaughtered … thousands of prisoners purchased by Jews were slaughtered. Anything good that existed was destroyed or was plundered by the invaders. The monks were slaughtered mercilessly, especially those of [[Mar Saba|St Savvas Monastery]]."

In 637, after a long [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|siege of Jerusalem]], Patriarch [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] surrendered Jerusalem to [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], but secured the [[Covenant of Umar I]], which recognised Christian rights to protection. In 638, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] began appointing its own [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem|bishop in Jerusalem]].

After 638, however, Christians suffered many persecutions. Christian shrines were repeatedly ransacked and defaced by the successors of Umur, and there was great persecution all around.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The most deadly persecution occurred during the time of the Fatamid [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (1007–1009), a schizophrenic,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} named the "[[Nero]] of Egypt" for his merciless acts.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} He persecuted ferociously both Christians and [[Jews]]. He ordered that in public Jews were to wear masks representing the head of an ox and bells around their necks; Christians were to wear mourning apparel and crosses one yard in length. Also, Al-Hakim ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In the eleventh century, the Caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]], under a treaty with Byzantium, permitted the reconstruction of the shrines.

In the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] joined those of [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]] as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. All Christians in the Holy Land came under the jurisdiction of the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]].

In 1099, the [[Crusade]]rs captured [[Jerusalem]], setting up the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and establishing a Latin hierarchy under a [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarch]], and expelling the Orthodox Patriarch. The Latin Patriarch resided in Jerusalem from 1099 to 1187, while Greek Patriarchs continued to be appointed, but resided in [[Constantinople]]. In 1187, the Crusaders were forced to flee Jerusalem, and the Orthodox Patriarch returned to Jerusalem. The [[Catholic Church]] continued to appoint Latin Patricarchs, though the office holder resided in Rome until 1847, when they were permitted to return to the Middle East by the Ottoman authorities.

The [[Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre]], which is closely linked to the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, remains the custodian of many of the  Christian [[Holy places]] in the [[Holy Land]], sometimes jointly with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Churches]] ([[Coptic Orthodox Church|Egyptian]], [[Syrian Orthodox Church|Syrian]], 
[[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]]  and [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian Orthodox]] Christians).

===Recent political controversies===
[[Patriarch Theofilos III of Jerusalem|Theophilos III]] became patriarch of the church at a very difficult time in its history. The politics of the Middle East and the delicacy of the relations with the [[Palestinian Authority]], [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]] continues to make the role and place of the Patriarch and the Patriarchate very challenging.

In 2005, a crisis occurred in the church when [[Patriarch Irenaios]] was [[Defrocking|stripped of his authority]] as patriarch by the [[Holy Synod of Jerusalem]] after he had allegedly sold church property in a very sensitive area of East Jerusalem to [[Israel]]i investors.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jerusalem affairs: Religiously political|date=December 20, 2007|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1196847396248&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|access-date=January 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917044043/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1196847396248&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archive-date=September 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''[[locum tenens]]'' (steward) until the election of a new patriarch was [[Metropolitan Cornelius]] of [[Petra]]. On August 22, 2005, the Holy Synod of the Church of Jerusalem unanimously elected Theophilos, the former Archbishop of [[Mount Tabor|Tabor]], as the 141st Patriarch of Jerusalem.

For some time the Israeli Government  withheld recognition of Theophilos as the new Patriarch, and continued to only recognize Irenaios as Patriarch.  This position has been criticised as defying the unanimous decision by representatives of all Eastern Orthodox churches meeting at the [[Phanar]] at the call of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] withdrawing communion from Irineos and recognizing Theophilos's canonical election.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Israel's refusal to recognise the Patriarch's temporal role, had inhibited the Patriarch's ability to take the Government to court and froze Patriarchal bank accounts.  This in turn threatened the maintenance of the [[Holy Places]] and the Patriarchate school system with 40,000 students. It has been alleged that the origins of the dispute are part of a forty-year attempt by Israeli settler organizations and politicians to open up the Patriarchate's extensive land holdings worth estimated hundreds of millions of dollars.  The Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported on February 4, 2007 that two Ministers in the Israeli Government offered to recognize Theophilos if he would give up control of several valuable properties.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The Israeli press reports that senior officials of the Israeli government may have been involved in a fraudulent real estate transaction with the deposed Patriarch Irenaios and are afraid of the consequences of court action.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 2006, [[Israel]] refused to renew [[Visa (document)|visa]]s of many of the Greek clergy, which threatened to create to a serious crisis within the church, as most of the monks are Greek citizens. Patriarch Theophilos applied to the Israeli Supreme Court in an effort to gain civil recognition.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The Court was due to give a decision in mid-2006, but delayed giving a decision twice since then. A decision was due in January 2007, but the Israeli government again requested a further delay in the case.

In May 2007, the Government of Jordan revoked its previous recognition of Theophilos III, but on 12 June 2007 the Jordanian cabinet reversed its decision and announced that it is once again officially recognising Theophilos as patriarch.<ref>[http://www.ana.gr/anaweb/user/showplain?maindoc=5427791&maindocimg=5422286&service=10 Jordan reverses decision over Jerusalem Patriarch]</ref> [[Archbishop]] [[Theodosios (Hanna) of Sebastia]] has also called for a boycott of Theophilos.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.panet.co.il/ysc.php?ac=showarticle&article_id=63753&category_id=1 |title=Link lost |access-date=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624182624/http://www.panet.co.il/ysc.php?ac=showarticle&article_id=63753&category_id=1 |archive-date=2007-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In December 2007, the Israeli government finally granted Theophilos full recognition. Irenaios appealed this decision to the Israeli Supreme Court,<ref name="fr.jpost.com"/> but that court ruled in favor of Theophilos.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
