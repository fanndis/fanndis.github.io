'''Spelman College''' is a [[Private college|private]] [[historically black college|historically black]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States. The college is part of the [[Atlanta University Center]] academic consortium in Atlanta.<ref name="NewGA" /> Founded in 1881 as the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, Spelman received its collegiate charter in 1924, making it America's oldest private [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] liberal arts college for women.<ref name="NewGA" />

== History ==
=== Founding ===
[[File:Harriet E. Giles and Sophia B. Packard.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Harriet E. Giles]] and [[Sophia B. Packard]]]]
The '' Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary'' was established on {{Start date|1881|04|11}} in the basement of Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, by two teachers from the [[Oread Institute]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]: [[Harriet E. Giles]] and [[Sophia B. Packard]].<ref name="NewGA" /><ref name="Reed1889">{{cite book|editor=Wallace Putnam Reed|title=History of Atlanta, Georgia: With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers|url=https://archive.org/details/historyatlantag00reedgoog|year=1889|publisher=D. Mason & Company|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyatlantag00reedgoog/page/n441 367]–370}}</ref> Giles and Packard had met while Giles was a student, and Packard the preceptress, of the New Salem Academy in [[New Salem, Massachusetts]], and fostered a lifelong friendship there.<ref name="Lefever, Harry G. 2005 pp. 60-63">Lefever, Harry G. (2005), "The Early Origins of Spelman College". ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', No. 47, pp. 60-63.</ref>  The two of them traveled to Atlanta specifically to found a school for black freedwomen, and found support from Frank Quarles, the pastor of Friendship Baptist Church.

Giles and Packard began the school with 11 African-American women and $100 given to them by the First Baptist Church in [[Medford, Massachusetts]].,<ref name="NewGA" /> and a promise of further support from the Women's American Baptist [[American Baptist Home Mission Society|Home Missionary Society]] (WABHMS), a group with which they were both affiliated in Boston.<ref name="Lefever, Harry G. 2005 pp. 60-63" />  Although their first students were mostly illiterate, they envisioned their school to be a liberal arts institution – the first circular of the college stated that they planned to offer "algebra, physiology, essays, Latin, rhetoric, geometry, political economy, mental philosophy (psychology), chemistry, botany, Constitution  of  the United  States, astronomy, zoology, geology, moral philosophy, and evidences  of Christianity".<ref name="Lefever, Harry G. 2005 pp. 60-63" />  Over time, they attracted more students; by the time the first term ended, they had enrolled 80 students in the seminary.<ref name="Lefever, Harry G. 2005 pp. 60-63" />  The WABHMS made a down payment on a nine-acre (36,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) site in Atlanta relatively close to the church they began in, which originally had five buildings left from a Union Civil War encampment, to support classroom and residence hall needs.<ref name="britannica.com">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437886/Sophia-B-Packard?anchor=ref669898 "Sophia B. Packard"], Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref>

In 1882 the two women returned to Massachusetts to bid for more money and were introduced to wealthy [[American Baptist Churches USA|Northern Baptist]] businessman [[John D. Rockefeller]] at a church conference in Ohio.<ref name="NewGA" />  Rockefeller was impressed by Packard's vision.  In April 1884, Rockefeller visited the school.  By this time, the seminary had 600 students and 16 faculty members.  It was surviving on generous donations by the black community in Atlanta, the efforts of volunteer teachers, and gifts of supplies; many Atlanta black churches, philanthropists, and black community groups raised and donated money to settle the debt on the property that had been acquired.<ref name="Lefever, Harry G. 2005 pp. 60-63" /> Rockefeller was so impressed that he settled the debt on the property.<ref name="britannica.com" />  Rockefeller's wife, [[Laura Spelman]] Rockefeller;<ref name="NewGA" /> her sister, Lucy Spelman; and their parents, Harvey Buel and Lucy Henry Spelman, were also supportive of the school.  The Spelmans were longtime activists in the abolitionist movement.  In 1884 the name of the school was changed to the ''Spelman Seminary'' in honor of Laura Spelman and her parents. Rockefeller also donated the funds for what is currently the oldest building on campus, Rockefeller Hall, which was constructed in 1886.

Packard was appointed as Spelman's first president in 1888, after the charter for the seminary was granted. Packard died in 1891, and Giles assumed the presidency until her death in 1909.

=== Growth ===
[[File:Spelman College gates.jpg|thumb|right|Spelman College gates]]
The years 1910 to 1953 saw great growth and transition for the seminary.<ref name="SChistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.spelman.edu/academics/catalog/catalog2007/collegehistory.html|title=College History|website=Spelman.edu|publisher=Spelman College|accessdate=July 2, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925124412/http://www.spelman.edu/academics/catalog/catalog2007/collegehistory.html|archivedate=September 25, 2008}}</ref> Upon Giles' death, Lucy Hale Tapley became president. Although the college was a stride in and of itself, at the time, neither the founders nor the current administration had interest in challenging the status quo of young women as primarily responsible for the family and the home.<ref name="Lefever, Harry G. 2005 pp. 60-63" /> Tapley declared: "Any course of study which fails to cultivate a taste and fitness for practical and efficient work in some part of the field of the world's needs is unpopular at Spelman and finds no place in our curriculum." <ref name="SChistory" /> The nursing curriculum was strengthened; a teachers' dormitory and a home economics building were constructed, and Tapley Hall, the science building, was completed in 1925.<ref name="SChistory" /> The Granddaughters' Club, a club for students whose mothers and aunts had attended Spelman was also created, and this club is still in existence today.

In September 1924, Spelman Baptist Seminary officially became ''Spelman College''. Florence Matilda Read assumed the presidency in 1927. Shortly thereafter, Spelman entered into an "agreement of affiliation" with nearby [[Morehouse College]] and [[Clark Atlanta University|Atlanta University]] by chartering the Atlanta University Center in 1929.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org">{{cite web|first1=Taronda|last1=Spencer|title=Spelman College|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1460|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|date=1 February 2004}}</ref> Atlanta University was to provide graduate education for students, whereas Morehouse and Spelman were responsible for the undergraduate education. At a time during which black students were often denied access to graduate studies at predominantly white southern research universities, access to Atlanta University allowed the undergraduate students at Morehouse and Spelman immediate access to graduate training.

In 1927, one of the most important buildings on campus, Sisters Chapel, was dedicated. The chapel was named for its primary benefactors, sisters Laura Spelman Rockefeller and Lucy Maria Spelman. The college had also begun to see an improvement in extracurricular investment in the arts, with the organization of the Spelman College Glee Club in 1925,<ref>{{cite web|title=Spelman College Glee Club|url=http://www.spelman.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/music/ensembles/glee-club|website=Spelman.edu|publisher=Spelman College|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> inauguration of the much-loved Atlanta tradition of the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol Concert and smaller events such as the spring orchestra and chorus concert, the Atlanta University Summer Theater, and the University Players, a drama organization for AUC students. The school also began to see more of a focus on collegiate education, as it discontinued its elementary and high school divisions. In 1930 the Spelman Nursery School was created as a training center for mothers and a practice arena for students who planned careers in education and child development. Spelman celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 1931. This milestone as accompanied by the construction of a university library that was shared amongst the Atlanta University Center institutions, and the center continues to share a library to this day.

[[File:SpelmanCollegeSign.jpg|thumb|right|Spelman College sign outside campus gates]]
The school continued to expand, building and acquiring more property to accommodate the growing student body. IN 1947, Spelman joined the list of "approved institutions" of the [[Association of American Universities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spelman.edu/about-us/about-spelman/history-in-brief|title=History in Brief|website=Spelman.edu|publisher=Spelman College}}</ref> In 1953, Florence Read retired, and Albert E. Manley became the first black and first male president of college. Under his presidency and the presidency of his successor, Donald Stewart, Spelman saw significant growth. The college established its study abroad program, the Merrill Foreign Travel-Study Program.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org" /> Stewart's administration tripled the college's endowment and oversaw the establishment of the Comprehensive Writing Program, an across-the-curriculum writing program that requires students to submit portfolios of their written work; the Ethel Waddell Githii College Honors Program; and the Women's Research and Resource Center.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org" /> In 1958, the college received accreditation from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].

=== Civil rights involvement ===
Going into the 1960s, the Spelman College students became involved in the heated civil rights actions going on in Atlanta. In 1962, the first Spelman students were arrested for participating in sit-ins in the Atlanta community.  Noted American historian [[Howard Zinn]] was a professor of history at Spelman during this era, and served as an adviser to the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] chapter at the college.  Zinn mentored many of Spelman's students fighting for civil rights at the time, including [[Alice Walker]] and [[Marian Wright Edelman]]<ref>Alice Walker remembers Howard Zinn, in the ''Boston Globe'', January 31, 2010.</ref>  Zinn was dismissed from the college in 1963 for supporting Spelman students in their efforts to fight segregation; at the time, Spelman was focused on turning out "refined young ladies."  Edelman herself writes that Spelman had a reputation as "a tea-pouring, very strict school designed to turn black girls into refined ladies and teachers."<ref>Edelman, Marian Wright (2000), "Spelman College: A Safe Haven for a Young Black Woman". ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', No. 27, pp. 118-123.</ref>

=== 1980–present ===
Stewart retired in 1986, and the following year, Johnnetta Betsch Cole became the first black female president of Spelman College.  During this time, the college became noted for its commitment to community service and its ties to the local community.  Cole also led the college's most successful capital campaign; between 1986 and 1996, the college raised $113.8&nbsp;million, including a $20&nbsp;million gift from [[Bill Cosby]] and his wife, [[Camille Cosby|Camille Hanks Cosby]], whose daughter graduated from Spelman.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org" /> In honor of this gift, the Cosby Academic Center was constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spelman.edu/about-us/visit-us/campus-map|title=Campus Map – Spelman College|website=Spelman.edu|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> In July 2015 the remainder of the funds were returned and an endowed professorship named for the Cosby couple discontinued as [[Bill Cosby molestation allegations|allegations of sexual assault]] by Bill Cosby grew more prominent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33667040 |title=Atlanta's Spelman College ends Bill Cosby professorship |publisher=BBC |date=July 25, 2015 |accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/07/27/spelman-discontinues-cosby-professorship |title=Spelman Discontinues Cosby Professorship |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=July 27, 2015 |accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>

In 1997, Cole stepped down and Audrey Forbes Manley became Spelman's first alumna president.  After her retirement, in 2002, Beverly Daniel Tatum, the college's president until 2015, took the post. The campus now comprises 26 buildings on {{convert|39|acre|m2}} in Atlanta.<ref name=fb />

In 2011, [[First Lady Michelle Obama]] served as the keynote commencement speaker.<ref name="ajc.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/spelman-left-spellbound-by-michelle-obama/nQtWr/|title=Spelman left spellbound by Michelle Obama|website=Ajc.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Oprah Winfrey]] served as the keynote commencement speaker.<ref name="ajc.com" />

In 2015, Spelman opened the Wellness Center at Reed Hall, a state-of-the-art recreation center. It is host to a multitude of services from an indoor track and cycling room to a teaching kitchen and a multitude of fitness and wellness programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carterusa.com/projects/spelman-college-read-hall-wellness-center|title=Spelman College Read Hall Wellness Center|website=www.carterusa.com}}</ref>

In 2018, Spelman received $30&nbsp;million from Spelman trustee [[Ronda Stryker]] for the construction of a new state-of-the-art building on campus.  Stryker's gift is the third largest single donation from a living donor to a [[HBCU]] and second largest in Spelman history.<ref>{{cite web|date=December 2018|url=https://www.spelman.edu/about-us/news-and-events/news-releases/2018/12/13/spelman-receives-30-million-gift-from-ronda-stryker-and-william-johnston|title=Spelman College Receives $30 Million Gift From Trustee Ronda Stryker and Spouse, William Johnston, to Support New Center for Innovation & the Arts|website=www.Spelman.edu|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/05/morehouse-commencement-speaker-robert-smith-loan-debt/589792/|title=What Happens When a Billionaire Swoops In to Solve the Student-Debt Crisis|first=Adam|last=Harris|date=May 19, 2019|website=The Atlantic|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref>

In June 2020, philanthropists [[Reed Hastings]] and his wife Patty Quillin donated $40&nbsp;million to Spelman College to be used as scholarship funds for students enrolled at Spelman.
