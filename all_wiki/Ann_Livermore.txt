==Life and career==

===Early life===
Livermore was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. She was the valedictorian at her North Carolina high school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/11/06women_Ann-Livermore_AMOV.html|title=#19 Ann Livermore - Forbes.com|date=2006-08-31|website=www.forbes.com|access-date=2017-09-23}}</ref> She holds a [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where she was a [[Morehead Scholar]], as well as an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Stanford University]].<ref name="GSB">{{cite web |title=Ann Livermore, MBA '82 |url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/alumni/contact/alumni-association/about-alumni/ann-livermore |website=Stanford Graduate School of Business |accessdate=17 July 2020}}</ref>

===Hewlett-Packard===
Livermore came to HP right out of graduate school. Livermore has been at HP since 1982 and has worked in a variety of sales, marketing, and research and development jobs before being elected a [[Vice president|corporate vice president]] in 1995.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=178110&privcapId=238570|title=Ann M. Livermore: Executive Profile & Biography|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-09-23}}</ref>

In 1997, Livermore was elected to the [[board of directors]] of [[United Parcel Service]].<ref name=":0" />

In 1998, when head of HP's software and services business, the company's top executives agreed to put themselves through a [[360-degree feedback|360-degree evaluation]]. Livermore observed: <blockquote>"I learned that I'm a very, very well-controlled executive, but that my employees like when I go off the handle every once in a while, you know, show my human side - It reinforced that leadership means touching people's hearts as well as their brains, so since then I haven't worried so much about keeping my lid on."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}</blockquote>

Livermore has been credited with steering HP away from its decentralized culture and hardware mentality and was the brains behind HP's E-services strategy.<ref>{{cite news | date=2000-10-09 | url=http://www.informationweek.com/807/livermore.htm | title=Women In Technology | publisher=informationweek.com | accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> When HP CEO [[Lewis E. Platt|Lewis Platt]] announced in March 1999 that he would step down, Livermore confirmed that she wanted the job.  Insiders say Livermore was the only internal candidate who made the short list, but, in July 1999, HP made the former [[Alcatel-Lucent|Lucent Technologies]] executive [[Carly Fiorina]] the first female CEO of a [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow 30 company]].<ref>{{cite news | date=1999-08-30 | url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_35/b3644121.htm | title=Is Ann Livermore the Hottest Property in the Valley? | work=forbes.com | accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref>

Since 2004, Livermore has led HP's Technology Solutions Group (renamed [[HP Enterprise Business]] in 2009), a US$30 billion-plus business that encompasses storage and servers, software and services. The products and services from this organization serve HP's business customers of all sizes in more than 170 countries. Once thought of as a costly distraction, this group is now seen as a source of future growth. Livermore's name was mentioned as a possible candidate to take over at HP when [[Carly Fiorina]] was ousted in February 2005 as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]. [[Mark V. Hurd|Mark Hurd]] from [[NCR Corporation|NCR Corp.]] was instead picked to be HP's new CEO.<ref>{{cite news|date=2005-04-14 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/management/story/0,10801,101080,00.html |title=Q&A: HP's Ann Livermore on life after Carly |publisher=computerworld.com |accessdate=2008-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715170215/http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/management/story/0%2C10801%2C101080%2C00.html |archivedate=July 15, 2006 }} </ref>

In the wake of HP pressuring employees to accept a 5% pay cut, it was revealed that Livermore's 2008 total compensation amounted to $20,551,493.  In the same year, Mark Hurd as CEO reported his compensation to be $42,514,524.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/hps-hurd-brings-in-42-5-million-4-other-top-execs-top-20-million/|title=HP's Hurd brings in $42.5 million; 4 other top execs top $20 million|author=Larry Dignan|publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date =  January 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/07/29/237082/Pay-cuts-barely-touch-HP-executives.htm|title=Pay cuts barely touch HP executives|author=Karl Flinders|date=28 July 2009|work=[[Computer Weekly]]|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>

On May 13, 2008, Hewlett-Packard Co. confirmed that it had reached a deal with Electronic Data Systems to acquire the company for $13.9 Billion. The deal was completed on August 26, 2008. EDS became an HP business unit and was renamed EDS, an HP company. Ronald A. Rittenmeyer remained at the helm, reporting to Ann Livermore until his retirement.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

With Mark Hurd's August 2010 departure, Livermore was once again a possible candidate for the top job however lost out to former [[SAP AG|SAP]] CEO, [[LÃ©o Apotheker]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2012/05/08/how-hewlett-packard-lost-its-way/|title=How Hewlett-Packard lost its way|last1=Bandler|first1=James|date=May 8, 2012|access-date=2017-09-23|last2=Burke|first2=Doris|language=en-US}}</ref>

Livermore was named in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' annual ranking of America's leading businesswomen.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0709/gallery.women_mostpowerful.fortune/13.html | title=50 Most Powerful Women in 2007 | publisher=money.cnn.com | accessdate=2008-01-24 | first1=Katie | last1=Benner | first2=Eugenia | last2=Levenson | first3=Rupali | last3=Arora| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071224104418/https://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0709/gallery.women_mostpowerful.fortune/13.html| archivedate= 24 December 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | date=2007-08-30 | url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/11/biz-07women_Ann-Livermore_AMOV.html | title=The World's 100 Most Powerful Women | work=forbes.com | accessdate=2008-01-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219111040/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/11/biz-07women_Ann-Livermore_AMOV.html| archivedate= 2008-02-19 | url-status= live}}</ref> As of 2011, her business unit was $60 billion which was half of total HP revenues and encompassed two-thirds of total HP staff.<ref name="informationweek1"/>

On June 14, 2011, Livermore was replaced as head of HP Enterprises, as her top lieutenants, Dave Donatelli, software head Bill Veghte, and global sales leader Jan Zadak, were to report directly to the CEO. She was reportedly forced out since total services revenue had grown just 1% in the most recent fiscal year, despite the earlier acquisition of EDS in 2008.<ref name="informationweek1"/>

In 2005 Livermore had a [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] for an undisclosed ailment.<ref>{{cite news | date=2005-11-01 | url=http://www.careerjournal.com/reports/specialwomen/20051101-inlinetolead.html | title= The Top Women In Line to Lead | publisher=careerjournal.com | accessdate=2008-01-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110053446/http://www.careerjournal.com/reports/specialwomen/20051101-inlinetolead.html| archivedate= 10 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>
