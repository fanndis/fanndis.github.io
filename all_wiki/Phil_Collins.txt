'''Philip David Charles Collins''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|LVO}} (born 30 January 1951) is an English drummer, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actor, best known as the drummer/singer of the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and for his solo career. Between 1982 and 1990, Collins scored three UK and seven US number-one singles in his solo career. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, he had more US Top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s.<ref name="Top">{{cite news|first=John|last=Anderson|title=Pop Notes|work=Newsday|location=New York|date=7 January 1990}}</ref> His most successful singles from the period include "[[In the Air Tonight]]", "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]", "[[One More Night (Phil Collins song)|One More Night]]", "[[Sussudio]]", "[[Two Hearts (Phil Collins song)|Two Hearts]]", "[[A Groovy Kind of Love#Phil Collins version|A Groovy Kind of Love]]" (featured in the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]''), "[[I Wish It Would Rain Down]]", and "[[Another Day in Paradise]]".

Born and raised in west London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of [[Peter Gabriel]]. Collins began a solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of [[soul music]], releasing a series of successful albums, including ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981), ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985), and ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989). Collins became "one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond".<ref name="Phil Collins Allmusic">{{cite web | url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/phil-collins-mn0000337119/biography | title= Phil Collins Biography | website=Allmusic | access-date=16 April 2014}}</ref><ref>GRO Register of Births MAR 1951 5e 137 EALING – Philip D.

Collins was given a toy drum kit for Christmas when he was five. His uncle later made him a makeshift set that he used regularly. As Collins grew older, these were followed by more complete sets bought by his parents.<ref>Coleman, Ray. ''Phil Collins: The Definitive Biography'', Simon & Schuster. London. 1997. pp. 29–30. {{ISBN|0-684-81784-5}}</ref> He practised by playing along to music on the television and radio.<ref name=":0">''Classic Albums: Face Value'' DVD, Eagle Home Entertainment, 2001.</ref> According to Barbara Speake, founder of the stage school Collins later attended, "Phil was always special; aged five he entered a [[Butlins]] talent contest singing [[The Ballad of Davy Crockett|Davy Crockett]], but he stopped the orchestra halfway through to tell them they were in the wrong key."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/10/children-growing-talent-show |title=Think your child has a future in showbiz?

Collins recalled: "Rudiments I found very, very helpful – much more helpful than anything else because they're used all the time. In any kind of funk or jazz drumming, the rudiments are always there."<ref name="Modern Drummer 1979">Alexander, Susan. "Phil Collins On the Move". ''[[Modern Drummer]]''. March/April 1979.

I should have stuck with it. I've always felt that if I could hum it, I could play it. For me, that was good enough, but that attitude is bad."<ref name="Modern Drummer 1979" />

Despite the beginnings of an acting career, Collins never intended to pursue it professionally and gravitated towards music which his father was less enthusiastic about.<ref name=TT10/> In 1969, he performed in [[John Walker (musician)|John Walker]]'s backing band for a European tour, which also consisted of [[Ronnie Caryl]] and Gordon Smith on guitar and [[Brian Chatton]] on keyboards.

===1970–1978: Joining Genesis, becoming lead singer, and Brand X===
In mid-1970, the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] had decided to become a full time band and following the departures of drummer [[John Mayhew (musician)|John Mayhew]] and guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]], advertised for a drummer "sensitive to acoustic music" and a "12-string acoustic guitarist".<ref>Coleman, p. 61.</ref><ref name="billbio">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=genesis|bio=true}} "Genesis" Biography], ''Billboard''.

The audition took place at the home of the parents of singer [[Peter Gabriel]] in [[Chobham]], [[Surrey]]. They arrived early; Collins took a swim in the pool and memorised the pieces before his audition.<ref>Coleman, p. 63.</ref> He recalled: "They put on ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'', and my initial impression was of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies, and I came away thinking [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]]."<ref name="Dodd">Banks, Tony; Collins, Phil; Gabriel, Peter; Hackett, Steve; Rutherford, Mike (2007).

From 1970 to 1975, Collins played drums and percussion, and sang (largely backing) vocals on Genesis albums and in their live shows. His first album recorded with the band, ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'', was recorded and released in 1971. "For Absent Friends", an acoustic track written by Collins and Hackett, is the first Genesis song with Collins on lead vocals.<ref name="Will Romano">Will Romano ''Mountains Come Out of the Sky: The Illustrated History of Prog Rock'', Backbeat Books, 2010.</ref> He sang "More Fool Me" on their 1973 album ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]''.<ref name="Selling England by the Pound">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/selling-england-by-the-pound-mw0000189986|title=Selling England by the Pound|website=AllMusic|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|access-date=27 July 2015}}</ref> In 1973, he and Hackett were among the musicians that performed on the solo debut of ex-[[Yes (band)|Yes]] guitarist [[Peter Banks]]. In 1974, during the recording of ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', Collins played drums on [[Brian Eno]]'s second album ''[[Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)]]'' after Eno had contributed electronic effects known as "Enossification" on "In the Cage" and "Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging".<ref name="Thompson117">Thompson, 2004. p. 117</ref>

''[[Wind & Wuthering]]'' was the last Genesis album recorded with Hackett before he left the group in 1977. Bruford was replaced by [[Chester Thompson]], who has since been a mainstay of Genesis' live lineup as well as of Collins' solo backing band. In 1977, Collins, Banks, and Rutherford decided to continue Genesis as a trio. As the decade closed, Genesis began to shift from their [[progressive rock]] roots to a more radio-friendly pop rock sound.

Collins's second solo album, ''[[Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)|Hello, I Must Be Going!]]'', was released in November 1982.

In February 1984, Collins released "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)|Against All Odds]]", the main theme for the [[Against All Odds (1984 film)|film of the same title]]. The song was produced by [[Arif Mardin]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Ed |title=Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/against-all-odds-take-a-look-at-me-now-t2760660|website=Allmusic |access-date=3 September 2011}}</ref> and is one of the few songs released by Collins that he did not co-produce himself. The single, more pop-orientated and commercially accessible than Collins's previous work, became his first solo single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reached number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and earned him the [[27th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance#Recipients|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]].<ref name="USCharts" />

In 1984, Collins contributed to the production on ''[[Chinese Wall (album)|Chinese Wall]]'', the third solo album from [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] vocalist [[Philip Bailey]], which included a duet from the two musicians, "[[Easy Lover]]". The song went to No. 1 in the UK the following year.<ref name="Charts" /><ref>{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/chinese-wall-mw0000189127|title=Chinese Wall – Philip Bailey &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|access-date=29 October 2015}}</ref> He also produced and played drums on several tracks on ''[[Behind the Sun (Eric Clapton album)|Behind the Sun]]'' by [[Eric Clapton]], which was released in March the following year. In November, Collins was part of the charity supergroup [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] in aid of Ethiopian famine relief and played drums on its single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", which was recorded at [[Sarm West Studios]] in Notting Hill, London.<ref>{{cite web|author=mtv |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1643506/looking-back-at-live-aid-25-years-later.jhtml |title=Looking Back At Live Aid, 25 Years Later |publisher=MTV |date=12 July 2010 |access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Band Aid sales top 3m – proceeds set to reach Ethiopia by summer|periodical=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Spotlight Publications|location=London|page=3|date=12 January 1985}}</ref>

Collins arranged his touring schedule in early 1985 to accommodate the possibility of appearing at the [[57th Academy Awards#Awards|Academy Awards]] in case "Against All Odds" was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1980s|Best Original Song]]. Not aware of his prominence as a musical performer, a note to Collins's label from telecast co-producer [[Larry Gelbart]] explaining the lack of invitation stated: "Thank you for your note regarding Phil Cooper [sic]. I'm afraid the spots have already been filled." Collins instead watched actress and dancer [[Ann Reinking]] perform his song.<ref>Bronson, p. 586.</ref> Reinking's performance was described by one critic as an "absurdly inept rendition" of the song.<ref name="Wolmuth">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091234,00.html|title=Short, Pudgy and Bald, All Phil Collins Produces Is Hits|work=People|first=Roger|last=Wolmuth|date=8 July 1985|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said: "Reinking did an incredible job of totally destroying a beautiful song.

Collins released his most successful album, the Diamond-certified ''[[No Jacket Required]]'', in February 1985. It reached No. 1 in both the UK and the US.<ref name="Charts" /> It contained the US number-one hits "[[One More Night (Phil Collins song)|One More Night]]" and "[[Sussudio]]" as well top ten hits "[[Don't Lose My Number]]" and "[[Take Me Home (Phil Collins song)|Take Me Home]]". It also contains the lesser known "Who Said I Would", and "Only You Know and I Know". The album featured contributions from [[the Police]]'s vocalist, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], ex-bandmate [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Helen Terry]] as backing vocalists.

The music press noted Collins's astronomical success as a solo artist had made him more popular than Genesis.<ref name=odds /> Before the release of ''No Jacket Required'', Collins insisted that he would not leave the band. "The next one to leave the band will finish it," Collins told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in May 1985. "I feel happier with what we're doing now, because I feel it's closer to me. I won't be the one." Collins added, "Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes.

In October 1985, Collins reunited with Banks and Rutherford to record the next Genesis album, ''[[Invisible Touch]]''. Its [[Invisible Touch (song)|title track]] was released as a single and reached No. 1 in the US, the only Genesis song to do so.

Reviews of ''Invisible Touch'' were mixed and many comparisons were made with Collins's solo work, but ''Rolling Stone'''s [[J. D.

Collins's first film role since embarking on his music career came in 1988 with the British romantic comedy drama-crime film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]''. He starred as [[Buster Edwards]], a criminal convicted for his role in the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]].

His slow [[ballad]] rendition of "[[A Groovy Kind of Love#Phil Collins version|A Groovy Kind of Love]]", originally by [[the Mindbenders]], became his only single to reach No. 1 in the UK and the US. The film also spawned the hit single "[[Two Hearts (Phil Collins song)|Two Hearts]]", which he co-wrote with [[Lamont Dozier]]; the two artists won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song#1980s|Golden Globe for Best Original Song]] and receive an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1980s|Oscar]] nomination in the same category. "Big Noise" and "[[Loco in Acapulco]]" were also by Collins and Dozier, the vocals for the latter were performed by [[the Four Tops]].

Upon its release in October 1989, it went to No. 1 in the US to become the final number one single there of the 1980s. Despite its success, the song was also heavily criticised and became linked to allegations of hypocrisy made against Collins.<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|author-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|date=14 September 2007|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music: Concise (5th ed.)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&q=%22the+widely+criticised+another+day+in+paradise%22&pg=PA2006-IA1345|publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]]|isbn=978-1-84609-856-7|access-date=21 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="wilson" /> Responding to criticism of the song, Collins stated: "When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees.

In 1991, Collins reconvened with Banks and Rutherford to write and record a new Genesis album, ''[[We Can't Dance]]''. It became the band's fifth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK and reached No. 4 in the US, where it sold over 4 million copies. It features the singles "[[Jesus He Knows Me]]", "[[I Can't Dance]]", "[[No Son of Mine]]", and "[[Hold on My Heart]]". Collins performed on their 1992 tour.

Collins worked on his fifth studio album, ''[[Both Sides]]'', in 1992 and 1993. It marked a departure from his more polished and up-tempo songs on recent albums to material more experimental in nature, with Collins performing all the instruments and producing the record himself, because the songs written "were becoming so personal, so private, I didn't want anyone else's input". The decline of his second marriage was a focal point of the album.<ref>Coleman, p. 181.</ref> Released in November 1993, ''Both Sides'' reached No. 1 in eight countries, including the UK, and No. 13 in the US. It marked a drop in sales in the latter when compared to his previous records, only reaching a single platinum certification by the end of the year. Its two biggest singles were "[[Both Sides of the Story]]" and "[[Everyday (Phil Collins song)|Everyday]]". The [[Both Sides of the World Tour]] saw Collins perform 165 shows across four legs between April 1994 and May 1995. Collins turned down the chance to contribute to ''[[Tower of Song]]'', an album of covers of [[Leonard Cohen]] songs, due to his touring commitments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/17/2|title=Who held a gun to Leonard Cohen's head?|last=de Lisle|first=Tim|date=17 September 2004|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=7 April 2016}}</ref> Collins left Genesis in March 1996 to focus on his solo career.<ref name="Hewitt official UK site bio" />

[[File:Phil Collins.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Collins performing with his big band in 1996]]
In the months surrounding his departure from Genesis, Collins formed the [[Phil Collins Big Band]], seating himself on the drums. He had wanted to undertake the project for some time and felt inspired from the ''[[Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich|Burning for Buddy]]'' project that drummer [[Neil Peart]] had put together. Having moved to Switzerland, an invitation to perform at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] led to the band to come together, which featured [[Quincy Jones]] as conductor and [[Tony Bennett]] on vocals.<ref name=R97>{{cite magazine|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/rhythm-september-1997-phil-collins-feature/|title=All the World's a Stage|first=Heinz|last=Kronberger|date=September 1997|magazine=Rhythm|access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> The group toured summer jazz festivals in July 1996 with a set of jazz renditions of Genesis and Collins' solo material. Their first date was at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for a [[Prince's Trust]] concert with Queen Elizabeth II and [[Nelson Mandela]] in attendance. To learn his parts, Collins devised his own notation on sheets.<ref name=R97/> The band then went on hiatus until a US and European tour in the summer of 1998, which spawned the live album ''[[A Hot Night in Paris]]''.

In October 1996, Collins released his sixth solo album, ''[[Dance into the Light]]''. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 23 in the US. The album was received negatively by the music press and sold less than his previous albums. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewed by saying that "even Phil Collins must know that we all grew weary of Phil Collins".<ref>{{cite news|author=Browne, David|date=1 November 1996|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294844,00.html |title=''Dance into the Light'' Review |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=30 September 2013}}</ref> Singles from the album included "[[Dance into the Light (song)|Dance into the Light]]", which reached No. 9 in the UK, and the Beatles-inspired "[[It's in Your Eyes]]".<ref name="Charts" /> The album achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]] in the US.

In his book on the "legends" who defined progressive rock drumming, American drummer Rich Lackowski wrote: "Phil Collins's grooves in early Genesis recordings paved the way for many talented drummers to come.

Collins's music is featured in the [[Satire|satirical]] [[black comedy]] film ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', with psychotic lead character [[Patrick Bateman]] (played by [[Christian Bale]]) portrayed as an obsessive fan who reads deep meaning into his work, especially with Genesis, while describing his solo music as "...more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way." Bateman delivers a monologue praising Collins and Genesis during a sequence in which he engages the services of two prostitutes while playing "[[In Too Deep (Genesis song)|In Too Deep]]" and "[[Sussudio]]". Collins told ''The New Musical Express'': “I don’t think him being a psychopath and liking my music is linked – my music was just omnipresent in that era."<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/phil-collins-shares-thoughts-musics-role-american-psycho-1652940 “Phil Collins shares thoughts on his music’s role in ‘American Psycho’ “].

In 2001, Collins was one of several celebrities who were tricked into appearing in a controversial British comedy series, ''[[Brass Eye]]'', shown on public service broadcaster [[Channel 4]]. In the episode, Collins endorsed a hoax anti-[[Pedophilia|paedophile]] campaign wearing a [[T-shirt]] with the words "Nonce Sense" and warned children against speaking to suspicious people. Collins was reported by the BBC to have consulted lawyers regarding the programme, which was originally pulled from broadcast but eventually rescheduled. Collins said he had taken part in the programme "in good faith for the public benefit", believing it to be "a public service programme that would be going around schools and colleges in a bid to stem child abduction and abuse". Collins also accused the makers of the programme of "some serious taste problems" and warned it would prevent celebrities from supporting "public spirited causes" in the future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1445870.stm|title=Star consults lawyers over TV spoof|work=BBC News|date=18 July 2001|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref>

Collins appeared as himself in the 2006 [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]''.

The disgrace of a career bogged entirely in the determined dross of ''No Jacket Required'' however is simply not justified, regardless of how Collins gained either his fortune, or his public image."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04335-phil-collins-genesis-brian-eno-john-lydon-peter-gabriel|title=No Flak Jacket Required: In Defence Of Phil Collins|last=Mills|first=Gary|date=26 May 2010|website=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=23 July 2014}}</ref> David Sheppard wrote for the BBC in 2010: "Granted, Collins has sometimes been guilty of painting the bull's-eye on his own forehead (that self-aggrandising Live Aid Concorde business, the cringe-worthy lyrics to 'Another Day in Paradise', ''Buster'', etc.), but nonetheless, the sometime Genesis frontman's canon is so substantial and his hits so profuse that it feels myopic to dismiss him merely as a haughty purveyor of tortured, romantic ballads for the middle income world."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/m9nv|title=Phil Collins Going Back Review|publisher=BBC|first=David|last=Sheppard|access-date=19 July 2015}}</ref>

''Rolling Stone'' journalist Erik Hedegaard expressed disapproval of the widespread criticism which Collins has received, suggesting that he has been "unfairly and inexplicably vilified".<ref name="hedegaard" /> Martin C. Strong stated in 2011 that "the enigmatic and amiable Phil Collins has had his fair share of mockers and critics over the years, although one thing is sure, and that is his dexterity and undeniable talent".<ref name="strong" /> In a piece the following year, titled "10 Much-Mocked Artists It's Time We Forgave", ''New Musical Express'' critic Anna Conrad said Collins had been portrayed as a "villain", and wrote: "Was the bile really justified?&nbsp;... come on, admit it.

===Court case===
{{Main|Philip Collins Ltd v Davis}}
On 29 March 2000, Collins launched a case against two former musicians from his band to recoup £500,000 in royalties that were overpaid. [[Louis Satterfield]], 62, and Rahmlee Davis, 51, claimed their contract entitled them to 0.5 per cent of the royalties from ''[[Serious Hits... Live!]]'', a live album recorded during Collins's [[Seriously, Live! World Tour]] in 1990. Their claim was they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/phil-collins-sues-backing-band-to-reclaim-overpaid-royalties-723775.html|title=Phil Collins sues backing band to reclaim 'overpaid' royalties'|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Kate|last=Watson-Smyth|date=30 March 2000|access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> On 19 April 2000, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins. The amount that Collins was seeking was halved, and Satterfield and Davis (who originally brought the suit forward in California) would not have to repay any of it. The judge agreed with Collins' argument that Satterfield and Davis should have been paid for only the five tracks on which they performed, including the hit "[[Sussudio]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/phil-collins-wins-claim-he-overpaid-musicians-721046.html|title=Phil Collins wins claim he overpaid musicians|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Kate|last=Watson-Smyth|date=20 April 2000|access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>

===Health===
In 2000, Collins developed sudden hearing loss in his left ear, following a recording session in Los Angeles. He consulted three doctors, who told him that there was nothing they could do and that the chance of a full recovery was slim. Two years later, he had recovered most of his hearing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genesisfan.net/phil-collins/phil-collins-archive/phil-collins-comes-clean-on-hearing-loss-scare|title=Phil Collins comes clean on hearing-loss scare|date=19 September 2002|work=Launch|first=Darryl|last=Morden|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> Collins later found that it was caused by a viral infection, and that it resolved after treatment.<ref name=PC />

In April 2009, Collins had surgery to repair dislocated vertebrae in his upper neck, which arose while drumming on the 2007 Genesis tour.

Collins has often been mentioned erroneously in the British media as being a supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and an opponent of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref name="Guardian2007" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2012/03/rock-music-britain-nme|title=Why are there so few right-wing rock stars?|work=New Statesman|first=Pat|last=Long|date=8 March 2012|access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref> This derives from the famous article in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', printed on the day of the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 UK general election]], titled "[[It's The Sun Wot Won It|If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights]]", which stated that Collins was among several celebrities who were planning to leave Britain in the event of a Labour victory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/833416.stm|title=Music's millionaires club honoured|work=BBC News|date=14 July 2000|access-date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="Archie Bland Independent 2012">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/archie-bland-forget-music--financial-wars-are-the-route-to-power-6297738.html|title=Archie Bland: Forget music – financial wars are the route to power|work=The Independent|first=Archie|last=Bland|date=1 February 2012|access-date=5 October 2013|location=London}}</ref>

He said of Gallagher: "I don't care if he likes my music or not. I do care if he starts telling people I'm a wanker because of my politics.

Questioned about his politics by [[Mark Lawson]] in an interview for the BBC, broadcast in 2009, Collins said: "My father was Conservative but it wasn't quite the same, I don't think, when he was alive. Politics never loomed large in our family anyway. I think the politics of the country were very different then."<ref name="Mark Lawson talks to...
