The '''''Algemeiner Journal''''', known informally as '''''The Algemeiner''''', is a newspaper based in [[New York City]] which covers American and international Jewish and Israel-related news. 

== History ==

In 1972, [[Gershon Jacobson]] founded the [[Yiddish]]-language ''Der Algemeiner Journal'', after consulting the Lubavitcher Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]].<ref name="tziviajacobson">Tzivia Jacobson, [http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3105536/jewish/The-Rebbes-Advice-on-Opening-a-Yiddish-Newspaper.htm "The Rebbe’s Advice on Opening a Yiddish Newspaper,"] ''Chabad.org'', December2014, January 2015.</ref> Jacobson served as editor and publisher from its inception until he died in 2005.<ref name="fox">{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/nyregion/02jacobson.html|title=Gershon Jacobson, 70, Founder and Editor of Yiddish Journal, Is Dead|work=The New York Times|date=June 2, 2005|access-date=July 23, 2020}}</ref>

The inaugural issue was published by Der Algemeiner Journal Corporation on February 23, 1972. The ten-page paper was priced at 25 cents. Twenty thousand issues were printed.<ref>[http://archive.jta.org/article/1972/02/25/2960397/new-yiddish-weekly-launched "New Yiddish Weekly Launched,"] [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], February 24, 1972.</ref> ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' intended to fill the gap after the daily Yiddish paper [[Jewish Morning Journal|''Der Tog Morgen Zhurnal'']] closed in 1971.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/24/archives/a-new-yiddish-weekly-makes-its-appearance.html "A New Yiddish Weekly Makes Its Appearance"], ''The New York Times'', February 24, 1972.</ref> Jacobson had earlier written and served as its city editor.<ref name="forward1">[http://www.forward.com/articles/3587/ "Yiddish Journalist Gershon Jacobson, 71"], ''[[The Forward]]'', June 3, 2005.</ref> The largest-circulation Yiddish weekly in the United States,<ref name="forward1"/> ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' emphasized Jewish community news, with a politically independent viewpoint, including reporting on tensions between rival [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sects. Although Jacobson was a Lubavitcher Chasid,<ref name="chaimmiller">Chaim Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=z8MNBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=gershon+jacobson+lubavitcher+chasid&source=bl&ots=WZg3r6LB0K&sig=tJG0Cq4wDNoDYxVcbL4N1GAFpwM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_6ofpzsbPAhUIWj4KHdtRB3oQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&q=gershon%20jacobson%20lubavitcher%20chasid&f=false "Turning Judaism Outward: A biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, page 208"], ''Turning Judaism Outward: A biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe'', p.208, copyright 2014.</ref> according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', he "defied easy categorization."<ref name="fox"/> 

At its peak<!-- when? -->, ''Der Algemeiner''{{'}}s circulation had neared 100,000 copies. In 1989, in response to the increasing marginalization of the Yiddish language in the changing Jewish community, ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' began printing a four-page English supplement in the middle of the paper, attracting a more diverse Jewish audience.<ref>Elli Wohlgelernter, [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/15693/head-of-yiddish-paper-comes-from-a-different-school "Head of Yiddish paper comes ‘from a different school,’"] ''[[Jweekly]]'', May 18, 2001.</ref> 

''The Algemeiner''{{'}}s Advisory Board was chaired by [[Nobel laureate]], writer and activist [[Elie Wiesel]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=chiourim.com|title=Allgemeiner Journal : 40 ans au service de la communauté juive|url=https://www.chiourim.com/allgemeiner-journal-40-ans-au-service-de-la-communaute-juive6854-html/|access-date=2020-10-22|website=chiourim|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

In May 2005, after Gershon Jacobson died, his elder son, [[Simon Jacobson]], became the Publisher of ''Der Algemeiner Journal''. He founded the Gershon Jacobson Jewish Continuity Foundation (GJCF), a Jewish media organization with the mission to serve as a voice for Jews and Israel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gjcf.net/mission.html |title=GJCF mission statement |access-date=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121024451/http://www.gjcf.net/mission.html |archive-date=2012-01-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2008, he reconceived ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' as an English-language publication, replacing the Yiddish "Der" in its title for "The". That year, Dovid Efune became the Editor-In-Chief of what was called ''The Algemeiner'' and Director of the GJCF.

In 2011, the GJCF launched the website Algemeiner.com.
