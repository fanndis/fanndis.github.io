===State Bank of the Russian Empire===
[[File:Госбанк, СПб, ~1905.jpg|thumb|300px|GosBank headquarters in Saint Petersburg (1905)]]

The decision to create a State Bank of the Russian Empire was made by Emperor [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] in May 1762,<ref>{{cite journal|script-title=ru: Об учреждении Государственного банка|trans-title=On the establishment of the State Bank|url= http://www.nlr.ru/e-res/law_r/search.php?part=67&regim=3|edition= {{ill|Полное собрание законов Российской империи|ru}} с 1649 года |place= СПб.|publisher= Типография II отделения [[His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|Собственной Его Императорского Величества канцелярии]]|year= 1830|volume= XV, 1758—1762 , № 11550|pages= 1021–1023 |language=ru}}</ref> which was modeled on [[Bank of England]] and would have the right to issue bank notes. However, due to the coup on 28 June 1762 and the murder of the Czar, the project was not implemented. The outbreak in 1768 of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774)|Russian-Turkish War]] and [[budget deficit|deficit of the state budget]] forced [[Catherine II]], in turn, refer to the idea of issuing a paper money, and in December 1768 she formed the State Assignation Bank, which existed until 1818 and was replaced by the State Commercial Bank, but the first central banking body in Russia was established on {{OldStyleDate|12 June|1860|31 May}} as The State Bank (GosBank) of the Russian Empire ({{lang-ru|link=no|Государственный банк Российской Империи}}) which was formed on the base of the [[State Commercial Bank]] by ''[[ukaz]]'' of Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. This ukaz also ratified the statutes of the bank. According to the statutes, it was a state-owned bank, intended for short-term credit of trade and industry.

In early 1917 the bank had eleven branches, 133 permanent and five temporary offices and 42 agencies. On 7 November 1917 the Russian State Bank was disestablished and replaced by The People's Bank which existed until the establishment of the Soviet [[Gosbank]].

==Subsidiaries==
The Central Bank of Russia holds directly significant participatory interests in a number of Russian companies:
* [[Sberbank of Russia]] (50%+1 voting share of the stock);
*[[Moscow Exchange]] (11.779% of the stock);
* [[Russian National Reinsurance Company]] (100% of the stock);
* Trust company of the Banking Sector Consolidation Fund (100% of the stock);
* Rosincas (Russian Association of Cash-in-transit).
Additionally, the Bank of Russia held earlier interests in some other Russian organizations. In particular, after the liquidation of [[Gosbank]] (State Bank of the USSR), the CBR beneficially acquired complete or controlling interests in five so-called "Russian Foreign Banks" (until 1991 – "Soviet Foreign Banks"): 
* [[VTB Bank]] (99.99% of the stock – until 2002, now - 60.9% owned by The Federal Agency for State Property Management (Rosimushchestvo) );
* [[Donau Bank]] AG, Vienna;
* East-West United Bank, Luxemburg;
* [[Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord – Eurobank|Eurobank]], Paris;
* [[Moscow Narodny Bank]], London;
* [[Ost-West Handelsbank]], Frankfurt am Main.
All of them were members of the USSR [[Vneshekonombank]] system and were transferred to the CBR in 1992 by the Resolution of the Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]]. For over five years – 2000 to 2005 – all stocks of the Russian Foreign Banks were being purchased from the Bank of Russia by [[VTB Bank]].
As part of the financial support to credit institutions, the Bank of Russia invests in them through the Banking Sector Consolidation Fund and acquires (on a temporary and indirect basis) shares in the equity of such banks. The first project of this kind was [[Otkritie FC Bank]], in summer 2017.

==Politics==
In December 2014, amidst falling global oil prices, Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, [[capital flight]], and fears of recession, the bank had increased the one-week minimum auction [[Repurchase agreement|repo]] rate up by 6.5 points to 17 percent.
This caused a run on the ruble, and on 29 January, the bank decreased the rate by two points to 15 percent.

In January 2015, the head of monetary policy, [[Ksenia Yudayeva]], a proponent of strict anti-inflation policy, was replaced by [[Dmitry Tulin]], who is "seen as more acceptable to bankers, who have called for lower interest rates".<ref name=reu>{{cite news|author1=Jason Bush, Lidia Kelly and Alexander Winning|title=Russian central bank makes surprise interest rate cut|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/30/us-russia-crisis-cenbank-rates-idUSKBN0L311Q20150130|accessdate=31 January 2015|work=Reuters|date=30 January 2015}}</ref>
