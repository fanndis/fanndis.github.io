'''''The Fiscal Times''''' ('''TFT''') is an [[English-language]] digital news, news analysis and opinion publication based in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. It was founded in 2010 with initial funding from businessman and investment banker [[Peter G. Peterson]]. [[Jacqueline Leo]] serves as the publication's editor-in-chief.

Through three core content channels—policy and politics, business and economy, and life and money—the publication focuses on how [[fiscal policy]] affects business and consumers and how business and consumer behavior influences government fiscal policy. The site's news coverage also tracks the [[President of the United States|Presidency]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]].

==History==
Businessman [[Peter G.

[[Jacqueline Leo|Jackie Leo]], former editor-in-chief of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' was selected to be the publication's editor-in-chief.
