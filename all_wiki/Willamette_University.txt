The university is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division III [[Northwest Conference]]. Approximately 2,100 students are enrolled at Willamette between the graduate and undergraduate programs.<ref name="willamette.edu"/>

Originally named the [[Oregon Institute]], the school was an unaffiliated outgrowth of the [[Methodist Mission]]. The name was changed to Wallamet University in 1852, followed by the current spelling in 1870. Willamette founded the first medical school and law school in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the second half of the 19th century. In the 20th century, it began competing in intercollegiate athletics.

Willamette's undergraduate programs exist within the school's College of Arts & Sciences. The oldest of the graduate programs is the [[Willamette University College of Law|College of Law]], founded in 1883 and currently located in the Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center. Established in 1974, [[Atkinson Graduate School of Management]] is housed in the Seeley G. Mudd Building.

==History==
The university was founded as the [[Oregon Institute]] by the missionary [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]], who had arrived in what was then known as the [[Oregon Country]] in 1834 and had founded the Indian Manual Labor Institute for the education of the local [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. Lee requested additional support for his mission, and received 53 additional volunteers in 1839, who arrived on the ship ''[[Lausanne (ship)|Lausanne]]''. After a series of meetings in Lee's home, the by-laws were adopted and board of trustees elected and the institute was officially established on February 1, 1842. The Oregon Institute officially opened on August 13, 1844 with a total of five students and one teacher, Mrs. [[Chloe Clark Willson|Chloe Clarke Willson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1834-1899.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1834 - 1899 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> Lee served as the first President of the Board of Trustees, followed by [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]] after Lee's death in 1845.

The original building of the institute was a three-story frame structure first occupied in 1844. At the time, it was one of the largest structures in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It housed the first session of the state legislature to meet in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]] after the capital was moved there in 1851. The building burned down in 1877. In 1867, a new brick building was finished to house the school and named University Hall.<ref name=wu/> The building was renamed as [[Waller Hall]] in 1912 to honor the Reverend [[Alvin F. Waller]], and is now the oldest university building west of the [[Mississippi River]] still in use.<ref name=wu/> The first president was [[Francis S.

The name of the institution was changed to "Wallamet University" in 1852. The following year, the [[Oregon Territorial Legislature]] granted a charter to the university.

In December 1941, the university's football team traveled to Hawaii to play the [[University of Hawaii]]. Many students accompanied the team by passenger ship to [[Oahu]]. The game was played on December 6. The following day, many of the Willamette students witnessed the bombing of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] from their hotels on [[Waikiki|Waikiki Beach]].  Their return trip was delayed by many weeks, and some of the students returned to Oregon by helping on ships transporting the wounded to the mainland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1900-1949.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1900 - 1949 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> Many of the team members stayed with football players from [[Punahou School]].

In addition to Greek housing, eleven residence halls exist on the Willamette campus. Undergraduate students are under contract to live on campus for two years, after which they may move into private residence or one of the university's apartment complexes. [[Lausanne Hall]], originally home of the university's Women's College, is now one of the university's undergraduate dormitories. The building commemorates the ship that brought the reinforcements to Lee in 1839. York Hall commemorates the university's first graduate.

The Mill Stream runs through the middle of the campus. Starting across 12th Street and flowing through the length of the campus, it passes by the [[Martha Springer Botanical Garden]], the [[Mark O. Hatfield Library|Hatfield Library]], Hudson Hall, the University Center, Smith Auditorium and Goudy Commons. This artificial stream, commonly referred to as the Mill Stream, was once known as the Mill Race. It forms a "W" shape when viewed from the University Center. Biology and environmental science classes utilize the Mill Stream as an authentic research venue. As part of the freshman matriculation ceremony, new students place a lit candle into the Mill Stream and watch it float downstream.

On-campus athletics facilities are located in the southeast portion of the campus. These include a soccer field, tennis courts, and the Sparks Center.<ref name="map"/> Softball, football, and baseball stadiums are located outside of the main campus.

===Greek life===
There are five fraternities and three sororities at Willamette. The sororities are [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], and [[Alpha Phi]]. Alpha Chi Omega and Pi Beta Phi have their own houses located along sorority row on Mill Street. The fraternities at Willamette are [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], and [[Sigma Chi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/offices/osa/greek/index.html|title=Student Activities: Fraternity & Sorority Life|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}</ref>

Greek life at Willamette began in the 1920s with the foundation of several local fraternities and sororities. In 1942, G. Herbert Smith, a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]], became President of Willamette, and invited national fraternities and sororities onto campus. The local fraternities were soon converted into national fraternities and sororities. Pi Beta Phi became the first national sorority at Willamette in 1944, and Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Delta Theta were installed in 1947. At its peak, there were six fraternities and five sororities at Willamette.

Two other sororities, [[Chi Omega]] and [[Alpha Phi]], and the fraternity [[Delta Tau Delta]], used to have chapters at Willamette.  In the mid-1990s, Delta Tau Delta lost its charter. The two sororities lost their charters after their move to sorority row. Chi Omega was transformed into a multicultural oriented residence known as WISH (Willamette International Studies House). In the spring of 2014, Alpha Phi accepted an invitation from the university's Panhellenic Council to reorganize their chapter on Willamette's campus. In the fall of 2014, Beta Theta Pi began recolonization of its chapter on Willamette's campus with the consent of the university's Inter-Fraternity council.

Greek life at Willamette came under intense scrutiny in 2013 for a series of leaked messages on a private Sigma Chi Facebook group. The messages were sexist in nature and included demands for Sigma Chi brothers to "invite any girl who has a pulse" to an upcoming house party and that "women's [sic] rights are the biggest joke in the US." The messages also included sexually threatening language about a school administrator. As a result, the fraternity lost its house and was forced to move off campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/willamette-university-sigma-chi-facebook_n_3670546|title=Fraternity Booted Off Campus Following Controversy|date=2013-07-29|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> When asked for a comment by the Statesman Journal, Sigma Chi's National [[Executive director|Executive Director]] Mike Dunn said that the fraternity “completely support[s] what the school has done.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/115562296/|title=Statesman Journal from Salem, Oregon on May 9, 2013 · Page A1|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Sigma Chi's Salem chapter later voted to expel 12 members of the fraternity involved in the abusive and misogynistic messages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2013/05/willamette_university_fraterni.html|title=Willamette University fraternity suspended during investigation over Facebook comments|last=Associated|first=The|date=2013-05-09|website=oregonlive|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>
