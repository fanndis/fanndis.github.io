Other television shows and films Hall has appeared in are ''[[Martial Law (TV series)|Martial Law]]'', ''[[Star Search]]'' (host), ''[[Coming to America]]'' (1988), and ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989). Hall is also known for his appearance as [[Alan Thicke]]'s [[sidekick]] on the talk show ''[[Thicke of the Night]]''.

In 2012, Hall won [[NBC]]'s reality-competition [[game show]] ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 12)|Celebrity Apprentice 5]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/television/celebrity-apprentice-final-recap-arsenio-hall-tops-clay-aiken-article-1.1081797 |last=Chen|first=Joyce|title='Celebrity Apprentice' final recap: Arsenio Hall tops Clay Aiken |work=New York Daily News|date=May 21, 2012|access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref>

==Early years==
Hall was born in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], the son of Fred and Annie Hall. His father is a [[Baptist minister]].<ref name=filmref>{{cite web | title=Arsenio Hall Biography (1955-) | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/15/Arsenio-Hall.html | publisher=FilmReference.com | year=2008 | access-date=July 6, 2008}}</ref> Hall performed as a magician when he was a child. He graduated from [[Warrensville Heights High School]] in [[Warrensville Heights, Ohio]], in 1973, after he briefly  attended [[John F. Kennedy High School (Cleveland, Ohio)|John F. Kennedy High School]]. He later attended college at [[Kent State University]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dawidziak |first=Mark |title=Arsenio Hall and Clay Aiken are this season's 'Celebrity Apprentice' finalists |url=http://mobile.cleveland.com/advcleve/pm_29206/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=0ZIMZvxv |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711210138/http://mobile.cleveland.com/advcleve/pm_29206/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=0ZIMZvxv |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |access-date=May 22, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=May 17, 2012 }}</ref>

==Career==
Hall later moved to Chicago, and then Los Angeles, to pursue a career in comedy, making a couple of appearances on ''[[Soul Train]]''. In 1984, he was the announcer/sidekick for [[Alan Thicke]] during the short-lived talk show ''[[Thicke of the Night]]'' (a role for which he has on occasion noted his confusion with [[Monty Hall]]).

Hall appeared on five weeks' worth of episodes of the short-lived [[NBC]] [[game show]] ''[[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]]'' from 1983 to 1984.

He was also the original voice of [[Winston Zeddemore]] in the cartoon ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' from 1986 to 1987. In 1988, he co-starred in the comedy film ''[[Coming to America]]'' with [[Eddie Murphy]].

===Talk shows===
In 1986, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network introduced ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers]]'', created to directly challenge ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. After a moderate start, ratings for the show sagged. Behind-the-scenes relations between Rivers and network executives at Fox quickly eroded, and Rivers left in 1987.<ref>{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Guy|title=Joan Rivers: 'I'm the funniest person performing stand-up today'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/joan-rivers-im-the-funniest-person-performing-standup-today-2111966.html|access-date=May 22, 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=October 23, 2010|location=London}}</ref> The series was subsequently renamed ''The Late Show'', and featured several interim hosts, including [[Ross Shafer]], [[Suzanne Somers]], [[Shawn Thompson]], [[Richard Belzer]] and [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] before it was canceled in 1988. Hall was also chosen to host the show in the fall of 1987, and his stint proved to be immensely popular, developing a cult following which eventually led to Hall landing his own show in syndication.<ref>{{cite news|last=Njeri|first=Itabari|title=Fresh Talk: 'We Be Havin' a Ball,' Says Arsenio Hall.

From January 2, 1989, until May 27, 1994, he had a [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] contract to host a nationwide [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] late night talk show, ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]''. The show became a breakout, late-night success, especially rating high among the coveted younger demographic and known for its audience's distinctive alternative to applause in chanting, "Roo, Roo, Roo! (The Cleveland Brown's Dawg Pound in the east end zone)," while pumping their fists. The practice soon became such a ritual that by 1991 had become a "[[popular culture|pop culture]] stamp of approval" — one that Hall said had become "so popular it's getting on people's nerves."<ref name="crankit">{{cite web| title= Crank It Up! | url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-04-03/lifestyle/9104020300_1_woof-woof-woof-arsenio-hall-crank | work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] | author=Diana E. Lundin | publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] | date= April 3, 1991| access-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> The gesture was so well known that it appeared in films such as ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', and ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]''.<ref name="crankit"/>

He also had a rivalry with [[Jay Leno]] after the latter was named host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', during which Hall said that he would "kick Jay's ass" in [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Celebrity Quotes | url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296183,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly | date=February 24, 1995 | access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref>

Hall used his fame during this period to help fight worldwide prejudice against [[HIV/AIDS]] after [[Magic Johnson]] contracted the virus. Hall and Johnson filmed a [[Public service announcement|PSA]] about the disease that aired in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-04-19/news/9204190407_1_magic-johnson-hiv-aids|title=Magic Johnson, Arsenio Team Up For Aids Video|date=April 19, 1992|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref>

===Other television and radio work===
Between 1988 and 1991, Hall hosted the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1991/ |title=1991 MTV Video Music Awards &#124; Highlights, Winners, Performers and Photos from the 1991 MTV VMAs |publisher=Mtv.com |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref> Over the years, he has appeared as a guest on numerous talk shows, in special features, as a voice actor, on game shows and other award shows. Since ''The Arsenio Hall Show'' ended, Hall had a leading role on television shows such as the short-lived sitcom ''[[Arsenio (TV series)|Arsenio]]'' (1997) and ''[[Martial Law (TV series)|Martial Law]]'' with [[Sammo Hung]] (1998–2000), as well as hosted the revival of ''[[Star Search]]'' (2003–2004). While hosting ''Star Search'', he popularized the [[catchphrase]] "Hit me with the digits!".

Hall appeared as himself in ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' in March 2004, (convinced by the Swedish comedy director Saman Khadiri), when Chappelle was imagining "what Arsenio is doing right now" in a dinner scene.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 2, Episode 9|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/chappelles-show/ep-209-321153/|work=Chappelle's Show|publisher=TV.com|access-date=May 22, 2012|date=March 24, 2004}}</ref> Hall has guest co-hosted Wednesday evenings on ''[[The Tim Conway Jr. Show]]'' on [[KAMP-FM|KLSX]] 97.1 FM radio.<ref>{{cite web | title=Tim Conway and Friends | url=http://www.971freefm.com/pages/1925907.php | work=KLSX 97.1 | year=2008 | access-date=July 17, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723141433/http://www.971freefm.com/pages/1925907.php | archive-date=July 23, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Hall also hosted [[MyNetworkTV]]'s comedic web video show ''[[The World's Funniest Moments]]'' and [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]'s ''100 Greatest Black Power Moves''.<ref>[https://www.tvguide.com/News/Arsenio-Hall-New-58316.aspx Arsenio Hall Is Back with Two New Shows]''.

Hall was considered to be the host of the syndicated version of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. syndicated game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'' and filmed a pilot (there were six taped).<ref>{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Richard|title=Howie says no deal to syndicated deal of Deal or no Deal|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2006/12/11/howie-says-no-deal-to-syndicated-deal-of-deal-or-no-deal/|access-date=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 11, 2006}}</ref><ref name="notedguys">{{cite news | title=Arsenio Hall | url=http://notedguys.com/arsenio-hall/ | work=NotedGuys.com | access-date=January 26, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305114030/http://notedguys.com/arsenio-hall/ | archive-date=March 5, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, by the time the syndicated series began on September 8, 2008, [[Howie Mandel]] was chosen as the host.

In 1997, after being out of the public eye for three years, Hall gave an interview to dispel rumors regarding what had driven him off stage stating, "I went on the Internet and read I was in detox at [[Betty Ford Center|Betty Ford]], I got online under a fake name and typed in, 'I know Arsenio better than anyone else and he's not in detox, you idiots!'"<ref name="philly">{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-03-05/news/25572605_1_arsenio-hall-late-night-wars-show|publisher=articles.philly.com|title=Archives - Philly.com|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref>
