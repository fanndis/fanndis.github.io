'''Dean''' is a title employed in [[academic administration]]s such as colleges or universities for a person with significant authority over a specific [[Academia|academic]] unit, over a specific area of concern, or both.  Deans are common in private [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]s, and occasionally found in [[middle school]]s and [[high school]]s as well.

==Origin==
{{main|Dean (Christianity)}}
A "dean" ([[Latin]] ''[[decanus]]'') was originally the head of a group of ten soldiers or monks.  Eventually an [[Dean (Christianity)|ecclesiastical dean]] became the head of a group of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] or other religious groups.

When the [[University|universities]] grew out of the [[cathedral school]]s and [[monastic school]]s, the title of dean was used for officials with various administrative duties.

==Use==
=== Bulgaria and Romania ===
In [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Romania]]n universities, a dean is the head of a [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], which may include several academic departments. Every faculty unit of university or academy. The Dean can appoint his deputies: a vice dean of university work and vice dean of science activity.

===Canada===
In a Canadian university or a college, a dean is typically the head of a [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], which may include several academic departments. Typical positions include Dean of Arts, Dean of Engineering, Dean of Science and Dean of Business. Many universities also have a Dean of Graduate Studies, responsible for work at the postgraduate level in all parts of the university.

The job description for deans at the [[University of Waterloo]] is probably typical, and reads in part, "The dean of a faculty is primarily a university officer, serving in that capacity on the senate, appropriate major committees and on other university bodies. As university officer, the dean has the dual role of making independent judgments on total university matters and representing the particular faculty's policies and points of view. The dean should oversee the particular faculty's relations with other faculties to ensure that they are harmonious and serve the total university's objectives. The dean will report directly to the vice president, academic and provost."<ref>{{cite web|title=Policy 45 â€“ The Dean of a Faculty|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-45|accessdate=16 March 2014}}</ref>

There may be associate deans responsible to the dean for particular administrative functions. [[McGill University]] also uses the title of '''pro-dean''' to refer to the ad-hoc officer responsible for administering a PhD thesis defence. They serve as the direct representative of the Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies and are responsible for the defence being handled in strict correspondence with the university regulations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies - Doctoral Oral Defence|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/gps/thesis/thesis-guidelines/oral-defence|accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>

Some universities also have a dean of students, responsible for aspects of welfare and discipline and serving as an advocate for students within the institution.

===Great Britain and Ireland===
In some [[university|universities]] in the [[United Kingdom]] the term ''dean'' is used for the head of a [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], a collection of related academic departments. Examples include ''Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities''. Similar usage is found in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

In collegiate universities such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], each college may have a dean who is responsible for discipline. An interview with the dean as a result of misbehaviour is referred to as a being ''deaned''. The dean may also, or instead, be responsible for the running of the college chapel. At [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], for example, the posts of ''Dean of College'' and ''Dean of Chapel'' are separate;<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapel and Services - Queens' College Cambridge |url=http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/student-information/spiritual-life-at-queens/chapel-and-services |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131551/http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/student-information/spiritual-life-at-queens/chapel-and-services |archivedate=17 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =College Officers - Jesus College Cambridge|url =http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/fellows-staff/fellows-research-associates/college-officers/|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170216173124/http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/fellows-staff/fellows-research-associates/college-officers/|archivedate =16 February 2017}}</ref> likewise at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], the posts of Senior and Junior Deans (charged with the discipline of Junior and Senior members respectively) are distinct from the Deans of Residence (who organise worship in the college chapel). At [[Oxford]] the Dean of the Cathedral is the head of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church College]].

The [[Durham University|University of Durham]] also has a Dean of Colleges, who is chosen from the various college principals and masters and takes a parallel role to the faculty deans in university-wide debate. There are also Deans of [[Durham Law School]] and [[Durham University Business School]].

The [[List of Deans of King's College London|Dean of King's College London]] is unusual role among British universities, in that its Dean is an ordained person, responsible for overseeing the spiritual development and welfare of all students and staff, as well as fostering vocations among the worshiping community.<ref>https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/principal/dean/thedean/why</ref>

Each of the colleges of the [[University of Lancaster]] has a Dean in charge of student discipline.

===United States===
====Higher education====
The term and position of dean is prevalent in American [[higher education]]. Although usage differs from one institution to another, the title is used in two principal ways:

* A dean is usually the head of a significant collection of departments within a [[university]] (e.g., "dean of the downtown campus", "dean of the college of arts and sciences", "dean of the school of medicine"), with responsibilities for approving faculty hiring, setting academic policies, overseeing the budget, [[fundraising]], and other administrative duties. Such a dean is usually a [[tenure]]d [[professor]] from one of the departments but gives up most teaching and research activities upon assuming the deanship.  
   
* Other senior administrative positions in higher education may also carry the title of dean (or a lesser title such as associate dean or assistant dean).  For example, many colleges and universities have a position known as "dean of students", who is in charge of [[student affairs]], and a "dean of the faculty", who serves as the faculty's voice in the school's day-to-day administration.

=====Professional schools=====
Almost every [[Law school in the United States|American law school]], [[medical school]], [[divinity school]], or other professional school is part of a university, and so refers to its highest-ranking administrator as a dean.  Most have several assistant or associate deans as well (such as an associate dean of academics or an associate dean of students), as well as a select few vice deans. 

The [[American Bar Association]] regulations on the operation of law schools, which must be followed for such an institution to receive and maintain ABA accreditation, define the role of the law school dean. These regulations specify that "A law school shall have a full-time dean, selected by the governing board or its designee, to whom the dean shall be responsible."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/legaled/standards/20082009StandardsWebContent/Chapter%202.pdf |title=ABA Standards for Approval of Law Schools, Standard 206(a) |publisher=abanet.org}}</ref> Thus, a law school dean may not simply be a professor selected by fellow professors, nor even by the president of the university.

Similar standards exist with respect to medical school deans. Specifically, the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME), which accredits medical schools, thereby making them eligible for federal grants and state licensure, sets forth the operative conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcme.org/functionslist.htm#governance%20and%20administration |archive-url=https://archive.is/20020612110929/http://www.lcme.org/functionslist.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 June 2002 |title=LCME Accreditation Standards (with annotations |date=June 2008 |publisher=lcme.org |accessdate=24 November 2010 }}</ref> LCME regulations require that the "chief official of the medical school, who usually holds the title 'dean,' must have ready access to the university president or other university official charged with final responsibility for the school, and to other university officials as are necessary to fulfill the responsibilities of the dean's office."<ref>IS-8.</ref> The LCME further require that the dean "must be qualified by education and experience to provide leadership in medical education, scholarly activity, and care of patients"<ref>IS-10.</ref> and that "[t]he dean and a committee of the faculty should determine medical school policies."<ref>FA-12.</ref>

====Secondary education====
The term or office of dean is much less common in American [[secondary education]]. 
Although most [[high school]]s are led by a [[Principal (school)|principal]] or headmaster, a few (particularly private [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]s) refer to their chief authority as a dean. In large schools or some boarding schools there may be a dean of men or boys, and a dean of women or girls, or each year (freshman, sophomore, etc.) may have a dean.  Some [[junior high school]]s and high schools have a teacher or administrator referred to as a dean who is in charge of [[School discipline|student discipline]] and to some degree administrative services.
