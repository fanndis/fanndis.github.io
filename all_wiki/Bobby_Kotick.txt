In 1987, Kotick tried to acquire [[Commodore International]]. He planned to remove the keyboard and disk drive from the [[Amiga 500]] and turn it into the first 16-bit video game system. He was unsuccessful in persuading Commodore's then-Chairman [[Irving Gould]] to sell control of the company.<ref name="Gamasutra" /><ref name="MarketWatch" /> He subsequently purchased a controlling stake in Leisure Concepts, [[Nintendo]]'s licensing agent,<ref name="MarketWatch" /> which was renamed [[4Kids Entertainment]].<ref name="Forbes">{{Cite news |url=https://people.forbes.com/profile/robert-a-kotick/1126 |title=Robert A.

In December 1990, Kotick and his partner Brian Kelly bought a 25% stake in Mediagenic, a bankrupt software company that Atari programmers founded in 1979 as Activision. He changed the name back to [[Activision]], performed a full restructuring of the company, and refocused the company on video games.<ref name="Gamasutra" /><ref name="MarketWatch" /> Kotick became CEO of Activision in February 1991.<ref name="Forbes" /> From 1997 to 2003, Activision acquired nine development studios and released its first hit game in 1995.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chozick|first=Amy|date=2012-12-15|title=At Activision, a Hero and Villain, Zapped Into One|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/business/bobby-kotick-of-activision-drawing-praise-and-wrath.html|access-date=2020-06-03|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

At Activision, Kotick set out to build "an institutional quality, well-managed company with a focus on the independent developer."<ref name="MarketWatch" /> In a June 14, 2010, interview with gaming blog [[Kotaku]], Kotick stated, "…[P]art of the whole philosophy of Activision was whether you're owned outright or not, if you're a studio you have control of your destiny, you could make decisions about who to hire, flexibility on what products to make, how to make them, schedules appropriate to make them, budgets."<ref name="Kotaku">{{cite web|author=Brian Crecente|title=A Delightful Chat With the Most Hated Man in Video Games|url=http://kotaku.com/5559201/a-delightful-chat-with-the-most-hated-man-in-video-games|website=Kotaku}}</ref>

=== Call of Duty Endowment ===
In October 2009, Kotick co-founded the [[Call of Duty Endowment (CODE)]], a non-profit benefit corporation, after speaking with former [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]] Secretary [[Jim Nicholson (Secretary of Veterans Affairs)|Jim Nicholson]] about how best to serve veterans.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/docs/default-source/guidebook-files/uniformchampions_gb_case1.pdf?sfvrsn=d8bea740_0 |title=A Gamer Puts Vets to Work:The Call of Duty Endowment separates potent nonprofits from also-rans |website=philanthropyroundtable.org |access-date=December 17, 2018}}</ref> The endowment helps soldiers transition to civilian careers after their military service by funding nonprofit organizations and raising awareness of the value veterans bring to the workplace.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-05|title=Call of Duty Endowment and U.S. Army create Code Bowl esports event for armed forces|url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/05/call-of-duty-endowment-and-u-s-army-create-code-bowl-esports-event-for-armed-forces/|access-date=2020-07-01|website=VentureBeat|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Business strategy controversy ==
Some statements Kotick has made about his business strategy have led to controversy.<ref name="Kotaku" /> He has focused on developing intellectual property which can be, in his words, "exploited" over a long period, to the exclusion of new titles which cannot guarantee sequels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2008/11/06/activision-if-we-cant-run-a-game-into-the-ground-we-dont-want-it |title=Activision: if we can't run a game into the ground, we don't want it |accessdate=November 7, 2008 |work=Ars Technica |date=November 6, 2008}}</ref> Kotick described this business strategy as "narrow and deep" or "annualizable" and cited it as key to attracting development talent who may not be drawn to "speculative franchises."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/104341-activision-blizzard-f2q09-qtr-end-9-30-08-earnings-call-transcript |title=Activision Blizzard SF2Q09 (Qtr End 9/30/08) Earnings Call Transcript |accessdate=October 20, 2009 |work=[[Seeking Alpha]] |date=November 5, 2008}}</ref> During Activision Blizzard's Q2 2009 financial results conference, Kotick was asked about his "comfort level"  regarding pricing of some of his new games.
