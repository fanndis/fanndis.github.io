== 2015 State Department subpoena ==
In February 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that the [[United States Department of State]] had issued a [[subpoena]] to the [[Clinton Foundation]] in the fall of 2015. According to the report, the subpoena focused on "documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from federal government during Hillary Clinton's term as secretary of state"; it "also asked for records related to Huma Abedin, longtime Clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation, Clinton's personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons".<ref name="SUBPOENA-WP">Hamburger, Tom. Helderman, Rosalind S. 2016.

On October 28, 2016, the FBI announced that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from [[Anthony Weiner]] to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Abedin's husband. FBI Director [[James Comey]] said the agency would review the e-mails to see if they contained classified material. Clinton called for the FBI to release its findings as soon as possible.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldman|first1=Adam|last2=Rappeport|first2=Alan|date=October 29, 2016|title=Emails in Anthony Weiner Inquiry Jolt Hillary Clinton's Campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=October 29, 2016}}</ref> CNN reported: "The Justice Department and FBI officials are working to secure approval that would allow the FBI to conduct a full search of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin's newly discovered emails." The issue is complex because Abedin shared a computer with Weiner, according to officials, and the case may raise "spousal privilege legal protections" for Abedin since the computer belongs to her husband.

The FBI's New York field office was conducting the Weiner investigation and found the Abedin emails on the computer, which they thought was only Weiner's, the officials said. They then stopped their work and contacted the team of investigators from FBI headquarters who had handled the probe of Clinton's private email server. The investigators saw enough of the emails to decide that they seemed pertinent to the Clinton server investigation and that they might be emails not seen before. Because they felt they needed a warrant specific to Abedin's emails, officials did not examine them further.

Abedin cooperated with the investigation, according to Justice Department and FBI officials. Investigators believed that some emails which were deleted from the Clinton server were possibly among those in question, and that they would need to interview Abedin again after examining the emails on Weiner's computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2016/10/30/justice-department-in-talks-with-huma-abedin-lawyers-to-permit-search-of-new-emails/|title=Justice Department Obtains Warrant for FBI Search of Huma Abedein's Newly Discovered Emails|date=October 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/30/politics/clinton-emails-fbi-abedin/index.html|title=FBI discovered Clinton-related emails weeks ago|author1=Evan Perez |author2=Pamela Brown|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/comey-wrote-bombshell-letter-to-congress-before-fbi-had-reviewed-new-emails-220219586.html|title=Exclusive: FBI still does not have warrant to review new Abedin emails linked to Clinton probe}}</ref>

On October 30, 2016, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the Abedin-linked emails found on Weiner's laptop. Abedin used the same laptop to send thousands of emails to Clinton, according to NBC sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/fbi-obtains-warrant-newly-discovered-emails-clinton-probe-reid-accuses-n675411|title=FBI obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in Clinton probe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/huma-abedin-email-address-discovered-benghazi-committee-testimony/|title=New Huma Abedin E-mail Address Discovered ahead of Benghazi Committee Appearance|date=2015-10-15|website=National Review|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> On November 6, in a letter to Congress, the FBI said that, after reviewing all of Clinton's emails from her tenure as Secretary of State, it had not changed its conclusion reached in July exonerating Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/fbi-completes-review-newly-revealed-hillary-clinton-emails-finds-no-n678701|title=FBI finds no criminality in review of newly discovered Clinton emails|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/hilary-clinton-male-voters-donald-trump.html|title=Emails Warrant No New Action Against Hillary Clinton, F.B.I.
