'''Helen Dale''' (born '''Helen Darville'''; 1972) is an Australian writer and lawyer. She is best known for writing ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'', a novel about a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] family who collaborated with the Nazis in the [[Holocaust]], under the pseudonym '''Helen Demidenko'''. 

A daughter of British immigrants, Darville was educated at [[Redeemer Lutheran College]] in [[Rochedale, Queensland|Rochedale]], a suburb of [[Brisbane]]. While studying English literature at the [[University of Queensland]], she wrote ''The Hand that Signed the Paper''. In 1993, the novel won [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]] for an unpublished manuscript.

Dale published her book in 1994 and won the [[Miles Franklin Award]], becoming the award's youngest winner. The following year, she was the subject of a major Australian literary controversy because she had falsely claimed Ukrainian ancestry as part of the basis of the book (and her pseudonym).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/demidenko/heyward.1.html|title=Helen Darville aka Helen Demidenko - Update|work=Australian Humanities Review|accessdate=27 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218101916/http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/demidenko/heyward.1.html|archive-date=18 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The misrepresentation has been described as a "[[literary hoax]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hums3001.unsw.wikispaces.net/Literary+Hoaxes#Literary%20Hoaxes-Examples-Helen%20Demidenko/Darville |title=hums3001 - Literary Hoaxes |publisher=Hums3001.unsw.wikispaces.net |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref> in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]].''<ref name=knox/> The novel was subsequently reissued under her legal name, then Helen Darville. It won the 1995 [[ALS Gold Medal|Australian Literary Society Gold Medal]].

After teaching, Dale returned to university, gaining her law degree in 2002. She later did post-graduate law study at Oxford and completed an LLB degree in 2012 at the University of Edinburgh. She returned to Australia and became a senior adviser to [[David Leyonhjelm]], a [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democrat]] member of the [[Australian Senate]], but at the end of May 2016 Leyonhjelm revealed that Dale had left his employ.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Aston|first1=Heath|title=Senator David Leyonhjelm's plan to pay cash, 'ignore tax' in new hire for Liberal Democratic Party|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/senator-david-leyonhjelms-plan-to-pay-cash-ignore-tax-in-new-hire-for-liberal-democratic-party-20160530-gp76ix.html|accessdate=2016-05-30|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2016-05-30}}</ref>

==Early life==
A daughter of British immigrants, Darville was educated at [[Redeemer Lutheran College]] in [[Rochedale, Queensland|Rochedale]], a suburb of [[Brisbane]].{{cn|date=October 2020}} She had previously claimed that her father was Ukrainian, and her mother was Irish.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

==''The Hand that Signed the Paper'': Novel and controversy==
While studying English literature at the [[University of Queensland]], she wrote ''The Hand that Signed the Paper,'' a novel about a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] family who collaborated with the Nazis in the [[Holocaust]]. In 1993, the novel won [[The Australian Vogel Literary Award]] for an unpublished manuscript.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===Contents===
The novel tells the story of a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. The family comprises the parents, a daughter, and two sons. They suffer abuse by the drunken local commissar and are refused treatment by the village doctor and his wife (a secular Jew). Many Ukrainians hail the German invaders as liberators from Soviet oppression. Many volunteered for the German armed forces&mdash;[[Wehrmacht]], [[SS]], and [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The novel stresses the arbitrariness of the assignments to military units. A Ukrainian could as easily end up fighting on the front alongside the Wehrmacht as be in a death squad.

The two young brothers are separated in military assignments: 16-year-old Evheny to [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Einsatzgruppen]] C (a mobile killing squad) and the elder 19-year-old Vitaly to the SS training facility for Ukrainians at [[Trawniki]] in Poland. Evheny is implicated in the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] outside Kiev, while Vitaly is posted to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] as a guard. Evheny is later sent to a front-line [[Waffen SS]] formation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], while Vitaly is posted to northern Italy. He is part of German anti-partisan activity in the wake of Italy's withdrawal from the Axis alliance.

===Style===
The novel is told primarily from the point of view of Kateryna, sister of the two brothers, and Magda, Vitaly's [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]] from the Polish village near the Treblinka extermination camp. Kateryna has a relationship with a German SS [[Hauptsturmführer]]. Magda assists a Jewish prisoner to escape after the Treblinka prisoner revolt in August 1943. The family's story is gradually revealed by Fiona, Evheny's Australian-born daughter, who starts investigating the past after her uncle Vitaly is charged in the early 1990s with war crimes in World War II.

The book is frank about the anti-semitism of its major characters (who blame Jews for the excesses of Communism), and Darville represented the lives of Ukrainian military men in a sympathetic manner, rather than featuring their victims as is more usual in Holocaust literature. These elements attracted accusations of anti-semitism and condemnation of the book by leaders of Australia's Jewish community. There was a perception that the attitudes of the author "Helen Demidenko" may have been informed by her Ukrainian ethnic identity, until her [[pseudonym]] was revealed along with her false representation of the book as history.

===Controversy===
''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' won the [[Miles Franklin Award]], one of the most prestigious literary awards in Australia. At the time, the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name. This promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1}}</ref>

Despite the adverse publicity for the author, the novel won the 1995 Australian Literary Society Gold Medal.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

When Dale submitted her novel to the [[University of Queensland Press]] in 1993, she said it was based upon recorded interviews with her own relatives, among others her uncle "Vitaly Demidenko". After the awards, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' mistakenly reported in 2005 that the novel had been submitted as a non-fiction book.<ref name=knox>{{cite news|first=Malcolm|last=Knox|title=The Darville Made Me Do It|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 July 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/the-darville-made-me-do-it/2005/07/08/1120704550613.html }}</ref> The author's 1993 note accompanying her manuscript had read: "The things narrated in this book really happened, the things they did [are] historical actualities." Then Dale wrote that she was presenting her book as fiction, saying: "But this is also a work of fiction. I have presented it as fiction...."<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/researcharchive/conferences/calp/papers/china.pdf |title=Under the Influence of Prize Culture:Helen Demidenko and the Australian/Vogel, Miles Franklin,and ALS Gold Medal Awards |first=Corey |last=China |year=2003 |conference=Culture and the Literary Prize Conference |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609224823/http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/researcharchive/conferences/calp/papers/china.pdf |archive-date=9 June 2011 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Books that discuss the scandal===
The controversy that surrounded ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' inspired the publication in 1996 of two books that assessed the novel and issues of authenticity: [[Robert Manne]]'s ''The Culture of Forgetting: Helen Demidenko and the Holocaust'' and Andrew Riemer's ''The Demidenko Debate''. Manne is very critical of Darville's book.<!--On what grounds? --> Riemer is not, believing her approach was consistent with fiction, even if she tried to exaggerate the specific historic basis of her work.<!-- Needs expansion --><ref>{{cite book|author=Riemer, Andrew|date=1996|title=The Demidenko Debate|location=St Leonards, NSW|publisher=Allen and Unwin|page=84|isbn=1-86448-109-9 }}</ref>

==Later work and recent years==
In 1995, Darville published a short story, "Pieces of the Puzzle", in the Australian culture journal ''[[Meanjin]]''. The byline was 'Demidenko', although the journal noted that the author had "taken back" her legal name of Darville. She has said that she had met Ukrainian witnesses to the war and the Holocaust, and based the story on their accounts. The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] wrote to her demanding that she identify these possible war criminals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Dale was briefly a columnist with the Brisbane daily newspaper ''[[The Courier-Mail]]''. She was dismissed for accusations of plagiarism after repeating jokes originally from the '[[Evil Overlord List]]' in one of her columns and passing them off as her own.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David |last=Greason |title=The Review – TZADIK |publisher=Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council |url=http://www.aijac.org.au/review/1997/222/tzad222.html |accessdate=26 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012013532/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/1997/222/tzad222.html |archive-date=12 October 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|title=Editor dumps Darville|page=3|date=5 February 1997}}</ref> She continued to write freelance features for other [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] newspapers and magazines, and occasionally the [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] press. In 2017, an investigation by [[BuzzFeed]] revealed that Dale had also plagiarised a number of social media posts in her [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] feeds. BuzzFeed asked Dale why she had been lifting the tweets. She replied over Twitter direct message: "Cos it's amusing and I don't like Twitter. And don't you have more important stuff to be writing about?"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/dale-pulls-tweets|title=An Award-Winning Novelist Is Lifting Viral Tweets}}</ref>

In 2000, Darville was again accused of anti-semitism after interviewing [[David Irving]], a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]], for ''Australian Style'' magazine during his [[slander and libel|libel]] trial in London. (It was decided against him).<ref>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Cauchi|title=Irving View Under Attack|work=[[The Age]]|date=29 February 2000|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/d/darville-helen/australian_business_intelligence.html}}</ref>  She wrote a post-September 11 article in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Helen|last=Darville|title=Were we US-Bashers wrong all along?|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 October 2001|url=http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=1126 }}</ref>
