'''Sir Cecil Walter Hardy Beaton''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|CBE}} (14 January 1904 – 18 January 1980) was a British fashion, portrait, and war photographer, [[diarist]], painter, and interior designer, as well as an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]–winning [[stage design|stage]] and [[costume designer]] for films and the theatre.

==Early life and education==
Beaton was born on 14 January 1904 in [[Hampstead]], north London, the son of Ernest Walter Hardy Beaton (1867–1936), a prosperous [[timber]] merchant, and his wife, Esther "Etty" Sisson (1872–1962).  His grandfather, Walter Hardy Beaton (1841–1904), had founded the family business of "Beaton Brothers Timber Merchants and Agents", and his father followed into the business. Ernest Beaton was an amateur actor and met his wife, Cecil's mother Esther ("Etty"), when playing the lead in a play. She was the daughter of a Cumbrian [[blacksmith]] named Joseph Sisson and had come to London to visit her married sister.<ref>{{citation | first = Hugo | last = Vickers | title = Cecil Beaton: The Authorised Biography | year = 1985 | publisher = Phoenix Press}}.</ref>

Ernest and Etty Beaton had four children – Cecil; two daughters, [[Nancy Beaton|Nancy Elizabeth Louise Hardy Beaton]] (1909–99, who married Sir Hugh [[Smiley Baronets|Smiley]]) and [[Baba Beaton|Barbara Jessica Hardy Beaton]] (1912–73, known as Baba, who married Alec Hambro); and son Reginald Ernest Hardy Beaton (1905–33).

[[File:1932 Standard Rolleiflex.jpg|thumb|A 1932 Standard [[Rolleiflex]], a type of camera used by Beaton]]
Cecil Beaton was educated at [[Heath Mount School]] (where he was bullied by [[Evelyn Waugh]]) and [[St Cyprian's School]], [[Eastbourne]], where his artistic talent was quickly recognised. Both [[Cyril Connolly]] and [[Henry Longhurst]] report in their [[autobiographies]] being overwhelmed by the beauty of Beaton's singing at the St Cyprian's school concerts.<ref>{{cite book | last=Connolly  | first=Cyril | title= Enemies of Promise| location= London | publisher= G Routledge & sons | year = 1938 | oclc = 123103671}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Longhurst  | first = Henry  | title = My Life and Soft Times | location=London | publisher=Cassell | year=1971 | isbn=0-304-93849-1 }}</ref>

When Beaton was growing up his [[nanny]] had a [[Kodak]] 3A Camera, a popular model which was renowned for being an ideal piece of equipment to learn on. Beaton's nanny began teaching him the basics of photography and developing film.  He would often get his sisters and mother to sit for him.  When he was sufficiently proficient, he would send the photos off to London society magazines, often writing under a pen name and "recommending" the work of Beaton.<ref name= fynetimes>{{cite news| title = Cecil Beaton | url = http://www.fyne.co.uk/index.php?item=207 | work=Fyne Times | year=2006 | access-date=2008-05-09}}</ref>

Beaton attended [[Harrow School]], and then, despite having little or no interest in academia, moved on to [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and studied history, art and architecture. Beaton continued his photography, and through his university contacts managed to get a portrait depicting the [[Duchess of Malfi]] published in ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]''. It was actually [[Dadie Rylands|George "Dadie" Rylands]] – "a slightly out-of-focus snapshot of him as Webster's Duchess of Malfi standing in the sub-aqueous light outside the men's lavatory of the [[ADC Theatre]] at Cambridge."<ref>Beaton, Cecil (1951). ''Photobiography.'' London: Odhams Press, p.34.</ref> Beaton left Cambridge without a degree in 1925.

==Career==
After a short time in the family timber business, he worked with a cement merchant in [[Holborn]]. This resulted in "an orgy of photography at weekends" so he decided to strike out on his own.<ref>Beaton, Cecil (1951). ''Photobiography.'' London: Odhams Press, p.40.</ref> Under the patronage of [[Osbert Sitwell]] he put on his first exhibition in the Cooling Gallery, London. It caused quite a stir.

Believing that he would meet with greater success on the other side of the Atlantic, he left for New York and slowly built up a reputation there. By the time he left, he had "a contract with [[Condé Nast Publications]] to take photographs exclusively for them for several thousand pounds a year for several years to come."<ref>Beaton, Cecil (1951). ''Photobiography.'' London: Odhams Press, p.56.</ref>

From 1930 to 1945, Beaton leased [[Ashcombe House, Wiltshire|Ashcombe House]] in Wiltshire, where he entertained many notable figures.

In 1947, he bought [[Reddish House]], set in 2.5 acres of gardens, approximately {{convert|5|mi|km}} to the east in [[Broad Chalke]]. Here he transformed the interior, adding rooms on the eastern side, extending the parlour southwards, and introducing many new fittings. [[Greta Garbo]] was a visitor.<ref name="Brit Hist 116110">{{citation | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=116110 | publisher = British History | place = UK | title = Broad Chalke}}.</ref>  He remained at the house until his death in 1980 and is buried in the churchyard.<ref>{{cite book | last= Vickers| first= Hugo| title= The Unexpurgated Beaton: The Cecil Beaton Diaries as He Wrote Them, 1970–1980| year= 2003| publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson| location = London| isbn = 1400041120}}</ref><ref name = "Broad">{{citation | title = Broad Chalke, A History of a South Wiltshire Village, its Land & People Over 2,000 years | publisher = The People of the Village | year = 1999}}.</ref><ref name="WiltsCouncil">{{citation | url = http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=33 | publisher = Wiltshire Council | title = Community History of Broad Chalke | access-date = 9 January 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110812072119/http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=33 | archive-date = 12 August 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}.</ref>

===Photography===
[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- General; Beaton, Cecil IB2357.jpg|thumb|Cecil Beaton self portraits: Cecil Beaton (in civilian suit) and his Rolleiflex reflected in a mirror of the Jain temple, Calcutta, India.]]
Beaton designed book jackets (see [[Catherine Ives]]), and costumes for charity matinees, learning the craft of photography at the studio of [[Paul Tanqueray]], until ''Vogue'' took him on regularly in 1927.<ref name=independent>{{cite news | author= Muir, Robin | title= The Beaton Generation | url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040201/ai_n12750408 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090209004625/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040201/ai_n12750408 | url-status= dead | archive-date= 9 February 2009 | work=The Independent | date=1 February 2004| access-date=2008-05-09}}</ref> He set up his own studio, and one of his earliest clients and, later, best friends was [[Stephen Tennant]].  Beaton's photographs of Tennant and his circle are considered some of the best representations of the [[Bright Young People]] of the twenties and thirties.

[[File:Roystrong.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Sir [[Roy Strong]], Director and Secretary of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]
Beaton's first camera was a Kodak 3A folding camera. Over the course of his career, he employed both [[large format]] cameras, and smaller [[Rolleiflex]] cameras. Beaton was never known as a highly skilled technical photographer, and instead focused on staging a compelling model or scene and looking for the perfect shutter-release moment.

He was a photographer for the British edition of ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' in 1931 when [[George Hoyningen-Huene]], photographer for the French ''Vogue'' travelled to England with his new friend [[Horst P. Horst|Horst]]. Horst himself would begin to work for French ''Vogue'' in November of that year. The exchange and cross pollination of ideas between this collegial circle of artists across the [[English Channel|Channel]] and the Atlantic gave rise to the look of style and sophistication for which the 1930s are known.<ref>{{cite news | title=Too, Too Vomitous | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740948-1,00.html | work=Time | date=2 February 1931 | access-date=2008-05-09}}</ref>

Beaton is known for his fashion photographs and society portraits. He worked as a staff photographer for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' in addition to photographing celebrities in Hollywood. In 1938, he inserted some tiny-but-still-legible [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] phrases (including the word "kike") into American ''Vogue'' at the side of an illustration about New York society. The issue was recalled and reprinted, and Beaton was fired.<ref>Simon Doonan, [http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8864644/Cecil-Beaton-Stateside.html "Cecil Beaton Stateside"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018145034/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8864644/Cecil-Beaton-Stateside.html |date=18 October 2015 }},  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 6 November 2011, retrieved 28 August 2012</ref>

Beaton returned to England, where the Queen recommended him to the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] (MoI). He became a leading war photographer, best known for his images of the damage done by the German [[The Blitz|Blitz]].  His style sharpened and his range broadened, Beaton's career was restored by the war.<ref>Richard Holledge, "A Career Restored by War" ''Wall Street Journal,'' 29 Nov 2012, p D5</ref>

Beaton often photographed the Royal Family for official publication.<ref>{{cite web | title=V&A Exploring Photography: Sir Cecil Beaton | publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum | url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/photography/photographerframe.php?photographerid=ph009  | access-date=2008-05-10}}</ref> [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] was his favourite royal sitter, and he once pocketed her scented hankie as a keepsake from a highly successful shoot. Beaton took the famous wedding pictures of the [[Edward VIII|Duke]] and [[Wallis Simpson|Duchess of Windsor]] (wearing an [[haute couture]] ensemble by the noted American fashion designer [[Mainbocher]]).

Photo by Cecil Beaton.]]

During the [[Second World War]], Beaton was first posted to the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and given the task of recording images from the home front. During this assignment he captured one of the most enduring images of British suffering during the war, that of 3-year-old [[the Blitz|Blitz]] victim Eileen Dunne recovering in hospital, clutching her beloved teddy bear. When the image was published, America had not yet officially joined the war, but images such as Beaton's helped push the Americans to put pressure on their government to help Britain in its hour of need.<ref name=fynetimes/>

Beaton had a major influence on and relationship with [[Angus McBean]] and [[David Bailey (photographer)|David Bailey]]. McBean was a well-known portrait photographer of his era.  Later in his career, his work is influenced by Beaton.  Bailey was influenced by Beaton when they met while working for British ''Vogue'' in the early 1960s. Bailey's use of square format (6x6) images is similar to Beaton's own working patterns.

===Stage and film design===
[[File:Audrey Hepburn My Fair Lady Dress.jpg|thumb|<center>A Cecil Beaton design for [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964), for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Academy Award.]] </center>]]
After the war, Beaton tackled the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] stage, designing [[Set construction|sets]], costumes, and lighting for a 1946 revival of ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', in which he also acted.

His costumes for [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956) were highly praised.  This led to two Lerner and Loewe film musicals, ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958) and ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964), each of which earned Beaton the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]]. He also designed the period costumes for the 1970 film ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (film)|On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]''.

Additional Broadway credits include ''[[The Grass Harp (play)|The Grass Harp]]'' (1952), ''[[The Chalk Garden]]'' (1955), ''[[Saratoga (musical)|Saratoga]]'' (1959), ''[[Tenderloin (musical)|Tenderloin]]'' (1960), and ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]'' (1969). He is the recipient of four [[Tony Award]]s.

He designed the sets and costumes for a production of Puccini's last opera'' Turandot'', first used at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and then at Covent Garden.

Beaton designed the [[academic dress]] of the [[University of East Anglia]].<ref>{{citation | last = Groves | first = Nicholas | title = The Academical Dress of the University of East Anglia | place = [[North Walsham]] | publisher = [[Burgon Society|The Burgon Society]] | year = 2005}}.</ref>

===Diaries===
Cecil Beaton was a published and well-known diarist. In his lifetime, six volumes of diaries were published, spanning the years 1922–1974. Recently some unexpurgated material has been published.   "In the published diaries, opinions are softened, celebrated figures are hailed as wonders and triumphs, whereas in the originals, Cecil can be as venomous as anyone I have ever read or heard in the most shocking of conversation" wrote their editor, [[Hugo Vickers]].<ref>{{citation | last = Beaton | first = Cecil | editor-first = Hugo | editor-last = Vickers | title = The Unexpurgated Beaton Diaries | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-7538-1702-0}}.</ref>

==Last public interview==
The last public interview given by Sir Cecil Beaton was in January 1980 for an edition of the BBC's [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mwlh Desert Island Discs]. The interviewer was [[Desert Island Discs|Desert Island Discs']] creator [[Roy Plomley]]. The recording was broadcast on Friday 1 February 1980 following the Beaton family's permission, and is now available as a podcast from the BBC Radio 4 Desert Island Disc archive 1976 – 1980. Owing to Beaton's frailty, the interview was recorded at Beaton's 17th-century home of Reddish House in [[Broad Chalke]] in [[Wiltshire]] (near Salisbury).

Beaton, though frail, recalled events in his life, particularly from the 1930s and 1940s ([[the Blitz]]). Among the recollections were his associations with stars of Hollywood and British Royalty notably [[Edward VIII|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor]] (whose official wedding photographs Beaton took on 3 June 1937 at relatively short notice); and official portraits of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother)]] and [[Her Majesty The Queen]] on her Coronation day on 2 June 1953. The interview also alluded to a lifelong passion for performing arts and in particular ballet and operetta.

The Beaton programme is considered to be almost the final words on an era of [[Bright young things|"Bright Young Things"]] whose sunset had taken place by the time of the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication of Edward VIII]]. Beaton commented specifically on [[Wallis Simpson]] (later titled The Duchess of Windsor after her marriage to the former king Edward VIII) giving perhaps an insight as to her character that has not at any time been freely expressed (The Duchess of Windsor at the time of the original Beaton interview and broadcast was still alive and living in relative solitude just outside [[Paris]] – it is quite possible though unconfirmed, that the Duchess may have indeed heard this edition of Desert Island Discs).

In closing, Roy Plomley asked Beaton for the one record that he would retain on the Desert Island should the others get washed away on the tide.  The immediate reply was [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Symphony No 1]]. Beaton's chosen book was a compendium of photographs he had taken down the years of "...people known and unknown; people known but now forgotten."

==Personal life and death==
Beaton had relationships with various men: his last lover was former Olympic fencer and teacher [[Kinmont Hoitsma]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=Hugo |title=Cecil Beaton |publisher=Phoenix Press |year=2002|isbn=978-1842126134}}</ref> He also had relationships with women, including the actresses [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Coral Browne]], the dancer [[Adele Astaire]], the Greek socialite Madame Jean Ralli (Lilia),<ref>Madame Jean Ralli (d.1977). Born in Athens. A childhood friend of [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark]]. Later she worked for [[Christian Dior]].</ref> and the British socialite [[Doris Castlerosse]] (1900–42).

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[1972 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Supplement to the London Gazette|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/45554/supplements/1|date=31 December 1971|work=London Gazette}}</ref>

[[File:Reddish House Broad Chalke.jpg|thumb|right|Reddish House in [[Broad Chalke]]]]
Two years later he suffered a [[stroke]] that left him permanently paralysed on the right side of his body. Although he learnt to write and draw with his left hand, and had cameras adapted, Beaton became frustrated by the limitations the stroke had put upon his work. As a result of his stroke, Beaton became anxious about financial security for his old age and, in 1976, entered into negotiations with [[Philippe Garner]], expert-in-charge of photographs at [[Sotheby's]].

On behalf of the auction house, Garner acquired Beaton's archive – excluding all portraits of the Royal Family, and the five decades of prints held by ''Vogue'' in London, Paris and New York. Garner, who had almost singlehandedly invented the photographic auction, oversaw the archive's preservation and partial dispersal, so that Beaton's only tangible assets, and what he considered his life's work, would ensure him an annual income. The first of five auctions was held in 1977, the last in 1980.

By the end of the 1970s, Beaton's health had faded. He died on 18 January 1980 at [[Reddish House]], his home in [[Broad Chalke]], Wiltshire, four days after his 76th birthday.<ref name=fynetimes/>
