==History==
''CounterPunch'' began as a newsletter, established in 1994 by the [[Washington, D.C.]]-based investigative reporter [[Ken Silverstein]].<ref>"Counterpunch is the brainchild of Ken Silverstein, a former AP reporter in Rio de Janeiro." ''[[Lies of Our Times]]'', vols 4-5 (1993), p. 26.</ref> He was soon joined by [[Alexander Cockburn]] and then [[Jeffrey St. Clair]], who became the publication's editors in 1996 when Silverstein left.<ref>Alexander Cockburn, Jeffrey St. Clair, ''Five Days that Shook the World: Seattle and Beyond'' (London and New York: Verso, 2000), p. 151; Alexander Cockburn, Ken Silverstein, ''Washington Babylon'' (London and New York: Verso, 1996), p. 302.</ref><ref>Alexander Cockburn, Jeffrey St. Clair, ''End Times: The Death of the Fourth Estate'' (Petrolia, California, and Oakland, California: CounterPunch and AK Press, 2007), pp. 2, 44.</ref> In 2007, Cockburn and St. Clair wrote that in founding ''CounterPunch'' they had "wanted it to be the best muckraking newsletter in the country", and cited as inspiration such pamphleteers as [[Edward Abbey]], [[Peter Maurin]], and [[Ammon Hennacy]], as well as the socialist/populist newspaper ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]]'' (1895–1922).<ref>Alexander Cockburn, Jeffrey St. Clair (2007), ''End times: the death of the fourth estate'', CounterPunch and AK Press, p383</ref> When Alexander Cockburn died in 2012 at the age of 71, environmental journalist [[Joshua Frank]] became managing editor and Jeffrey St. Clair became editor-in-chief of ''CounterPunch''.<ref>Nichols, John, [http://www.thenation.com/blog/168996/alexander-cockburn-and-radical-power-word "Alexander Cockburn and the Radical Power of the Word"], ''thenation.com'', 21 July 2012, accessed 22 July 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/blog/1645/an_award-winning_year/ An Award-Winning Year, The Investigative Fund] retrieved July 24, 2016</ref>

During the 2016 presidential election, ''CounterPunch'' published a piece by "Alice Donovan",<ref name="GoAskAlice"/> who purported to be a freelance writer but who US intelligence officials allege is pseudonymous employee of the Russian government.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kremlin-trolls-burned-across-the-internet-as-washington-debated-options/2017/12/23/e7b9dc92-e403-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html|title=Kremlin trolls burned across the Internet as Washington debated options|last=Entous|first=Adam|date=2017-12-25|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-25|last2=Nakashima|first2=Ellen|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|last3=Jaffe|first3=Greg}}</ref> Donovan was tracked by the [[FBI]] for nine months.<ref name=":0" />  In late November 2017, after CounterPunch had published several more pieces by "Donovan", ''The Washington Post'' contacted Jeffrey St. Clair about her.  The co-editor said that Donovan's pitches did not stand out amongst the pitches that ''CounterPunch'' received daily<ref name=":0" /> and began making inquiries.  He asked Donovan to substantiate her identity by sending a photo of her driving license but she did not.<ref name=":0" /> On the same day ''The Washington Post'' article was published on Donovan, St. Clair and Frank published a piece stating that ''CounterPunch'' only ran one article by Alice Donovan during the 2016 election, which was on cyber-breaches of medical databases. Donovan was also exposed by the newsletter as a serial plagiarizer.<ref name="GoAskAlice">{{cite web|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/12/25/go-ask-alice-the-curious-case-of-alice-donovan-2/|title=Go Ask Alice: the Curious Case of "Alice Donovan"|author=Jeffrey St. Clair and Joshua Frank|date=December 25, 2017|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=January 6, 2018|quote=In sum, we published five stories by Donovan. One was apolitical. Four could be considered critiques of US foreign policy during the Trump administration. None mentioned Hillary Clinton, Vladimir Putin, the 2016 elections, Wikileaks or Julian Assange.}}</ref> In another follow-up article St. Clair and Frank exposed a network of alleged trolls that operated a site called Inside Syria Media Center promoting a pro-[[Bashar al-Assad]] and pro-Russian view of the [[Syrian Civil War]]. St. Clair and Frank speculated that the website was connected to the same network of trolls as Alice Donovan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/01/05/ghosts-in-the-propaganda-machine/|title=Ghosts in the Propaganda Machine|author=Jeffrey St. Clair and Joshua Frank|date=January 5, 2018|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}</ref>

The lobby group [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]] (CAMERA) that counters criticism of the Israeli government in U.S. media in 2007 described ''CounterPunch'' as an "extremist anti-Israel web site."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_print=1&x_context=2&x_outlet=118&x_article=1280 |title=Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris and Peace not Apartheid |date=February 7, 2007 |publisher=CAMERA |accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref> ''CounterPunch'' was also criticized for an interview with [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]] in which he made controversial comments on Israel and a "Jewish lobby".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boteach|first1=Shmuley|title=The Anti-Semitic Stench of Pink Floyd|url=http://observer.com/2013/12/the-anti-semitic-stench-of-pink-floyd/|website=Observer.com|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=2013-12-12}}</ref> Waters in a separate interview with ''[[Haaretz]]'' stated that he hates apartheid and not Israelis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/1.668705 |title=Roger Waters Sets the Record Straight: I Hate Apartheid, Not Israel|author=Gideon Levy |date=August 2, 2015 |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, [[Adrian Chen]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called ''CounterPunch'' a "respected left-leaning" publication following accusations that ''CounterPunch'' promoted a pro-Russian agenda.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-propaganda-about-russian-propaganda |title=The Propaganda About Russian Propaganda |author=Adrian Chen |date=December 1, 2016 |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>
