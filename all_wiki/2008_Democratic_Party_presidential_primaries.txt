The '''2008 Democratic presidential primaries''' were the selection processes by which voters of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] chose its nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]] was selected as the nominee, becoming [[List of African-American firsts|the first African American]] to secure the presidential nomination of any major political party in the United States. However, due to a close race between Obama and Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], the contest remained competitive for longer than expected, and neither candidate received enough pledged delegates from state primaries and caucuses to achieve a majority, without endorsements from unpledged delegates ([[superdelegates]]).

The presidential primaries actually consisted of both [[primary election]]s and [[caucus]]es, depending upon what the individual [[U.S. state|state]] chose. The goal of the process was to elect the majority of the 4,233 [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s to the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], which was held from Sunday, August 25, through Wednesday, August 28, 2008, in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. To secure the nomination, a candidate needed to receive at least 2,117 votes at the convention—or a simple majority of the 4,233 delegate votes. This total included half-votes from [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], and [[Democrats Abroad]], as well as '[[superdelegates]]'—party leaders and elected officials who were not chosen through a primary or caucus. The race was further complicated by a controversy over the scheduling of the [[Michigan]] and [[Florida]] state primaries, which had been scheduled earlier than party rules permitted, affecting the number of delegates that those states sent to the national convention.

The popular vote tally from most news organizations did not include Iowa, Maine, Nevada, and Washington. These states did not release the results of the popular vote from their caucuses. The media reports did include Florida, which neither Clinton nor Obama contested, and Michigan. Both states were penalized by the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) for violating party rules. Michigan proved a source of controversy due to the change in the date of the primary election. Consequently, Obama and other candidates removed their names from the ballot yet Clinton did not. The DNC did not count the popular vote from Michigan, and evenly split the state's delegates between Clinton and Obama. As a result, without the Michigan vote, Obama won the popular vote; whereas with the votes from Michigan, Clinton won the popular vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/democratic_vote_count.html |title=Democratic Vote Count |publisher=Real Clear Politics |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, regardless of how votes were counted, the candidates' totals were within less than one percent of each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/06/clinton-and-the-popular-vote/ |title=Clinton and the Popular Vote |publisher=FactCheck.org |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2016}}</ref>

Obama received enough superdelegate endorsements on June 3 to claim that he had secured the simple majority of delegates necessary to win the nomination, and Clinton conceded the nomination four days later.<ref>{{cite news | last=Weisman | first=Jonathan | title=Strategy Was Based On Winning Delegates, Not Battlegrounds | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/03/AR2008060304268.html | work=The Washington Post |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2008|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nedra |last=Pickler |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/24/ap-obamas-political-team_n_103396.html |title=AP: Obama's Political Team Out-Organized Clinton |work=The Huffington Post |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=March 7, 2012 |date=May 24, 2008}}</ref> Obama was nominated on the first ballot, at the August convention. He went on to win the general election, and became the 44th President of the United States on January 20, 2009. Clinton went on to serve as Obama's [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] for his first term as president, and the Democratic nominee for president in 2016.

== Delegate system ==
Delegates are the people who decided the nomination at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. Delegates from fifty [[US states]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]] had a single vote each, while delegates from [[American Samoa]], the [[Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]] and [[Democrats Abroad]], as well as the states of [[Florida Democratic primary, 2008|Florida]] and [[Michigan Democratic primary, 2008|Michigan]], which contravened the schedule, had half a vote each. Thus, the total number of delegates was slightly higher than the total number of available delegate votes (4,049).<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P08/D-Alloc.phtml#Terr |title=Democratic Delegate Allocation - 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}</ref> This is now updated to 4,233 with FL-MI delegations.

=== Pledged delegates ===
In the modern [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary system]], candidates for the nomination campaign in a series of primary elections and caucus events. For the Democratic Party, the results from these primaries and caucuses determine the number of ''pledged delegates'' committed to vote for each candidate at the [[Democratic National Convention]], intended to reflect the will of the voters. These delegates are not legally bound to vote for the candidate they represent, but candidates may remove delegates whom they feel may be disloyal, and delegates generally vote as pledged.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/02/delegate.explainer/index.html |title=Why delegates matter in the presidential race |work=CNN | date=January 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Under the party's ''Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention'', delegates were allocated to each of the fifty U.S. states according to two main criteria: the proportion of votes each state had given to the Democratic candidate in the previous three presidential elections, and the percentage of votes each state had in the [[United States Electoral College]]. In addition, fixed numbers of delegates were allocated to the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and [[Democrats Abroad]].<ref name="Dem rules">{{cite web|publisher=[[Democratic National Committee]] |title=Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention |date=August 19, 2006 |url=http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/rules.pdf |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006191218/http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/rules.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2010 }}</ref> In 2008, a total of 3,253 pledged delegate votes would be awarded through the primaries and caucuses.

=== Superdelegates ===
{{Main|List of Democratic Party (United States) superdelegates, 2008}}

[[Superdelegate]] votes are given equal weight to the votes of pledged delegates. Superdelegates are members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], state and territorial [[List of current United States Governors|governors]], members of the [[Democratic National Committee]], distinguished party leaders, and add-on delegates selected by the [[Democratic Party (United States)#State and territorial parties|state parties]]. They represented almost 20 percent <!-- 19.45% --> of the total 4,233 delegates.

The number and composition of superdelegates had the potential to change right up to the start of the Democratic National Convention. The total number of superdelegate votes at the start of the primary season in October 2007 stood at 850. Various events such as deaths, elections, and disqualifications may alter the final number of superdelegates voting in the primary.

While officially uncommitted until the convention, the superdelegates may publicly endorse or commit to a candidate at any time. The presidential candidates compete heavily for these commitments. News organizations survey the superdelegates periodically throughout the election season and try to calculate how many have committed to each of the candidates. The media often include these superdelegate estimates in their reporting on the race, leading to differing delegate counts from various news sources.

=== Delegate selection rules ===
[[File:43rd Legislative District Democratic Caucus 1.jpg|thumb|right|Washington Democrats meet in the legislative district caucuses.]]

Under the Democratic Party's ''Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention'',<ref name="Dem rules"/> delegates are awarded by [[proportional representation]], with a minimum 15 percent threshold required to receive delegates. Each state party is required to publish its own state level delegate selection plan, indicating how the state will select delegates at the congressional and statewide level, how the delegation will implement the party's [[affirmative action]] policy, and how the delegation will ensure an equal balance between women and men. Those plans were adopted at state conventions and forwarded to the national party in mid-2007.

In most state caucuses, the viability threshold must be met at each level in the process, from the precinct level upwards. This puts enormous pressure on the remaining candidates to gain the support of voters whose chosen candidates fall below the 15 percent mark.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQ's |publisher=Nevada State Democratic Party |url=http://www.nvdemscaucus.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=13&Itemid=30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123201111/http://www.nvdemscaucus.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=13&Itemid=30 |archivedate=January 23, 2008 }} See also: {{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703085604/http://www.iowafirstcaucus.org/faqs.php |archivedate=July 3, 2007 |url=http://www.iowafirstcaucus.org/faqs.php |title=Iowa Democratic Party Precinct Caucus Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Iowa Democratic Party]] }}</ref> The focus on viability is designed to weed out small, divisive factions from gaining delegates to disrupt the national convention. However, this can result in candidates gaining viability in some precincts but not in others, and a complicated "caucus math" is required to allocate delegates to the county and state conventions for each precinct.<ref>{{cite news |title=So why DO we caucus, anyway? |first=Ed |last=Tibbetts |work=[[Quad-City Times]] |date=December 15, 2007 |url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2007/12/15/news/local/doc4764bb64e0b44787047257.txt }}</ref> In the primaries, the viability threshold is set based on statewide and congressional district votes. At-large and PLEO (Party Leaders and Elected Officials) delegates are allocated based on statewide votes, while district-level delegates are allocated by district votes.<ref name="Dem rules"/>

=== Early campaigning ===
[[File:Mgravelgrandpa.jpg|thumb|right|Mike Gravel at the launch of his presidential campaign in April 2006]]
The earliest significant candidate to launch their candidacy was [[Mike Gravel]] in April 2006. However, for the most part, the race for the 2008 presidential nomination did not truly begin in earnest until after the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]]. Between November 2006 and February 2007, eight major candidates opened their campaigns: [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|Joe Biden]], [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|Hillary Clinton]], [[Chris Dodd 2008 presidential campaign|Chris Dodd]], [[John Edwards 2008 presidential campaign|John Edwards]], [[Dennis Kucinich 2008 presidential campaign|Dennis Kucinich]], [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|Barack Obama]], [[Bill Richardson 2008 presidential campaign|Bill Richardson]], and [[Tom Vilsack]]. Potential candidates [[John Kerry]], [[Al Gore]], [[Russ Feingold]], [[Evan Bayh]], [[Tom Daschle]], [[Wesley Clark]], [[Sam Nunn]], [[Mark Warner]], and [[Al Sharpton]] reportedly considered running but ultimately declined to seek the nomination. Vilsack dropped out in February 2007.

Obama won the Iowa caucuses with 38% of the vote, over Edwards by 30% and Clinton by 29%. His victory brought him to national prominence as many voters tuned into the race for the first time. In a speech given that evening, he defined the word "change" as the primary theme of his campaign and said, "On this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/01/obama_says_time.html |title=Obama says time for change has come |first= Foon |last=Rhee |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=January 3, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}</ref> The delegate count was virtually tied, but Clinton's surprising third-place finish in the popular vote damaged her image as being the "inevitable" nominee.<ref name="politico01/03/08">{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0108/7695.html |title= Obama and Huckabee win big in Iowa |work=[[politico.com]] |first=Bill |last=Nichols |date=January 3, 2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref> However, she remained upbeat, saying "This race begins tonight and ends when Democrats throughout America have their say.

After Obama's upset win in the Iowa caucuses, it appeared to many political observers that he would ride a wave of momentum through the New Hampshire primary and then go on to win the Democratic nomination. Eulogies were published on the Clinton campaign,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/07/AR2008010702263.html |title=A Candidacy's Prose and Cons |author=Dionne, E.

At the [[Saint Anselm College]] New Hampshire [[debate]] on January 5, 2008, Edwards sided with Obama against Clinton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/us/politics/06dems.html |title=At Debate, Two Rivals Go After Defiant Clinton |first=Patrick |last=Healy |author2= Jeff Zelaney |work=The New York Times |date=January 6, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2008}}</ref> In one noted exchange, Edwards said that Clinton could not bring about change, while he and Obama could, saying "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack." Clinton passionately retorted, saying, "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is somebody who can deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2008/01/edwards-he-obam.html |title=Edwards: He & Obama share a 'conviction alliance' |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 6, 2008 |first=Mark |last=Memmott |author2= Jill Lawrence |accessdate=January 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117032103/http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2008/01/edwards-he-obam.html |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}</ref> It came to be seen as the defining statement for her candidacy.

Voters rallied to Clinton's defense, and she won a surprising 3% victory over Obama in the popular vote. They tied in the delegate count. Richardson withdrew from the race on January 10.
Momentum shifted in Clinton's favor, and she won the popular vote in the Nevada caucuses eleven days later, despite Obama's endorsement from the influential [[Culinary Workers Union]]. However, Obama ran strongly in rural areas throughout the state, and he beat Clinton in the delegate count. Edwards's support collapsed in Nevada, as voters coalesced around the two apparent frontrunners. Dennis Kucinich withdrew from the race. In the following week, issues regarding [[Race in the United States|race]] came to the fore as campaigning began for the South Carolina primary, the first to feature a large proportion of [[African American]]s in the Democratic electorate. Behind in the state polls, Clinton left to campaign in some [[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday]] states,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-south-carolina|title=Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton South Carolina | work=Huffington Post}}</ref> while her husband, former president [[Bill Clinton]], stayed in South Carolina and engaged in a series of exchanges with Obama.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/01/report_hillary_largely_skippin.php |work=Talking Points Memo |title=Hillary Largely Skipping South Carolina, Leaving The State To Bill |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325124656/http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/01/report_hillary_largely_skippin.php |archivedate=March 25, 2012 }}</ref> [[CBS News]] reported, "By injecting himself into the Democratic primary campaign with a series of inflammatory and negative statements, Bill Clinton may have helped his wife's presidential hopes in the long term but at the cost of his reputation with a group of voters [African Americans] that have long been one of his strongest bases of political support."<ref name = cbs-vv-2008-01>{{Cite news

Neither Clinton nor Obama had a clear advantage heading into the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries, with 23 states and territories and 1,681 delegates at stake and more media attention than any primary election day in American history.

As the primaries continued, various groups tried to negotiate a resolution to the standoff between the DNC and the state parties.

=== Super Tuesday ===
{{Main|Super Tuesday (2008)}}
[[File:Hillary Clinton HQ 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Staffers make phone calls to voters from Clinton's national campaign headquarters.]]

Traditionally, the Tuesday on which the greatest number of states hold primary elections is known as [[Super Tuesday]]. In 2007, many states moved their primaries or caucuses to early in the year so they could have greater influence over the race. As February 5 was the earliest date to be allowed by the Democratic National Committee, 23 states and territories moved their elections to that date. 2008's Super Tuesday became the date of the nation's first quasi-national primary. It was dubbed "Super Duper Tuesday"<ref>{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Schneider (journalist) |title=It could all be over after 'Super Tuesday' |work=CNN |date=February 7, 2007 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/02/05/schneider.superduper.tuesday/index.html |accessdate=June 3, 2007}}</ref> or "Tsunami Tuesday,"<ref>{{cite news |author=Todd, Chuck |author-link=Chuck Todd |title=Will Tsunami Tuesday be an Afterthought? |date=May 10, 2007 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18593870 |work=NBC News}}</ref> among other names.

On election night, both Obama and Clinton claimed victories. In the popular vote, Obama won 13 states and territories to Clinton's 10. This included the states of Idaho and Georgia, where Obama won by very wide margins. His wins in Connecticut and Missouri were considered upsets. However, Clinton won the large electoral prizes of California and Massachusetts, where some analysts had expected the Kennedy endorsements might carry Obama to the victory. Although Obama gained significant ground from where he was polling in mid-January, it was not enough to close the gap in those states. In exit polls, Obama gained some overwhelming support of African-American voters, and he strengthened his base among college-educated voters and voters younger than the age of 45. Clinton found significant support among white women, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]s, and voters over age 65. Obama ran strongest in caucus states, [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain states]], [[Southern United States|Southern states]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern states]]. Clinton ran strongest in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern states]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern states]], and states bordering [[Arkansas]], where she served as first lady while her husband served as that state's governor. When the delegate counting was finished, Obama won an estimated 847 pledged delegates to Clinton's 834. Early in the primary season, many observers had predicted that the nomination would be over after [[Super Tuesday]], but the general verdict on election night was that the candidates had drawn to a virtual tie and that the race for the Democratic presidential nomination would not likely be settled for at least a month.<ref name="hookbarabak">{{cite news |last=Hook |first=Janet |author2=Mark Z.

=== Mid-February contests ===
In the following week, it became clear that a tie on Super Tuesday would leave Obama better positioned for the upcoming contests in February, where the demographics of several large states seemed to favor him.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cillizza |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Cillizza |title=What's Next |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/02/whats_next.html |department=The Fix |work=The Washington Post |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830071103/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/02/whats_next.html |archivedate=August 30, 2008 }}</ref> The day after Super Tuesday, February 6, Clinton announced that she had personally lent her campaign $5 million in January.<ref name="hookbarabak"/> The news came as a surprise and set off another round of news stories about Clinton donors and supporters concerned about the campaign's strategy. It was particularly striking in light of Obama's announcement that he had raised a record-high $32 million in January, tapping 170,000 new contributors.<ref>{{cite news |last=Zeleny |first=Jeff |author2=Leslie Wayne |date=February 1, 2008 |work=The New York Times |title=Enlisting New Donors, Obama Reaped $32 Million in January |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/us/politics/01donate.html }}</ref> It became clear that Obama's financial advantage had allowed him to organize and compete in some broader states on Super Tuesday, an advantage that was likely to continue in the upcoming months and weeks. In response, Clinton's supporters raised $6 million online in 36 hours, but Obama's campaign upped the ante, announcing their own total of $7.5 million in 36 hours and starting a new goal of reaching 500,000 new contributors in 2008 by late February.<ref>{{cite news |last=Healy |first=Patrick |author2=Jeff Zeleny |title=Obama Outshines Clinton at Raising Funds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/us/politics/08clinton.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref>

As expected, Obama swept the three nominating events on February 9, which were thought to favor him based on the results in similar states that had voted previously. He then scored a convincing win in [[Maine]], where Clinton had hoped to hold her ground.<ref>{{cite news |last=Seelye |first=Katharine Q. |title=Maine to Obama; Clinton Replaces Campaign Leader |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/us/politics/11dems.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> The same day, Clinton's campaign announced that campaign advisor [[Patti Solis Doyle]] would resign. Obama's momentum carried throughout the following week, as he scored large delegate gains in the [[Potomac Primaries]], taking the lead in the nationwide [[Results of the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries#Popular vote|popular vote]], even under the projection most favorable to Clinton, with Florida and Michigan included. [[NBC News]] declared him "Mr. Frontrunner" on February 13.<ref>{{cite news |last=Todd |first=Chuck |title=First Thoughts: Mr. Front-Runner |work=First Read |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/02/13/661146.aspx |display-authors=etal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401022002/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/02/13/661146.aspx |archivedate=April 1, 2008 }}</ref> Clinton attempted a comeback win in the demographically more favorable state of Wisconsin, but Obama won again by a larger margin than expected. In 11 days, he swept 11 contests and extended his pledged delegate lead by 120. By the end of the month, Obama had 1,192 pledged delegates to Clinton's 1,035. He also began closing the gap in superdelegates, although Clinton still led among superdelegates by 240–191. Clinton's campaign tried to downplay the results of the February contests, and the candidate refused to acknowledge the losses in her speeches on election nights.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Her advisers acknowledged that she would need big wins in the upcoming states to turn the race around.

=== March ===
{{See also|Jeremiah Wright controversy|A More Perfect Union (speech)}}

With four states and 370 delegates at stake, March 4 was dubbed "Mini-Super Tuesday" or "[[Super Tuesday II, 2008|Super Tuesday II]]". Just as Obama had been favored in the mid-February states, Clinton was favored in Ohio, with its high proportion of [[working-class]] white voters and older voters, and Texas, with its high proportion of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] voters. Exit polls in previous states showed that all three groups were a part of Clinton's base. In mid-February, Clinton held a 10-point lead in Texas and a 20-point lead in Ohio in [[RealClearPolitics]] polling averages.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/tx/texas_democratic_primary-312.html RealClearPolitics, Texas Polling Average], [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/oh/ohio_democratic_primary-263.html RealClearPolitics, Ohio Polling Average]</ref> Her campaign set its sights on the Ohio-Texas "firewall," counting on a clear March 4 win to change the narrative and turn her campaign around for the nomination. Meanwhile, Obama hoped to win one or both states that might be enough to knock Clinton out of the race. By February 25, according to a [[CNN]] poll, they were in a statistical dead heat in Texas.<ref>{{cite news |last=Steinhauser |first=Paul |title=Poll: It's all tied up for Dems in Texas |work=CNN |date=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/25/texas.poll}}</ref>

[[File:Hillary Clinton Lorain 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton campaigns in Lorain, Ohio.]]

In the last week of February, Clinton's campaign seemed to be back on its feet. A [[Saturday Night Live]] sketch mocked the media for its supposedly biased coverage in favor of Obama, and Clinton used the sketch to argue that Obama had not received proper scrutiny. The media responded by taking a more critical look at Obama's campaign.<ref name="tonechanges">{{cite news |last=Seelye |first=Katharine Q. |title=News Coverage Changes, and So Does Tone of the Campaign |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/us/politics/05press.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 5, 2008|accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Meanwhile, Obama supporter and former fundraiser [[Tony Rezko]] went on trial in a political corruption case in Chicago. While Obama was not implicated, questions remained about how forthcoming he had been about his relationship with Rezko.<ref name="tonechanges"/> Controversy also erupted when it was reported in the Canadian press that Obama economic advisor [[Austan Goolsbee]] had privately offered assurances that Obama's anti-[[North American Free Trade Agreement]] rhetoric on the campaign trail was exaggerated. Obama's campaign denied the substance of the report, but their response was muddled by a series of missteps and may have hurt the candidate's standing with Ohio voters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Carrie Budoff |title=Conflicting Obama answers on NAFTA meeting |work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/8819.html |date=March 4, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Clinton launched a five-point attack on Obama's qualifications, "unleashing what one Clinton aide called a 'kitchen sink' fusillade," according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Healy |first=Patrick and Julie Bosman |title=Clinton Campaign Starts 5-Point Attack on Obama |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/us/politics/26clinton.html |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Perhaps the most damaging component was a campaign ad that aired in Texas, using the imagery of the [[White House]] "red phone" to suggest that Obama would not be prepared to handle a crisis as commander-in-chief when a phone call comes into the White House at 3 a.m. The ad drew significant media attention in the four days before the election.<ref>{{cite news |last=Seelye |first=Katharine Q. |author2=Jeff Zeleny |title=Clinton Questions Role of Obama in a Crisis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/us/politics/01campaign.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 22, 2008 |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}</ref>  In the general-election campaign, McCain used parts of the ad against Obama.<ref>{{cite news | last = Glover | first = Mike | title = McCain ad returns to Clinton's 3 a.m. phone call | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = August 26, 2008 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-08-26-3886087604_x.htm | access-date = December 28, 2016}}</ref>

On election night, Clinton scored convincing wins in Ohio and Rhode Island. She narrowly won the Texas primary, while losing the Texas caucus. She pitched her wins that night as a comeback: "For everyone here in Ohio and across America who's ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out, and for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up, and for everyone who works hard and never gives up, this one is for you."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/hillary_clintons_ohio_primary.html |title=Hillary Clinton's Ohio Primary Victory Speech}}</ref>

Obama focused on the "delegate math." He won the total delegate count in Texas, and he stayed close to Clinton on the delegate count in Ohio. "No matter what happens tonight," he said, "we have nearly the same delegate lead that we did this morning, and we are on our way to winning this nomination."<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |title=Big Wins for Clinton in Texas and Ohio; McCain Clinches Race as Foe Concedes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/us/politics/05primary.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 5, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> In fact, March 4 was the first election day in which Clinton won more delegates than Obama (though the Florida and Michigan primaries would later be honored by seating half of the states' delegations). After winning contests in Wyoming and Mississippi the following week, Obama erased Clinton's March 4 gains. On March 15, he increased his lead by 10 delegates at the Iowa county conventions, when former supporters of withdrawn candidates switched their support to him.

After the March contests, the Democratic race entered a six-week period with no upcoming contests until April 22. As the campaigns settled in for the long haul, advisors for both candidates escalated their rhetoric and stepped up attacks in their daily [[conference call]]s. News reports described the tenor as increasingly "rancorous" and "vitriolic."<ref>{{cite news |last=Seeyle |first=Katherine Q. |author2=Julie Bosman |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/us/politics/01fight.html |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008 |title=Carrying Primary Scars Into the General Election }} See also: {{cite news |last=Cillizza |first=Chris |work=The Washington Post |department=The Fix |title=FixCam: Obamacains and McClintons |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008 |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/03/fixcam_obamaniacs_and_mcclinto.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321030407/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/03/fixcam_obamaniacs_and_mcclinto.html |archivedate=March 21, 2012 }}</ref>

On March 14, clips of controversial [[sermon]]s from Obama's former pastor, [[Jeremiah Wright]], resurfaced on [[YouTube]] and received heavy airtime on cable news television. Among other things, Wright said, "God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme." Four days later, Obama responded to the controversy in a 37-minute speech, speaking openly about race and religion in the United States. He denounced Wright's remarks while refusing to condemn the pastor himself, and he attempted to pivot from the immediate circumstances to address the larger theme of "[[A More Perfect Union (speech)|A More Perfect Union]]." The speech was regarded as "breathtakingly unconventional" in its political strategy and tone,<ref>{{cite news |last=Carney |first=James |title=Obama's Bold Gamble on Race |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1723302,00.html |date=March 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> and it received generally positive reviews in the press.

As the race continued to Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina, many observers concluded that Clinton had little chance to overcome Obama's lead in pledged delegates.<ref>{{cite news |last=Alter |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Alter |title=Hillary's New Math Problem |work=Newsweek |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/119010}}</ref> Even if she were to succeed in changing the dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios.<ref name="narrowpath">{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |title=Clinton Facing Narrower Path to Nomination |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/us/politics/20memo.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Some analysts believed Clinton could still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cillizza |first=Chris |department=The Fix |work=The Washington Post |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/03/the_blueprint_hillary_rodham_c.html |title=Clinton's Blueprint for Victory |date=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725040829/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/03/the_blueprint_hillary_rodham_c.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> However, the window of opportunity for re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March,<ref name="narrowpath"/> and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pelosi's Delegate Stance Boosts Obama |date=March 14, 2008 |work=[[ABC News]] |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/03/pelosis-delegat.html |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref>

Complicating the equation for Democrats, presidential candidate [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|John McCain]] clinched the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Republican nomination]] on March 4. With Obama and Clinton engaged in the Democratic primary, McCain was free to define his candidacy for the general election largely unchallenged. Some Democrats expressed concern that Clinton stayed in the campaign through March and April, when they felt she had little chance to win the nomination, but a much greater chance to damage Obama's candidacy in the general election. However, others defended Clinton's right to continue on, arguing that a sustained campaign was good for the Democratic Party and that Clinton still had a realistic shot at the nomination.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |author2=Carl Hulse |title=Clinton Success Changes Dynamic In Delegate Hunt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/us/politics/06elect.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref>

On April 22, Clinton scored a convincing win in Pennsylvania. However, on May 6, Obama surprised many observers by winning North Carolina by almost 15 percentage points, effectively erasing Clinton's gains in Pennsylvania. Clinton won by only 1 point in Indiana. With Obama now leading by 164 pledged delegates and with only 217 pledged delegates left to be decided in the remaining contests, many pundits declared that the primary was effectively over. Obama gave an election night speech that looked forward to the general election campaign against McCain.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rutenberg |first=Jim |work=The New York Times |date=May 8, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/us/politics/07cnd-pundits.html |title=Pundits Declare the Race Over}}</ref> The pace of superdelegate endorsements increased. On May 10, Obama's superdelegate total surpassed Clinton's for the first time in the race, making the math increasingly difficult for a Clinton win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/05/10/obama-picks-up-utah-superdelegate |work=[[Fox News]] |date=May 10, 2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2008 |title=Obama Takes Superdelegate Lead for the First Time}}</ref>

Clinton vowed to continue campaigning, and won convincingly in primaries in [[West Virginia]] on May 13, and [[Kentucky]] on May 20 where Appalachian voters strongly preferred her over Obama. However, Obama was able to clear a victory in Oregon on May 20, which allowed him to clinch the majority of pledged delegates. Obama gave a speech in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the state that propelled his candidacy, in which he stated, "You have put us within reach of the Democratic nomination for president of the United States of America."<ref>"Obama's Remarks in Des Moines," transcript, ''NY Times,'' May 20, 2008.

However, even under the most favorable seating arrangement, she would not have been able to take a lead in pledged delegates and would have had to rely on superdelegates to win the nomination. On May 31, the rules committee accepted the Michigan state party's 69-59 distribution of pledged delegates and restored half votes to Florida's and Michigan's delegations. This resulted in a net gain for Clinton of 24 pledged delegates. Obama remained significantly ahead, with a lead of 137 pledged delegates before the [[Puerto Rico Democratic primary, 2008|Puerto Rico primary]] on June 1.

On June 3, the day of the final primaries in South Dakota and Montana, Obama rolled out about sixty superdelegate endorsements. Those endorsements, together with the pledged delegates awarded in the final primaries, put him well over the "magic number" of 2,117 delegate votes necessary for a majority at the Democratic National Convention. By early in the evening, all major news organizations had announced that Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination, and Obama claimed the status of [[presumptive nominee]] in a speech in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. Clinton did not concede the nomination in her election night speech, saying that she would be "making no decisions tonight".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.democrats/index.html|title=Obama: I will be the Democratic nominee|date=June 3, 2008|publisher=CNN|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}</ref> On the morning of June 5, Clinton posted on her website an open letter to her supporters, which she also sent by e-mail that day. It announced that on Saturday (June 7) Clinton would endorse Obama's candidacy. During a well received concession speech in Washington DC on Saturday June 7 Clinton endorsed Obama in the following terms:
"The way to continue our fight now, to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy, our passion, our strength, and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama, the next president of the United States.
Today, as I suspend my campaign, I congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary race he has run. I endorse him and throw my full support behind him."

== Voter turnout ==
[[File:Primary 2008 Voter Turnout.svg|thumb|right|350px|Democratic primary turnout exceeded Republican turnout in most states through March 4 (when [[John McCain]] clinched the Republican nomination). The eight exceptions were Alabama, Alaska, McCain's home state of Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, and Florida and Michigan, where the Democratic primaries had been nullified.]]

[[Voter turnout]] was at historically high levels in the 2008 primaries and caucuses, with many contests setting all-time records for turnout. Voter turnout on Super Tuesday was at 27% of eligible citizens, breaking the previous record of 25.9% set in 1972.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katharine |last=Seelye |title=The Caucus: Records for Turnout |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E6D71031F934A35751C0A96E9C8B63&scp=11&sq=voter+turnout+democratic&st=nyt# |work=The New York Times |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2008 }}</ref> Turnout was higher among Democrats than [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], with Democratic turnout surpassing Republican turnout even in traditionally [[red states]] where the number of registered Democrats is proportionally low.<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Herszenhorn |title=Senate Democrats Hope for a Majority Not Seen in 30 Years: 60 Seats |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/us/politics/07senate.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2008 }}</ref> Many states reported high levels of Democratic [[voter registration]] in the weeks before primaries.<ref>{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Kaplan |title=Connecticut Sees Surge of Voters for Primary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/nyregion/05conn.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2008 }}</ref> From January 3 through February 5, Democratic turnout exceeded Republican turnout, 19.1 million to 13.1 million.<ref name="Garber">{{cite news |first=Kent |last=Garber |title=High Democratic Turnout Sends a Mixed Signal for November |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/02/28/high-democratic-turnout-sends-a-mixed-signal-for-november.html |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |date=March 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2008 }}</ref>
{{Quotation|In the first five weeks of 2008, 'voter turnout' was a phrase that was used almost exclusively in connection with the Democratic Party. There were routine stories of precincts running short on ballots, poll hours being extended, and voters packing haunch to paunch inside community centers and local churches. Crowd sizes were described, often with growing awe, as 'staggering,' 'record breaking,' or 'unprecedented.'|Kent Garber|U.S. News & World Report<ref name="Garber"/>}}

The high Democratic turnout was attributed to several factors:<ref>{{cite news |first= Laris |last= Michael |title=Tight Race and Deep Interest Augur Big Turnout Today |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/11/AR2008021101532.html |work=The Washington Post |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2008 }} See also: {{cite news |first= Peter |last= Whoriskey |title=GEORGIA: Low GOP Enthusiasm |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020502976.html |work=The Washington Post |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2008 }}</ref>
