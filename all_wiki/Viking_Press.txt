'''Viking Press''' (formally '''Viking Penguin''', also listed as '''Viking Books''') is an American [[publishing company]] now owned by [[Penguin Random House]]. It was founded in [[New York City]] on March 1, 1925, by Harold K. Guinzburg and George S. Oppenheim<ref name=newyork>{{cite book|author1=Kenneth T.

==History==
Guinzburg, a Harvard graduate and former employee of Simon and Schuster and Oppenheimer, a graduate of Williams College and Alfred A. Knopf, founded Viking in 1925 with the goal of publishing nonfiction and “distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than ephemeral popular interest.”<ref name=NYTObit>{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bruce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/arts/10guinzburg.html|title=Thomas Guinzburg, Paris Review Co-Founder, Dies at 84|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=September 10, 2010|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}</ref> [[B. W. Huebsch]] joined the firm shortly afterward. Harold Guinzburg's son [[Thomas Guinzburg|Thomas]] became president in 1961.<ref name=NYTObit/>

The firm's name and logo—a [[Viking ship]] drawn by [[Rockwell Kent]]—were meant to evoke the ideas of adventure, exploration, and enterprise implied by the word "[[Viking]]."

In August 1961, they acquired H.B. Huesbsch, which maintained a list of backlist titles from authors such as James Joyce and Sherwood Anderson.  The first imprint was ''The Book of American Negro Spirituals'', edited by James Weldon Johnson.  The young firm focused on aggressive advertising and a liberal return policy.  These policies, along with popular fiction authors Dorothy Parker, D.H. Lawrence and Erskine Caldwell, as well as non-fiction authors Bertrand Russell and Mohandis Gandhi, helped the firm weather the Depression.     

The house has been home to many prominent authors of fiction, non-fiction, and play scripts. Five Viking authors have been awarded [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prizes for Literature]] and one received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]; Viking books have also won numerous [[Pulitzer Prizes]], [[National Book Award]]s, and other important literary prizes.

The Viking Children's Book department was established in 1933; its founding editor was [[May Massee]]. Viking Kestrel was one of its [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s. Its books have won the [[Newbery Medal|Newbery]] and [[Caldecott Medal|Caldecott]] Medals, and include such books as ''[[The Twenty-One Balloons]]'', written and illustrated by [[William Pene du Bois]] (1947, Newbery medal winner for 1948), ''[[Corduroy (book)|Corduroy]]'', ''[[Make Way for Ducklings]]'', ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales|The Stinky Cheese Man]]'' by [[Jon Scieszka]] and [[Lane Smith (illustrator)|Lane Smith]] (1993), ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'', ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'', and ''[[The Story of Ferdinand]]''. Its paperbacks are now published by [[Puffin Books]], which includes the Speak and [[Firebird Books|Firebird]] imprints. From 2012 and {{As of|2016|lc=yes}}, Viking Children's publisher is Kenneth Wright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penguin.com/meet/publishers/vikingchildrensbooks/|website=[[Penguin Random House]]|title=Viking Children's Books|accessdate=April 17, 2016}}</ref>

In 1943, the Viking Portable Library was introduced, a series designed to provide compact, well-printed anthologies for the general reader and college students.  These compilations encompassed works by Hemingway, Steinbeck and Shakespeare.  Over the next decade, Viking published works by Lillian Hellman, Arthur Miller, Rumer Godden and Rex Stout.  Saul Bellow published his third novel, ''The Adventure of Augie March'' in 1953, and would publish his next five works with the press, including the Pulitzer Prize winning ''Humboldt's Gift'' in 1975.  In 1957, Jack Kerouac's ''On the Road'' was published by the press, and during the 1960s Viking published works by Hannah Arendt, Theodore Draper, Zbignew Brzezinski, Ian Fleming, Ken Kesey, and Jimmy Breslin.

Viking publishes approximately 75 books a year. It has published both successful commercial fiction and acclaimed literary fiction and non-fiction, and its paperbacks are most often published by Penguin Books. Viking's current president is [[Brian Tart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/tags-bookseller/brian-tart|title=Brian Tart {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-13}}</ref>

===Viking Children's===
In 1933, Viking Press founded a department called Junior Books to publish children's books. The first book published was ''[[The Story About Ping]]'' in 1933 under editor [[May Massee]]. Other stories published under the Viking label early in its history include ''[[The Story of Ferdinand]]'' (1936), ''[[Make Way for Ducklings]]'' (1941), and ''[[The Twenty-One Balloons]]'' (1947). Junior Books was renamed to Viking Children's Books at some point in the past. It currently publishes approximately sixty titles a year.

==Series==
===Viking Critical Library===
The '''Viking Critical Library''' offers academic editions of [[Classic book|literary texts]]. Like [[W. W. Norton]]'s ''Norton Critical Editions'', all titles print the text alongside a selection of critical essays and contextual documents (including relevant extracts from the author's oeuvre). The series, which only saw sporadic publications in the late '70s and late '90s, has been dormant since 1998, with no new titles released since then. However, a number of existing titles remain in print.
