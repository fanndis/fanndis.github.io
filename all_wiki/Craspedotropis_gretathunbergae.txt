== Taxonomy ==
After the discovery of the species, a vote was conducted among the members of the expedition and the staff of the national park, and a decision was made to name it after Greta Thunberg. According to the scientists, this was a "way of acknowledging that her generation will be responsible for fixing problems that they did not create". The holotype was collected by citizen scientist J.P. Lim.

This is the second animal, after ''[[Nelloptodes gretae]]'', to be named after Greta Thunberg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://independenteagle.com/tiny-2mm-long-snail-found-in-brunei-is-named-after-greta-thunberg/|title=Tiny 2mm-long SNAIL found in Brunei is named after Greta Thunberg|last=Ny6QGwsxiV|date=2020-02-25|website=The Independent Eagle|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
