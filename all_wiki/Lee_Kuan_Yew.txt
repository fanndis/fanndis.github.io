'''Lee Kuan Yew''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|GCMG|CH}} {{post-nominals|list=[[Order of the Crown of Johor|SPMJ]]}} (born '''Harry Lee Kuan Yew'''; 16 September 1923 – 23 March 2015), often referred to by his initials '''LKY''', was a [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politician]] and lawyer who served as the first [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] from 1959 to 1990. As one of the founding members of the [[People's Action Party]], Lee is recognised as the nation's founding father, credited with rapidly transitioning the country from a "[[developing countries|developing]] [[third world country]] into a [[developed country|developed]] [[first world country]] within a single generation" under his leadership.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gic.com.sg/CondolencesMessages.html |title=Condolence Messages from Our Partners |accessdate=23 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420110317/http://www.gic.com.sg/CondolencesMessages.html |archive-date=20 April 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name="CNNgrand">{{cite news |last1=Allison |first1=Graham |title=Lee Kuan Yew: Lessons for leaders from Asia's 'Grand Master' |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/28/opinions/singapore-lee-kuan-yew-graham-allison/ |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=28 March 2015 |accessdate=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110638/http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/28/opinions/singapore-lee-kuan-yew-graham-allison/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Weatherbee |first1=Donald E. |title=Historical Dictionary of United States-Southeast Asia Relations |year=2008 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=9780810864054 |page=213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-boaAAAAQBAJ |accessdate=2 April 2015 |archive-date=26 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426141727/https://books.google.com/books?id=-boaAAAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> 

After attending the [[London School of Economics]], Lee transferred to and graduated from [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]], with [[British undergraduate degree classification#Variations of first-class honours|starred-first-class honours]] in law. He became a [[barrister]] of the [[Middle Temple]] in 1950 and practised law until 1959. Lee co-founded the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) in 1954 and was its first [[Secretary General|secretary-general]] until 1992, leading the party to eight consecutive victories in the [[General elections in Singapore|general elections]]. After Lee stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990, he served as [[Senior Minister]] under his successor [[Goh Chok Tong]] until 2004, then as [[Minister Mentor]] (an advisory post) until 2011, under his son [[Lee Hsien Loong]]. In total, Lee held successive ministerial positions for 56 years. From 1991, he helmed the five-member Tanjong Pagar [[Group representation constituency|Group Representation Constituency]] and ran unopposed for a record five elections. He continued to serve the [[Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency|Tanjong Pagar constituency]] for nearly 60 years as a member of parliament until his death in 2015.<ref name="New York Times March 23, 2015">

Lee [[Self-governance of Singapore#Campaign for Malaysia|campaigned]] for Britain to relinquish its colonial rule, and eventually attained through a [[1962 Singaporean national referendum|national referendum]] a [[People's Action Party–United Malays National Organisation relations#Merger|merger]] with other [[Malaysia Agreement|former British territories]] in Southeast Asia to form [[Malaysia]] in 1963. However, racial strife and ideological differences led to Singapore's [[Singapore in Malaysia|separation]], becoming a sovereign [[city-state]] two years later. With overwhelming parliamentary control at every election, Lee oversaw Singapore's transformation from a British crown colony with a natural deep harbour to a [[developed country]] with a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] economy. In the process, he forged a system of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]], highly effective and non-corrupt government and civil service. Many of his policies are now taught at the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]]. Lee eschewed [[populist]] policies in favour of long-term social and economic planning. He championed [[meritocracy]] and [[multiracialism]] as governing principles, making English the [[common language]] to integrate its immigrant society and to facilitate trade with the world, whilst mandating [[bilingualism]] in schools to preserve students' [[mother tongue]] and ethnic identity.

Lee's rule was criticised particularly in the West for curtailing civil liberties such as media control, limits on public protests, and bringing libel suits against some political opponents. He argued that such disciplinary measures were necessary for political stability which, together with the [[rule of law]], were essential for economic progress.<ref name="rose">{{cite news |url=http://www.charlierose.com/search/?text=Lee+Kuan+Yew |title=Lee Kuan Yew Interview |work=Charlie Rose |date=22 October 2009 |first=Charlie |last=Rose |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402175832/http://www.charlierose.com/search/?text=Lee+Kuan+Yew |archive-date=2 April 2015 }}</ref><ref name="WSJ-lky2">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lee-kuan-yew-singapores-founding-father-dies-at-91-1427056223 |title=Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's Founding Father, Dies at 91 |date=22 March 2015 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312070525/https://www.wsj.com/articles/lee-kuan-yew-singapores-founding-father-dies-at-91-1427056223 |archive-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lee had once responded to critics of his style saying: "Anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle-dusters.

==Personal life==

{{Lee Kuan Yew family tree}}

==Education==
In 1931, Lee Kuan Yew studied at [[List of primary schools in Singapore|Telok Kurau English School]] in Singapore. He described his schoolmates at Telok Kurau as "generally poor and not very bright." He then attended [[Raffles Institution]] in 1935, where he initially had difficulties keeping up with the top 150 students from all over Singapore. Lee joined the [[Scouting|Scouts]] for three years, played [[cricket]], [[tennis]], and [[chess]], and [[debate]]d for the school. He obtained several scholarships, and came top in the School Certificate examinations in 1940, gaining the John Anderson scholarship to attend [[National University of Singapore|Raffles College]] (now the [[National University of Singapore]]). Lee's future wife, [[Kwa Geok Choo]], was his classmate and the only girl at Raffles Institution at that time. Kwa, who was a top-scoring student herself, was the only one to beat his scores in English and economics.<ref name=fromthirdworldtofirst/>

Lee's university education was delayed by [[World War II]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] from 1942 to 1945. After the war, Lee went on to study in England. He briefly attended [[London School of Economics]], as enrolment at the University of Cambridge had already closed. He related that London overwhelmed him, and he sought the more pleasant surroundings of Cambridge. A fellow Raffles College student introduced him to the Censor of Fitzwilliam House, W. S. Thatcher, who admitted him for the 1947 Lent term. He matriculated in January 1947, reading law at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam College]].

Lee graduated [[British undergraduate degree classification|First Class]] in both parts of the [[Tripos]] with an exceptional Starred-First for Part II Law in 1949; this placed him at the very top of his cohort, and he was awarded the Fitzwilliam's Whitlock Prize. He was placed above two contemporaries who later became Professors of Law in Cambridge, including [[Elihu Lauterpacht]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Class Lists 1949|publisher=Cambridge University Reporter|year=1949|location=Cambridge}}</ref> Lee was called to the Bar at the [[Middle Temple]] in 1950. In 1969, he was elected an honorary fellow of Fitzwilliam College and was the most senior of the College's Honorary Fellows for many years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} In 1971, Lee gave the Foundation Lecture – "East and West: the twain have met".<ref name=manandhisideas/>

==Early life==
During World War II, Lee learnt [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and first worked as a SAS (Singapore Administration Service) officer at the Sentosa islands where he listened to Allied radio stations and wrote down what they were reporting in the ''Hōdōbu'' (報道部–a Japanese propaganda department) office.<ref name = "Time 1999">{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Terry |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |title=Lee Kuan Yew |newspaper=Time Asia |location=Hong Kong |date=23 August 1999 |quote=Lee Kuan Yew towers over other Asian leaders on the international stage ... |access-date=14 August 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815041902/http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |archive-date=15 August 2004 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Towards the end of the war, by listening to Allied radio stations, he realised the Japanese were losing the war, and fearing that a brutal war would break out in Singapore as the Japanese made their last stand, he made plans to purchase and move to a farm on the [[Cameron Highlands]] with his family. However, a lift-boy in his office told him his file had been taken out by the security department, and he realised he was being followed by Japanese security personnel (which continued for three months), so he abandoned those plans as he knew if he went ahead, he would be in trouble. Lee set up private small enterprises during the war to survive, among which was one that manufactured stationery glue, branded as "Stikfas".<ref name=manandhisideas/><ref name="LKY My Lifelong Challenge">{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |year=2012 |title=My Lifelong Challenge: Singapore's Bilingual Journey |publisher=Straits Times Press |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-4342-03-2 }}</ref><ref name=econ2015-lky>{{cite news |last1=The Data Team |title=Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore An astonishing record |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/03/lee-kuan-yews-singapore |accessdate=27 March 2015 |work=The Economist |location=London |date=22 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327044409/http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/03/lee-kuan-yews-singapore |archive-date=27 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Lee had a near-miss with a Japanese occupation atrocity. The Japanese army was rounding up Chinese men for questioning and Lee was told to fall in and join the segregated Chinese men. Sensing that something was amiss, he asked for permission to return home to collect his clothes first, and the Japanese guard agreed. It turned out that those who were segregated were taken to the beach to be shot as part of the [[Sook Ching|Sook Ching massacre]].<ref name=fromthirdworldtofirst/><ref>{{Cite book |author=Josey, Alex |title=Lee Kuan Yew Vol. 1  |publisher=Times Books International |location= Singapore |year=1980 |page=41 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xTIMAQAAIAAJ&q=translator |isbn=978-9971-65-043-8 |orig-year=1971}}</ref> The Japanese occupation had a profound impact on the young Lee, who recalled being slapped and forced to kneel for failing to bow to a Japanese soldier. In his memoirs, he described himself "emerged [from the war] determined that no one—neither Japanese nor British—had the right to push and kick us around ... (and) that we could govern ourselves." The occupation also influenced his perceptions of raw power and the effectiveness of harsh punishment in deterring crime.<ref name=Branigin>{{cite news |last1=Branigin |first1=William |title=Lee Kuan Yew, who led Singapore into prosperity over 30-year rule, dies at 91 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/lee-kuan-yew-who-led-singapore-into-prosperity-over-30-year-rule-dies-at-91/2015/03/22/00f7ccbe-d0d4-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html |accessdate=27 March 2015 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=22 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324153449/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/lee-kuan-yew-who-led-singapore-into-prosperity-over-30-year-rule-dies-at-91/2015/03/22/00f7ccbe-d0d4-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html |archive-date=24 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

After the war, whilst studying in England, Lee campaigned for a friend named [[David Widdicombe]], who was in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. He drove Widdicombe around in a lorry and delivered several speeches on his behalf. Widdicombe lost the election in 1950, but went on to become a member of the Inner Temple with Lee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onthehill.info/2016/11/david-widdicombe/|title=David Widdicombe|publisher=On The Hill|date=15 November 2016|access-date=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124625/http://onthehill.info/2016/11/david-widdicombe/|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> After seeing how the British had failed to defend Singapore from the Japanese, Lee assented that Singapore had to govern itself. He returned to Singapore in 1949.<ref name="fromthirdworldtofirst"/><ref name=manandhisideas/> It was around this time that Lee decided to omit his English name, Harry, and simply be known as Lee Kuan Yew.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2054444,00.html |title=Lee Kuan Yew |author=McCarthy, Terry |work=Time |location=New York |date=23 August 1999 |accessdate=6 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904122106/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2054444,00.html |archive-date=4 September 2012 |url-status=live  }}
</ref> Notwithstanding, even until the end of his life, old friends and relatives referred to him as Harry.

==Early political career (1951–1959)==
Lee returned to Singapore to work as a lawyer. Upon his return, Lee worked in [[John Laycock]]'s law firm for $500 per month. He also worked as a legal advisor to the [[Trade union|trade]] and [[students' union]]s.<ref name=fromthirdworldtofirst/> His first experience with politics in Singapore was his role as an election agent for Laycock under the banner of the pro-British [[Progressive Party (Singapore)|Progressive Party]] in the 1951 legislative council elections.<ref name=fromthirdworldtofirst/>

=== Fajar trial ===
Lee was the junior counsel for the Fajar trial in May 1954 when members of the [[University Socialist Club]] were arrested for publishing an article considered [[sedition|seditious]] in the club's magazine ''The Fajar''. Lee claimed that he was the one who invited the lead counsel [[Denis Pritt|D. N. Pritt]] to defend the students, although this was denied by Club members. Lee gained a widespread reputation through the victory of the trial, one of the first sedition trials held in Colonial post-war Malaya. Furthermore, the co-operation between Lee and the Club members strengthened their relationship which helped Lee's future political career and the founding of the PAP.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Men in White: The Untold Story of Singapore's Ruling Political Party |last1=Yap |first1=Sonny |last2=Richard |first2=Lim |last3=Weng |first3=K.

===Formation of the People's Action Party===
Lee formally entered politics when members of the Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Union launched anti-colonial, non-violent protests against the enactment of the national service ordinance law on [[1954 National Service riots|13 May 1954]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Lee Ting Hui |title=The Open United Front: The Communist Struggle In Singapore 1954–1966 |date=1996 |publisher=South Seas Society |location= Singapore |page=49}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Wu Cai Tang |title=Youth on Trial |date=2014 |publisher=Function 8 |location= Singapore |pages=144–145}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Tan Kok Chiang |title=Youth on Trial |date=2014 |publisher=Function 8 |pages=144–145}}</ref> Forty-six to sixty students were arrested after an initial use of violence by members of the police riot squad.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Service Riots of 1954|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1202_2006-07-28.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801044819/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1202_2006-07-28.html|archive-date=1 August 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015|website=Infopedia|publisher=National Library Board}}

The [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) was officially inaugurated on 12 November 1954.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gong|first=Loh Miaw |title=The May 13 Generation: The Chinese Middle School Student Movement and Singapore Politics in the 1950s |year=2011 |publisher=Strategic Information and Research Development Centre |location=Malaysia |page=229}}</ref> Together with a group of fellow English-educated middle-class men whom he described as "beer-swilling [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]", Lee formed the socialist PAP in an alliance with the pro-communist trade unionists. This alliance was described by Lee as a [[marriage of convenience]] since his English-speaking group needed the Chinese-speaking majority's mass support base.<ref name="thesingaporestory"/> Their common aim was to struggle for self-government and put an end to British colonial rule in Malaya. An inaugural conference was held at the [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall|Victoria Memorial Hall]], attended by over 1,500 supporters and trade unionists. Lee became [[Secretary (title)|secretary-general]], a post he held until 1992, save for a brief period in 1957.<ref name="thesingaporestory" />

===Leader of the Opposition===
Lee Kuan Yew won the [[Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency|Tanjong Pagar]] seat in the 1955 elections. He became the [[Leader of the Opposition]] against [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]]'s [[Labour Front]]-led coalition government in Parliament. He was also one of PAP's representatives to the two constitutional discussions held in London over the future status of Singapore, the first led by Marshall and the second by [[Lim Yew Hock]], Marshall's hardline successor. It was during this period that Lee had to contend with rivals from both within and outside the PAP.<ref name=thesingaporestory/>

Lee's position in the PAP was seriously under threat in 1957 when pro-communists took over the leadership posts, following a party conference which the party's left-wing had stacked with fake members.<ref>Mauzy, Diane K.; Milne, R.S. (2002). ''Singapore Politics Under the People's Action Party''. London & New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-24653-9}}.</ref> Fortunately for Lee and the party's moderate faction, [[Lim Yew Hock]] ordered a [[mass arrest]] of the pro-communists and Lee was reinstated as secretary-general. After the communist "scare", Lee subsequently received a new, stronger mandate from his Tanjong Pagar constituents in a by-election in 1957.<ref name="success">{{cite book |title= Management of Success: The Moulding of Modern Singapore |author1=Sandhu, Kernial Singh |author2=Wheatley, Paul |page=73 |publisher= Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 1989 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ldKwPQ2PyBAC&q=lee+kuan+yew+by-election+in+1957|isbn= 9789813035423 }}</ref>

===Self-government administration (1959–1963)===
In the [[1959 Singaporean general election|national elections]] held on 30 May 1959, the [[People's Action Party|PAP]] won 43 of the 51 seats in the legislative assembly. Singapore gained self-government with autonomy in all state matters except defence and foreign affairs, and Lee became the first Prime Minister of Singapore on 3 June 1959, taking over from Chief Minister [[Lim Yew Hock]].<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/433440/1/.html| title = State of Singapore came into being 50 years ago on 3 June| date = 2 June 2009| location = Singapore| publisher = Channel NewsAsia| author = Hoe Yeen Nie| accessdate = 3 June 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090708163028/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/433440/1/.html| archive-date = 8 July 2009| url-status=live| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

====PAP split of 1961====
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2020}}
In 1961, former PAP minister and Mayor of Singapore after PAP's victory in the [[1957 Singapore City Council election]], [[Ong Eng Guan]] resigned his parliamentary seat of [[Hong Lim Single Member Constituency|Hong Lim]], filing the famous "16 resolutions" in the legislative assembly against the government. He challenged the PAP to defeat him in Hong Lim after his sacking from the cabinet. He had also been expelled by the party after making open disputes with his Cabinet colleagues, including over the abolition of the City Council, of which he was the last Mayor. Two other PAP members had followed him to join his faction and resigned from the party but did not resign their seats with Ong. Ong stood as an independent and won the Hong Lim by-election, defeating PAP candidate [[Jek Yeun Thong]].

Later that year, another by-election was held after the death of the incumbent PAP member Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff in the constituency of [[Anson Single Member Constituency|Anson]] on 15 July 1961. Former [[Labour Front]] chief minister [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], now the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP) leader, contested and won the seat, marking his political return. Two days after the Anson result, Lee assumed full responsibility for the two election setbacks and resigned as prime minister to PAP chairman [[Toh Chin Chye]], only for Toh to reject it.

On 21 July 1961, Lee then moved a [[motion of no confidence|motion of confidence]] in his own government five days after the Anson by-election. The motion was agreed to with 27 "Ayes", 8 "Noes" and 16 abstentions. The members who voted "No" included David Marshall and members of the [[Singapore People's Alliance]]. 13 allegedly pro-communist PAP members and 3 members of [[Ong Eng Guan]]'s newly-formed United People's Party abstained. Lee's expelled the PAP members who did not vote for his motion for breaking ranks and pulling support away to Communist opponents. Together with six prominent left-leaning leaders from trade unions, the breakaway members established a new party, the [[Barisan Sosialis]]. 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.

===Merger with Malaysia (1963–1965)===
{{main|Singapore in Malaysia}}
[[File:Singapore during the formation of Malaysia (16 September 1963).jpg|thumb|Lee Kuan Yew declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore]]

====Lead up to merger====
Independence of Singapore from Britain, through a merger with the Federation of Malaya, had been the PAP's platform since its founding in 1954. The merger was supported both by the non-communists and the communists in the PAP. So when the PAP won a strong mandate in the 1959 General Election, it pursued merger vigorously.

After Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] proposed the formation of a federation which would include [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1961, Lee began to campaign for a merger to end British colonial rule. The communists made a startling about-turn and were determined to derail merger, even though they had all along insisted that Malaya and Singapore were one entity. [[Chin Peng]], leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] made it clear that it wished to sabotage merger or delay its implementation at that stage.

Lee explained in a series of radio broadcasts in 1961 that the communists and [[Barisan Sosialis]] opposed merger because they wanted to establish control over Singapore so they could subsequently subvert and take over Malaya. The radio talks won over public opinion in favour of merger on the terms proposed by Lee's government. Lee would use the results of [[1962 Singaporean integration referendum|a referendum held on 1 September 1962]], in which 70% of the votes were cast in support of his merger proposal, to demonstrate that the people supported his plan; most of the other votes were blank, as Lee had not allowed a "No" option.<ref name="illusion">Lennox A.

====Operation Coldstore====
{{main|Operation Coldstore}}
By 1962, it was clear that the Malayan government considered the arrests of Singapore's left-wing groups, which they perceived as communist breeding grounds, as one of the two pre-conditions for the creation of Malaysia.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|title = Creating Malaysia: Singapore Security, the Borneo Territories, and the Contours of British policy|last = Matthew|first = Jones|date = 2008|journal = The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History|volume = 28|issue = 2}}</ref> The debates over the specifics of the arrests resulted in a power struggle in 1961 between the British, Singapore and Malayan leaders. In February 1962, the Malayans insisted on the apprehension of opposition leaders in Singapore and warned that they would pull out from the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Council]] if their requests were ignored.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title = Selkirk in Singapore|last = Ball|first = SJ|date = 1997|journal = Twentieth Century British History|issue = 2|volume = 10}}</ref> Observing that the Malayans were pushing for an arrest programme, Lee Kuan Yew jumped onto the bandwagon in March 1962.<ref name=":2" /> The arrests were scheduled for 16 December 1962 at 0200 hours but shortly before the scheduled date Lee Kuan Yew expanded the list of arrestees to include Malayan parliamentarians Lim Kean Siew and [[Ahmad Boestaman]] because they were opposed to merger.<ref name=":2" /> Lee also wanted the Malayan government to assume joint responsibility for the arrests and even composed a draft public statement for them to present in the federal parliament.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = The 1963 Operation Coldstore in Singapore, Commemorating 50 years|last = Wade|first = Goeffe|publisher = Vinlin Press Sdn Bhd|year = 2013|location = Malaysia|editor-first = Lysa|editor-last = Hong|chapter = Operation Coldstore: A Key Event in the Creation of Modern Singapore|editor-last2 = Poh|editor-first2 = Soo Kai|editor-last3 = Tan|editor-first3 = Kok Fang}}</ref> Malayan Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] rejected Lee's demands on the grounds that insufficient evidence existed to justify the arrest of the Malayan parliamentarians.<ref name=":1" /> In January 1963, the Tunku was alarmed when Lee Kuan Yew continued to expand the arrest list to include "some members of Marshall's and Ong's parties" despite "protestations of Singapore Special Branch."<ref name=":1" /> Nevertheless, on 18 January 1963, the Malayan government agreed on the specifics of the arrests "except for two matters... the UPP members and the proposal that Lim be offered by Lee the opportunity to leave Singapore after the arrest."<ref name=":1" />

However, Tunku warned [[Geofroy Tory]], the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malaysia|British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur]] on 30 January 1963, that 'if this operation failed, merger with Singapore was off'.<ref name="TanAlvin">{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Alvin |title=Singapore, a very short history : from Temasek to tomorrow |date=2020 |publisher=Talisman Publishing Pte Ltd |location=Singapore |isbn=9789811433481}}</ref> Tory, in turn warned everyone else, particularly his British colleagues and especially [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Singapore|British Commissioner to Singapore]] [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk|Lord Selkirk]], to put their reservations aside as 'this was positively the last time'.<ref name="TanAlvin" /> All parties finally agreed to proceed, and 2 February 1963 was selected for the commencement of Operation Coldstore. 113 were detained including [[Lim Chin Siong]] and 23 others from Barisan Sosialis.

====From merger to separation====
{{see also|PAP–UMNO relations}}
On 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of the new Federation of Malaysia. The [[Barisan Sosialis]] was the [[People's Action Party]]'s strongest contenders in politics. However, Operation Coldstore had substantially weakened the Barisan as most of its key personnel had been detained. According to Matthew Jones, "the Barisan never recovered from the combined effects of the outcome of the referendum result and the 'Cold Store' detentions.”<ref name=":2" /> Jones also highlights that numerous Barisan leaders and members were bogged down with lawsuits and its followers were "demoralised".<ref name=":2" /> In the [[1963 Singaporean general election|1963 election]] held on 21 September 5 days after the merger, Lee's PAP defeated Barisan Sosialis in a landslide victory.

However, the Singapore's union with Malaysia was short-lived. The Malaysian central government, ruled by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), became worried by the inclusion of Singapore's Chinese majority and the political challenge of the PAP in Malaysia. UMNO's coalition partner, the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) feared that the PAP would replace them, and opposed the PAP, seeing it as a radical socialist movement. The MCA urged the UMNO to prevent the PAP from becoming too influential. Also, the failure of a [[free trade|common market]] to be set up between the Federation and Singapore, and the heavy tax burden placed on Singapore by the federal government put strain on the relations between Singapore and the Federation.

In the [[1964 Malaysian general election]], PAP contested 11 federal and 15 state seats, which were mostly urban constituencies with a large ethnic Chinese population and traditional MCA turfs. However, the PAP won only one parliamentary seat by [[Devan Nair]] in [[Bungsar (federal constituency)|Bungsar]], [[Selangor]]. UMNO saw this as spite, and felt threatened by the fact that the PAP had even contested any seats at all, and was alarmed by the seat the PAP managed to win.

The [[1964 race riots in Singapore]] followed, such as that on 21 July 1964 near Kallang Gasworks in which 23 people were killed and hundreds injured as Chinese and Malays attacked each other. It is still disputed how the riots started, and theories include a bottle being thrown into a Muslim rally by a Chinese, while others have argued that it was started by a Malay. More riots broke out in September 1964, as rioters looted cars and shops, forcing both Tunku Abdul Rahman and Lee to make public appearances to calm the situation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

====Separation====
{{see also|Malaysian Malaysia|Malaysian Solidarity Convention|Proclamation of Singapore}}
In May 1965, PAP formed the [[Malaysian Solidarity Convention]] with 4 other Malaysian political parties championing the concept of a "[[Malaysian Malaysia]]" opposing [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia]]. This article specifically provides special [[Quota share|quota]]s for the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and other [[Demographics of Malaysia#Ethnolinguistic groups|indigenous peoples]] of Malaysia in admission to the public service, awarding of public scholarships, admission to public education institutions and the awarding of trade licences.

Some politicians in the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) thought Malaysian Malaysia threatened the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]]' special position in Malaysia. They considered Lee to be a dangerous and seditious trouble-maker. UMNO supreme council member and future prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. [[Mahathir Mohamad]] called the PAP “pro-Chinese, communist-oriented and positively anti-Malay”.<ref name="A close but difficult relationship">{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |title=A close but difficult relationship |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=12 April 2020 |archive-date=12 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412101031/https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |url-status=live }}</ref> The more moderate Tunku was perturbed by the campaign. He thought it would lead to trouble, as he believed that the Malays were not ready to compete without their special privileges.

Also in May 1965, Lee addressed the Malaysian Parliament and laid out his case against communal politics. He caused a sensation addressing them in [[Malaysian language|Bahasa Malaysia]]. Former Minister for Social Affairs [[Othman Wok]] recounted years later: 
<blockquote>“I noticed that while he was speaking, the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance]] leaders sitting in front of us, they sank lower and lower because they were embarrassed this man (Lee) could speak Malay better than them.<ref name="The great persuader">{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/great-persuader |title=The great persuader |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803015533/https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/great-persuader |url-status=live }}</ref>”</blockquote>

Former Cabinet colleague, the late [[Lim Kim San]], noted: 
<blockquote>“That was the turning point. They perceived [Lee] as a dangerous man who could one day be the Prime Minister of Malaya. This was the speech that changed history.<ref name="The great persuader"/>”</blockquote>

Unable to resolve the crisis, Tunku Abdul Rahman decided that Singapore had to be expelled from Malaysia, choosing to "sever all ties with a State Government that showed no measure of loyalty to its Central Government". Lee refused and tried to work out a compromise, but without success. He was later convinced by [[Goh Keng Swee]] that the secession was inevitable.<ref name="asias">Arthur Cotterell (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ml2ABAAAQBAJ&dq=lee+kuan+yew+secession+inevitable&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''A History of South East Asia''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509002950/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ml2ABAAAQBAJ&dq=lee+kuan+yew+secession+inevitable&source=gbs_navlinks_s |date=9 May 2016 }}, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd., p. 345.</ref> The negotiations of post-separation relations were held in utmost secrecy, to prevent any premature move by extreme elements of UMNO to instigate the arrest of Lee's government and imposing of direct rule over Singapore. Lee and his cabinet signed a separation agreement on 7 August 1965, which discussed Singapore's post-separation relations with Malaysia in order to continue co-operation in areas such as trade and mutual defence.

On 9 August 1965, at 10am, the Malaysian Parliament convened and passed unanimously by a vote of 126–0, the Constitution of Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Bill 1965 to allow Singapore to separate from the Malaysian federation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/behind-the-scenes-what-led-to-separation-in-1965 |title=Behind the scenes: What led to separation in 1965 |publisher=[[The Straits Times]] |access-date=12 April 2020 |archive-date=12 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412101035/https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/behind-the-scenes-what-led-to-separation-in-1965 |url-status=live }}</ref> The failure of the merger was a blow to Lee, who believed that it was crucial for Singapore's survival.

Singapore's lack of natural resources, a water supply that was derived primarily from Malaysia and a very limited defensive capability were the major challenges which Lee and the nascent Singaporean government faced.<ref>For one journalist's personal view of these events, see Pillai, M.G.G., {{cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/columns/pillai/2005/11/did-lee-kuan-yew-want-singapore.htm |title=Did Lee Kuan Yew want Singapore ejected from Malaysia? |accessdate=4 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013161748/http://www.malaysia-today.net/columns/pillai/2005/11/did-lee-kuan-yew-want-singapore.htm |archive-date=13 October 2007 }}, ''Malaysia Today'', 1 November 2005.</ref>

==Prime Minister, post-independence (1965–1990)==
[[File:Mr. Lee Kuan Yew Mayoral reception 1965.jpg|thumb|Lee Kuan Yew and [[Frank Kitts]], [[Mayor of Wellington City]] in 1965]]
Despite the momentous event, Lee did not call for the parliament to convene to reconcile issues that Singapore would face immediately as a new nation. Without giving further instructions on who should act in his absence, he went into isolation for six weeks, unreachable by phone, on an isolated chalet. According to Dr. [[Toh Chin Chye]], the parliament hung in "suspended animation" until the sitting in December that year.<ref name="Chew 1996">{{cite book|last=Chew|first=Melanie|title=Leaders of Singapore|year=1996|publisher=Resource Press|isbn=978-9810073336}}</ref>

In his memoirs, Lee said that he was unable to sleep. Upon learning of Lee's condition from the [[High commissioner (Commonwealth)|British High Commissioner]] to Singapore, John Robb, the British Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], expressed concern, in response to which Lee replied:
<blockquote>Do not worry about Singapore. My colleagues and I are sane, rational people even in our moments of anguish. We will weigh all possible consequences before we make any move on the political chessboard.<ref name="excess">{{cite book |title= Singapore: The State and the Culture of Excess|author= Yao, Souchou |page=2 |publisher= Routledge |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BKp8AgAAQBAJ&q=Do+not+worry+about+Singapore.+My+colleagues+and+I+are+sane,+rational+people+even+in+our+moments+of+anguish |location= London |isbn= 9780415417112 |year=2007}}</ref></blockquote>

Lee began to seek international recognition of Singapore's independence. Singapore joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, and founded the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) on 8 August 1967 with four other South-East Asian countries. Lee made his first official visit to Indonesia on 25 May 1973, just a few years after the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] under [[Sukarno]]'s regime. Relations between Singapore and Indonesia substantially improved as subsequent visits were made between the two countries.

Singapore has never had a dominant culture to which immigrants could assimilate even though Malay was the dominant language at that time.<ref name="multi">Robert W. Hefner (2001).

Lee and his government stressed the importance of maintaining religious tolerance and racial harmony, and they were ready to use the law to counter any threat that might incite ethnic and religious violence. For example, Lee warned against "insensitive evangelisation", by which he referred to instances of Christian proselytising directed at Malays. In 1974 the government advised the Bible Society of Singapore to stop publishing religious material in Malay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|title=Public-domain information from the US State Department Country Guide|website=exploitz.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319013143/http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|archive-date=19 March 2005}}</ref>

===Decisions and policies===
{{Main|Political positions of Lee Kuan Yew}}

====National security====
The vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources including the communists and Indonesia with its confrontational stance. Adding to this vulnerability was the impending withdrawal of British forces from [[East of Suez]]. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore's independence. He appointed [[Goh Keng Swee]] as [[Ministry of Interior and Defence|Minister for the Interior and Defence]] to build up the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) and requested help from other countries, particularly [[Israel]] and [[Taiwan]], for advice, training and facilities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 14–15, 20, 25–26] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 }}</ref> In 1967, Lee introduced conscription for all able-bodied male Singaporean citizens age 18 to serve National Service (NS) either in the SAF, [[Singapore Police Force]] or the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]. By 1971, Singapore had 17 national service battalions (16,000 men) with 14 battalions (11,000 men) in the reserves.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First – The Singapore Story (1965–2000) |year=2000 |publisher=Times Edition |isbn=978-9812049841 |page=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/41 41] |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/41 }}</ref> In 1975, Lee convinced then-Premier [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] of [[Taiwan|Taiwan (ROC)]] to permit Singaporean troops to train in [[Taiwan]], under the codename "Exercise Starlight".<ref>{{cite book|author=Lee Kuan Yew|title=From Third World to First|year=2000|publisher=Times Edition|isbn=978-9812049841|pages=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/45 45, 622]|url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/45}}</ref>

====Economy====
One of Lee's most urgent tasks upon Singapore's independence was to address high unemployment. Together with his economic aide, [[Economic Development Board]] chairman [[Hon Sui Sen]], and in consultation with Dutch economist [[Albert Winsemius]], Lee set up factories and initially focused on the manufacturing industry. Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.

Eventually, Lee and his cabinet decided the best way to boost Singapore's economy was to attract foreign investments from [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs). By establishing First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could attract American, Japanese and European entrepreneurs and professionals to set up base there. By the 1970s, the arrival of MNCs like [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[General Electric]] laid the foundations, turning Singapore into a major [[electronics]] exporter the following decade.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First – The Singapore Story (1965–2000) |year=2000 |publisher=Times Edition |isbn=978-9812049841 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 80–81] |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 }}</ref> Workers were frequently retrained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign companies. The government also started several new industries, such as steel mills under 'National Iron and Steel Mills', service industries like [[Neptune Orient Lines]], and the [[Singapore Airlines]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First – The Singapore Story (1965–2000) |year=2000 |publisher=Times Edition |isbn=978-9812049841 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/66 66–88] |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/66 }}</ref>

Lee and his cabinet also worked to establish Singapore as an international financial centre. Foreign bankers were assured of the reliability of Singapore's social conditions, with top-class infrastructure and skilled professionals, and investors were made to understand that the Singapore government would pursue sound [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] policies, with [[Balanced budget|budget surplus]]es, leading to a stable valued Singapore dollar.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First – The Singapore Story (1965–2000) |year=2000 |publisher=Times Edition |isbn=978-9812049841 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/89 89–102] |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/89 }}</ref>

Throughout the tenure of his office, Lee placed great importance on developing the economy, and his attention to detail on this aspect went even to the extent of connecting it with other facets of Singapore, including the country's extensive and meticulous tending of its international image of being a "Garden City",<ref>See, for example, [[Koh Buck Song]] (1 August 1996). "The Route To Success&nbsp;– Keeping Singapore Green And Efficient". ''The Straits Times'' (Singapore).</ref> something that has been sustained to this day.

====Anti-corruption measures====
Lee introduced legislation giving the [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau]] (CPIB) greater power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses, and investigate bank accounts and income-tax returns of suspected persons and their families.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/159 159–163, 647] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/159 }}</ref> Lee believed that ministers should be well paid in order to maintain a clean and honest government. On 21 November 1986, Lee received a complaint of corruption against then Minister for National Development [[Teh Cheang Wan]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Curbing Corruption in Asian Countries: An Impossible Dream?: An Impossible Dream?|first=Jon S.T. |last = Quah |publisher = Emerald Group |year=2011 |isbn= 9780857248206 |location= Bingley, UK |page=461}}</ref> Lee was against corruption and he authorised the [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau|CPIB]] to carry out investigations on Teh, but Teh committed suicide before any charges could be pressed against him.<ref>{{cite web|title = Politicians {{!}} Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau|url = https://www.cpib.gov.sg/cases-interest/cases-involving-public-sector-officers/politicians|website = www.cpib.gov.sg|accessdate = 3 October 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003194257/https://www.cpib.gov.sg/cases-interest/cases-involving-public-sector-officers/politicians|archive-date = 3 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> In 1994, he proposed to link the salaries of ministers, judges, and top civil servants to the salaries of top professionals in the private sector, arguing that this would help recruit and retain talent to serve in the public sector.<ref name="natgeojan10">{{cite news |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/01/singapore/jacobson-text |title=The Singapore Solution |last=Jacobson |first=Mark |date=January 2010 |work=[[National Geographic Magazine]] |accessdate=26 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219160039/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/01/singapore/jacobson-text |archive-date=19 December 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

====Population policies====
{{see also|Population planning in Singapore}}

In the late 1960s, fearing that Singapore's growing population might overburden the developing economy, Lee started a "[[Stop at Two]]" [[family planning]] campaign. Couples were urged to undergo [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]] after their second child. Third or fourth children were given lower priorities in education and such families received fewer economic [[Tax refund|rebates]].<ref name="natgeojan10"/>

In 1983, Lee sparked the "Great Marriage Debate" when he encouraged Singapore men to choose highly educated women as wives.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/136 136] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/136 }}</ref> He was concerned that a large number of graduate women were unmarried.<ref name="Lee 2000 140">{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/140 140] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/140 }}</ref> Some sections of the population, including graduate women, were upset by his views.<ref name="Lee 2000 140"/> Nevertheless, a match-making agency, the [[Social Development Network|Social Development Unit]] (SDU),<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/138 138] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/138 }}</ref> was set up to promote socialising among men and women graduates.<ref name="natgeojan10"/> In the Graduate Mothers Scheme, Lee also introduced incentives such as [[tax rebate]]s, schooling, and housing priorities for graduate mothers who had three or four children, in a reversal of the over-successful "Stop at Two" family planning campaign in the 1960s and 1970s.

Some sections of the population, including graduate women, were upset by the views of Lee, who had questioned that perhaps the campaign for [[women's rights]] had been too successful:

{{quote|text=''Equal employment opportunities, yes, but we shouldn't get our women into jobs where they cannot, at the same time, be mothers...our most valuable asset is in the ability of our people, yet we are frittering away this asset through the [[unintended consequences]] of changes in our education policy and [[equal opportunities|equal career opportunities]] for women. This has affected their traditional role ... as mothers, the creators and protectors of the next generation.''|sign=Lee Kuan Yew|source="Talent for the future", 14 August 1983<ref name="Natalism">{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Theresa|author2=Brenda Yeoh|year=2003|title=Fertility and the Family: An Overview of Pro-natalist Population Policies in Singapore|url=http://www.populationasia.org/Publications/RP/AMCRP12.pdf|journal=Asian Metacentre Research Paper Series|issue=12|access-date=19 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182245/http://www.populationasia.org/Publications/RP/AMCRP12.pdf|archive-date=27 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

The uproar over the proposal led to a swing of 12.9 percent against the PAP government in the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 general election]]. In 1985, especially controversial portions of the policy that gave education and housing priorities to educated women were eventually abandoned or modified.<ref name="LOC1989">{{cite web|title=Singapore: Population Control Policies|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/singapore/society/singapore_society_population_control_p~11008.html|work=Library of Congress Country Studies (1989)|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=11 August 2011|archive-date=11 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411115633/http://www.photius.com/countries/singapore/society/singapore_society_population_control_p~11008.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="natgeojan10"/>

By the late 1990s, the birth rate had fallen so low that Lee's successor [[Goh Chok Tong]] extended these incentives to all married women, and gave even more incentives, such as the "baby bonus" scheme.<ref name="natgeojan10"/>

One of Lee's abiding beliefs was in the efficacy of [[corporal punishment]] in the form of [[caning]].<ref name="Lee 2000 213–214">{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/213 213–214] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/213 }}</ref> In his autobiography ''The Singapore Story'', Lee described his time at [[Raffles Institution]] in the 1930s, mentioning that he was caned there for chronic lateness by the then headmaster, D. W. McLeod. He wrote: "I bent over a chair and was given three of the best with my trousers on. I did not think he lightened his strokes. I have never understood why Western educationists are so much against corporal punishment. It did my fellow students and me no harm".<ref>Yew, Lee Kuan (21 September 1998).

Lee's government inherited [[judicial corporal punishment]] from British rule, but greatly expanded its scope. Under the British, it had been used as a penalty for offences involving personal violence, amounting to a handful of caning sentences per year. The PAP government under Lee extended its use to an ever-expanding range of crimes.<ref>[http://www.corpun.com/singfeat.htm "Judicial caning in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115052445/http://www.corpun.com/singfeat.htm |date=15 January 2015 }}.

In 1994, judicial caning was publicised in the rest of the world when an American teenager, [[Michael P. Fay]], was caned under the vandalism legislation.<ref name="Lee 2000 213–214"/>

[[School corporal punishment]] (for male students only) was likewise inherited from the British, and is still in use in schools, permitted under legislation from 1957.<ref>[http://www.corpun.com/sgscr1.htm "Regulation No 88 under the Schools Regulation Act 1957"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308110142/http://www.corpun.com/sgscr1.htm |date=8 March 2015 }} (extract).
</ref> Lee also introduced caning in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]], and Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where corporal punishment is an official penalty in military discipline.<ref>

====Water resources in Singapore====
Singapore has traditionally relied on water from Malaysia. However, this reliance has made Singapore subject to the possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as political leverage by [[Water conflicts between Malaysia and Singapore|threatening to cut off supply]]. To reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974.<ref name="water">Tortajada, Cecilia; Joshi, Yugal; Biswas, Asit K.(2013).

===Foreign relations===

====Malaysia and Mahathir Mohamad====
Lee looked forward to improving relationships with [[Mahathir Mohamad]] upon the latter's promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. Knowing that Mahathir was in line to become the next [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Lee invited Mahathir (through Singapore President [[Devan Nair]]) to visit Singapore in 1978. The first and subsequent visits improved both personal and diplomatic relationships between them. Then [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]]'s Secretary-General Mahathir asked Lee to cut off all links with [[Democratic Action Party]]; in exchange, Mahathir undertook not to interfere in the affairs of [[Malay Singaporeans]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In June 1988, Lee and Mahathir reached an agreement in [[Kuala Lumpur]] to build the Linggui dam on the [[Johor River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|title=Singapore-Malaysia water agreements|author=National Library Board, Singapore|website=nl.sg|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609063811/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|archive-date=9 June 2012}}</ref> Lee said he had made more progress solving bilateral issues with Dr Mahathir from 1981 to 1990 than in the previous 12 years with the latter’s two predecessors, Tun [[Abdul Razak]] and Tun [[Hussein Onn]].<ref name="A close but difficult relationship"/> Mahathir ordered the lifting of the ban on the export of construction materials to Singapore in 1981, agreed to sort out Malaysia’s claim to [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|Pedra Branca]] island and affirmed it would honour the 1962 Water Agreement.<ref name="A close but difficult relationship"/>

One day before Lee left office in November 1990, Malaysia and Singapore signed the [[Malaysia–Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990]]. [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|Malayan Railways (KTM)]] would vacate the [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] and move to [[Bukit Timah railway station|Bukit Timah]] while all KTM's land between Bukit Timah and Tanjong Pagar would revert to Singapore. Railway land at Tanjong Pagar would be handed over to a private limited company for joint development of which its equity would be split 60% to Malaysia and 40% to Singapore. However, Prime Minister Mahathir expressed his displeasure with the POA as it failed to include a piece of railway land in Bukit Timah for joint development in 1993. It was only in 2010 when the matter was resolved under Malaysia's [[Najib Razak]] and Lee's son, [[Lee Hsien Loong]].

Following Lee's death, Mahathir posted a blog post that suggested his respect for Lee despite their differences, stating that while "I am afraid on most other issues we could not agree [...] [h]is passage marks the end of the period when those who fought for independence lead their countries and knew the value of independence. ASEAN lost a strong leadership after President Suharto and Lee Kuan Yew".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chedet.cc/?p=1620 |title=Kuan Yew and I |website=chedet.cc |access-date=4 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002093251/http://chedet.cc/?p=1620 |archive-date=2 October 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Lee fully supported the USA in the Vietnam War. Even as the [[Vietnam War]] began to lose its popularity in the United States, Lee made his first official visit to the United States in October 1967, and declared to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that his support for the war in Vietnam was “unequivocal”. Lee saw the war as necessary for states in Southeast Asia like Singapore to buy time for stabilizing their governments and economies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/lee-kuan-yews-singapore-bloomed-in-the-shadow-of-the-cold-war/ |title=Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore Bloomed in the Shadow of the Cold War |publisher=The Diplomat |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=2 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602065814/http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/lee-kuan-yews-singapore-bloomed-in-the-shadow-of-the-cold-war/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1967/10/21/singapore-prime-minister-asserts-us-must/ |title=Singapore Prime Minister Asserts U.S. Must Continue Vietnam War |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803012544/https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1967/10/21/singapore-prime-minister-asserts-us-must/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Lee cultivated close relationships with presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name="Dinner at the White House">{{cite web |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/dinner-at-the-white-house |title=Dinner at the White House |publisher=The Straits Times |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803022821/https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/dinner-at-the-white-house |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as former secretaries of state [[Henry Kissinger]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/lee-kuan-yew-meant-lot-me-kissinger |title=Lee Kuan Yew meant a lot to me: Kissinger |publisher=Today |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803005110/https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/lee-kuan-yew-meant-lot-me-kissinger |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[George Shultz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-us-secretary-of-state-george-shultz-mr-lee-kuan-yew-one-of-the-most-intelligent-people |title=Ex-US Secretary of State George Shultz: Mr Lee Kuan Yew 'one of the most intelligent people I have ever known' |publisher=The Straits Times |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803040923/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-us-secretary-of-state-george-shultz-mr-lee-kuan-yew-one-of-the-most-intelligent-people |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1967, Nixon, who was running for president in 1968, visited Singapore and met with Lee who advised that the United States had much to gain by engaging with China, culminating in [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mothership.sg/2017/10/lky-told-richard-nixon-in-1967-that-u-s-should-engage-china-despite-ongoing-cold-war/ |title=LKY told Richard Nixon in 1967 that U.S. should engage China despite ongoing Cold War |publisher=mothership.sg |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803021702/https://mothership.sg/2017/10/lky-told-richard-nixon-in-1967-that-u-s-should-engage-china-despite-ongoing-cold-war/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 1985, Lee made a state visit to the United States on the invitation of President Reagan and addressed a [[joint session of the United States Congress]]. Lee appealed to Congress the importance of free trade and not to turn towards protectionism.

<blockquote>It is inherent in America's position as the preeminent economic, political and military power to have to settle and uphold the rules for orderly change and progress... In the interests of peace and security America must uphold the rules of international conduct which rewards peaceful cooperative behaviour and punishes transgressions of the peace. A replay of the depression of the 1930s, which led to World War II, will be ruinous for all. All the major powers of the West share the responsibility of not repeating this mistake. But America's is the primary responsibility, for she is the anchor economy of the free- market economies of the world.<ref name="Dinner at the White House"/></blockquote>

After leading the [[People's Action Party|PAP]] to victory in seven elections, Lee stepped down on 28 November 1990, handing over the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|prime ministership]] to [[Goh Chok Tong]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/672 672] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/672 }}</ref> At that point in time he had become the world's longest-serving prime minister.<ref name="erlanger">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/29/world/new-leader-takes-singapore-s-helm.html |title=New Leader takes Singapore's Helm |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 November 1990 |first=Steven |last=Erlanger |access-date=17 February 2017 |archive-date=21 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421203303/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/29/world/new-leader-takes-singapore-s-helm.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This was the first leadership transition since independence.

When Goh Chok Tong became head of government, Lee remained in the cabinet with a non-executive position of [[Senior Minister]] and played a role he described as advisory. In public, Lee would refer to Goh as "my Prime Minister", in deference to Goh's authority.

Lee subsequently stepped down as [[Secretary (title)|Secretary-General]] of the PAP and was succeeded by Goh Chok Tong in November 1992.

==Minister Mentor (2004–2011)==
From the decade of the 2000s, Lee expressed concern about the declining proficiency of [[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]] among younger [[Chinese Singaporeans]]. In one of his parliamentary speeches, he said: "Singaporeans must learn to juggle English and Mandarin". Subsequently, in December 2004, Lee stepped down to become minister mentor and started a year-long campaign called "{{lang|zh-Hans|华语 Cool!}}" (Mandarin is Cool!) in an attempt to attract young viewers to learn and speak Mandarin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |script-title=zh:华语 Cool! |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212155239/http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |archive-date=12 December 2009 |work=[[Zaobao]] |date=7 December 2004 |language=zh-sg}}</ref>

In June 2005, Lee published a book, ''Keeping My Mandarin Alive'', documenting his decades of effort to master Mandarin, a language that he said he had to re-learn due to disuse:
<blockquote>[B]ecause I don't use it so much, therefore it gets disused and there's language loss. Then I have to revive it. It's a terrible problem because learning it in adult life, it hasn't got the same roots in your memory.</blockquote>

On 13 September 2008, Lee underwent successful treatment for abnormal heart rhythm ([[atrial flutter]]) at [[Singapore General Hospital]], but he was still able to address a philanthropy forum via video link from hospital.<ref>{{cite news |title=Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew hospitalized |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |location=Paris |date=13 September 2008}}</ref> On 28 September 2010, he was hospitalised for a chest infection, cancelling plans to attend the wake of the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, [[Balaji Sadasivan]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=MM treated for chest infection |newspaper=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=29 September 2010}}</ref>

In November 2010, Lee's private conversations with [[James Steinberg]], [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|US Deputy Secretary of State]], on 30 May 2009 were among the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US Embassy cables leaked]] by [[WikiLeaks]]. In a US Embassy report classified as "Secret", Lee gave his assessment of a number of Asian leaders and views on political developments in North Asia, including implications for nuclear proliferation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/210110 |title=Former Singapore PM on 'psychopathic' North Koreans |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 November 2010 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329190119/https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/210110 |archive-date=29 March 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Singapore's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] expressed deep concern about the leaks, especially when read out of context, and the need to protect confidentiality of diplomatic correspondence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/PrimeNews/Story/STIStory_609035.html |title=WikiLeaks: Singapore joins global chorus of disapproval |newspaper=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=1 December 2010 |agency=AFP, AP}}</ref>

After the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general elections]] in which the [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]], a major opposition political party in Singapore, made unprecedented gains by winning a [[Group representation constituency|Group Representation Constituency]] (GRC), Lee announced that he decided to leave the Cabinet for the Prime Minister, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], and his team to have a clean slate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1128878/1/.html |title=SM Goh, MM Lee to leave Cabinet |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |location=Singapore |date=14 May 2011 |access-date=14 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515061344/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1128878/1/.html |archive-date=15 May 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Analysts such as [[Citigroup]] economist Kit Wei Zheng believed that the senior Lee had contributed to the PAP's poor performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/3748684/lee-kuan-yew-obituary/|title='Father of Singapore' Lee Kuan Yew Dies at 91|website=Time|language=en|access-date=10 April 2020|archive-date=11 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211174249/https://time.com/3748684/lee-kuan-yew-obituary/|url-status=live}}</ref> In particular, he stated during the election campaign that the voters of Aljunied constituency had "five years to live and repent" if they voted for the [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]], which was said to have backfired for the PAP as the opposition went on to win Aljunied.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110509-277921.html|title=Reasons behind Aljunied swing|website=asiaone.com|language=en|access-date=27 April 2020|archive-date=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029180604/http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110509-277921.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a column in the ''Sunday Times'' on 6 November 2011, Lee's daughter, Lee Wei Ling, revealed that her father suffered from [[peripheral neuropathy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15615921|title=Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew admits nerve illness|work=BBC News|date=7 November 2011|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031224953/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15615921|archive-date=31 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In the column, she recounted how she first noticed her father's ailments when she accompanied him to meet the former US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in [[Connecticut]] in October 2009. Wei Ling, a neurologist, "did a few simple neurological tests and decided the nerves to his legs were not working as they should". A day later, when interviewed at a constituency tree-planting event, Lee stated: "I have no doubt at all that this has not affected my mind, my will nor my resolve" and that "people in wheel chairs can make a contribution. I've still got two legs, I will make a contribution".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20111107-309055.html |title=I've still got two legs, I will make a contribution |date=7 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222001906/http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20111107-309055.html |archive-date=22 February 2015  }}</ref>

Two years after his death, Lee's three surviving children became embroiled in a dispute over the house that served as his residence from the 1940s until his death. The first meeting of the People's Action Party took place in the basement of the eight-bedroom two-storey bungalow built in 1898. The feud centres around the question of whether the house will be demolished (Lee's preferred option) or gazetted and preserved as a national monument.

==International organisations==
Lee was a member of the [[Fondation Chirac]]'s honour committee,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/foundation/honour-committee/|title=Honor Committee|website=Fondation Chirac|access-date=24 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421171358/http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/foundation/honour-committee/|archive-date=21 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> from the time that the foundation was launched in 2008 by the former French President [[Jacques Chirac]] to promote world peace.

Lee was also a member of [[David Rockefeller]]'s "International Council", along with [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Riley P. Bechtel]], [[George Shultz]] and others. Additionally he was one of the "Forbes' Brain Trust", along with [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] and [[Ernesto Zedillo]].

As Singapore's Prime Minister from 1959 to 1990, Lee presided over many of Singapore's advancements. Singapore's [[Gross National Product]] per capita rose from $1,240 in 1959 to $18,437 in 1990. The unemployment rate in Singapore dropped from 13.5% in 1959 to 1.7% in 1990. [[International trade|External trade]] increased from $7.3&nbsp;billion in 1959 to $205&nbsp;billion in 1990. In other areas, the [[life expectancy]] at birth for Singaporeans rose from 65 years at 1960 to 74 years in 1990. The [[Demographics of Singapore#Population|population of Singapore]] increased from 1.6&nbsp;million in 1959 to 3 million in 1990. The number of [[Public housing in Singapore|public flats in Singapore]] rose from 22,975 in 1959 (then under the [[Singapore Improvement Trust]]) to 667,575 in 1990. The Singaporean [[literacy]] rate increased from 52% in 1957 to 90% in 1990. [[Telecommunications in Singapore#Telephones|Telephone lines]] per 100 Singaporeans increased from 3 in 1960 to 38 in 1990.

During the three decades in which Lee held office, Singapore grew from a [[developing country]] to one of the most [[Developed country|developed nations]] in Asia.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hussain|first=Zarina|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32028693|title=Singapore's economic transformation|date=24 March 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=16 March 2020|language=en-GB|archive-date=16 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216220711/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32028693|url-status=live}}</ref> Lee said that Singapore's only natural resources are its people and their strong work ethic.<ref>{{cite book |last=Suryadinata |first=Leo |date=2012 |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent, Vol. 1: A Biographical Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ |location=Singapore |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |page=525 |isbn=978-981-4414-14-2 |access-date=28 July 2015 |archive-date=11 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511032830/https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lee's achievements in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under [[Deng Xiaoping]], to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.<ref name="New York Times March 23, 2015"/> He has also had a major influence on thinking in Russia in recent years.<ref>Ben Judah, "The Curse of Lee Kuan Yew: The leader eulogized by Obama as a ‘giant of history’ is being used to re-legitimize tyranny."

Other world leaders also praised Lee. [[Henry Kissinger]] once wrote of Lee: "One of the asymmetries of history is the lack of correspondence between the abilities of some leaders and the power of their countries." Former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] praised "his way of penetrating the fog of propaganda and expressing with unique clarity the issues of our time and the way to tackle them".<ref>

On the other hand, many Singaporeans and Westerners have criticised Lee as authoritarian and as intolerant of dissent, citing his numerous attempts to sue political opponents and newspapers who express unfavourable opinions of Lee. [[Reporters Without Borders]], an international media pressure group, requested Lee and other senior Singaporean officials to stop taking libel suits against journalists.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Stop suing journalists: RSF tells Singapore leaders |newspaper= Bangkok Post |date= 26 March 2010 |url= http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/172827 |accessdate= 26 March 2010 |agency= Agence France-Presse}}</ref>

In addition, Lee was accused of promoting a culture of elitism among Singapore's ruling class. Michael Barr in his book ''The Ruling Elite of Singapore: Networks of Influence and Power'' claims that the system of meritocracy in Singapore is not quite how the government presents it; rather, it is a system of nepotism and collusion run by Lee's family and their crony friends and allies. Barr claims further that although the government presents the city-state as multi-ethnic and cosmopolitan, all the networks are dominated by ethnic Chinese, leaving the minority Malay and Indian ethnic groups powerless. According to Barr, the entire process of selecting and grooming of future political and economic talent is monopolised in the hands of the ruling People's Action Party, which Lee himself founded with a handful of other British-educated ethnic Chinese that he met in his days at Cambridge.<ref>Barr, M. (2009). ''The ruling elite of Singapore: Networks of power and influence''.</ref>

==Legal suits==
===Action against ''Far Eastern Economic Review''===
In April 1977, just months after a [[1976 Singaporean general election|general election]] which saw the People's Action Party winning all 69 seats, the [[Internal Security Department (Singapore)|Internal Security Department]], under orders from Lee, detained [[Ho Kwon Ping]], the Singapore correspondent of the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', as well as his predecessor Arun Senkuttavan, over their reporting. Ho was detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] which allows for indefinite trial, held in solitary confinement for two months, and charged with endangering national security. Following a televised confession in which Ho confessed to "pro-communist activities"<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Singapore Government press release|url=https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/777-1977-04-16.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=National Archives of Singapore}}</ref>, he was fined $3,000. Lee Kuan Yew later charged ''FEER'' editor, Derek Davies, of participating in "a diabolical international Communist plot" to poison relations between Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia.

In 1987 Lee restricted sale of the ''Review'' in Singapore after it published an article about the [[Operation Spectrum|detention of Roman Catholic church workers]], reducing circulation of the magazine from 9,000 to 500 copies,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HrWBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA273&lpg=PA273&dq=far+eastern+economic+review+singapore+gazetted&source=bl&ots=NcvyRQWQYk&sig=2eJ93MJVvfsrW0PgIEKlvolZ9Uc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEEQ6AEwB2oVChMI1vC1t6aTyAIVi5caCh2CqgUr#v=onepage&q=far%20eastern%20economic%20review%20singapore%20gazetted&f=false ''The New Communications Landscape: Demystifying Media Globalization''],  Anura Goonasekera, Jan Servaes, Georgette Wang, Routledge, 2003, page 273</ref> on the grounds that it was "interfering in the domestic politics of Singapore."<ref>[http://www.mci.gov.sg/web/corp/press-room/categories/press-releases/content/circulation-of-foreign-newspapers-in-singapore Circulation Of Foreign Newspapers In Singapore], [[Ministry of Communications and Information]], 3 August 2006</ref>

On 24 September 2008 the [[High Court of Singapore]], in a [[summary judgment]] by Justice [[Woo Bih Li]], ruled that the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' magazine (Hugo Restall, editor), defamed Lee and his son, the Prime Minister, [[Lee Hsien Loong]]. The court found the 2006 article "Singapore's 'Martyr': [[Chee Soon Juan]]" suggested that Lee "ha[d] been running and continue[d] to run Singapore in the same corrupt manner as [[T.T Durai|Durai]] operated [[National Kidney Foundation Singapore|[the National Kidney Foundation]]] and he ha[d] been using libel actions to suppress those who would question [him] to avoid exposure of his corruption".<ref name="bbc20080924">

===Action against J.B. Jeyaretnam===
Lee commenced proceedings for [[slander]] against opposition leader [[J.B. Jeyaretnam]] for comments he made at a [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] rally in the [[1988 Singaporean general election|1988 general election]]. Lee alleged that Jeyaretnam's speech at the rally implied he had tried to cover up the corruption of the former [[Ministry of National Development (Singapore)|Minister for National Development]], [[Teh Cheang Wan]], by aiding and abetting his suicide. The action was heard by Justice [[Lai Kew Chai]], who ruled against Jeyaretnam and ordered him to pay damages of S$260,000 plus costs to Lee. Jeyaretnam lost an appeal against the judgment.

===Action against Devan Nair===
In 1999, the former Singaporean President [[Devan Nair]] who was living in Canada, remarked in an interview with the [[Toronto]] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that Lee's technique of suing his opponents into bankruptcy or oblivion was an abrogation of political rights. He also described Lee as "an increasingly self-righteous know-all" surrounded by "department store dummies". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a reasonable cause of action.<ref>''Lee v. Globe and Mail'' (2001), 6 C.P.C. (5th) 354 (Ont.S.C.J.).</ref>

Lee wrote in one of his memoirs that Nair was forced to resign as President due to his alleged alcoholism, a charge which Nair denied.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-03-28-mn-29066-story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 September 2020 |archive-date=19 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919041439/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-03-28-mn-29066-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''International Herald Tribune'' defamation case===
In 2010 Lee, together with his son Lee Hsien Loong, and Goh Chok Tong, threatened legal action against [[The New York Times Company]], which owns the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', regarding an Op-Ed piece titled "All in the Family" of 15 February 2010 by [[Philip Bowring]], a freelance columnist and former editor of the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]''. The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' apologised in March that readers of the article may "infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit". The New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee Hsien Loong, S$50,000 to Lee and S$50,000 to Goh (totalling about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to "dynastic politics" in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew. In response, media-rights watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] wrote an open letter to urge Lee and other top officials of the Singapore government to stop taking "libel actions" against journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/business/media/25times.html?adxnnl=1&ref=global&adxnnlx=1269630126-/pOpabLI8eqVE1l9rvVbZw|title=Times Co.

==Controversies==
===Views on eugenics===
Alarmed that Singapore's fertility rate was falling precipitously low, Lee launched the Graduate Mothers' Scheme in 1983, giving tax deductions for children to women with university degrees, and priority in admission to primary schools to graduate mothers with 3 or more children.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/did-mr-lee-kuan-yew-create-a-singapore-in-his-own-image| title=Did Mr Lee Kuan Yew create a Singapore in his own image?| date=23 March 2015| access-date=21 May 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522044442/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/did-mr-lee-kuan-yew-create-a-singapore-in-his-own-image| archive-date=22 May 2018| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref> 

In his speech at the 1983 National Day Rally, Lee said, "If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society... So what happens? There will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation. That's a problem."<ref>{{Cite web|last=CoconutsSingapore|date=2015-03-23|title=That's What He Said: A collection of Lee Kuan Yew's most incredible quotes {{!}} Coconuts Singapore|url=https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/unbelievable-lee-kuan-yew-quotes/|access-date=2020-12-05|website=Coconuts|language=en-US}}</ref>

"If we continue to respond ourselves in this lopsided manner we will be unable to maintain our present standards," he added. "Levels of competence will decline. Our economy will falter, the administration will suffer, and society will decline.., for every two college graduates in 25 years' time there will be one graduate and for every two uneducated workers there will be three."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hugo|first=Justin|date=2018-10-22|title=SINGAPORE: Millionaire Ministers and Systemic Inequality|url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/106583|access-date=2020-12-05|website=The News Lens International Edition|language=en}}</ref>

In June 1984, Lee's government rolled out grants for low income and low education women to undergo sterilisation. If a woman and her husband had no O-level passes and fewer than 3 children, the woman could receive a $10,000 grant for undergoing sterilization. Sterilized lower-class parents were also given priority primary school admission for their existing first and second children. The uproar over the proposal led to a swing of 12.9 percent against the [[People's Action Party]] in the [[1984 Singaporean general election|general election held later that year]]. In 1985, especially controversial portions of the policy that gave education and housing priorities to educated women were eventually abandoned or modified.

A proponent of nature over nurture, Lee averred that "intelligence is 80% nature and 20% nurture" and attributed the successes of his children to genetics.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1984/08/16/between-you-and-your-genes/ |title=Between You and Your Genes |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |work=The New York Review of Books |date=16 August 1984 |access-date=19 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819082920/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1984/08/16/between-you-and-your-genes/ |archive-date=19 August 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

=== Nassim Jade and Scotts 28 condominium discounts ===
In 1996, while serving as [[Senior Minister]] Lee along with his son, [[Lee Hsien Loong]] then serving as the Deputy Prime Minister addressed in Parliament on allegations of receiving special discounts on four luxury condominium units that they had purchased from Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) on the properties of Nassim Jade and Scotts 28 that were purchased in 1994 and 1995 respectively.

Then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] ordered an immediate investigation into the matter, as though the provision of special discounts or rebates is permitted to the relatives and associates of directors under Singapore law, such transactions must be disclosed and approved by shareholders.<ref name="National Archives of Singapore">{{cite news|date=21 May 1996|title=STATEMENT BY SENIOR MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW ON NASSIM JADE AND SCOTTS 28|work=[[National Archives of Singapore]]|url=https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/066-1996-05-21.pdf|access-date=5 July 2020|archive-date=7 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200707034411/https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/066-1996-05-21.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> In his statement, Lee stated that no special treatment on their respective transactions, the [[Stock Exchange of Singapore]] firmly rebuked HPL for violations in their non-disclosure of the sales of these luxury properties.

===Comments on Islam===
In 1999, in a discussion forum, Lee Kuan Yew was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied: "Yes, I think so, over a long period of time, and selectively. We must not make an error. If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know his background. I'm saying these things because they are real, and if I don't think that, and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy. So, these are problems which, as poly students, you're colour-blind to, but when you face life in reality, it's a different proposition".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90919lky.htm|title = Lee Kuan Yew's remarks on Malays|access-date = 30 March 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150204121609/http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90919lky.htm|archive-date = 4 February 2015|url-status=live|df = dmy-all}}

In 2011, [[WikiLeaks]] published diplomatic cables attributing controversial comments on [[Islam]] to Lee. WikiLeaks quoted Lee as having described Islam as a "venomous religion". Lee called the remarks "false" and looked up to MFA's filenote of meeting and found no record of the claim, stating: "I did talk about extremist terrorists like the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] group, and the jihadist preachers who brainwashed them. They are implacable in wanting to put down all who do not agree with them. So their Islam is a perverted version, which the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Singapore do not subscribe to". He added that "Singapore Muslim leaders were rational and that the ultimate solution to extremist terrorism was to give moderate Muslims the courage to stand up and speak out against radicals who hijacked Islam to recruit volunteers for their violent ends".<ref>{{cite book|last=Allison|first=Graham|title=Lee Kuan Yew – The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World|year=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=76}}</ref><ref>

In ''Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going'', Lee stated that Singaporean Muslims faced difficulties in integrating because of their religion, and urged them to "be less strict on Islamic observances". His remarks drew firestorm from Malay/Muslim leaders and MPs in Singapore, prompting a strong reaction from his son [[Lee Hsien Loong]], the Prime Minister at that time, who said "My views on Muslims’ integration in Singapore differed from the Minister Mentor's. Muslims are a valued and respected community, who have done a good deal to strengthen our harmony and social cohesion." Lee Kuan Yew then told the media "I made this one comment on the Muslims integrating with other communities probably two or three years ago. Ministers and MPs, both Malay and non-Malay, have since told me that Singapore Malays have indeed made special efforts to integrate with the other communities, especially since 9/11, and that my call is out of date." Subsequently, he added: "I stand corrected. I hope that this trend will continue in the future."<ref>

===Comments on homosexuality===
While the People's Action Party remains reluctant to strike down [[Section 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)|Section S377A]] of the [[Singapore Penal Code]] which criminalises sex between mutually consenting men, Lee appeared to be supportive of LGBT issues, stating his belief on multiple occasions in his later years that gay people should not be persecuted because homosexuality was a "genetic variance".

In response to a question from the youth wing of the PAP in 2007, Lee said, “This business of homosexuality. It raises tempers all over the world, and even in America. If in fact it is true, and I’ve asked doctors this, that you are genetically born a homosexual, because that is the nature of genetic random transmission of genes. You can’t help it. So why should we criminalise it?... But there is such a strong inhibition in all societies – Christianity, Islam, even the Hindu, Chinese societies. And we’re now confronted with a persisting aberration, but is it an aberration? It’s a genetic variation. So what do we do? I think we pragmatically adjust.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lee Kuan Yew answers Loretta Chen's question on homosexuality - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx93PbLwc2s|access-date=2020-12-05|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

Four years later, in an interview granted to journalists for the book “Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going”, Lee was asked if he thought homosexuality was a lifestyle or genetic. He said, "No, it’s not a lifestyle. You can read the books all you want, all the articles. There’s a genetic difference, so it’s not a matter of choice. They are born that way and that’s that. So if two men or two women are that way, just leave them alone."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Straits Times asks Lee Kuan Yew about homosexuality - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq2Ci0ouAFg|access-date=2020-12-05|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

Asked how he would feel if one of his children came out to him, Lee said, "That’s life. They’re born with that genetic code, that’s that. [[Dick Cheney]] didn’t like gays but his daughter was born like that. He says, 'I still love her, full stop.' It’s happened to his family. So on principle he’s against it, but it’s his daughter. Do you throw the daughter out? That’s life. I mean none of my children is gay, but if they were, well that’s that."

Saying he took a "purely practical view" on the issue, Lee said, "Look, homosexuality will eventually be accepted. It’s already been accepted in China. It’s only a matter of time before it is accepted here. If we get a Cabinet full of Christians, we’re going to get an intolerant Cabinet. We’re not going to allow that.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lee Kuan Yew's views on homosexuality & Christians in the cabinet - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0664Sr2chLM|access-date=2020-12-05|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

Asked whether Singapore was ready for a gay member of parliament, Lee said, "As far as I’m concerned, if she does her work as an MP, she looks after her constituents, she makes sensible speeches, she’s making a contribution, her private life is her life, that’s that."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-03-26|title=LKY Controversial: LGBT - "It's a genetic variation"|url=https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/03/26/lky-controversial-lgbt-its-a-genetic-variation/|access-date=2020-12-05|website=The Online Citizen|language=en-GB}}</ref>
