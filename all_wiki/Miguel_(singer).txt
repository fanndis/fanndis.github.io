July 13, 2020 - Miguel began conversations with Twitter users on behalf of a GQ interview.  He was asked when he would release a new album.  Miguel personally replied physically on the social media platform and clarified verbally in the video to expect another, "project", by the end of the year.  The term project may not be a sufficient exchange of a full release album.  Or it may mean Miguel has begun collaborative performances with other Latin music artists again.{{cn|date=November 2020}}
