The '''2008 United States presidential election in Massachusetts''' took place, as in all 50 states and [[The District of Columbia|D.C.]], as part of the [[2008 United States presidential election]] of November 4, 2008. Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who, in turn, voted for the office of [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee [[Barack Obama]] won the state by a 25.8% margin of victory: slightly better than [[John Kerry]]'s 25.2% margin in [[2004 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|2004]]. Prior to the election, all 17 news organizations forecast that Obama would win Massachusetts, or otherwise considered it to be a safe [[Red states and blue states|blue state]]. Massachusetts had been a Democratic-leaning state since [[1928 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1928]], and a Democratic stronghold since [[1960 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1960]], and has kept up its intense level of the sizable Democratic margins since [[1996 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1996]]. No Republican presidential nominee has won a single county in the state, nor obtained more than 40% of the vote, since [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[1988 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1988]].<ref>[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.cookpolitical.com/charts/president/ev_scorecard.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618182133/http://www.cookpolitical.com/charts/president/ev_scorecard.php |date=2008-06-18 }}[http://www.pollster.com/08-MA-Pres-GE-MvO.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511165552/http://www.pollster.com/08-MA-Pres-GE-MvO.php |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref> In 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] captured the state's 12 electoral votes winning 61.80% of the popular vote to Republican [[John McCain]]'s 35.99%. Massachusetts was also 1 of only 6 states in which neither Obama nor McCain won during the [[2008 United States presidential election|primary season]].

The Massachusetts Democratic primary took place on [[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday]], February 5, 2008, and had a total of 93 delegates at stake. The winner in each of [[Massachusetts's congressional districts|Massachusetts's 10 congressional districts]] was awarded all of that district's delegates, totaling 61. Another 32 delegates were awarded to the statewide winner, [[Hillary Clinton]]. The 93 delegates represented Massachusetts at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. 26 other unpledged delegates, known as [[superdelegate]]s, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well.

Polls indicated that Clinton was leading [[Barack Obama]] in the days leading up to the contest in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Democratic Primary |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/ma/massachusetts_democratic_primary-539.html |publisher=RealClearPolitics |accessdate=February 4, 2008}}</ref>

Hillary Rodham Clinton won a convincing victory in Massachusetts over Barack Obama due to a number of factors. According to exit polls, 85% of voters in the Massachusetts Democratic Primary were [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Caucasians]] and they opted for Clinton by a margin of 58–40% compared to the 6% of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|African American]] voters who backed Obama by a margin of 66–29. [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Hispanics]]/[[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Latinos]], which comprised 5% of the total voters, backed Clinton by a margin of 56–36%. Clinton narrowly won the youth vote (those ages 18–29) by a margin of 49–48 and tied the vote among voters ages 30–44; she also won all voters over the age of 45 by a margin of 60.5–38. Pertaining to socioeconomic class, Clinton won all levels of family income except highly affluent voters making $200,000 or more a year, as they backed Obama by a narrow margin of 53–47%. As for educational attainment levels, Clinton won all categories except those with postgraduate degrees who backed Obama by a margin of 51–47%. Among self-identified Democrats in the primary, which made up 65% of the total electorate, they went for Clinton by a 58–41 margin while [[Independent politician|Independents]], which comprised a healthy 33% of the electorate, also went for Clinton by a 54–42 margin. She also won all ideological groups. Clinton also won most major religious denominations – [[Protestantism|Protestants]] 53–46; [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] 64-33; other Christians 51-47; and other religions 49-46. Obama won [[Judaism|Jews]] by a margin of 52–48 as well as [[Atheism|atheists]]/[[Agnosticism|agnostics]] by a margin of 53-45.

Clinton performed extremely well statewide, carrying a majority of counties and sweeping most of the major [[urban area|urban]] areas and cities. Obama won [[Boston]] by fewer than 10,000 votes, while Clinton won other urban and conservative towns<ref>{{cite news |first1=Frank |last1=Phillips |last2=Viser |first2=Matt |title=Decisive victories in Mass. |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/02/06/decisive_victories_in_mass |work=Boston Globe |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=February 6, 2008}}</ref> such as [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] and [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]].

Obama had picked up major endorsements from the Massachusetts Democratic establishment prior to Super Tuesday. Both [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] [[Ted Kennedy]] and [[John Kerry]] threw their support behind Obama, along with [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Deval Patrick]]. Clinton also picked up a number of top-tier endorsements from [[Mayor of Boston|Mayor]] [[Thomas Menino]] of [[Boston]] and [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] [[Salvatore DiMasi]] along with [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] [[Richard Neal]] and [[Barney Frank]], one of the three openly [[gay]] members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].

==Analysis==
[[Massachusetts]] was (and is) the bluest state in the nation, in terms of voting for the Democrat in presidential elections. Massachusetts is ethnically diverse, highly educated, and less religious. The Bay State has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election since [[1960 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1960]] except for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s landslide victories of  [[1980 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1980]] and [[1984 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1984]]. In [[1972 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1972]], only Massachusetts and the [[1972 United States presidential election in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] voted for Democratic [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George McGovern]] as Republican [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] won reelection.

[[Barack Obama]] won the state's 12 electoral votes with 61.80% of the vote to [[John McCain]]'s 35.99%. This is slightly higher than Kerry's victory in 2004. Despite that, 4 counties in the state trended away from the Democratic party: Bristol, Plymouth, Norfolk, and Worcester.

Both of Massachusetts's U.S. Senators and all 10 of its [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] were Democrats, and Democrats held [[Supermajority|supermajorities]] in the Massachusetts Legislature. At the same time in 2008, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] was reelected with 65.86% of the vote over Republican Jeff Beatty's 30.93% as were all of the state's delegates in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. At the state level, Democrats picked up three seats in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and one seat in the [[Massachusetts Senate]].

==Electors==
{{Main|List of 2008 United States presidential electors}}
Technically the voters of Massachusetts cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Massachusetts is allocated 12 electors because it has 10 [[Massachusetts's congressional districts|congressional districts]] and 2 [[List of United States senators from Massachusetts|senators]]. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 12 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 12 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_ec.htm |title=Electoral College |accessdate=2008-11-01 |publisher=[[California Secretary of State]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030041546/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_ec.htm |archive-date=October 30, 2008 }}</ref> An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a [[faithless elector]].

The electors of each state and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] met on December 15, 2008, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 12 were pledged to Obama and Biden:<ref>http://www.massdems.org/dsc/dscon_resources08.cfm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001215456/http://www.massdems.org/dsc/dscon_resources08.cfm |date=2008-10-01 }} Massachusetts Democratic Party</ref>
