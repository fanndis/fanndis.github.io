It was announced on September 30, 2014, that eBay would spin off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company, a move demanded in 2013 by activist [[hedge fund]] magnate [[Carl Icahn]].

On July 1, 2015, PayPal announced that it was acquiring digital money transfer company [[Xoom Corporation]]. PayPal spent $25 a share in cash to acquire the publicly traded Xoom, or about $1.09 billion. The deal was closed in the fourth quarter of 2015.

=== Business model evolution ===
PayPal's success in users and volumes was the product of a three-phase strategy described by former eBay CEO [[Meg Whitman]]: "First, PayPal focused on expanding its service among eBay users in the US. Second, we began expanding PayPal to eBay's international sites. And third, we started to build PayPal's business off eBay."<ref name=wallstfolly>{{cite web |url=http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116122051/http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 16, 2006 |title=Wall Street Folly: eBay: Conference call transcript – 1/18/06 |publisher=Wallstfolly.typepad.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011 }}</ref>

==== Phase 1 ====

In the first phase, payment volumes were coming mostly from the eBay auction website. The system was very attractive to auction sellers, most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards, and for consumers as well. In fact, many sellers could not qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.<ref name=wallstfolly/>

==== Phase 2 ====

Until 2000, PayPal's strategy was to earn interest on funds in PayPal accounts. However, most recipients of PayPal credits withdrew funds immediately. Also, a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards, which cost PayPal roughly 2% of payment value per transaction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

To solve this problem, PayPal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts. Instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds, PayPal started relying on earnings from service charges. They offered seller protection to PayPal account holders, provided that they comply with reimbursement policies. For example, PayPal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over $750.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==== Phase 3 ====

After fine-tuning PayPal's business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on eBay, PayPal started its off-eBay strategy. This was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms, despite the slowdown in on-eBay growth and low-single-digit user growth on the eBay site. A late 2003 reorganization created a new business unit within PayPal—Merchant Services—to provide payment solutions to small and large e-commerce merchants outside the eBay auction community. Starting in the second half of 2004, PayPal Merchant Services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants outside the eBay auction community, including:<ref name=wallstfolly/>

* Lowering its transaction fee for high-volume merchants from 2.2% to 1.9% (while increasing the monthly transaction volume required to qualify for the lowest fee to $100,000)
* Encouraging its users to recruit non-eBay merchants by increasing its referral bonus to a maximum of $1,000 (versus the previous $100 cap)
* Persuading credit card gateway providers, including [[CyberSource]] and Retail Decisions USA, to include PayPal among their offerings to online merchants.
* Hiring a new sales force to acquire large merchants such as [[Dell]], [[ITunes|Apple's iTunes]], and [[Yahoo! Store]]s, which hosted thousands of online merchants
* Reducing fees for online music purchases and other "micropayments"
* Launching PayPal Mobile, which allowed users to make payments using text messaging on their cell phones

=== Global reach ===

PayPal can be used in more than 200 countries/regions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.paypal.com/al/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide | title=PayPal Global - All countries and markets - PayPal | publisher=PayPal | accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>

Different countries have different conditions: ''Send only'' (Package Service allows sending only, valid in 97 countries), ''PayPal Zero'' (package suggests the possibility of enrollment, entry, and withdrawal of funds in foreign currency, but the user can not hold the balance PayPal account, operates in 18 countries), ''SRW Send - Receive - Withdrawal'' (the possibility of enrollment, input-output and the ability to keep your PayPal account balance in the currency and to transfer to the card when the user sees fit, operates in 41 countries) and ''Local Currency'' (SRW plus opportunity to conduct transactions in the local currency, 21 countries).

PayPal is available in Israel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/api/country_codes/|title=List of country codes where PayPal available}}</ref> but is not available in the [[Palestinian territories]]. Nor can Palestinians working in the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] access it but Israelis living in [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] in the West Bank can use PayPal.

==== Turkey ====

Eight years after the company first started operating in the country, Paypal ceased operations in Turkey on 6 June 2016 when Turkish financial regulator BDDK denied it a payment license. The regulators had demanded that PayPal's data centers be located inside Turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate [[tax revenue]]. PayPal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/paypal-to-exit-turkey-after-regulator-denies-payments-license-1464720574|title=PayPal to Exit Turkey After Regulator Denies Payments License}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/paypal-to-halt-operations-in-turkey-after-losing-license-impacts-hundreds-of-thousands/|title=PayPal to halt operations in Turkey after losing license, impacts 'hundreds of thousands'}}</ref>

In the United States, PayPal is licensed as a [[money transmitter]], on a state-by-state basis.<ref name=Wolverton>[https://www.zdnet.com/news/fdic-decides-paypals-no-bank/121346 FDIC decides PayPal's no bank].

Although PayPal is not classified as a bank, the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including [[Regulation E]] consumer protections and the [[USA PATRIOT Act]].<ref>Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (2001)</ref> The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from [[Peer-to-peer banking|peer-to-peer]] (P2P) payments using [[Credit card|credit]] and [[debit cards]]. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution, and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges.<ref name=margaretjane>Margaret Jane Radin et al., Internet Commerce The Emerging Legal Framework 1174–1175 Foundation Press (2d ed. 2006)</ref> Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the [[Electronic Funds Transfer Act]] (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a ''payment intermediary'' and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.<ref name=margaretjane />

== Safety and protection policies ==

The PayPal Buyer Protection Policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described. The customer can open a dispute within 180 days from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute.  If the buyer used a credit card, he or she might get a refund via [[chargeback]] from his or her credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1979, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kukiewicz |first=Julia |url=http://www.choose.net/money/guide/features/section-75-credit-card-protection-claim.html |title=Choose.net |publisher=Choose.net |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref>

Also, the Financial Ombudsman Service position is that section 75 protection does not apply where PayPal or any eMoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction. This leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service. They only have recourse with the courts. However, the key issues which determine the applicability of section 75 are identified very clearly in Office of Fair Trading v Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others [2006] EWCA Civ 268 7 and the [[Bank of Scotland]] v Alfred Truman (a firm) [2005] [EWHC] 583 (QB). This is a legal authority that section 75 protection does exist where one has paid on a credit card for a product, via an eMoney service.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miloseski-Reid |first=Paul |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmhaff/70/70vw05.htm |title=Home Affairs Committee |publisher=publications.parliament.uk |date=July 29, 2013 |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref>

According to PayPal, it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the Seller Protection Policy. In general, the Seller Protection Policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if the seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer. PayPal states the Seller Protection Policy is "designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non-receipt of any merchandise". The policy includes a list of "Exclusions" which itself includes "Intangible goods", "Claims for receipt of goods 'not as described{{'"}}, and "Total reversals over the annual limit".<ref name=ppsafety>{{cite web| url=https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security| title=Buyer Protection & Seller Protection| publisher=PayPal| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> There are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect). The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation (e.g., Sale of Goods Act) and in addition, it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions.<ref name=ppagreement>{{cite web| url=https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full| title=PayPal User Agreement| date=8 October 2014| publisher= PayPal| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>

==Security==

=== Security token ===

{{main|Security token}}
In early 2006, PayPal introduced an optional [[Security token|security key]] as an additional precaution against fraud.<ref name=forbessecurity>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2014/06/25/researchers-discover-vulnerability-in-paypals-two-factor-authentication/| title=Researchers Discover Vulnerability in PayPal's Two-Factor Authentication| author=Kate Vinton| date=25 June 2014| magazine=Forbes| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process. Account-holders enter their login ID and password as normal but are then prompted to enter a six-digit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holder's mobile phone. For convenience, users may append the code generated by the hardware key to their password in the login screen. This way they are not prompted for it on another page. This method is required for some services, such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on [[iPhone]].

This [[two-factor authentication]] is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key, although it does not prevent the so-called [[Man in the Browser]] (MITB) attacks. However, the user (or malicious third party) can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on their account. Thus the PayPal implementation does not offer the security of true two-factor authentication.<ref name=techhivepp>{{cite web| url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2058327/keep-your-paypal-account-safer-with-two-factor-authentication.html| title=Keep your PayPal account safer with two-factor authentication| author=Nick Mediati| date=29 October 2013| publisher=TechHive| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>

=== MTAN ===

It is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an [[mTAN]] (Mobile Transaction Authentication Number) via [[SMS]].<ref>{{cite web| title=PayPal Security Key – PayPal|url=https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/Marketing_CommandDriven/securitycenter/PayPalSecurityKey-outside| accessdate=August 18, 2009}}</ref> Use of a security code that is sent to the account holder's mobile phone is currently free.<ref>[http://www.moonlightceo.com/paypal-secrets/ MoonlightCEO.com] Moonlight CEO, PayPal Secrets, October 28, 2013</ref>

== Fraud ==

As early as 2001, PayPal had substantial problems with [[online fraud]], especially international [[hacker]]s who were hacking into PayPal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts. Standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters. But with PayPal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the [[FBI]] to pursue cases of international fraud, PayPal developed a private solution: a "fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions.  ... Rather than treating the problem of fraud as a [[Legal matter management|legal problem]], the company treated it as a [[risk management]] one."<ref name=stringham2013>{{cite journal |last=Stringham|first=Edward |title=PayPal's Private Governance |journal=The Freeman |date=March 4, 2013 |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/paypals-private-governance#ixzz2Ma4h62Lo |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Morisy|first1=Michael|title=How PayPal Boosts Security with Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545631/how-paypal-boosts-security-with-artificial-intelligence/|accessdate=28 January 2016|work=MIT Technology Review|date=25 January 2016}}</ref>

=== 150,000 PayPal cards frozen ===

In 2015, 150,000 Spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a PayPal service provider, Younique Money, which was the de facto administrator of the cards. Previously, PayPal had charged €15 to all its card users without authorization (150,000 users). As of March 2015 most funds had not been returned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocu.org/dinero/tarjetas/noticias/paypal-prepago|title=Paypal prepago deja de estar operativa|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cadenaser.com/programa/2015/03/06/ser_consumidor/1425647549_395678.html|title=OCU denuncia a YoUnique Money ante el Banco de España|author=Cadena Ser|date=6 March 2015|work=Cadena Ser|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20150216/54427286227/younique-money-perdio-su-autorizacion-para-operar-por-irregularidad-contable.html|title=El Banco de España retira la licencia a Younique Money para emitir tarjetas Paypal|work=LA VANGUARDIA|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref>

In 2003, PayPal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers. At the time of this cessation, it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions. In 2010, PayPal resumed accepting such transactions, but only in those countries where online gambling is legal, and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://internet-bingo.co/payment-options/paypal/ |title=Internet bingo guide to PayPal |publisher=internet-bingo.co |date=October 30, 2011 |accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref>

If an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use, PayPal puts the "Limited Access" designation on the account. PayPal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as [[Richard Kyanka]], owner of the website [[Something Awful]], in September 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/46325.html |title=E-Commerce News: Security: Feds Investigating Fraudulent Katrina-Related Web Sites|publisher=Ecommercetimes.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref> [[Cryptome]] in March 2010,<ref>{{cite web|last=Orlowski |first=Andrew|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/08/paypal_cryptome_ko/ |title=Theregister.co.uk |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Orlowski |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/10/cryptome_paypal/ |title=Theregister.co.uk|publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=March 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Orlowski |first=Andrew|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/16/cryptome_paypal/ |title=Theregister.co.uk |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref> or [[April Winchell]], the owner of [[Regretsy]], in December 2011.

In September 2010, PayPal froze the account of a [[Minecraft]] developer, [[Markus Persson]]. Persson stated publicly that he had not received a clear explanation of why the account was frozen, and that PayPal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong. His account contained around €600,000.<ref name="rock-paper-shotgun">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/10/paypal-freezes-minecraft-devs-600k-euros/|title=PayPal Freezes Minecraft Dev's 600k Euros |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref>

PayPal's partner [[MasterCard]] ceased taking donations to [[WikiLeaks]] in 2010, and PayPal also suspended, and later permanently restricted, payments to the website after the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] deemed WikiLeaks activities as illegal. Online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting PayPal and MasterCard, along with other companies, to coordinated [[cyberattack|cyber attacks]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/08/operation-payback-mastercard-website-wikileaks | location=London |work=The Guardian | first1=Esther | last1=Addley | first2=Josh | last2=Halliday | title=Operation Payback cripples MasterCard site in revenge for WikiLeaks ban | date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2011 PayPal [[wikt:unbanned|unbanned]] the account of a website that supports [[List of Iraq War resisters|Iraq War resisters]] after it had enough information to fulfill its [[know your customer]] guidelines.

In August 2013, entrepreneurs who had used PayPal to collect the funds they raised on [[crowdfunding]] platforms like [[Kickstarter]] and [[Indiegogo]] reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money.

== Litigation ==

In March 2002, two PayPal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) and California law. Most of the allegations concerned PayPal's dispute resolution procedures. The two lawsuits were merged into one class-action lawsuit (In re: PayPal litigation). An informal settlement was reached in November 2003, and a formal settlement was signed on June 11, 2004. The settlement requires that PayPal change its business practices (including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them EFTA-compliant), as well as making a US$9.25 million payment to members of the class. PayPal denied any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paypalsucks.com/files/PayPalSettlementAgreement.pdf|title=Settlement Agreement|date=June 11, 2004}}</ref>
