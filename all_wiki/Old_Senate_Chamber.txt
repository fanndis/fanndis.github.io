[[Image:Old sen ch 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The restored Old Senate Chamber]]
The '''Old Senate Chamber''' is a room in the [[United States Capitol]] that was the [[legislature|legislative]] chamber of the [[United States Senate]] from 1810 to 1859 and served as the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] chamber from 1860 until 1935. It was designed in [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] and is elaborately decorated.<ref name="AOC">"[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/capitol/old_sen_ch.cfm The Old Senate Chamber]." [[Architect of the Capitol]].</ref> Restored in 1976 as part of [[United States Bicentennial]] celebrations, it is preserved as a [[museum]] and for the Senate's use.<ref name="AOC"/>

==Design and furnishings==
Located north of the [[United States Capitol rotunda|Capitol rotunda]] on the second floor of the north wing (the Senate side) of the Capitol, the semicircular two-story room is {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|75|ft|m}} long, with a half-domed ceiling.<ref name="AOC"/>

The chamber is overlooked by two visitors' galleries. The [[Architect of the Capitol]] reports that the gallery on the east is "supported by eight [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] of [[Variegation|variegated]] [[marble]] [[Quarry|quarried]] along the [[Potomac River]]", inspired by the [[Erechtheum]] of the [[Acropolis of Athens]].<ref name="AOC"/> Directly above this gallery hangs an 1823 "porthole portrait" of [[George Washington]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], which was purchased for display in the chamber in 1832 upon the centennial of Washington's birth.<ref name="AOC"/>

The second gallery is the Ladies' Gallery, which follows the curved western wall and is much larger. The Ladies' Gallery is supported by 12 [[steel]] columns "encased in [[Cast iron|cast-iron]] forms with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], which were designed to simulate the cast-iron originals." The gallery has a "[[Wrought iron|wrought-iron]] balcony [[Guard rail|railing]] [that] follows the contour of the gallery and is backed by [[crimson]] fabric that accentuates the decorative [[Metalworking|metalwork]]."<ref name="AOC"/>

On the [[dais]] in the center of the room is a curved table with "richly turned and [[trapezophoron|carved legs]] and a crimson [[Modesty panel|modesty screen]]" which serves as the desk of the [[President of the Senate]] (the [[Vice President of the United States]]). The crimson fabric is hung from a [[mahogany]] valence from a canopy overhead. The valence is below a carved [[Gilding|gilt]] [[Bald eagle|eagle]] and shield.<ref name="AOC"/> Directly in front of the Vice President's desk one tier down is "a larger desk of similar design," which was used by the [[Secretary of the United States Senate|Secretary of the Senate]] and [[Clerk (legislature)|Chief Clerk]].<ref name="AOC"/>

A glass screen between the dais and a small lobby allowed Senators to relax but remain within earshot of the floor. In addition, there are two [[fireplace mantel]]s on the east wall behind the screen, which are among the original pieces of the chamber that remain today. Two other mantels on the lobby's north and south ends are [[replica]]s, as the originals were replaced with [[stove]]s when the chamber was converted for the use of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref name="AOC"/>

Radiating off the dais are desks and chairs for 64 Senators, which was the number of Senators at the time the Senate moved to its current quarters. The desks and chairs are located on four semicircular graduated platforms. When the Senate moved to its current chamber in 1859, it took the original furniture with it.<ref name="AOC"/> Many of the [[Traditions of the United States Senate#Senate desks|original desks]] remain in use today, including the [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Jefferson Davis]] desks. The desks and chairs that are in the chamber today are replicas reproduced from a circa 1819 design by the [[New York City]] [[Cabinet making|cabinetmaker]] Thomas Constantine. Like the originals, the furniture is mahogany.<ref name="AOC"/>

Behind the last row of desks is a low paneled wall separating the center of the chamber from a visitors' area (the third visitor area in the chamber, along with the two visitors' galleries). The area has red-upholstered sofas and was originally "reserved for privileged visitors who gained admittance to the Chamber through the special invitation of a Senator."<ref name="AOC"/> On either side of the main doorway are [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] for coal- or [[wood-burning stove]]s; the current stoves are reproductions.<ref name="AOC"/>

The [[color scheme]] of crimson and gold, seen in the dais' decorations, can be seen elsewhere in the chamber as well, as in the "crimson [[Window valance|drapery swags]] secured with gilt stars" in the visitors' galleries, crimson [[window treatment]]s, and the [[carpet]] on the chamber floor, which is [[Weaving|woven]] from [[Gossypium hirsutum|long-staple]] [[Wool|virgin wool]] and has a "gold star pattern on a red background".<ref name="AOC"/>

The domed [[ceiling]] of the chamber is painted white. The Architect of the Capitol describes it as "elaborately [[coffer]]ed and enriched by [[Molding (decorative)|decorative moldings]]." In the center of the ceiling is a semicircular [[Skylight (window)|skylight]], and around it are five smaller circular skylights.<ref name="AOC"/> The skylight originally allowed [[Sunlight|natural light]] in the chamber, but today they are artificially lit. A large [[brass]] [[chandelier]] made by [[Philadelphia]]'s Cornelius and Company also provided light; a reproduction now hangs above the Vice President's desk.<ref name="AOC"/>

==Use by the Senate and Supreme Court==
[[Image:OldSenateChamber2.jpg|thumb|250px|View of Chamber from southwest]]
The chamber was completed in 1810, after [[Architect of the Capitol]] [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] divided the original Senate chamber in the North wing into two rooms, one on the first floor and the other on the second. The bottom-floor chamber—known as the [[Old Supreme Court Chamber]]—was put into use as a chamber for the Supreme Court in 1810.

In 1810—the same year the Supreme Court moved into the lower floor—the Senate moved into the second-story chamber. For the next 49 years, the Senate used the chamber until the completion of the north wing extension in 1859, when they moved to their present-day chamber. At its height, 64 senators met in the chamber.<ref name="AOC" /> In 1860, after the Senate moved to its current quarters, the Supreme Court moved upstairs into Old Senate Chamber, where it sat until the completion of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] in 1935.

[[Image:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|250px|Famous political cartoon of Brooks' attack on Sumner by J.L. Magee]]
Many noted events occurred in the chamber. Among them are the passage of the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]], the 1830 [[Webster–Hayne debate]], and the [[Great Triumvirate|Webster-Clay-Calhoun]] debates over the [[Compromise of 1850]].<ref name="AOC" /> In 1856, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Preston Brooks]] beat Senator [[Charles Sumner]] nearly to death with a [[Walking stick|cane]] in the chamber. The attack occurred three days after Sumner, a strident [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], attacked pro-[[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] politicians, including Brooks' relative Senator [[Andrew Butler]], in a speech. Brooks attacked Sumner as a matter of honor, [[Caning of Charles Sumner|beating him with a cane]] and injuring him so badly that he was absent from the Senate for nearly three years as he recovered.

In a famous exchange in 1858, Senator [[James Henry Hammond]] of North Carolina gave a speech advancing the [[Mudsill theory]], arguing that slavery was justified because civilization required a permanent underclass to serve as a foundation. In reply, Senator [[David C. Broderick]], a [[Free Soil]] Democrat, pointed out that he himself had risen to the Senate from this "mudsill" class, and that his father, an Irish immigrant, had worked as a stonecutter in the construction of that very room:

<blockquote>If I were inclined to forget my connection with them, or to deny that I sprang from them, this chamber would not be the place in which I could do either. While I hold a seat I have but to look at the beautiful capitals adorning the pilasters that support this roof, to be reminded of my father's talent and to see his handiwork.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AAN8043.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext | title=Anecdotes of Public Men | publisher=Harper & Brothers | author=Forney, John W | year=1873 | pages=26}}</ref></blockquote>

Until 1976, the room was used for meetings,<ref name="AOC"/> irregular [[United States congressional committee|congressional committee]] hearings, and as temporary quarters while the modern Senate chamber was being repaired in 1940, 1949, and 1950.

==Restoration==
The [[United States Bicentennial]] brought about the decision to [[Building restoration|restore]] the room to its [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] appearance. At present, much of the room is furnished with reproductions with the exceptions of the gilded eagle ornament located above the chair of the [[President of the Senate]] (the [[Vice President of the United States]]), which is original, and above the eagle ornament on a third-story gallery resides an original portrait of [[George Washington]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]].<ref name="AOC" />

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the chamber was closed to tourists for almost two years due to security concerns;<ref name="After 9/11"/> tour groups would have to pass close to the current Senate chamber and the office of then-[[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist]]. It was later reopened after tightened security measures were put into place, with visitors being observed by two [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]] officers posted outside the room and allowed to "quickly file through the room" only when the Senate is not in session (usually Monday mornings and Friday afternoons).

==Modern use==

The chamber is today used occasionally for ceremonial functions. Special meetings between Senators or dignitaries as well as speeches have been given there. Examples of such events include a speech by [[Walter Mondale]] in the Old Senate Chamber in September 2002,<ref>{{cite news |last=Sarasohn |first=Judy |title=Mondale's Ex-Staffers Abound. |work=The Washington Post |date=31 October 2002}}</ref> a meeting between [[Jesse Helms]] and visiting members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in March 2000,<ref>{{cite news |last=Vita |first=Matthew |title=U.N.

The room has been used by the press to take photos of Senators taking a mock [[oath of office]]. Senators are normally sworn-in in the current Senate chamber, where no photos are allowed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Babington |first=Charles |title=A Bittersweet Day Like No Other; Hillary Clinton's Swearing-In as Senator Highlights a Political Passage. |work=The Washington Post |date=4 January 2002}}</ref> However, [[Byron Dorgan]], who was elected in a [[special election]], was sworn in as a senator in 1992 in a ceremony in the Old Senate Chamber.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dorgan Takes North Dakota Senate Seat. |work=The Washington Post |date=16 December 1992}}</ref>

The chamber is rarely used for official purposes. One exception is special circumstances calling for a more collegial atmosphere. The Senate met in the chamber on the morning of January 8, 1999 to deliberate rules for the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment trial of President Clinton]]; the procedures for the trial, brokered by [[Phil Gramm]] and [[Ted Kennedy]], passed 100–0.<ref name="After 9/11">{{cite news
