'''''Talk That Talk''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]], released on November 18, 2011, by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and SRP Records. It was recorded while traveling for the [[Loud Tour]] between February and November 2011, and was originally planned to be a [[reissue]] of her previous studio album ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). As executive producer, Rihanna enlisted a wide range of producers including [[Alex da Kid]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Chase & Status]], [[No I.D.]], and [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]]  to achieve her desired sound. Following in the same vein as ''Loud'', ''Talk That Talk'' is a [[Electronic dance music|dance]]-oriented [[Pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] crossover album that incorporates elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[dubstep]], [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[house music]]. The album also contains subtle [[dancehall]] influences, whilst its lyrical content and themes revolve around a nihilistic, romantic and lascivious lover.

''Talk That Talk'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the album's lyrics, while others were less favorable of its themes. ''Talk That Talk'' debuted at number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 198,000 copies and went on to sell 1.15 million copies in the United States by June 2015. The album also peaked at number one in Austria, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], selling 163,000 copies in its first week. As of April 2012, the album has been certified triple Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for shipments of 900,000 copies. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Talk That Talk'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2011.<ref name="IFPI 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RIN-2012-SNEP-copie.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2012|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 8, 2012|page=34}}</ref> As of March 2013, the album has sold more than 5.5 million copies worldwide.

The album produced six singles, including the international hit "[[We Found Love]]" which was released as the album's [[lead single]]. "[[We Found Love]]" became Rihanna's eleventh number-one song on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the charts in twenty six additional countries. "[[You da One]]", "[[Talk That Talk (Rihanna song)|Talk That Talk]]" (featuring rapper [[Jay-Z]]) and a remix of "[[Birthday Cake (song)#Remix featuring Chris Brown|Birthday Cake]]" (featuring [[Chris Brown]]) experienced moderate success, while "[[Where Have You Been]]" reached the top ten of twenty countries around the world. A remixed form of "[[Cockiness (Love It)#Remix|Cockiness (Love It)]]" (featuring rapper [[ASAP Rocky]]) was released as the sixth and final single from the album.

== Recording and production ==
[[File:Westlake Recording Studios.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Westlake Recording Studios]] was one of many locations in which the album was recorded.]]
Recording sessions for ''Talk That Talk'' began in February 2011 and ended in November 2011. Recording for the album took place during the [[Loud Tour]]. Due to this, recording sessions for the album took place in various countries including Paris, London, Norway, Denmark and Germany. Vocal producer Kurk Harrell estimates the album was cut in more than 25 cities. Rihanna recorded a total of sixteen to seventeen song.<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com">{{Cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/11/kuk-harrell-rihanna-talk-that-talk.html|title=Rihanna's vocal producer Kuk Harrell on making 'Talk That Talk'|date=2011-11-22|website=LA Times Blogs - Pop & Hiss|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>
The singer would record late into the morning, sometimes until noon, before riding her bus to the next city. In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: "It was the best [shit] ever, it was some rock star [shit] This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning I woke up and started crying so hard. I finally just got to my bed from the IV [drip] and I was just like, 'Good I can actually get to sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished [the album] at 5&nbsp;pm the day before..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/rihanna/354661-rihanna-talk-that-talk-breakdown|accessdate=February 13, 2014|date=May 11, 2012|title=Rihanna 'Suffered A Breakdown' While Making LP|publisher=[[MTV UK]]}}</ref>

Kuk Harrell, one of the producers of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before we went on the European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/10/13/rihanna_recording_new_album_talk_that_|title=Rihanna Recording New Album, 'Talk That Talk,' In Hotel Rooms|work=Starpulse}}</ref> Continuing Harrell stated "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated "I’d make the decision based off {{sic}} where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice."<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"/>
