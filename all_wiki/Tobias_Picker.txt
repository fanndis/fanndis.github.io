==Biography==
===1954–1975: Early years, influences, and education===
Picker was born in [[New York City]] on July 18, 1954, the son of painter and fashion designer [[Henriette Simon Picker]] and news-writer Julian Picker, and the cousin of film executive [[David V. Picker]], businessman [[Harvey Picker]], former CEO of The [[American Film Institute]] [[Jean Firstenberg|Jean Picker Firstenberg]], art-patron Stanley Picker,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stanleypickertrust.org/house-and-collection/ |title=House and Collection|publisher=The Stanley Picker Trust|accessdate=September 24, 2020}}</ref> producer Jimmy Picker,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/056-17/ |title=Jimmy Picker, Producer|publisher=[[Academy Awards]]|accessdate=September 24, 2020}}</ref> and economist [[Kenneth Rogoff]]. At the age of eight, he began composing and studying the piano:
{{quote|I was raised by my teachers on a diet of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Schuman, and eventually Brahms, my favorite. There was always some "modern" music thrown in…. With the discovery of each new composer a new world opened up for me. It wasn't really until I discovered the music of Charles Wuorinen with whom I began studying at eighteen that I finally was exposed to Carter (with whom I later studied) and Boulez and Stravinsky and Stefan Wolpe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sequenza21.com/picker.html |title=An Interview with Tobias Picker|publisher=Sequenza 21|accessdate=September 17, 2020}}</ref>}}
Picker started composing in 1962, and, that same year, began corresponding with composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], who encouraged his studies. Three years later, Picker was taken into the preparatory division of the [[Juilliard School of Music]] for instruction in piano and theory.

Robert|access-date=September 19, 2020|quote= It was a signal moment in the rebirth of tonality. When the curtain rose on Tobias Picker's first opera, ''Emmeline,'' in 1996, the orchestra conjured an atmosphere of grim foreboding, circling endlessly around a single, brooding chord. As if to emphasize his immersion in the dark realm of B flat minor, Mr. Picker prefaced the score with a device long scorned by modernists: a key signature.}}</ref> He has mentioned that there are "tourettic" elements in his music.

He has said, "I live my life controlled by Tourette's...but I use music to control it. I have harnessed its energy—I play with it, manipulate it, trick it, mimic it, taunt it, explore it, exploit it, in every possible way."<ref>Oliver Sacks, ''Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain'', revised and expanded (New York: Random House, 2007), p. 252. {{ISBN|978-0-676-97979-4}}</ref> 
Sacks wrote of the inspiration he took from Picker's music in the preface to his book, ''Island of the Color Blind'', saying he "owe[d] a special debt to Tobias Picker's version of ''The Encantadas'', and that "whenever, in the writing, memory failed me, listening to the piece operated as a sort of Proustian mnemonic, transporting me back to the Marianas and the Carolines".<ref>Oliver Sacks, ''The Island of the Colorblind'', Illustrated Edition, (New York: Vintage, 1998), p. xxi. {{ISBN|9780375700736}}</ref>
