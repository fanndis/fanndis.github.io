In April 2019, he pretended to cross the [[Mexico–United States border]] to show how easy it was for immigrants to enter into the country; this came to light after it was pointed out by his Democratic challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, that actually leaving the country would violate his [[parole]] after [[#Campaign finance investigation and indictment|his indictment on illegal spending of campaign funds]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/rep-hunter-campa-najjar-bicker-over-congressmans-faux-border-crossing-video |title=Rep.

On July 19, 2019, it was revealed that the Marine Corps had sent a cease and desist letter to Hunter, asking him to immediately stop using the Marine Corps logo and a Corps motto on political mailers to constituents.

After President Trump pulled 1,000 U.S. troops from [[Kurds|Kurdish]]-held territory on the Syrian border south of Turkey in 2019, a bipartisan resolution was passed in the House, 354–60, that condemned the president for abandoning those U.S. allies that would allow the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) to reestablish and regroup its forces, and allow the Turks to attack the Kurds.

===Post-plea punishment===
On December 5 the House Ethics Committee informed Hunter that he had violated House rules when he cast votes in the chamber two days earlier. They said he must refrain from Congressional voting because he had pleaded guilty to a federal felony with a potentially significant prison sentence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2019-12-05/house-ethics-committee-warns-hunter-to-refrain-from-voting-in-light-of-guilty-plea?te=1&nl=california-today&emc=edit_ca_20191206?campaign_id=49&instance_id=14331&segment_id=19357&user_id=e9848bda5d7546386411f6e2fbdaf95e&regi_id=1615347420191206|title=House Ethics Committee warns Hunter to refrain from voting in light of guilty plea|last=Clark|first=Charles T.|date=December 5, 2019|newspaper= [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |access-date=6 December 2019}}</ref> Longstanding precedent holds that House members convicted of felonies should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the Ethics Committee reviews the matter.
