The '''NAACP Image Award''' is an annual awards ceremony presented by the U.S.-based National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([[NAACP]]) to honor outstanding performances in film, television, music, and literature. Similar to other awards, like the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and the [[Grammy Award|Grammys]], the over 40 categories of the Image Awards are voted on by the award organization's members (in this case, NAACP members). Honorary awards (similar to the [[Academy Honorary Award]]) have also been included, such as the [[NAACP Image Award – President's Award|President's Award]], the [[NAACP Image Award – Chairman's Award|Chairman's Award]], the [[NAACP Image Award for Entertainer of the Year|Entertainer of the Year]], and the [[NAACP Image Award – Hall of Fame Award|Hall of Fame Award]].

==History==
The [[award ceremony]] was first presented on August 13, 1967,<ref name= first/> and it was first nationally televised in 1994 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]. There was no awards ceremony in 1973 or 1995. The first [[Streaming media|live broadcast]] of the event, also on the Fox Network, occurred in 2007 for its 38th edition (up until 2007, the ceremony had been broadcast with [[broadcast delay|tape delay]]) and the annual ceremonies usually take place in or around the Los Angeles, United States area, in February or early March. The 44th edition aired on NBC. Sources have had trouble verifying the winners in the top categories from 1983 to 1995.

The New York firm [[Society Awards]] manufactures the trophy since its redesign in 2008.

==Controversy==
In 1987, the NAACP came under fire for dropping their Best Actress award for that year. They defended this position, citing a lack of meaningful roles for black women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/10/29/Best-actress-award-dropped-in-NAACP-Image-Awards/5120562482000/|title=NAACP cites lack of Best Actress in a Motion Picture Award due to lack of meaningful roles|date=October 29, 1987|website=[[UPI.com]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}</ref> In 1990, they were criticized once again for not awarding Best Actress.<ref name="NAACP Best Actress">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-25/entertainment/ca-4455_1_image-award|title=Why NAACP lacks image award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture|date=October 25, 1990|website=[[LA Times]]|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}</ref> This was the fourth time it could not find enough nominees for Best Actress.<ref name="NAACP Best Actress"/> Sandra Evers-Manly, president of the organization's Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch, said, "The [film] industry has yet to show diversity or present realistic leading roles for [[African-American]] women."<ref name="NAACP Best Actress"/>

In other years, some nominees have been called undeserving of NAACP attention. In response, some NAACP representatives have argued that the quality of an artist's work is the salient issue, with factors such as criminal charges inconsequential in this regard. For example, in 1994, [[Tupac Shakur]] was a nominee for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for the film ''[[Poetic Justice (1993 film)|Poetic Justice]]'' despite the filing of [[sexual assault]] charges against him in December 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Jackson makes surprise appearance at NAACP Image Awards|work=Jet|date=1994-01-24|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n12_v85/ai_14777970|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> More specifically, Shakur had been accused of felony counts of forcible sodomy and unlawful detainment in New York City, when a woman alleged that he and two other men held her down in a hotel room while a fourth man sodomized her.<ref name="Charged">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-07/entertainment/ca-9458_1_whitney-houston|title=Shakur Questionably nominated|last=Leonardi|first=Marisa|date=January 7, 1994|website=[[LA Times]] |access-date=1 July 2016}}</ref> Shakur was also indicted for two counts of aggravated assault in an unrelated incident in which he supposedly shot and wounded two off-duty police officers.<ref name="Charged"/> In the same year, [[Martin Lawrence]] was criticized for winning Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series and the show was criticized for its sexual controversy.<ref name="Charged"/>{{clarify|date=March 2019}} In 2004, [[R. Kelly]]'s ''[[Chocolate Factory]]'' was nominated for Outstanding Album<ref>{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|title=Outkast, Beyoncé, R.

Other nominees have faced controversy due to their portrayals of major civil rights figures. In 2003, the movie ''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'' received five nominations, including Outstanding Motion Picture and Outstanding Supporting Actor (for [[Cedric the Entertainer]]'s performance). In the film, Cedric's character makes [[Barbershop (film)#Subjects discussed in the barbershop|pejorative remarks]] about [[Rosa Parks]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Jesse Jackson]], content that elicited criticism, including Rosa Parks's refusal to attend the awards event.<ref>{{cite web|title=Image Awards rekindle 'Barbershop' controversy|work=CNN.com|date=2003-03-09|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/08/image.awards.ap/|accessdate=2006-09-29|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060629060508/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/08/image.awards.ap/|archivedate=2006-06-29}}</ref> The rap group [[OutKast]] received six nominations in 2004 but faced criticism because they had previously recorded the song "Rosa Parks", which had resulted in Parks suing them over the use of her name.<ref name="zahn"/>
