A '''trade name''', '''trading name''', or '''business name''' is a [[pseudonym]] used by companies that do not operate under their registered company name. The term for this type of alternative name is a "fictitious" business name. Registering the fictitious name with a relevant government body is often required.

In a number of countries, the phrase "'''trading as'''" (abbreviated to t/a) is used to designate a trade name. In the [[United States]], the phrase "'''doing business as'''" (abbreviated to DBA, dba, d.b.a. or '''d/b/a''') is used,<ref name="Pinkerton" /> among others, such as '''assumed business name'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Search|work=SOSNC.gov|publisher=[[North Carolina Secretary of State]]|date=2018|access-date=June 20, 2018|url=https://www.sosnc.gov/search/index/corp}}</ref> or '''fictitious business name'''.<ref>[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&division=7.&title=&part=3.&chapter=5.&article= California Business and Professions Code Section 17900] ''et seq''.</ref> In [[Canada]], "'''operating as'''" (abbreviated to o/a) and "trading as" are used, although "doing business as" is also sometimes used.<ref name="business-registration">{{cite web|url=https://businessregistration.ca/business-registration/|title=Business Registration|publisher=BusinessRegistration.ca|date=2015|accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref>

A company typically uses a trade name to conduct business using a simpler name rather than using their formal and often lengthier name. Trade names are also used when a preferred name cannot be registered, often because it may already be registered or is too similar to a name that is already registered.

==Legal aspects==
Using one (or more) fictitious business name(s) does not create one (or more) separate legal entities.<ref name="Pinkerton">''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12111403894102280465 Pinkerton's, Inc. v. Superior Court]'', 49 Cal. App. 4th 1342, 1348-49, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 356, 360 (1996) (collecting cases and explaining term of art "doing business as" (DBA)).</ref> The distinction between a registered legal name and a fictitious business name, or trade name, is important because fictitious business names do not always identify the entity that is [[Legal liability|legally responsible]]. 

Legal agreements (such as [[contract]]s) are normally made using the registered legal name of the business. If a corporation fails to consistently adhere to such important legal formalities like using its registered legal name in contracts, it may be subject to [[piercing the corporate veil|piercing of the corporate veil]].<ref name="Plimpton">{{cite book |last1=Plimpton |first1=Laura |title=Business Contracts: Turn Any Business Contract to Your Advantage |date=2007 |publisher=Entrepreneur Press |location=Irvine |isbn=9781613081303 |page=7 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Business_Contracts/hrviRzYuY5oC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA7&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> 

In English, trade names are generally treated as [[proper noun]]s.<ref>[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 57. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}</ref>

Both Pepple and Jaja would bequeath their trade names to their royal descendants as official [[surname]]s upon their deaths.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, there is no filing requirement for a "trading as" name, however, there are requirements for disclosure of the owner's true name and some restrictions on the use of certain names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gp1.shtml#ch10 |title=Companies House Booklet GP1, Chapter 10 |publisher=Companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2020-03-09}}</ref>

===United States===
A minority of U.S. states, including [[Washington (state)|Washington]], still use the term '''trade name''' to refer to "doing business as" (DBA) names;<ref>[http://www.dol.wa.gov/business/faqtradename.html Washington State Department of Licensing FAQ: Trade name registration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606082016/http://www.dol.wa.gov/business/faqtradename.html|date=2013-06-06}}</ref> In most U.S. states now, DBAs are officially referred to using other terms; almost half of states, like [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Oregon]], use the term ''Assumed Business Name or Assumed Name;''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/assdnmins.html |title=NYS Division of Corporations, State Records and UCC |publisher=Dos.ny.gov |date=2014-11-07 |accessdate=2020-03-09}}</ref><ref>[http://egov.sos.state.or.us/br/!PKG_BC1_WEB_INTERVIEW.DISPLAY_FAQ?p_current_faqcode=DOBIZ&p_current_expanded_id=10#QID10 Oregon Business Information Center FAQ] from the Oregon Secretary of State</ref> nearly as many, like [[Pennsylvania]], use the term ''Fictitious Name.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dos.pa.gov/BusinessCharities/Business/Resources/Pages/Fictitious-Names.aspx |title=Fictitious Names |publisher=Dos.pa.gov |date= |accessdate=2020-03-09}}</ref>

For [[consumer protection]] purposes, many U.S. jurisdictions require businesses operating with fictitious names to file a DBA statement, though names including the first and last name of the owner may be accepted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doing Business As: What Is It and Do You Need It?; Freshbooks Blog May 7, 2013|url=http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2013/05/07/doing-business-as/|date=2019-12-06}}</ref> This also reduces the possibility of two local businesses operating under the same name, although some jurisdictions do not provide exclusivity for a name, or may allow more than one party to register the same name. Note, though, that this is not a substitute for filing a [[trademark]] application. A DBA filing carries no legal weight in establishing trademark rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Protecting Your Trademark|url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/BasicFacts.pdf|work=booklet|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|US Patent and Trademark Office]]|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> In the U.S., trademark rights are acquired by use in commerce, but there can be substantial benefits to filing a trademark application.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Mary|title=Corporate Names, Trade Names, Trademarks, and Fictitious Names|url=http://bizadvisor.com/NamesTrademarks.htm|publisher=The Business Advisor|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> [[Sole proprietorship|Sole proprietors]] are the most common users of DBAs.  Sole proprietors are individual business owners who run their businesses themselves. Since most people in these circumstances use a business name other than their own name,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} it's often necessary for them to get DBAs.

Generally, a DBA must be registered with a local or state government, or both, depending on the jurisdiction. For example, California, Texas and Virginia require a DBA to be registered with each county (or [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the case of Virginia) where the owner does business. Maryland and Colorado have DBAs registered with a state agency. And Virginia requires corporations and LLCs to file a copy of their registration with the county or city to also be registered with the State Corporation Commission.

DBA statements are often used in conjunction with a [[franchising|franchise]].  The franchisee will have a legal name under which it may sue and be sued, but will conduct business under the franchiser's [[brand name]] (which the public would recognize).  A typical real-world example can be found in a well-known pricing [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]] case, ''Donovan v. RRL Corp.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/26C4t261.htm 26 Cal. 4th 261] (2001), where the named defendant, RRL Corporation, was a [[Lexus]] [[car dealership]] doing business as "Lexus of Westminster", but remaining a separate legal entity from Lexus, a division of [[Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.]]

In [[California]], filing a DBA statement also requires that a notice of the fictitious name be published in local [[newspaper]]s for some set period of time to inform the public of the owner's intent to operate under an [[assumed name]]. The intention of the law is to protect the public from fraud, by compelling the business owner to first file or register his fictitious business name with the county clerk, and then making a further public record of it by publishing it in a newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Publication Requirements For DBA in Los Angeles|url=http://www.signaturefiling.com/blog/dba-filing-county/los-angeles-dba-filing/|website=Signature Filing}}</ref> Several other states, such as [[Illinois]], require print notices as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2299&ChapterID=65|title=805 ILCS 405/ Assumed Business Name Act.|website=www.ilga.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}</ref>
