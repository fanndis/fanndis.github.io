'''''Born This Way''''' is the second studio album by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], released by [[Interscope Records]] on May 23, 2011. It was co-written and co-produced by Gaga with several producers, including [[RedOne]] and [[Fernando Garibay]], with whom she had previously worked. She also worked with artists such as [[E Street Band]] saxophonist [[Clarence Clemons]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]].

The music of ''Born This Way'' stems from the [[synthpop]] and [[dance-pop]] styles of her previous material while incorporating different forms of instrumentation from that on her previous releases, such as [[electronic rock]] and [[techno]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-says-she-loves-bruce-springsteen-wont-do-reality-tv-20110323|title=Lady Gaga Says She Loves Bruce Springsteen, Won't Do Reality TV|work=Rolling Stone|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205030920/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-says-she-loves-bruce-springsteen-wont-do-reality-tv-20110323|archivedate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> It features a broader range of genres, such as [[opera]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[disco]], [[House music|house]], and [[rock and roll]], while its lyrical topics include sexuality, religion, freedom, feminism, and individualism.

On April 17, 2011, Gaga tweeted her selection for the [[cover art]] of ''Born This Way'', which featured Gaga fused into a motorcycle. Gaga's name does not appear on the album cover – the only text is the chrome writing across the top reading the album's name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popeater.com/2011/04/17/lady-gaga-born-this-way-album-art/|title=Lady Gaga Reveals 'Born This Way' Album Art –|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=April 17, 2011|accessdate=May 5, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421085109/http://www.popeater.com/2011/04/17/lady-gaga-born-this-way-album-art/|archivedate=April 21, 2011}}</ref> The cover received a negative response from critics and fans. Sean Michaels of ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressed that the cover "[looked] more like a cheap [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] job than the most anticipated album of the year." He then commented: "Gone are the futurist sunglasses, the asymmetrical haircuts, even Gaga's newly touted magic horns; instead, a mutant motorbike with Gaga's arms and head, plus a cheesy chrome typeface." He also referenced several messages from fans on Gaga's official forum expressing their dislike for the cover.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Sean Michaels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/18/lady-gaga-born-this-way-artwork|title=Lady Gaga's Born This Way artwork provokes fan backlash|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=May 5, 2011|date=April 18, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001142614/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/18/lady-gaga-born-this-way-artwork|archivedate=October 1, 2013}}</ref> Andrew Martin of ''Prefix'' referred to it as "a reject from the last ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' film".<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Martin|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/lady-gaga-reveals-awful-born-this-way-album-art/51471/|title=Lady GaGa Reveals Awful 'Born This Way' Album Art|work=Prefix|date=April 16, 2011|accessdate=May 5, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419002722/http://www.prefixmag.com/news/lady-gaga-reveals-awful-born-this-way-album-art/51471/|archivedate=April 19, 2011}}</ref> The special edition cover was released on the same day: it featured just Gaga's head from the standard edition cover but the words "Lady Gaga" and "Born This Way" appear in the top left corner of the cover.

==Religious criticism controversy==
Several religious groups have condemned the album for its incorporation of several religious icons of Christianity and its stance on sexuality. In [[Lebanon]], ''Born This Way'' was temporarily banned by the General Secretary Department, who deemed the album to be in bad taste and mocking of Christianity.<ref name="NMEBan" /> Abdo Abu Kassm, director of the Catholic Information Center of Lebanon, highly criticized the themes of the album, expressing that "if they are going to offend us we are going to cancel the album."<ref name="LebanonBan">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/07/lady-gaga-born-this-way-banned-lebanon|title=Lady Gaga's Born This Way banned in Lebanon|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2011|work=The Guardian|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930111000/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/07/lady-gaga-born-this-way-banned-lebanon|archivedate=September 30, 2013}}</ref> He continued: "We will not accept that anyone insult the [[Virgin Mary]] or Jesus or Christianity [...].

The music video of "[[Judas (Lady Gaga song)|Judas]]" was criticized by [[William Anthony Donohue]], the president of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]], notably for Gaga's portrayal of [[Mary Magdalene]].
