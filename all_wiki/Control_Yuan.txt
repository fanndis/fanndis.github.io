{{Politics of Taiwan}}

== History ==
=== Constitutional theory ===
{{see also|Censorate}}
The concept of Control Yuan was introduced by [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Three Principles of the People]]''. The theory proposed a [[separation of powers]] into five branches ({{zh|t=五院|p=wǔyuàn|poj=gō͘-īⁿ|labels=no}}). [[Sun Yat-sen]] demonstrated the benefit of separate the supervision and auditing power from the [[legislature]] by the designation of the state organs of the [[History of China|Imperial China]]. He quotes the long tradition of supervision used in past dynasties, ranging from the ''Censor'' ({{lang|zh-tw|御史}}) established by the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] ({{lang|zh-tw|秦}}) and [[Han dynasty|Han]] ({{lang|zh-tw|漢}}) dynasties to the ''tái'' ({{lang|zh-tw|臺}}) and ''jiàn'' ({{lang|zh-tw|諫}}) offices established under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] ({{lang|zh-tw|隋}}) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] ({{lang|zh-tw|唐}}) dynasties (''tai'' were selected to supervise civil officials and military officers, while ''jian'' were selected to counsel the emperor on supervisory matters) to the ''Board of Public Censors'' ({{lang|zh-tw|都察院}}) selected under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] ({{lang|zh-tw|明}}) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] ({{lang|zh-tw|清}}) dynasties. Most of these offices also operated local and provincial branches to supervise local governments. Under the [[Qing dynasty]], the Board of Public Censors consisted of forty or fifty members, and two presidents, one of [[Manchu]] ancestry and the other of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] ancestry.<ref>Hawke's Bay Herald. Volume XXXV, Issue 11595. Monday, July 23, 1900. Page 2.</ref><ref>The Statesman's year-book, Volume 47. Page 685.</ref> They were, in theory, allowed to send one censor to participate in the meetings of all government boards. The Board's powers were minimized by the time of political flux which preceded the end of the Empire.

However, the 1947 [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] has many influence from the resolutions of the [[Political Consultative Assembly]] held between the Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) and the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. [[Carsun Chang]], the major author of the Constitution draft in the [[Political Consultative Assembly]], considered the fact that the supervision and auditing power is traditionally held by the [[legislature]], and also the proposal of [[federalism]] from the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] in the drafting process. He designed the Control Yuan to be a [[Legislative chamber|chamber]] of [[parliament]] that is [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] by the [[Provinces of China|provincial]] legislatures of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]]. The Control Yuan has some similarities to the [[United States Senate]] which put similar number of seats to each [[Provinces of China|province]] of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] and hold many powers to confirm important public positions in [[Judicial Yuan]] and [[Examination Yuan]] appointed by the [[President of the Republic of China|President of the Republic]].

In the 1947 constitution, Control Yuan, together with [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] and [[Legislative Yuan]], form a [[Tricameralism|tricameral parliament]] according to the [[Judicial Yuan]]'s interpretation number 76 of the Constitution in 1957.<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|[[:wikisource:zh:司法院釋字第76號解釋|司法院釋字第76號解釋]]}}, [http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/EN/p03_01.asp?expno=76 Judicial Yuan interpretation number 76 (English translation)]</ref> The Control Yuan was given the power to request documents from other government agencies and investigate them for violations of law or neglect as under [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ideology. The [[Comptroller|auditor-general]] is place under the Control Yuan, who shall be nominated by the [[President of the Republic of China|President of the Republic]] with consent of the [[Legislative Yuan]], who was responsible for submitting reports on government budgets.<ref name="cosnt">{{cite constitution |article= 90-106|section=IX|polity=the Republic of China|date=1947}}</ref> Finally, the Control Yuan had confirmation power for the President, Vice President and members of the [[Judicial Yuan]] and [[Examination Yuan]].<ref>{{cite constitution |article=79|section=VI|polity=the Republic of China|date=1947}}</ref><ref>{{cite constitution |article=84|section=VII|polity=the Republic of China|date=1947}}</ref>

=== Establishment and relocation to Taiwan ===
[[File:Control Yuan Building 20050702.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Control Yuan building, built in 1915 when [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was under Japanese rule]] as the governmental building of [[Taihoku Prefecture]].]]
In early [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|republican era]], the [[Beiyang government]] was in favor of the traditional three-branch form of [[separation of powers]]. However, the weak [[republicanism]] soil and the later [[Warlord Era]] suppresses the implementation of these constitutional ideology.

After a successful [[Northern Expedition]] campaign, the [[Kuomintang]] secured its leadership in [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] and started to build the [[Nationalist government]] according to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ideology. Five branches (''Yuan''s) were created under the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[One-party state|party-state]] administration. During this time, the Auditing Yuan ({{zh|t=審計院|p=Shěnjì Yuàn}}) was established in February 1928, but in February 1931, the Control Yuan was established and the Auditing Yuan was downgraded to the current ministry-level National Audit Office within the Control Yuan.<ref name="cy">http://www.cy.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=6036&CtNode=989&mp=21</ref> The creation of Control Yuan on 16 February 1931 was the last establishment of the five-''Yuan''s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Herbert Han-pao|title=The Chinese Control Yuan: An Independent Supervisory Organ of the State|journal=Washington University Law Review|volume=1963|issue=4|pages=402}}</ref>

However, the 1947 [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], although retain the architecture of the five-branch government, changed the Control Yuan to be a [[parliament]] [[Legislative chamber|chamber]]. Under the constitution, the members elected from regional [[legislature]]s: 5 from each [[provinces of China|province]], 2 from each [[Direct-administered municipalities of China|direct-administered municipality]], 8 from [[Outer Mongolia|Mongolia]], 8 from [[Tibet]], and 8 from [[overseas Chinese]]. The [[List of Presidents of the Control Yuan|President]] and [[List of Vice Presidents of the Control Yuan|Vice President]] of the Control Yuan shall be elected by and from the members like the [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of many other [[parliament]]ary bodies. Follow the [[promulgation]] of the ''Constitution'', the 178 first Control Yuan members elected by the regional [[legislature]]s and convened in [[Nanjing|Nanking]] on June 4, 1948.<ref name="cy" /> The first Control Yuan then confirmed the leaders and members of the first [[Judicial Yuan]] and [[Examination Yuan]]. The transition from [[one-party state]] [[Nationalist government]] to [[Government of the Republic of China|constitutional government]] is hence completed.

However, a year later, the [[Kuomintang]]-led [[government of the Republic of China]] lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] and [[Retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan|retreated to]] [[Taiwan]] in December 1949. [[Taiwan]] was [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] before August 15, 1945. As a result of [[World War II]], the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] occupied [[Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The government established [[Taiwan Province]] to mark its annexation of [[Taiwan]]. There were 104 members retreated to Taiwan with the government. The Control Yuan occupied the former governmental building of [[Taihoku Prefecture]] in [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]]. Term of the retreated members was extended indefinitely until "re-election is possible in their original [[electoral district]]." During this era, the first Control Yuan members continue to conduct sessions in [[Taipei]] until they were ordered to retire by the [[Judicial Yuan]] (Constitutional Court) in 1991.

=== Democratization ===
Democratization took place in [[Taiwan]] starting late 1980s, the movement resulted in a series of [[constitutional amendment]] known as the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution]]. On May 27, 1992, the second amendment removed Control Yuan from [[parliament]] [[Legislative chamber|chambers]]. Decision process of leaders and members of the Control Yuan follows a similar pattern of [[Judicial Yuan]] and [[Examination Yuan]]. These officials were nominated by the [[President of the Republic of China|President of the Republic]] and confirmation by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]]. The [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] was another [[parliament]] [[Legislative chamber|chamber]] that can hold the confirmation process to maintain the [[separation of powers]].<ref>{{cite constitution| amendment = 2| polity =the Republic of China| date = 1992}}</ref>

On 18 July 1997, by the 4th [[constitutional amendment]], the procedure to [[impeachment|impeach]] the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and [[President of the Republic of China|Vice President of the Republic]] was transferred out from the Control Yuan. In this amendment, presidential impeachment shall be initiated by [[Legislative Yuan]] and voted by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]].<ref>{{cite constitution| amendment = 4| polity =the Republic of China| date = 1997}}</ref> However, the later political developments in [[Taiwan]] has inclined to simplify the [[parliament]] to [[Unicameralism|one chamber]]. The [[Legislative Yuan]] was the surviving chamber and the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] was then abolished.<ref>{{cite constitution| amendment = 6| polity =the Republic of China| date = 1997}}</ref> Since 25 April 2000, confirmation of leaders and members of the Control Yuan are transferred to [[Legislative Yuan]], together with the confirmation of similar officials of [[Judicial Yuan]] and [[Examination Yuan]].<ref>{{cite constitution| amendment = 7| polity =the Republic of China| date = 1997}}</ref>

At the end of 2004, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chen Shui-bian]] sent a list of nominees to positions in the Control Yuan to the [[Legislative Yuan]] for approval. The coalition of [[Kuomintang]] and [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]], which then held a majority in the Legislative Yuan, refused to ratify President Chen's nominees and demanded that he submit a new list. The political deadlock that resulted stopped the Control Yuan from functioning from February 2005 to July 2008. The situation resolved after [[Kuomintang]]'s candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] was elected as the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] in [[2008 Taiwanese presidential election]] and [[Kuomintang]] won the [[supermajority]] of Legislative Yuan seats in [[2008 Taiwanese legislative election]]. Mr. [[Wang Chien-shien]] was then appointed to be its President under the [[Ma Ying-jeou]] administration.

In 2016, [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s candidate [[Tsai Ing-wen]] was elected as the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] in [[2016 Taiwanese presidential election]] and [[Democratic Progressive Party]] won the majority of Legislative Yuan seats in [[2016 Taiwanese legislative election]]. On 10 December 2019, the [[Legislative Yuan]] passed the National Human Rights Committee Organic Law (國家人權委員會組織法), which established the National Human Rights Committee under the Control Yuan. Its duties include investigating human rights abuses, proposing human rights laws, compiling an annual report, and educational promotion of human rights, in accordance with the [[Paris Principles]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shih |first1=Hsiu-chuan |title=Control Yuan may be made National Human Rights Institution |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/201812110020 |accessdate=18 June 2020 |work=[[Central News Agency (Taiwan)]] |date=11 December 2018}}</ref>  The committee will consist of 10 members, one of which is the President of the Control Yuan who heads the committee.<ref name="hr">{{cite news |last1=Wang |first1=Yang-yu |last2=Mazzetta |first2=Matthew |title=Bill passed to establish Human Rights Committee under Control Yuan |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/201912100020 |accessdate=8 June 2020 |work=[[Central News Agency (Taiwan)]] |date=10 December 2019}}</ref> It was reported that Tsai would nominate former democracy activist [[Chen Chu]] as president of the Control Yuan in 2020, and [[Kuomintang]] member [[Justin Huang]] as vice president.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Xie |first1=Dennis |title=Chen Chu to be Control Yuan head |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/06/19/2003738489 |accessdate=18 June 2020 |work=[[Taipei Times]] |date=19 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=監院副院長 提名回扣案黃健庭 立委譁然 |url=https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/paper/1380809 |accessdate=19 June 2020 |work=[[Liberty Times]] |date=19 June 2020}}</ref>  It is not clear how the National Human Rights Committee will interact with the existing Committee on Human Rights Protection.<ref>{{cite act|url=https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=A0010079|title=Regulations Governing the Establishment of the Control Yuan Committee on Human Rights Protection|date=19 June 2013}}</ref>

==Elections and terms==
The [[Kuomintang]]-led [[government of the Republic of China]] [[Retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan|retreated]] to [[Taiwan]] in 1949, the year following the elections after the enactment of the 1947 constitution. As the [[Kuomintang]] government continues to claim sovereignty over [[mainland China]], the term limit of the original Members of the Control Yuan was extended until "re-election is possible in their original [[electoral districts]]." In response to the increasing democracy movement in [[Taiwan]], limited supplementary elections were held in the [[Free area of the Republic of China|Free Area]] ([[Taiwan]]) starting 1969. Members elected in these supplementary elections served together with those who were elected in 1948. This situation remained until a Constitutional Court ([[Judicial Yuan]]) ruling on June 21, 1991 that ordered the retirement of all members with extended terms by the end of 1991.<ref>[https://web.cec.gov.tw/central/cms/elec_hist/21226 中央選舉委員會歷次選舉摘要－監察委員選舉]</ref>
