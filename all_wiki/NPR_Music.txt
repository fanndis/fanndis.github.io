'''NPR Music''' is a project of [[National Public Radio]], an American privately and publicly funded non-profit membership media organization,<ref>[https://www.npr.org/music/ "Music" tab] ''npr.org'' Retrieved July 30, 2012</ref> that launched in November 2007 to present public radio music programming and original editorial content for music discovery. NPR Music offers current and archival podcasts, live concert webcasts, reviews, music lists, news, studio sessions, and interviews to listen to from NPR and partner public radio stations across the country, as well as an index of public radio music stations streaming live on the Internet.  There are two blogs: "Monitor Mix" by [[Sleater-Kinney]] musician [[Carrie Brownstein]] and the ''[[All Songs Considered]]'' Blog by [[Bob Boilen]] and Robin Hilton.
