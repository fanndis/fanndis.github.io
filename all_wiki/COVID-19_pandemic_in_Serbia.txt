The '''COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia''' is a current outbreak of the disease [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in [[Serbia]] caused by the virus [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]].

In late June 2020, the [[Balkan Insight]] published a report based on the allegedly leaked data from the internal Government COVID-19 information system. This report stated that in reality, Serbia had recorded 632 deaths due to COVID-19 in the period from 19 March to 1 June 2020, which corresponds to 388 additional deaths caused by the virus that were not publicly reported. Additionally, according to the leaked data, the number of people who became infected in Serbia from 17 June to 20 June was at least 300 per day, while public reports never accounted for more than 96 cases per day in the same period.<ref name="balkaninsight.com">{{cite web|date=22 June 2020|title=Serbia Under-Reported COVID-19 Deaths and Infections, Data Shows|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2020/06/22/serbia-under-reported-covid-19-deaths-and-infections-data-shows/|accessdate=22 June 2020|website=}}</ref> Recovery figures were also disputed, with the Public Health Institute of Montenegro formally requesting an explanation from Serbian authorities in early June following a reported recovery of 4,000 patients in one day.<ref name="rs.n1info.com">{{cite web|date=8 June 2020|title=Montenegro wants explanation of Serbian coronavirus recovery figures|url=http://rs.n1info.com/English/NEWS/a607687/Montenegro-wants-explanation-of-Serbian-coronavirus-recovery-figures.html|accessdate=22 June 2020|website=}}</ref> Earlier, the index case was also disputed after the Public Health Institute publicly revealed that the first case was registered a week before the officially reported index case.<ref name="telegraf.rs" />

In September 2020, [[NIN (magazine)|NIN]] weekly released research results that show a significant discrepancy between the data on the number of infected persons and the number of tests that were released by the Government during July and the data that was obtained from individual public health institutions through the [[freedom of information]] requests. The discrepancy shows that the Government released data inflated the number of tests that were conducted and that the number of infected persons was decreased by at least 59% during July.<ref name="NIN">{{cite web|date=25 September 2020|title=Spinovana statistika i lažne brojke |url=http://www.nin.co.rs/pages/article.php?id=102354668|accessdate=26 September 2020|website=}}</ref>
