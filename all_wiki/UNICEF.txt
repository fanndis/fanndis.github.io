'''UNICEF''', also known as the '''United Nations Children's Fund''',{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The agency's name used to be the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund with the acronym UNICEF.

UNICEF is the successor of the '''International Children's Emergency Fund (ICEF)''', created in 1946 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|U.N. Relief Rehabilitation Administration]] to provide immediate relief to children and mothers affected by [[World War II]]. The same year, the [[United Nations General Assembly|U.N. General Assembly]] established the '''United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund''' (UNICEF) to further institutionalize post-war relief work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/stories/learning-experience-19461979|title=Learning from experience: 1946–1979|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In 1950, UNICEF's mandate was extended to address the long-term needs of children and women, particularly in developing countries. In 1953, the organization became a permanent part of the [[United Nations System]], and its name was subsequently changed to its current form, though it retains the original acronym.<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web|title=About UNICEF - FAQ|url=https://www.unicef.org/about-unicef/frequently-asked-questions#3|access-date=4 April 2017|website=UNICEF|at=What does the acronym UNICEF stand for?}}</ref>

UNICEF relies entirely on contributions from governments and private donors. Its total income as of 2018 was $5.2 billion, of which two-thirds came from governments; private groups and individuals contributed the rest through national committees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/2018-2021_Draft_Integrated_Budget_EB_Informal_23_June.pdf|title=UNICEF Integrated Budget 2018-2021|date=23 June 2017}}</ref> It is governed by a 36-member executive board that establishes policies, approves programs, and oversees administrative and financial plans. The board is made up of government representatives elected by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], usually for three-year terms.

UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children. Most of its work is in the field, with a network that includes 150 country offices, headquarters and other facilities and 34 "national committees" that carry out its mission through programs developed with host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical assistance to country offices as needed, while its Supply Division—based in [[Copenhagen]] and [[New York City|New York—]]<nowiki/>helps provide over $3 billion in critical aid and services.<ref name="SD"/>
[[File:Unicef.png|thumb|261x261px|Flag of UNICEF]]
In 2018, UNICEF assisted in the birth of 27 million babies, administered [[pentavalent vaccine]]s to an estimated 65.5 million children, provided education for 12 million children, treated four million children with [[severe acute malnutrition]], and responded to 285 humanitarian emergencies in 90 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/reports/annual-report-2018|title=UNICEF annual report 2018|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> UNICEF has received recognition for its work, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1965, the [[Indira Gandhi Prize]] in 1989 and the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Princess of Asturias Award]] in 2006. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF, along with the World Health Organization and other agencies, published guidance about healthy parenting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/reports/key-messages-and-actions-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-prevention-and-control-schools|title=Interim Guidance for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in Schools|website=unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-09-20}}</ref>

UNICEF relies on country offices to help carry out its work through a unique program of cooperation developed with the host government. The programs last five years and seek to develop practical strategies for fulfilling and protecting the rights of children and women. Regional offices guide this work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization take place at its New York headquarters, where global policy on children is shaped.

Guiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is an Executive Board made up of 36 members who are government representatives. The Board establishes policies, approves programs and decides on administrative and financial plans and budgets. Its work is coordinated by the Bureau, comprising the President and four Vice-Presidents, each officer representing one of the five regional groups. These five officers are elected by the Executive Board annually from among its members, with the presidency rotating among the regional groups on an annual basis. As a matter of custom, permanent members of the Security Council do not serve as officers of the Executive Board.

The Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board helps maintain an effective relationship between the Executive Board and the UNICEF secretariat, and organizes field visits by board members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/structure/|title=How UNICEF works|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/|title=Home|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/index_13225.html|title=Bureau|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref>[[File:1 school in a box.jpg|thumb|right|UNICEF ''School in a box'' contains basic educational items for one teacher and 40 students]]

==UNICEF national committees==
{{see also|List of UNICEF National Committees}}
There are national committees in 36 developed countries, each established as an independent local [[non-governmental organization]]. Their primary function is to raise funds from the public sector, as UNICEF is entirely dependent on voluntary contributions.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/publicpartnerships/files/UNICEF_Transparency_and_Accountability_-_Resource_Development_and_Mobilization.pdf Presentation – UNICEF’s Resource Development Architecture Key Trends and Challenges]. UNICEF. Retrieved on 2014-10-21.</ref> National Committees collectively account for about one-third of the agency's annual income, including from corporations, civil society organizations, around six million individual donors worldwide.

==Promotion and fundraising==
In the United States, [[Nepal]] and some other countries, UNICEF is known for its "Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF" program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they [[trick-or-treating|trick-or-treat]] on [[Halloween]] night, sometimes instead of candy. The program was discontinued in [[Canada]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/unicef-ends-halloween-program-in-canada-1.618474 |title=UNICEF ends Halloween program in Canada |work= CBC News |date= 30 May 2006 |access-date = 10 October 2020}}</ref>

UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world, but not involved in nine others ([[Bahamas]], [[Brunei]], [[Cyprus]], [[Latvia]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Monaco]], [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/index.html |title=Information by country |publisher=UNICEF |date=2014-03-17 |access-date=2014-08-03}}</ref>

Many people in [[developed countries]] first hear about UNICEF's work through the activities of one of the 36 [[List of UNICEF National Committees|National Committees for UNICEF]]. These [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) are primarily responsible for [[fundraising]], selling UNICEF greeting cards and products, creating private and public partnerships, advocating for children's rights, and providing other support. The [[US Fund for UNICEF]] is the oldest of the national committees, founded in 1947.<ref>[http://www.unicefusa.org/site/c.duLRI8O0H/b.25933/k.8DDD/US_Fund_for_UNICEF__US_Fund_for_UNICEF.htm US Fund for UNICEF], unicefusa.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024144251/http://www.unicefusa.org/site/c.duLRI8O0H/b.25933/k.8DDD/US_Fund_for_UNICEF__US_Fund_for_UNICEF.htm |date=October 24, 2007 }}</ref>

In 2009, the British retailer [[Tesco]] used "Change for Good" as advertising, which is trademarked by UNICEF for charity usage but not for commercial or retail use. This prompted the agency to say, "it is the first time in Unicef's history that a commercial entity has purposely set out to capitalise on one of our campaigns and subsequently damage an income stream which several of our programs for children are dependent on". They went on to call on the public "who have children’s welfare at heart, to consider carefully who they support when making consumer choices".<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0725/1224251305112.html "Unicef accuses Tesco of misusing charity slogan"].

===UNICEF World Warehouse===
The old UNICEF World Warehouse is a large facility in [[Denmark]], which hosts UNICEF deliverable goods as well as co-hosts emergency goods for [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) and the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC). Until 2012 the facilities was a 25,000m<sup>2</sup> warehouse at [[Nordhavnen|Marmormolen]] in Copenhagen. With construction of a 45,000m<sup>2</sup> [[UN City]] that is to house all UN activities in Copenhagen under one roof,<ref name='marmormolen'>{{cite web|url=http://www.byoghavn.dk/marmor-front/Marmormolen/FN+Byen.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901180829/http://www.byoghavn.dk/marmor-front/Marmormolen/FN%2BByen.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-01 |title=FN Byen |access-date=2012-07-06 |author=By & Havn |language=da |author-link=By & Havn }}</ref> the warehouse service has been relocated to outer parts of the [[Freeport of Copenhagen]]. The facility houses the UNICEF Supply Division which manages strategic hubs in [[Dubai]], [[Douala]], and [[Colón, Panama|Colón]].<ref name="SD">{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/supply/index_contact.html|access-date=28 January 2020|title=Supplies and Logistics|work=UNICEF}}</ref> The warehouse contains a variety of items, e.g., [[food supplements]], [[Chlorine Dioxide Tablets|water purification tablets]], [[dietary supplement|dietary]] and [[Vitamin#Supplements|vitamin supplements]], and the "School in a box" (illustrated above).

===UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre===
The UNICEF [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Innocenti]] Research Centre in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], was established in 1988. The centre, formally known as the International Child Development Centres, has as its prime objectives to improve international understanding of issues relating to children's rights, to promote economic policies that advance the cause of children, and to help facilitate the full implementation of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in industrialized and developing countries.

The program for 2006–2008 was approved by UNICEF Executive Board in September 2005. {{update|section|date=August 2015}}
It reaffirms the centre's academic freedom and the focus of IRC's research on knowledge gaps, emerging questions and sensitive issues which are relevant to the realization of children's rights, in developing and industrialized countries. It capitalizes on IRC's role as an interface between UNICEF field experience, international experts, research networks and policy makers and is designed to strengthen the centre's institutional collaboration with regional academic and policy institutions, pursuing the following goals:
* Generation and communication of strategic and influential knowledge on issues affecting children and the realization of their rights;
* Knowledge exchange and brokering;
* Support to UNICEF's advocacy, policy's and program development in support of the Millennium Agenda
* Securing and strengthening the centre's institutional and financial basis.

Three interrelated strategies guide the achievement of these goals:
* Evidence-based analysis drawing on quantitative and qualitative information, the application of appropriate methodologies, and the development of recommendations to assess and inform advocacy and policy action.
* Enhanced partnerships with research and policy institutions and development actors, globally and at regional level, in developing and industrialized countries.
* Communication and leveraging of research findings and recommendations to support policy development and advocacy initiatives through strategic dissemination of studies and contribution to relevant events and fora.<ref>[http://www.unicef-irc.org/ Innocenti Research Centre], UNICEF-irc.org</ref>

==Position on ethical themes==
UNICEF's programmatic objectives include the promotion of safe [[abortion]]s <ref>{{cite web |title=Son preference perpetuates discrimination and violations of women's rights – it must and can end |url=https://www.unicef.org/media/media_58924.html |website=UNICEF |access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref> and education in [[Human population planning|family planning]] and in the use of [[contraception]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/projects/contraception/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Current HRP projects|website=WHO|access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lepantoin.org/unicef/|title=UNICEF|website=The Lepanto Institute|language=en-US|access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref>

In a joint declaration of 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/Preventing_gender-biased_sex_selection.pdf|title=Preventing gender-biased sex selection}}</ref> UNICEF argued the need to combat the spread of selective abortion, through plans that favored, inter alia, the use of safe abortion services and family planning programs in order to decrease the use of abortion.

In 2013, together with WHO, it published an integrated plan of guidelines for the prevention of infant mortality caused by pneumonia and diarrhea, including, among the recommended strategies for promoting the health of women and children, access to safe abortion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/files/Final_GAPPD_main_Report-_EN-8_April_2013.pdf|title=Ending Preventable Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea by 2025}}</ref>

UNICEF has adopted the ABC strategy ("'''a'''bstinence, '''b'''e faithful and consistent '''c'''ondom use") promoted in various international AIDS prevention interventions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=UNICEF|first2=Joint United Nations Programme on|last2=HIV/AIDS|title=Young People and HIV/AIDS: Opportunity in Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyj79Vq24GAC&q=UNICEF%2FMultiple+Indicator+Cluster+Surveys+%28MICS%29%2CMeasure+DHS%2C+1999-2001.+condom&pg=PP16|access-date=21 June 2020|date=2002|publisher=The Stationery Office|language=en|isbn=978-0-11-987820-2}}</ref> The strategy was later updated as the "'''ABC to Z''' model", to include '''D'''elaying and '''V'''oluntary '''C'''ounselling & '''T'''esting.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UNICEF|date=2005|title=Simple as ABC?

In 1996 the [[Holy See|Vatican]] withdrew its symbolic contribution to UNICEF on the occasion of the publication by UNICEF of a manual on emergency operations for refugee populations which supported the spread of [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptive practices]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Patricia |title=Good Catholics: The Battle over Abortion in the Catholic Church |date=2014-05-20 |publisher=Univ of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-95827-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qkMAwAAQBAJ&q=unicef+vatican+contraception&pg=PA206 |access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Holy See gets tough on UNICEF |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/holy-see-gets-tough-on-unicef-1.19946 |website=The Irish Times |access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deen |first1=T. |title=UNICEF supports birth control despite Holy See |journal=Popline |year=1992 |volume=14 |pages=3–4 |pmid=12317622 |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12317622/}}</ref>

Despite this, on several occasions senior UNICEF officials have denied that the organization promoted abortion or family planning methods.<ref>{{cite web |title=UNICEF And Abortion |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/unicef-and-abortion-1.96197 |website=The Irish Times |access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.it/doc/2140/unicef-e-aborto-un-chiarimento-necessario.htm|title=UNICEF e aborto, un chiarimento necessario|website=www.unicef.it|language=IT|access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref>

UNICEF also supports the adoption by states of laws that guarantee [[Homosexual union|LGBT couples]] and their children the legal recognition of their status, as these rules would help ensure the best interests of children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.it/Allegati/Position_Paper_Sexual_Identification_and_Gender_Identity_12_Nov_2014.pdf|title=ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST CHILDREN AND PARENTS BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND/ OR GENDER IDENTITY}}</ref>

=={{anchor|Criticism}}Controversies==

===Adoption program===
UNICEF has a policy preferring orphanages only be used as temporary accommodation for children when there is no alternative. UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large-scale, permanent orphanages for children, preferring instead to find children places in their (extended) families and communities, wherever possible. This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care problems in developing countries; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3228398/IA-GlPol72409.pdf?sequence=2|title=Bartholet article on human rights and adoption}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bothendsburning.org/|title=Both Ends Burning|access-date=9 July 2015}}</ref>

A 2015 article in ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' magazine asserted UNICEF's intervention that on giving large cash payments to developing countries can lead to a cessation of international adoptions until all of its recommendations are in place, and have even labelled UNICEF a "villain" for the extent of its negative impact on orphans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2013/05/17/bureaucracy-keeps-adopted-children-stuck-in-international-limbo|title=Bureaucracy Keeps Adopted Children Stuck in International Limbo - US News|author=Peter Roff|work=US News & World Report|access-date=9 July 2015}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Bartholet]] and Paulo Barrozo have written in this context, encouraging adoption protocols to take on a more child-centric viewpoint.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Child mortality===
One concern is that the child [[mortality rate]] has not decreased in some areas as rapidly as had been planned, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where in 2013 "the region still has the highest child mortality rate: 92 deaths per 1000 live births".<ref name=CMEp1>Danzhen You, Lucia Hug and Yao Chen, [http://childmortality.org/files_v19/download/unicef-2013-child-mortality-report-LR-10_31_14_195.pdf "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality: Report 2014: Estimates Developed by the UN Interagency Group for Child mortality Estimation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814133928/http://childmortality.org/files_v19/download/unicef-2013-child-mortality-report-LR-10_31_14_195.pdf |date=2015-08-14 }}. Published by the United Nations Children's Fund, The World Bank, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Population Division, 2014. Retrieved August 1, 2015. p. 1.</ref> and that "Globally, nearly half of under-five deaths are attributable to undernutrition."

In 2005, [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]] editor-in-chief of ''[[The Lancet]]'', editorialized that "over 60% of these deaths were and remain preventable" and that the coverage levels for these interventions are "appallingly low in the 42 countries that account for 90% of child deaths".<ref name="horton">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17560-0|title=UNICEF leadership 2005–2015: a call for strategic change|year=2004|last1=Horton|first1=Richard|author-link=Richard Horton (editor)|journal=The Lancet|volume=364|pages=2071–2074|pmid=15589292|issue=9451|s2cid=42522736}}</ref>

A $27 million UNICEF program in [[West Africa]] in 2001-2005 which was meant to decrease child deaths from disease has been deemed a failure, according to a study that found higher survival rates of children in some regions that weren't included in that program.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/unicef-program-failed-to-save-children-study-1.939386</ref>

Critics argue that UNICEF's focus on rights rather than safety and survival is idealistic, and that by focusing on politicized [[children's rights]] instead of mere child survival, UNICEF has contributed indirectly to the [[child mortality]] crisis.<ref>http://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=1443</ref>

===NSA surveillance===
{{Further|Global surveillance disclosure}}
Documents released by [[Edward Snowden]] in December 2013 showed that "UNICEF" was among the surveillance targets of British and American intelligence agencies.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/20/gchq-targeted-aid-agencies-german-government-eu-commissioner GCHQ and NSA targeted charities, Germans, Israeli PM and EU chief] The Guardian 20 December 2013</ref>
