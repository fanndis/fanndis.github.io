'''Tung Chee-hwa''' {{Post-nominals|country=HKG|GBM}} ({{zh-t|董建華}}; born 7 July 1937) is a Shanghai-born Hong Kong businessman and politician. He was the first [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] upon the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] on 1 July 1997 to 12 March 2005. He is currently a vice-chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC).

Born as the eldest son of Chinese shipping magnate [[Tung Chao Yung]] who founded [[Orient Overseas Container Line]] (OOCL), Tung took over the family business after his father's death in 1981. Four years later, OOCL teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, and the business was saved by the [[government of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China government]] through [[Henry Fok]] in 1986.

He was appointed an unofficial member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong]] by the last [[Governor of Hong Kong|British Governor]] [[Chris Patten]] in 1992 and was tipped as Beijing's favourite as the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR. In 1996, he [[1996 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|was elected]] the Chief Executive by a 400-member [[Selection Committee]]. His government was embroiled with a series of crises, including the [[Influenza A virus|bird flu]] and the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]]. In 2002, he [[2002 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|was re-elected]] without competition. In 2003, [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003|more than 500,000 protesters]] demanded Tung to step down in the light of the [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|proposed legislation]] of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23]] and the [[2002–2004 SARS outbreak|SARS outbreak]]. Tung resigned in the middle of his second term on 10 March 2005.

After his resignation, he was appointed vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference by the Beijing government and formed the [[China–United States Exchange Foundation|China-United States Exchange Foundation]] (CUSEF) in 2008 to influence public opinion towards China in the United States. In 2014, he founded a think tank [[Our Hong Kong Foundation]] consisting of the membership of numerous leading tycoons. He remains influential in Hong Kong politics and is dubbed as "kingmaker".<ref name="OOIL"/>

==Family and early life==
Tung was born in Shanghai on 7 July 1937,<ref>Chinese calendar 29 May 1937 as disclosed in directorship filings at UK Companies Registry</ref> 29th day of the fifth lunar month in 1937 in the [[Chinese calendar]] into an influential shipping magnate family of [[Tung Chao Yung]]. Tung Chao Yung was the founder of the [[Orient Overseas Container Line]], a shipping company which was closely associated with the [[government of the Republic of China]]. His younger brother, [[Tung Chee-chen]], was ranked as the 23rd wealthiest man in Hong Kong in 2009, worth US$900 million.<ref>[[Forbes]] Hong Kong's 40 Richest (April 2009): [https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/82/business-hongkong09_Chee-Chen-(CC)-Tung_LP4N.html #23 Chee Chen (C.C.) Tung]</ref> In January 2008, Tung and his family were ranked (also by Forbes) as the 16th wealthiest in Hong Kong, with a total value of US$3 billion.<ref>[[Forbes]] Hong Kong's 40 Richest (Jan 2008): [https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/82/biz_08hkrichest_Chee-Chen-Tung-family_LP4N.html #16 Chee Chen Tung & family]</ref>

In 1949, Tung's father moved the family to Hong Kong in the same year as the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]], when Tung was 12 years old. His father remained close to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang government]] on [[Taiwan]], in which the logo OCCL has been [[plum blossom]], the [[National Flower of the Republic of China|national flower of the Republic of China]]. In the 1950s, Tung attended the [[Chung Wah Middle School]], a leftist school later shut down by the Hong Kong colonial government in the light of the [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots|1967 Leftist riots]].<ref name="undergroundfront">{{cite book|last1=Loh|first1=Christine|title=Underground Front: The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong|date=2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9789888028948|page=113}}</ref> He was sent abroad to study at [[Liverpool University]], leaving him with a lifelong passion for the [[Liverpool Football Club]].

==Early business and political career==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2019}}
He joined his father's business upon his return to Hong Kong in 1969 and gradually took over the leadership of the family enterprise. He took over his family business in 1982 when his father died. However, in 1985, his company was heavily in debt and teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. [[Henry Fok]], a pro-Beijing businessman took initiative and helped Tung's family, with the support of the Beijing government. At the time of the Sino-British negotiation over Hong Kong's sovereignty, Beijing was enforcing the "[[PRC United Front strategy|united front]]" strategy to gather the widest possible range of allies together and gradually isolate opponents. Tung became close to the Communist authorities in Beijing afterward especially with [[Jiang Zemin]], former [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]. He was a member of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee|Basic Law Consultative Committee]] from 1985 to 1990, responsible for the drafting of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]]. In 1993, he was appointed to the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the top advisory body of China.<ref name="independent"/> He also established close relationship with [[US President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[US Assistant Secretary of State]] [[Winston Lord]].

Under the consensus between the British and Chinese government, Tung, until then remained a low profile in politics, was appointed to the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong]] by the last [[Governor of Hong Kong|British Governor]] [[Chris Patten]], the highest advisory body in the colonial government in 1992, before he left the office in 1996 and ran for the [[1996 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|first Chief Executive election]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Before the election, he received a warm handshake from Jiang Zemin who crossed a crowded room to single out Tung, which was seen as a sign of him being regarded as Beijing's choice for the Chief Executive. Tung employed three "isms" in his election campaign, namely [[Confucianism]], [[elitism]] and [[nationalism]]. On 11 December 1996, he was elected by a 400-member [[Selection Committee]], receiving 320 votes and beating former judge [[Yang Ti-liang]] and tycoon [[Peter Woo]]. He was sworn in as the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the day of [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] on 1 July 1997.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Chief Executive==

===First term===
{{main|First term of Tung Chee-hwa as Chief Executive of Hong Kong}}
In early 1997, Tung saw his victory in the first Chief Executive election,<ref>{{cite web |last = Xavier |first = Gerry |title = Decision day brings a 10-minute replay of Tung's landslide |work = The Standard |date = 24 January 1997 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=45529&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19970124&sear_year=1997 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051520/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=45529&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19970124&sear_year=1997 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> in the voting conducted by 400 committees of [[Election Committee|electoral college]] whose members are appointed by the Chinese Government.

The government pledged to focus on three policy areas: housing, the elderly, and education.<ref>{{cite web |last = Western |first = Neil |title = Maiden policy address |work = The Standard |date = 9 October 1997 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=39561&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19971009&sear_year=1997 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051455/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=39561&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19971009&sear_year=1997 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 30 April 2008 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 }}</ref> Measures on housing included a pledge to provide 85,000 housing flats each year so as to resolve the problems of soaring property prices. The [[Asian financial crisis]] that hit Hong Kong in months after Tung took office made this objective almost immediately redundant and, in fact, it was a collapse in property prices that became a far more pressing problem in the years between 1998 and 2002.

After appointing by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of China]], Tung took office on 1 July 1997. His first term was significantly – and negatively – impacted by the [[Asian financial crisis]] and there was criticism by the general public of his style of governance.   Job losses and plummeting values in the stock and property markets, combined with controversial economic policies (which were called [[crony capitalism]] at the time), the people of Hong Kong started to question Tung and the HKSAR government.

During Tung's first term the government proposed a number of controversial infrastructure and reformation projects including [[Cyberport|technology park]], a science park, a Chinese medicine centre and the [[Hong Kong Disneyland|Disney theme park]]. Tung's decisions were somewhat questioned by the [[Government of China|central government]], including [[Jiang Zemin]], former [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]].

Questions arose over Tung's decision to grant the Cyberport Project to [[Richard Li]], son of tycoon [[Li Ka-shing]], without the benefit of an open tender.<ref>{{cite web |title = Tung pushed to explain high-handed decisions |work = The Standard |date = 18 December 1999 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=44890&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19991218&sear_year=1999 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051510/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=44890&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19991218&sear_year=1999 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = AFP |title = Cyberport critics get stake hint |work = The Standard |date = 21 March 1999 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=25641&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19990321&sear_year=1999 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071122134958/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=25641&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19990321&sear_year=1999 |archivedate = 22 November 2007 }}</ref>

=== Second term ===
{{main|Second term of Tung Chee-hwa as Chief Executive of Hong Kong}}
Tung Chee Hwa, with nominations from 714 members of the electoral college, was uncontested in the election for a second term, as according to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance, nominations from at least 100 members of the 800-strong [[Election Committee|electoral college]] are required for each candidate.<ref>{{cite web |last = Staff reporter |title = Zhu ratifies second Tung term |work = The Standard |date = 5 March 2002 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=13758&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20020305&sear_year=2002 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051336/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=13758&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20020305&sear_year=2002 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref>

==== Accountability system ====
{{Main|Principal Officials Accountability System}}
In an attempt to resolve the difficulties in governance, Tung reformed the structure of government substantially starting from his second term in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |last = Yau |first = Cannix |title = Legco green light for accountability system |work = The Standard |date = 31 May 2002 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=17188&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20020531&sear_year=2002 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051402/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=17188&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20020531&sear_year=2002 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> In a system popularly called the Principal Officials Accountability system, all principal officials, including the [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Chief Secretary]], [[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Financial Secretary]], [[Attorney General of Hong Kong|Secretary for Justice]] and head of [[List of Hong Kong government agencies|government bureaux]] would no longer be politically neutral career civil servants. Instead, they would all be political appointees chosen by the Chief Executive. The system was portrayed as the key to solve previous administrative problems, notably the cooperation of high-ranking civil servants with the Chief Executive. Under the new system, all heads of bureau became members of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]], and came directly under the Chief Executive instead of the Chief Secretary or the Financial Secretary. The heads of the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] and [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]], two pro-government parties in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], were also appointed into the Executive Council to form a "ruling alliance," a ''de facto'' coalition.<ref>{{cite web |last = DeGolyer |first = Michael |title = Stating the obvious |work = The Standard |date = 1 January 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=5877&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030101&sear_year=2003 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051542/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=5877&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030101&sear_year=2003 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> This practically shut out the [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democratic parties]] and individuals.

==== Crisis of governance in 2003 ====
The first major move of Tung in his second term was to push for the [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security legislation]] to implement [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23]] of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] in September 2002. However, the initiative drew a hostile response from the pro-democratic camp, lawyers, journalists, religious leaders and human rights organisations.<ref>{{cite web |last = Staff reporter |title = Bill will limit freedoms say majority of Catholics |work = The Standard |date = 7 July 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=23368&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030707&sear_year=2003 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051424/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=23368&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030707&sear_year=2003 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> This stoked public concerns that the freedoms they enjoyed would deteriorate. The sentiment, together with other factors such as the [[SARS]] epidemic in early 2003, when the government was criticised for its slow response, strained hospital services and the unexpected death toll, resulted in the largest mass demonstration since the establishment of HKSAR, with an estimated 500,000 people (out of the population of 6,800,000) marching on 1 July 2003. Many demanded Tung to step down.<ref>{{cite web |last = Paris Lord |author2 = Cannix Lau |title = 500,000 show anger at 'stubborn' rulers |work = The Standard |date = 2 July 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=23054&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030702&sear_year=2003 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051417/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=23054&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030702&sear_year=2003 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref>

In response to the protests, the leader of the Liberal Party, [[James Tien (politician)|James Tien]], resigned from the Executive Council on evening 6 July, signifying the withdrawal of the party's support for the bill implementing Article 23. As a result, the government had to postpone and later withdraw the bill from the legislative agenda.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ng |first = Dennis |title = Uncertain future for Article 23 |work = The Standard |date = 14 July 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=23846&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030714&sear_year=2003 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051428/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=23846&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030714&sear_year=2003 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 30 April 2008 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 }}</ref> On 17 July 2003, [[Regina Ip]], the then Secretary for Security who was responsible for implementing Article 23, resigned for personal reasons. Another Principal Official, Finance Secretary [[Antony Leung]], who earlier suffered from a scandal over his purchase of a luxury vehicle weeks prior to his introduction of a car sales tax, which was dubbed as the ''Lexusgate'' scandal, resigned on the same day.<ref>{{cite web |last = Fung |first = Fanny |title = Leung, Ip quit |work = The Standard |date = 17 July 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=24045&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030717&sear_year=2003 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051433/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=24045&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030717&sear_year=2003 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref>

During the debate over Hong Kong's constitutional development, Tung was criticised as not reflecting effectively the views of the general population to push for 2007/08 universal suffrage to the People's Republic of China government.<ref>{{cite web |last = Staff reporter |title = Academics call for universal suffrage |work = The Standard |date = 27 June 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=22875&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030627&sear_year=2003 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051412/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=22875&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030627&sear_year=2003 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 30 April 2008 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 }}</ref> Although the primary target of popular opposition was the PRC government, Tung's lack of support for the pro-democratic camp resulted in his low approval ratings.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ng |first = Michael |title = Tung main victim of SARS outbreak |work = The Standard |date = 16 April 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=16606&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030416&sear_year=2003 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051357/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=16606&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20030416&sear_year=2003 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref>

In late 2003, in an attempt to bring back visitors to Hong Kong, Government agency [[InvestHK]] was mandated to sponsor the [[Harbour Fest]] music festival in October, organised by the American Chamber of Commerce. The result was a series of poorly attended concerts, HK$100m bill for the taxpayers, with the Government, InvestHK and the American Chamber of Commerce blaming each other for the flop.,<ref>{{cite web |last = Luk |first = Eddie |title = $100m mistake |work = The Standard |date = 19 November 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=31995&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20031119&sear_year=2003 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522031054/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=31995&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20031119&sear_year=2003 |archivedate = 22 May 2011 }}</ref> EOC chairman to be added.<ref>{{cite web |last = Yau |first = Cannix |title = Legco sets EOC deadline |work = The Standard |date = 10 December 2003 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=33321&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20031210&sear_year=2003 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130107161451/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=33321&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20031210&sear_year=2003 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 7 January 2013 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 }}</ref>

Tung's cabinet suffered another blow in July 2004 when another Principal Official, the Secretary for Health, Welfare & Food, Dr. [[Yeoh Eng-kiong]], resigned on 7 July to take political responsibility for the government's handling of the [[SARS]] outbreak in 2003,<ref>{{cite web |last = Lee |first = Matthew |author2 = Teddy Ng |author3 = Dennis Ng |title = Yeoh Resigns |work = The Standard |date = 8 July 2004 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=31995&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20031119&sear_year=2003 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522031054/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=31995&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20031119&sear_year=2003 |archivedate = 22 May 2011 }}</ref> after the release of the investigation report of LegCo over the issue.

In late 2004, the Tung administration experienced another embarrassment as the large planned sale of government-owned real estate, [[The Link REIT]], was cancelled at the last moment by a lawsuit by a tenant from an affected estate.<ref>{{cite web |last = Yau |first = Cannix |title = REIT woman set to launch appeal |work = The Standard |date = 23 December 2004 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15688&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041223&sear_year=2004 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051351/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15688&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041223&sear_year=2004 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 30 April 2008 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 }}</ref>

With the subsequent improvement in the economy over 2004, unemployment fell and the long period of [[deflation]]<ref>{{cite web |last = Staff reporter |title = Prices plunge 3.6pc as job worries bite |work = The Standard |date = 23 January 2002 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=12147&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20020123&sear_year=2002 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051331/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=12147&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20020123&sear_year=2002 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> ended. This resulted in a decrease in public discontent as the government's popularity improved, and popular support for the democratic movement dwindled with a protest in January <!-- 2004? 2005? -->attracting a mere few thousand protesters compared to the 1 July protests of 2003 and 2004. However, the popularity of Tung himself remained low compared to his deputies including [[Donald Tsang]] and [[Henry Tang]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Ng |first = Michael |title = Tung's poll numbers take a dive |work = The Standard |date = 21 December 2004 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15522&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041221&sear_year=2004 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051346/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15522&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041221&sear_year=2004 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref>

====Resignation====
Tung's reputation suffered further damage when [[Hu Jintao]] gave him a humiliating public dressing-down for poor governance in December 2004. Official sources specifically cited the poor handling of the Link REIT listing, the [[West Kowloon Cultural District|West Kowloon cultural project]], the Hung Hom flats episode.<ref>{{cite web |last = Yau |first = Cannix |title = Hu reprimands Tung |work = The Standard |date = 21 December 2004 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15512&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041221&sear_year=2004 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051340/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15512&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041221&sear_year=2004 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> Tung himself denied it was a dressing-down, and insisted that he retained the central government's support, although he and the rest of the government were asked to examine their past inadequacies.<ref>{{cite news |title = HK leader denies Chinese scolding |work=BBC News |date = 20 December 2004 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4109613.stm |accessdate =11 January 2007}}</ref> Hu's words, however, were thinly veiled criticism. Nevertheless, in his January 2005 Policy Address, Tung gave a rather critical verdict on his own performance.

The speculation which was running rife in the weeks in the run-up to his actual resignation, and its intensity, continued to perpetuate the impression of Tung's "weakness" and "confusion".<ref>{{cite web |last = Hui |first = Sylvia |author2 = Zhu Sun |title = Media takes the measure of departed leader Tung |publisher = Sing Tao News Corp |date = 12 March 2005 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=4612&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20050312&sear_year=2005 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051526/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=4612&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20050312&sear_year=2005 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> Prior to Tung's resignation, in mid-February [[Stanley Ho]], a tycoon with close ties with Beijing, had already commented on the possible candidates for the next Chief Executive and personally endorsed Donald Tsang.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ng |first = Michael |title = Ho throws backing behind Tsang |work = The Standard |date = 18 February 2005 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=3355&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20050218&sear_year=2005 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051448/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=3355&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20050218&sear_year=2005 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> This started rumours that Tung would be nominated to the election of vice chairman of [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) of the PRC. On the night of 27 February 2005, it was revealed that he and nine other persons would be appointed as new members to the CPPCC. All the local newspapers, except for the three controlled by the PRC government, namely [[Ta Kung Pao]], [[Wen Wei Po]] and [[Hong Kong Commercial Daily]], went to the presses preemptively on the morning of 2 March with the headline "Tung Resigns".<ref>{{cite web |last = Chan |first = Carrie |title = Tung resigns |work = The Standard |date = 2 March 2005 |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=4035&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20050302&sear_year=2005 |accessdate = 11 January 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430051504/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=4035&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20050302&sear_year=2005 |archivedate = 30 April 2008 }}</ref> Tung declined to comment when questioned by journalists waiting at the government headquarters.

On 10 March 2005, Tung assembled a press conference at the Central Government Offices and announced that he had tendered his resignation due to "health problems".<ref>{{cite web |last = Yau |first = Cannix |title = Tung's gone.

His resignation sparked a constitutional debate of whether his successor should fill his remaining term of two years, or start a new term of five years.<ref>{{cite news |last = Hogg |first = Chris |title = China to settle new HK chief row |work=BBC News |date = 6 April 2005 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4415257.stm |accessdate =11 January 2007}}</ref> Tung was mostly chosen by the PRC due to his business background as well as owing Beijing for saving him from bankruptcy with a US$100 million loan.<ref name="Hor">Horlemann, Ralf.

==Post-Chief Executive==
===U.S.−China politics===
Soon after he resigned as Chief Executive, he was appointed vice-chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) in March 2005. In 2008, Tung formed the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF), a group whose stated aim is to promote better understanding between the two countries.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120913035619/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=21&art_id=60829&sid=17328225&con_type=1&d_str=20080129&fc=2 Tung lays foundation for success with US 29 January 2008 The Standard]</ref> In 2017, it was reported that the CUSEF has been a tool for the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to push to strengthen its influence over policy debate around the globe by massive funding into organisations abroad, for instance the China Studies department of the [[Johns Hopkins University]]'s [[Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies|School of Advanced International Studies]] (SAIS).<ref>{{cite news|last=Allen-Ebrahimian|first=Bethany|date=28 November 2017|title=This Beijing-Linked Billionaire Is Funding Policy Research at Washington’s Most Influential Institutions|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/11/28/this-beijing-linked-billionaire-is-funding-policy-research-at-washingtons-most-influential-institutions-china-dc/|url-status=live|access-date=16 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=J.

In 2018, the [[University of Texas at Austin]] rejected funding from the CUSEF for its recently established China Public Policy Center, after [[U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Cruz]] wrote a letter of UT Austin president [[Greg Fenves]] in which Cruz expressed his concerns that the university's China Public Policy Center was considering a partnership with the foundation "given its affiliation with the People's Republic of China's United Front system and its registration as an agent of a foreign principal." Cruz also noted Tung's CPPCC vice chairmanship is "an organization which works closely with the United Front, the structure the CCP utilizes to manage foreign influence operations."<ref>{{cite news|last=Redden|first=Elizabeth|date=16 January 2018|title=Thanks, but No, Thanks|work=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/01/16/ut-austin-rejects-funding-chinese-government-linked-foundation|url-status=live|access-date=16 September 2020}}</ref>

===Influence in Hong Kong===
During the [[2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2012 Chief Executive election]], it was reported that one of the two candidates, [[Leung Chun-ying]] was Tung's protege and therefore Leung acquired the goodwill of [[Xi Jinping]], then the head of managing the Hong Kong and Macau affairs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Xi Jinping: Red China, The Next Generation|first=Agnès|last=Andrésy|publisher=UPA|year=2015|page=109}}</ref> Leung, who was seen as the underdog, eventually won in the election over the other pro-Beijing candidate [[Henry Tang]].

In 2014, Tung founded a thinktank [[Our Hong Kong Foundation]]. The foundation has about 80 advisors which consists some of the most well known tycoons and public figures, drawn from the business, education, social welfare, legal and religious sectors, including former Financial Secretary [[Antony Leung]], former [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority|Monetary Authority]] Chief Executive [[Joseph Yam]], and [[Jack Ma]], the chairman of Chinese e-commerce giant [[Alibaba]].<ref>{{cite news|title=China's president praises Hong Kong chief's handling of protests|date=10 November 2018|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-president-praises-hong-kong-chief-protests-20141110-story.html}}</ref> The foundation has been vocal in advocating public policies, including the housing and land supply. In 2018, its proposal of massive reclamation by constructing artificial islands were partly adopted in Chief Executive [[Carrie Lam]]'s [[policy address of Hong Kong|policy address]].

In the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive election]], he was seen hugging Carrie Lam, then [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] who was seen as potential candidate for the Chief Executive after incumbent Leung Chun-ying announced he would not seek for re-election. It was seen as his blessing for Lam to be the next Chief Executive. In February, ''[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]'' cited unnamed sources that Tung Chee-hwa said in a close-door meeting that Beijing may not appoint former [[Financial Secretary of Hong Kong]] [[John Tsang]] as Chief Executive even if he wins the election. He said this was the reason he asked Carrie Lam to run in the election in order to prevent an "embarrassing situation".<ref>{{cite news|title=Tung Chee-hwa: Beijing may not appoint Tsang even if he wins|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20170222-tung-chee-hwa-beijing-may-not-appoint-tsang-even-if-he-wins/|date=22 February 2017|work=ejinsight.com}}</ref> 30 electors of the Legal subsector in the Election Committee expressed "deep concerns" about Tung's comments in a joint statement, stating that "such action undermines the fairness of our Chief Executive election and shows a callous disregard for the aspirations of most Hong Kong people to have free and fair elections without ignorant and insensitive interference."<ref>{{cite news|title=Fairness of Hong Kong chief executive poll under threat from ex-leader’s comments, lawyers say|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2073503/fairness-hong-kong-chief-executive-poll-under-threat-ex|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=23 February 2017}}</ref> He was dubbed as "kingmaker" in the Hong Kong political community.<ref name="OOIL"/>

In July 2017, Tung sold his family business [[Orient Overseas (International) Limited]] (OOIL) to Chinese state-owned [[COSCO|Cosco Shipping]] in a HK$49.2 billion (US$6.3 billion) deal.<ref name="OOIL">{{cite news|title=Tung Chee-hwa secures a 'Godfather' deal from Beijing|date=10 July 2017|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/tung-chee-hwa-secures-godfather-deal-beijing/|newspaper=Asia Times}}</ref>
