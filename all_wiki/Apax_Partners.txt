==History==
{{history of private equity and venture capital}}

Apax Partners Worldwide is the product of the combination of three firms:
*'''Patricof & Co.''', founded in 1969 in New York by pioneering venture capitalist Alan Patricof;
*'''Multinational Management Group''' (MMG), founded in 1972 by [[Ronald Mourad Cohen|Sir Ronald Cohen]] and Maurice Tchénio;<ref name=namechange>"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_Sept_10/ai_78016942 Patricof & Co. Ventures Strategically Takes On 'Apax Partners' Name in Plan to Fortify Leading Global Private Equity Role]"  ''Business Wire'',  Sept 10, 2001.</ref>
*'''Saunders Karp & Megrue''', founded in 1988 by [[Thomas A. Saunders III]] and Allan W. Karp and joined by John Megrue in 1992.

===Patricof & Co. and MMG===
In 1969, Alan Patricof founded Patricof & Co. a firm dedicated to making investments in "development capital" later known as "venture capital," primarily in small early-stage companies.  Patricof, one of the early venture capitalists, was involved in the development of numerous major companies including  [[AOL|America Online]], [[Office Depot]], [[Cadence Design Systems]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] and [[FORE Systems]].<ref>[http://www.wharton-pec.org/conf2006/keynote_alanpatricof.asp 2006 Wharton Private Equity Conference Keynote Speaker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012130851/http://www.wharton-pec.org/conf2006/keynote_alanpatricof.asp |date=2007-10-12 }}</ref>  In 1975, Patricof launched 53rd Street Ventures, a $10 million vehicle.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Meanwhile, in 1972, [[Ronald Mourad Cohen|Sir Ronald Cohen]] and Maurice Tchénio, along with two other partners, founded Multinational Management Group (MMG) with offices in London, Paris, and Chicago.  MMG initially was established as an advisory firm, working with small emerging companies, rather than an investment firm.  However, MMG initially struggled to gain traction amid the negative economic conditions, particularly in the UK in the mid-1970s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

By 1977, two of the original four founding partners had left MMG, leaving Cohen and Tchénio in need of a partner to help rejuvenate their firm.  In that year, Cohen approached Alan Patricof to join them and run the new firm's investments in the U.S.  The new firm would be known as Alan Patricof Associates (APA) and ultimately come to be known as Apax Partners (based on a play on Patricof's name: Alan Patricof Associates Cross (x) Border).  Following the merger, MMG abandoned its advising business, and the new APA shifted its focus exclusively to investing in [[Startup company|start-up]] companies.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===1980s-21st century===
Throughout the 1980s, the firm grew steadily raising capital under a series of separate funds.  As the 1980s progressed, the firm introduced its first later stage venture fund in 1984, its first [[growth capital]] fund in 1987 and its first dedicated European [[leveraged buyout]] fund MMG Patricof European Buy-In Fund in 1989.<ref name=vxpert>Source: [[Thomson Financial]]'s VentureXpert [http://www.venturexpert.com www.venturexpert.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602110227/http://www.venturexpert.com/ |date=2008-06-02 }}</ref>  In response to the changing conditions, in the venture capital industry in the 1980s Apax (and other early venture capital firms including [[Warburg Pincus]] and [[J.H. Whitney & Company]]) began to transition away from venture capital toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments, which were in vogue in that decade.<ref name=VCVigor>POLLACK, ANDREW.  "[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/08/business/venture-capital-loses-its-vigor.html Venture Capital Loses Its Vigor]."  ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 8, 1989.</ref><ref>LUECK, THOMAS J.  "[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/06/business/high-tech-s-glamour-fades-for-some-venture-capitalists.html HIGH TECH'S GLAMOUR FADES FOR SOME VENTURE CAPITALISTS ]."  ''The New York Times'', February 6, 1987.</ref>  This trend was more prevalent in Europe than the U.S. where Patricof preferred to continue focusing on venture investments.

In 1991, Apax Partners became the official name for all of its European operations however the U.S. business still operated under the Patricof & Co. name.  By the mid-1990s Apax had become one of the larger private equity firms globally.

In 2000, Patricof & Co. adopted the Apax Partners branding and formalized its affiliation with its European business.  The U.S. business would operate as Apax Partners, Inc.<ref name=namechange />  The following year, Patricof stepped back from day-to-day management of Apax Partners, Inc., the US arm of the firm to return to his original focus on making venture capital investments in small early-stage companies.  In 2006, Patricof left Apax to form [[Greycroft Partners]] which focuses on small early-stage venture capital investments.<ref>Sorkin, Andrew Ross. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/06/business/media/06apax.html?_r=1&scp=5&sq=patricof&st=cse&oref=slogin New Fund for Prominent Investor]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 6, 2006.</ref>

Despite the closer relations between the U.S. and European teams, the firm still operated separate fund entities for each geography.  The European side of the business began to pull away in terms of capital commitments, raising more than $5 billion for its 2004 vintage European fund but just $1 billion for its 2006 U.S. vintage fund.<ref name=vxpert />

===Saunders Karp & Megrue===
In 2005, Apax announced it would acquire middle market [[leveraged buyout]] firm [[Saunders Karp & Megrue]] to augment its buyout business in the United States. Saunders Karp, formerly based in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], was founded in 1989 by Thomas A. Saunders III and Allan W. Karp.  John Megrue, who today serves as co-chairman of [[Bridgewater Associates]], had worked as a principal at [[Patricof & Co.]] before joining Saunders Karp in 1992.<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/25/business/company-news-british-buyout-firm-buys-out-american-buyout-firm.html Company News; British Buyout Firm Buys out American Buyout Firm]." ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 25, 2005</ref>  Saunders Karp had received capital commitments from [[institutional investor]]s including [[AT&T Corporation]], [[General Electric|the General Electric Pension Trust]], [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman Sachs Private Equity Group]], [[HarbourVest Partners]], [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management]], [[New York State Common Retirement Fund]] and [[Verizon]], among others.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040624113648/http://www.skmequity.com/skmequity/site/firm.asp Saunders Karp & Megrue: Our Firm] (Cached version of company website as of April 2, 2005.)</ref>

==Criticisms==

=== British United Shoe machinery (2000) ===
The circumstances surrounding the demerger, transfer of assets and subsequent collapse of the [[British United Shoe Machinery#Failed Flotation, Apax Partners and pension collapse|British United Shoe Machinery]] in 2000 led to questions about Apax's behaviour being raised in Parliament by MPs of both main parties.  After calls for an enquiry into the loss of hundreds of pensions were refused, [[Ros Altmann]], the pensions expert and, as of 2015, UK Pensions minister described it  "one of the worst cases ..I have seen  ..the actions of the former owners - Apax have been immoral." The politician [[Ashok Kumar (British politician)|Ashok Kumar]] said,  "I think these people needed flogging"  ..these are greedy, selfish, capitalists who live on the backs of others.<ref name=nick>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/10/privateequity.statepensions|author=Nick Mathiason|title=Private equity stole our pensions|work=Observer Newspapers|date=10 June 2007|access-date=9 June 2014|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2006-01-17b.234.0&s=apax#g234.1|title=House of Commons Debate on Deferred pensions, 17 January 2006, c234WH|work=Theyworkforyou.com|access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>

=== Hellas Telecommunications (2015)===
Following its sale of Wind Hellas in 2007, Apax and Hellas co-owner TPG were sued by former bondholders of the telecom company, who allege that Apax and TPG unjustifiably enriched themselves from Hellas and misrepresented the true state of its accounts. Apax has countered that some of these bondholders only began their dispute after passing up on the chance of selling prior to the bankruptcy of 2009, and that Apax sold the business in 2007 (almost three years before the bankruptcy) and so was not the legal owner of Hellas during the periods cited in some of the lawsuits. (In 2005 a New York judge awarded $56m to some of these bondholders, made against Hellas Telecommunications Finance and Hellas Finance, rather than Apax or TPG). Other lawsuits related to Apax and TPG's ownership of Hellas are being heard in the USA. In December 2015 a separate legal action brought by the liquidators of Hellas Telecommunications was dismissed by a Luxembourg court.<ref>{{cite web|author1=William Louch|title=Luxembourg court rules in favour of Apax, TPG in Hellas case|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2015-12-24/hellas-ii-apax-tpg-luxembourg-ruling|website=efinancialnews.com/|access-date=14 January 2016|date=24 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Kleyr Grasso|title=Hellas case: Court rejects claim - 5 January 2016|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=92cb8101-d5e5-46f6-b500-2da96579fd8e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Globe Business Publishing Ltd|access-date=14 January 2016|date=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102201516|title=Greek drama: Telecom focus of bloody PE fight|first=Lawrence|last=Delevingne|date=20 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Another Greek tragedy|url = https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21654680-pressure-mounts-two-private-equity-giants-did-very-well-out-disastrous|newspaper = The Economist|access-date = 2015-12-23|issn = 0013-0613}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters|url = https://www.economist.com/news/letters/21659685-letters|website = The Economist|access-date = 2015-12-23}}</ref> In February 2018 the liquidators abandoned their UK case against Apax and TPG after four days of trial.<ref>[https://www.debtwire.com/intelligence/view/prime-2591557 "COURT: Hellas Telecommunications liquidators abandon lawsuit against Apax and TPG, costs hearing week of 5 March,"] Debtwire.com, February 23, 2018.</ref><!-- === PCM Uitgevers / De Persgroep (2010) === Apax Partners has been condemned for its unethical and predatory practices. After the company had profited from a [[leveraged buyout]] of Dutch publishers [[PCM Uitgevers|PCM]] (it acquired the company, saddled the company with huge debts, then sold it off for a profit), the business court of Amsterdam criticized Apax Partners for not keeping the works council informed.<ref>BESCHIKKING van 27 mei 2010 in de zaak met rekestnummer 200.024.956 OK, {{ECLI|ECLI:NL:GHAMS:2010:BM5928}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2015}} The case against PCM had been brought by journalists' union NVJ and general trade union FNV.
