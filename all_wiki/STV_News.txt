'''''STV News''''' is a Scottish news service produced by [[STV (TV channel)|STV]]. The news department produces three regional services covering STV's two Channel 3 franchise areas of [[Grampian Television|Northern]] and [[Scottish Television|Central]] Scotland.

STV's news programmes are produced from studios in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen with reporters also based at newsrooms in Dundee and Inverness and political correspondents based at Holyrood and Westminster. Freelance correspondents and camera crews are based on the Orkney and Shetland Isles, Wick and Fort William with a permanent Western Isles correspondent based in Stornoway.

In addition to its daily bulletins and online services, STV News also produces some non-news programming including current affairs (''[[Scotland Tonight]]''), one-off feature specials and documentaries.

==On air==
Three separate editions of ''STV News at Six'' air on STV Central and STV North each weeknight at 6{{nbsp}}pm.

The main evening programmes are supplemented by shorter ''STV News'' bulletins seven days a week:
*''Good Morning Scotland'' (not to be confused with the BBC Radio Scotland programme of the [[Good Morning Scotland|same name]]) updates for the North and Central regions during ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' at around 6:10{{nbsp}}am, 7:10{{nbsp}}am and 8:10{{nbsp}}am each weekday. Both bulletins are broadcast from Glasgow.
*Lunchtime bulletins for the North and Central regions at 1:55{{nbsp}}pm each weekday, following the ''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]''.
*Late news bulletins for the North and Central regions at 10:30{{nbsp}}pm each weeknight, following ''[[ITV News at Ten]]''.
*Weekend bulletins, broadcast across all regions from Glasgow - one on Saturday evenings, one on Sunday evenings.

In the Central region, ''STV News at Six'' is presented jointly from STV's Glasgow and Edinburgh studios. The programme includes opt-outs for separate news, sport and weather for the East and West of the region.

In the North, viewers in [[Tayside]] and north east [[Fife]] receive a separate 5-minute bulletin during the main ''STV News at Six'' each weeknight, presented and produced from STV's studios at Seabraes in [[Dundee]] and directed from a technical gallery in Aberdeen. While the Tayside bulletin is broadcast, viewers further north see more news from the north-east, [[Highlands and Islands]], broadcast from the main studio in Aberdeen.

All North, East and pan-Scottish bulletins are broadcast one hour after their original airing on [[STV (TV channel)#STV .2B1|STV +1]]. Bulletins are also available for catch-up, 30 days after broadcast on the [[STV Player]] website.

==Overview==
''STV News at Six'' launched on Monday 23 March 2009 as part of a major station revamp. The nightly news programmes were previously known as ''[[Scotland Today]]'' in the STV Central region and ''[[North Tonight]]'' in the [[STV North]] region, with both programmes carrying local opt-outs from January 2007 onwards.

===[[STV2]] national news===
On Monday 2 June 2014, a secondary news service, ''STV Glasgow News'', was launched as part of the local television channel [[STV Glasgow]]. This was followed by the launch of a news service for [[STV Edinburgh]] on Monday 12 January.

Both channels were merged with new local TV services for Aberdeen, Ayr and Dundee in April 2017 to form STV2, providing national news bulletins throughout the day with half-hour programmes at 1{{nbsp}}pm and 10{{nbsp}}pm on weekdays.

In September 2016, STV announced it would launch a news programme combining Scottish, UK and international news coverage. ''STV News Tonight'' was produced and broadcast from Glasgow using STV's resources from across Scotland and the UK and international resources of [[ITN]].<ref>{{cite news|title = STV to launch integrated Scottish and international news show|publisher=STV|work=STV News|date=21 September 2016|url=http://stv.tv/news/scotland/1367651-stv-to-launch-integrated-scottish-and-international-news-show/ |accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref> The half-hour programme, launched on Monday 24 April 2017, was presented by [[Halla Mohieddeen]] and aired each weeknight at 7{{nbsp}}pm on STV2.<ref>{{cite news|title = Anchor of flagship STV News Tonight show announced|publisher=STV|work=STV News|date=26 January 2017|url=https://stv.tv/news/scotland/1379125-anchor-of-flagship-stv-news-tonight-show-announced/ |accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>

===Cutbacks===
On 16 May 2018, STV announced 59 redundancies, including 34 from its news division. [[STV2]] ceased broadcasting at the end of June 2018,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/05/16/struggling-stv-2-be-taken-air-online-shift|title=Struggling STV 2 to be taken off air in online shift|last=Glenday|first=John|date=16 May 2018|work=The Drum|access-date=16 May 2018|language=en}}</ref> leading to the end of ''STV News Tonight'' and the station's national news service.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-44136400 On-air talent lead 'angry' STV staff to outdoor union meeting], BBC News, 16 May 2018</ref>

On STV itself, the Edinburgh-based edition of ''STV News at Six'' was axed and replaced with shorter opt-outs within a Central Scotland programme.<ref>[https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2018/news/union-slams-devastating-blow-as-almost-60-journalism-jobs-set-to-go/ Union to ballot over industrial action as almost 60 journalism jobs set to go], Hold the Front Page, 17 May 2018</ref> [[STV North]]'s regional news services were not affected, although nine jobs - three journalists and six technical posts - were lost at the company's Aberdeen studios.

[[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] members at STV voted in favour of strike action against the job cuts, although the union decided against immediate action after the company ruled out compulsory redundancies.<ref>[https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/nuj-eases-off-strike-threat-after-stv-pledges-to-avoid-compulsory-redundancies-as-it-looks-to-cut-staff/ NUJ eases off strike threat after STV pledges to avoid compulsory redundancies as it looks to cut staff], Press Gazette, 19 June 2018</ref>

The last edition of ''STV News Tonight'' aired on Friday 29 June 2018, followed by the end of the East edition of ''STV News at Six'' on Friday 7 September 2018.
