==History==

Queen's University Belfast has roots in the Belfast Academical Institution, which was founded in 1810 and which remains as the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]].<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/TheUniversity/AboutQueens/HistoryofQueens/|title=History of Queen's|publisher=Queen's University Belfast|accessdate=1 March 2008}}</ref> The present university was first chartered as "Queen's College, Belfast" in 1845, when it was associated with the simultaneously founded [[Queen's College, Cork]], and [[Queen's College, Galway]], as part of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]] – founded to encourage higher education for Catholics and [[Presbyterians]], as a counterpart to [[Trinity College, Dublin]], then an almost exclusively [[Anglican]] institution.<ref name=History/> Queen's College, Belfast, opened in 1849.<ref name=History/> Its main building, the Lanyon Building, was designed by the English-born architect, [[Charles Lanyon|Sir Charles Lanyon]].
At its opening, it had 23 professors and 195 students.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queen's, Belfast 1845–1949 : the history of a university|last=Moody|first=T.W.|last2=Beckett|first2=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber for the Queen's University of Belfast|year=1959|location=London|pages=661}}</ref> Some early students at Queen's University Belfast took [[University of London]] examinations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/our-collections/historic-collections/archives-manuscripts/university-of-london-student-records-1836-1931/ |title=Student lists |publisher=Senate House Library |accessdate=4 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914105055/http://www.shl.lon.ac.uk/specialcollections/archives/studentrecords.shtml |archive-date=14 September 2010 }}</ref>

The ''Irish Universities Act, 1908'' dissolved the [[Royal University of Ireland]], which had replaced the Queen's University of Ireland in 1879, and created two separate universities: the current [[National University of Ireland]] and Queen's University of Belfast.<ref name=History/>

===Parliamentary representation===
{{Main|Queen's University of Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)|Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)}}
The university was one of only eight United Kingdom universities to hold a parliamentary seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at Westminster until such representation was abolished in 1950. The university was also [[Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|represented]] in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] from 1920 to 1968, when graduates elected four members.

==Contemporary university life==

On 20 June 2006, the university announced a £259 million investment programme focusing on facilities, recruitment and research.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/TheUniversity/GeneralServices/News/ArchivesPressReleases-CampusNews/2006PressReleases/06-2006PressReleases/#d.en.31450|title=Queen's invests £259 million in 'world-class future'|publisher=Queen's University Belfast|date=20 June 2006|accessdate=16 September 2006}}</ref> One of the outcomes of this investment has been a new university library; the McClay library was designed by Boston-based architects Sheply, Bulfinch, Richardson & Abbott, working in association with Belfast architects, Robinson Patterson Partnership, and opened in July 2009. The building has been named in honour of Sir [[Allen McClay]], a major benefactor of Queen's University and of the Library.<ref>{{cite news|title=New library update – 27 July 2009|url=http://blogs.qub.ac.uk/library/2009/07/30/new-library-update-%e2%80%93-27-july-2009/|date=27 July 2009|work=Library News|publisher=Queen's University Belfast|accessdate=10 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815021616/http://blogs.qub.ac.uk/library/2009/07/30/new-library-update-%E2%80%93-27-july-2009/|archive-date=15 August 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Entrants to Queen's have, on average, 359 [[Advanced Level (UK)|A/AS-level]] [[UCAS Tariff|points]] and there are currently 5.3 applications per place, although this is misleading because virtually all applicants come from Northern Ireland and most apply for multiple courses.<ref name="STUG">Sunday Times University Guide, [http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/stug2006/uk48.pdf Queen's University Belfast], 10 September 2006.

Queen's was established with the aim of attracting both Protestant and Catholic students. While the university does not publish data on the religion affiliation of its students, [[Rupert Taylor]], who conducted his PhD research on the university during [[The Troubles]], argued in an article published in 1988 that "Whilst in the past, especially before the Second World War, Catholics were under-represented this is not currently the case". Taylor cites data showing that Catholic representation among undergraduates rose from 21.9 per cent in 1958/59 to 27.4 per cent in 1968/69 and 42.5 per cent in 1978/79.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Rupert|title=The Queen's University of Belfast: The liberal university in a divided society|journal=Higher Education Review|volume=20|issue=2|pages=27–45|year=1988}}</ref> By the late 1990s, 54 per cent of Queen's students were Catholics, compared to a 48 per cent share of the Northern Ireland population aged 18–25.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarkson|first=Leslie A|year=2004|title=A University in Troubled Times: Queen's, Belfast, 1945–2000|location=Dublin|publisher=Four Courts Press}}</ref> The growing share of Catholics in the student population is in part due to the tendency of middle-class Protestants to go to university in Great Britain rather than Northern Ireland.<ref name=Taylor/>

In 2009, Queen's signed a joint venture partnership with [[INTO University Partnerships]], creating [[INTO Queen's University Belfast]]. The INTO centre is based on campus and provides a foundation year for international students who want to study at the university.<ref>[http://www.intohigher.com/uk/en-gb/our-centres/into-queens-university-belfast.aspx intohigher.com] accessed 5 September 2011</ref>

==Student life==

===Students' Union===
{{Main|Queen's University Belfast Students' Union}}
[[File:Student's Union Queen's.jpg|thumb|The old Students' Union Building]]
The [[QUBSU|Students' Union]] at Queen's (QUBSU) is located opposite the Lanyon Building on University Road, and is provided for under the university's statutes. All students at the university are automatic members of the union, making it one of the largest unions on a single campus in Ireland and the UK. It is administered by the Students' Representative Council (SRC) (elected every October, on a faculty basis) and an executive (elected in March), who manage the operations of the union in conjunction with several full-time staff.

The current union building is to close at the end of August 2018, marking the beginning of a three-year process of rebuilding the union building. Interim facilities are being provided in other university buildings and, for the union bars, a newly acquired space on the Lisburn Road (opposite the Medical Biology Centre).

====Union services====
A range of services are provided by the students' union, including an advice centre with full-time staff to help with issues such as money problems, accommodation and welfare. Commercial services are also provided for by the union and include a shop, canteen and coffee franchise. There are also four bars within the building, the biggest of which, the [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]] Hall, hosts numerous concerts each year as well as the majority the students' union's club nights.
[[File:Riddel Hall, Stranmillis, Belfast - geograph.org.uk - 1593557.jpg|alt=|thumb|Riddel Hall]]

====Clubs and societies====
More than fifty sporting clubs and over one hundred non-sporting societies are recognised by the Students' Union Council and therefore eligible to apply for an annual grant from the university.<ref>[http://quis.qub.ac.uk Clubs and Societies], Queen's University website. Retrieved 15 July 2007.</ref> The oldest society in Queen's University is the [[Literary and Scientific Society (Queen's University Belfast)|Literary and Scientific Society]] which focuses on debating political, cultural and social issues within Northern Ireland. Established in 1850 by [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]], the society has been very successful and produced some of the finest orators within Northern Ireland. The Dragonslayers Gaming Society hosts one of Ireland's largest games conventions, [[Q-Con]], in June of each year, and cultural groups such as [[An Cumann Gaelach, QUB|An Cumann Gaelach]] and the [[Ulster-Scots]] Society are also present. There are a number of international societies at Queen's, including the International Students Society and the Malaysian Students Society.

The Queen's University Mountaineering Club is notable for producing three [[Everest]] summiteers including Ireland's first, [[Dawson Stelfox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open.ac.uk/graduation2006/pop63047.shtml |title=Mr Dawson Stelfox |publisher=Open University |accessdate=15 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070626035008/http://www.open.ac.uk/graduation2006/pop63047.shtml |archive-date=26 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Roger McMorrow]] and Nigel Hart also summited in May 2007, and were subsequently jointly announced Queen's University Graduates of the year for 2006/07<ref>{{cite news|url=https://daro.qub.ac.uk/pastwinners|title=Past Graduate & Student of the Year winners|publisher=Queen's University Belfast|accessdate=15 June 2008}}</ref> for their role in rescuing a young Nepalese climber left for dead near the summit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6700603.stm|title=BBC: NI doctors in Everest rescue drama|publisher=BBC News |date=29 May 2007|accessdate=15 June 2008}}</ref>

QUB is one of only 20 Universities in the United Kingdom to have the privilege of an [[AIESEC]] Local Chapter, developing leadership, business and soft skills in highly motivated students, as well as providing international opportunities through their work abroad program.

===Housing===
Queen's provides housing for both undergraduates and postgraduates, although because of the compact size of Northern Ireland many students chose to live at home and commute. In 2005/06, 36% of Queen's students lived in private accommodation within Belfast, 29% lived with parents or guardians, 20% in private accommodation outside of Belfast, and 10% lived in university maintained accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Planning Service|url=http://www.planningni.gov.uk/AreaPlans_Policy/Plans/BMA/HMO/Supplementary_docs/HMA.pdf|title=Supplementary Document 1: Housing Market Analysis, Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs): Subject Plan for Belfast City Council Area 2015|page=14|accessdate=26 August 2007}}</ref>
