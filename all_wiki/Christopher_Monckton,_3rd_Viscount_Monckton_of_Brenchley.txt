'''Christopher Walter Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley''' (born 14 February 1952) is a British public speaker and [[hereditary peer]]. He is known for his work as a journalist, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] political advisor, [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] political candidate, and for his invention of the mathematical puzzle ''[[Eternity puzzle|Eternity]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Eternity puzzle solved|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/953316.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2 October 2000|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref>

Early on in his public speaking career topics centred on his mathematical puzzle and conservative politics. In recent years his public speaking has garnered attention due to his [[denial of climate change]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Climate deniers to send film to British schools|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/climate-deniers-to-send-film-to-british-schools-396895.html|work=The Independent|date=2 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Climate chaos?

==Personal life==
Monckton is the eldest son of Major-General [[Gilbert Monckton, 2nd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley]] (1915–2006), and Marianna Letitia (''née'' Bower), former [[High Sheriff of Kent]], [[Dame of Malta]] (born 1929). He has three brothers, Timothy, Jonathan and Anthony, and a sister, [[Rosa Monckton|Rosa]], wife of the journalist [[Dominic Lawson]].

Monckton was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], where he received a B.A. (Classics, 1974, now M.A.), and at [[Cardiff University|University College, Cardiff]], where he obtained a diploma in journalism studies. In 1990, he married Juliet Mary Anne Malherbe Jensen.

Monckton is a liveryman of the [[Worshipful Company of Broderers]], an [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Officer of the Order of St John of Jerusalem]], a [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knight of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], and a member of the Roman Catholic Mass Media Commission. He is also a qualified Day Skipper with the [[Royal Yachting Association]], and has been a trustee of the Hales Trophy for the [[Blue Riband]] of the Atlantic since 1986.<ref name="whoswho">''Who's Who 2007'', p. 1599</ref>

On the death of his father in 2006 Monckton inherited the title [[Viscount Monckton of Brenchley]], but owing to the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] he did not gain a seat in the [[House of Lords]].

On 18 October 2008 Monckton posted online "More in Sorrow than in Anger, Open letter from The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley to Senator John McCain about Climate Science and Policy" after U.S. presidential candidate [[John McCain]] made a campaign speech at a wind farm in which he stated his belief in [[anthropogenic climate change]]. Monckton stated in interviews and on the web site of the Science and Public Policy institute that he was a [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize laureate]]; he later stated that this had been a joke.<ref>{{cite web |title=More in Sorrow than in Anger, Open letter from The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley to Senator John McCain about Climate Science and Policy |url=http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/reprint/Letter_to_McCain.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2016 |first=Christopher |last=Monckton |publisher=[[Science and Public Policy Institute]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Michael E. |last=Mann |title=The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HK0CN6FVtfgC |date=March 2012 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-15254-9}}</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-diary/nobleman-is-no-nobel-man-20100125-muky.html [[Sydney Morning Herald]] ] 16 January 2010 "Christopher Walter, the third Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, has conceded that his claim to have won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 was a joke."</ref>

==Career==

===Journalism===
Monckton joined the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' in 1974 at the age of 22, where he worked as a reporter and leader-writer. From 1977 to 1978, he worked at [[Conservative Central Office]] as a press officer, becoming the editor of the Roman Catholic newspaper ''[[The Universe (Catholic newspaper)|The Universe]]'' in 1979, then managing editor of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' magazine in 1981. He joined the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' newspaper as a leader-writer in 1982.<ref name="whoswho"/> After a hiatus in his career as a journalist Monckton became assistant editor of the newly established, and now defunct, tabloid newspaper ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' in 1986. He was a consulting editor for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' from 1987 to 1992 and was its chief leader-writer from 1990 to 1992.<ref name="whoswho"/>

Since 2002 Monckton has had several newspaper articles published critical of the [[IPCC]] and current scientific consensus on [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/8210739/The-climate-bugaboo-is-the-strangest-intellectual-aberration-of-our-age.html|title=The climate bugaboo is the strangest intellectual aberration of our age|author=Christopher Monckton|work=The Telegraph|date=17 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533290/Climate-chaos-Dont-believe-it.html|title=Climate chaos?

===Entrepreneurship===
In 1995, Monckton and his wife opened Monckton's, a shirt shop in [[King's Road]], Chelsea.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Undie-Serving Rich|work=Evening Standard|date=10 November 1995}}</ref>

In 1999, Monckton created and published the [[Eternity puzzle]], a geometric puzzle that involved tiling a [[dodecagon]] with 209 irregularly shaped [[polygon]]s called "[[polydrafter]]s". A£1 million prize was won after 18 months by two Cambridge mathematicians.<ref name="bbcwin">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/992393.stm|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News Online|title=£1m Eternity jackpot scooped|date=26 October 2000}}</ref> By that time, 500,000 puzzles had been sold. Monckton launched the [[Eternity II puzzle]] in 2007, but, after the four-year prize period, no winner came forward to claim the $2 million prize.

Monckton is a director of Resurrexi Pharmaceutical. It asserts it is  "responsible for invention and development of a broad-spectrum cure for infectious diseases." In the BBC documentary, "Meet the Sceptics" (2011), he claimed to have cured himself of [[Graves' disease]].<ref>Rupert Murray [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00y5j3v "Meet the Climate Sceptics"], ''[[Storyville (TV series)|Storyville]]'', 3 February 2011.</ref> UKIP's CV for Monckton claims that his methods have produced cures for [[multiple sclerosis]], [[influenza]], and [[herpes]], as well as reducing the viral load of an [[HIV]] patient.<ref name=UKIPbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/1675-christopher-a-man-of-many-talents |title=Christopher: A man of many talents |publisher=UKIP.co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608023401/http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/1675-christopher-a-man-of-many-talents |archivedate=8 June 2010 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref> In an interview with Australia's [[Radio National]], Monckton said that his methods had had some initial successes but "we cannot claim that we can cure anything".<ref>{{Citation|last=Carlisle|first=Wendy|publication-date=17 July 2011|title=The Lord Monckton Roadshow|series=Background Briefing|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|publication-place=Australia|at=46min 48sec|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/the-lord-monckton-roadshow/2923400|accessdate=2 September 2012<!--|format=Radio broadcast-->|format=Transcription and podcast}}</ref>

In 1979, Monckton met [[Alfred Sherman]], who co-founded the pro-Conservative [[think tank]] the [[Centre for Policy Studies]] (CPS) with [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Keith Joseph]] in 1974.

Monckton has said that he served as science adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during his years with the Number 10 Policy Unit, and that "it was I who—on the prime minister's behalf—kept a weather eye on the official science advisers to the government, from the chief scientific adviser downward."<ref name="Ward">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/22/thatcher-climate-sceptic-monckton|title=Thatcher becomes latest recruit in Monckton's climate sceptic campaign|last=Ward|first=Bob|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> [[John Gummer]], who was Environment Minister under Thatcher said Monckton was "a bag carrier in Mrs Thatcher's office.

==Dispute over his non-membership of the House of Lords==
Monckton asserts that the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], that deprived him of a hereditary seat, is flawed and unconstitutional. In 2006 he referred to himself as "a member of the Upper House of the United Kingdom legislature" in a letter to US Senators,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ff.org/centers/csspp/pdf/20061212_monckton.pdf|title=Uphold Free Speech about Climate Change or Resign|publisher=Frontiers of Freedom|date=11 December 2006|accessdate=17 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904190755/http://www.ff.org/centers/csspp/pdf/20061212_monckton.pdf|archive-date=4 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and has said he was "a member of the Upper House but without the right to sit or vote."<ref>{{cite web|title=Questions from the Select Committee Concerning My Recent Testimony|last=Monckton|first=Christopher|date=14 July 2010|url=http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckton/answers_to_committee.html|publisher=Science & Public Policy Institute|access-date=13 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406055927/http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckton/answers_to_committee.html|archive-date=6 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The House of Lords authorities have said Monckton is not and never has been a member and that there is no such thing as a non-voting or honorary member of the House.<ref name=guardian11aug2010/><ref name="Hickman">{{cite news|last=Hickman|first=Leo|title=Lord Monckton throws his safari helmet in the ring as Ukip candidate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/apr/20/monckton-mp-general-election|date=20 April 2010|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

In July 2011 the House of Lords took the unprecedented step of publishing online a [[cease and desist]] letter to Monckton from the [[Clerk of the Parliaments]], which concluded, "I am publishing this letter on the parliamentary website so that anybody who wishes to check whether you are a Member of the House of Lords can view this official confirmation that you are not."<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="houseoflords"/>

===Social and economic policy===
{{wikiquote|Christopher Monckton}}
One of Margaret Thatcher's policy advisors, Monckton was credited with being "the brains behind the Thatcherite policy of giving council tenants ([[public housing]]) the [[Right to buy scheme|right to buy their homes]]."<ref name="times031004">Leppard, David. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article489715.ece "Top Tory in a kilt hit by visa 'racket' case"], ''The Times'', 3 October 2004</ref> Monckton was a sponsor of the Conservative Family Campaign in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Persuaded to act otherwise|work=The Independent|date=3 April 1992}}</ref> Monckton has been associated with the [[Referendum Party]], advising its founder, Sir [[James Goldsmith]]. In 2003 he helped a Scottish Tory breakaway group, the [[The New Party (UK, 2003)|Scottish Peoples Alliance]].<ref name="times031004"/>

In 1988, ''Eddy Shah: Today and the Newspaper Revolution'' described Monckton as "a fervent, forthright and opinionated Roman Catholic Tory"<ref>MacArthur, Brian. ''Eddy Shah: Today and the Newspaper Revolution'', p. 154. David & Charles Publishers, 1988; {{ISBN|0-7153-9145-3}}</ref> who has been closely associated with the "[[New Right#United Kingdom|New Right]]" faction of the Conservative Party.<ref name="berridge">Virginia Berridge.

===Statements on AIDS and homosexuality===

====''American Spectator'' article on AIDS (1987)====
In a 1987 article for ''[[The American Spectator]]'', "AIDS: A British View", Monckton argued "there is only one way to stop [[AIDS]]. That is to screen the entire population regularly and to quarantine all carriers of the disease for life. Every member of the population should be blood-tested every month ... all those found to be infected with the virus, even if only as carriers, should be isolated compulsorily, immediately, and permanently." This would involve isolating between 1.5 and 3 million people in the United States ("not altogether impossible") and another 30,000 people in the UK ("not insuperably difficult"). The article concluded that current Western sensibilities would not allow this standard protocol for containing a new, fatal and incurable infection to be applied: therefore, he said, many would needlessly die. [[Andrew Ferguson (journalist)|Andrew Ferguson]], then assistant managing editor of ''The American Spectator'', denounced it in the letters column of the same issue.<ref name=moncktonaids>{{cite book|last=Bawer|first=Bruce|title=A place at the table: the gay individual in American society|page=[https://archive.org/details/placeattablegayi00bawe/page/75 75]|publisher=Poseidon Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-671-79533-7|url=https://archive.org/details/placeattablegayi00bawe/page/75}}</ref> Monckton appeared on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme in February 1987 to discuss his views and present the results of an opinion poll that found public support for his position.<ref name="berridge"/> Monckton has since stated "the article was written at the very outset of the AIDS epidemic, and with 33 million people around the world now infected, the possibility of [quarantine] is laughable. It couldn't work." He also said that this standard protocol could have worked at the time; that senior HIV investigators had called for it; and that many of the lives that have been lost could have been saved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-14/business/9908140168_1_ertl-peter-tatchell-outrage|title=Ertl in Puzzle As Gay Group Protests|publisher=Chicago Tribune|author=Ray Moseley|date=14 August 1999}}</ref>

====Article on homosexuality (2014)====
Monckton returned to the subject of homosexuality in a November 2014 article for the WorldNetDaily website describing the campaign of Councillor Rosalie Crestani in the [[City of Casey]], near Melbourne, Australia. In the article, he claims that "official survey after official survey had shown that homosexuals had an average of 500-1,000 partners in their sexually active lifetime, and that some had as many as 20,000."<ref name="Meredith">Charlotte Meredith [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/11/27/ukip-lord-christopher-monckton-aids-gays_n_6231330.html "Ukip's Former Deputy Leader, Lord Monckton, Has Some Jaw-Dropping Opinions On The Gay Community"], ''The Huffington Post'', 27 November 2014</ref> He rejected the use of the LGBT acronym for the order of the alphabet on QWERTY keyboards. "That ought to cover every real or imaginary form of sexual deviancy they may dream up," he wrote.<ref name="Meredith"/>

"Now, I’m not sure where Viscount Monckton is getting his statistics," wrote Ukip leader [[Nigel Farage]] in ''[[The Independent]]'', "but to frame these comments as he has is both deeply offensive and fundamentally wrong."<ref>Nigel Farage [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-saw-the-immigration-lies-a-mile-off--and-now-nobody-can-deny-it-9888641.html "I saw the immigration lies a mile off - and now nobody can deny it"], ''The Independent'' (London), 27 November 2014</ref>

===European integration===
Monckton has been a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]], an opponent of [[European integration]]. In 1994, he sued the Conservative government of [[John Major]] for agreeing to contribute to the costs of the Protocol on Social Policy agreed in the 1993 [[Maastricht Treaty]], although the UK had an opt-out from the protocol. The case was heard in the Scottish [[Court of Session]] in May 1994. His petition for [[judicial review]] was dismissed by the court for want of relevancy.<ref>"Lawful for UK to contribute to European social policy costs – Scots Law report", ''The Times'', 12 May 1994</ref> In a 2007 interview he said he would "leave the [[European Union]], close down 90 per cent of government services and shift power away from the atheistic, humanistic government and into the hands of families and individuals."<ref name=euro/>
