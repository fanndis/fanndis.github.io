'''Rappler''' is a [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[online news]] website based in [[Pasig]], [[Metro Manila|Manila]]. It started as a Facebook page named MovePH in August 2011<ref>{{cite web|title=MovePH|url=http://facebook.com/rapplerdotcom/|website=Facebook|access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref> and later evolved into a complete website on January 1, 2012.<ref name="aboutrappler">{{cite web|last=Ressa|first=Maria|title=About Rappler|url=http://www.rappler.com/index.php?view=article&id=385|website=Rappler|access-date=20 August 2013}}</ref> Along with web-based text news content, it was among the first news websites in the Philippines to extensively use online multimedia including video, pictures, text and audio.

According to its own website, the name Rappler is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "rap" (to discuss) and "ripple" ([[ripple effect|to make waves]]).<ref name=aboutrappler/>

In 2018, arms of the Philippine government initiated legal proceedings against Rappler.<ref>{{cite news|title=Facebook attacked by critics over 'fake news' – but outside the US this time|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/facebook-and-fake-news-controversy-in-philippines-around-rappler.html|access-date=6 December 2018|publisher=CNBC|date=17 January 2018}}</ref> Rappler and its staff said it was being targeted for its revelations of misappropriations by government and elected officials.

Other key people involved in its conceptualization and creation were former ''[[Newsbreak (magazine)|Newsbreak]]'' head and [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] managing editor Glenda Gloria, journalist and [[Ateneo De Manila University]] professor Chay Hofileña, former ''[[TV Patrol]]'' executive producer Lilibeth Frondoso, Philippine internet pioneer [[Nix Nolledo]], internet entrepreneur Manuel I.

Rappler first went public as a [[beta version]] website on January 1, 2012, the same day that the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' published a Rappler piece that broke the story of (then) Philippine Chief Justice [[Renato Corona]] being awarded a [[University of Santo Tomas]] doctoral degree without a required dissertation.<ref>{{cite web|title=UST breaks rules to favor Corona|url=http://www.inquirer.net/?page-one=january-01-2012|date=January 1, 2012|website=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref> The site officially launched at its #MoveManila event at the [[Far Eastern University]] in Manila on January 12, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rappler introduced at #MoveManila Chat Series|author=Natashya Gutierrez|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/831-rappler-introduced-at-movemanila-chat-series|date=January 12, 2012|publisher=Rappler|access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref>

==Coverage of fake news campaigns in the Philippines==
In 2016, Rappler began to be critical of the [[Rodrigo Duterte presidential campaign, 2016|Duterte]]-led government of the Philippines, which had just taken office in 2016 and his controversial [[Philippine Drug War|war on drugs]] after it noticed a trend of [[fake news]] related to him in media outlets of the state and private entities, and being spread on [[Facebook]].<ref name="pbs">{{cite news|title=The Facebook Dilemma – Part 2|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/facebook-dilemma/|access-date=6 December 2018|publisher=PBS Frontline|date=30 October 2018}}</ref> On 11 January 2018, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] revoked Rappler's license to operate as a "mass media" entity, for allegedly violating the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution's]] Foreign Equity Restrictions in Mass Media by being wholly foreign-owned.<ref name=SECruling>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018Decision_RapplerIncandRapplerHoldingsCorp.pdf|title=In Re: Rappler, Inc. & Rappler Holdings Corporation SP Case No. 08-17-001|publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]]|date=January 11, 2018|access-date=July 27, 2018}}</ref> Rappler then sought a petition for review from the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]] on 28 January, but was rejected on 26 July 2018, finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the SEC. Many journalistic organizations and committees saw the act as intimidation and attempt to silence the opposition, and control freedom of the press.<ref name=CAaffirms>{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/rappler-not-filipino-owned-and-violated-law-court-rules/423806/|title=Rappler not Filipino-owned and violated law, court rules|newspaper=[[The Manila Times]]|date=July 27, 2018|access-date=July 27, 2018}}</ref>

On 26 October 2017, Rappler became a member of the [[Poynter Institute]]'s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). This led to Facebook tapping Rappler and [[Vera Files]] in April 2018 to be its Philippine partners in its worldwide fact-checking program, in part because of their participation in the IFCN.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-sheet-facebooks-third-party-fact-checking-pr|title=Vera Files Fact Sheet: Facebook's third-party fact-checking program in PH explained|date=April 18, 2018|work=Vera Files|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/fact-checking-philippines/|title=Facebook Launches Third-Party Fact-Checking Program in the Philippines|date=April 12, 2018|work=Facebook Newsroom|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Under the program, false news stories will appear lower on users' news feeds and lower the chances of people seeing those stories.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> The program, according to a Facebook executive, "is one of the ways we hope to better identify and reduce the reach of false news that people share on our platform."<ref name=":3" /> A spokesperson for the Philippine government backed the fact-checking program but protested Facebook's partnership with Rappler.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/04/19/Facebook-Rappler-Vera-Files-fake-news-fact-check.html|title=Roque to meet with Facebook on its 'unacceptable' fact-checking partners|date=April 19, 2018|work=CNN|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/982887/yes-to-fb-fact-checkers-no-to-rappler-palace|title=Yes to FB fact-checkers, no to Rappler – Palace|last=Salaverria|first=Leila B.|date=April 17, 2018|work=Inquirer|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref>
