A '''''chuppah''''' ({{lang-he|חוּפָּה}}, pl. חוּפּוֹת, ''chuppot'', literally, "canopy" or "covering"), also '''huppah''', '''chipe''', '''chupah''', or '''chuppa''', is a canopy under which a [[Judaism|Jewish]] couple stand during their [[Jewish wedding|wedding ceremony]]. It consists of a cloth or sheet, sometimes a [[tallit]], stretched or supported over four poles, or sometimes manually held up by attendants to the ceremony. A ''chuppah'' symbolizes the home that the couple will build together.

In a more general sense, ''chuppah'' refers to the method by which ''nesuin'', the second stage of a Jewish marriage, is accomplished. According to some opinions, it is accomplished by the couple standing under the canopy along with the [[rabbi]] who weds them; however, there are other views.<ref name="Kaplan18">{{cite book| last=Kaplan| first=Rabbi Aryeh| title=Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide| year=1983| publisher=Moznaim Publishers| location=New York / Jerusalem}}, Chapter 18</ref><ref>Aside from Chuppah, it can also be accomplished by consummation; however, this is discouraged (Kaplan, Ibid.).</ref>

A traditional ''chuppah'', especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]], recommends that there be open sky exactly above the ''chuppah'',<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/481263/jewish/The-Chupah-Marriage-Canopy.htm The Chupah -- Marriage Canopy] on Chabad.org</ref> although this is not mandatory among Sephardic communities. If the wedding ceremony is held indoors in a hall, sometimes a special opening is built to be opened during the ceremony. Many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] prefer to conduct the entire ceremony outdoors. It is said that the couple's ancestors are present at the chuppah ceremony.<ref>{{cite book| title=Zohar (III)| last=Bar-Yochai| first=Rabbi Shimon| publisher=| isbn=| location=Israel| pages=Page 219B}}</ref>

In Yemen, the Jewish practice was not for the groom and his bride to stand under a canopy (''chuppah'') hung on four poles, as is widely practised today in Jewish weddings, but rather to be secluded in a bridal chamber that was, in effect, a highly decorated room in the house of the groom, known as the ''chuppah'' (see [[Jewish wedding#Yichud]]).

==History and legal aspects==
The word ''chuppah'' appears in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (e.g., [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 2:16; [[Psalms]] 19:5). Abraham P. Bloch states that the connection between the term ''chuppah'' and the wedding ceremony 'can be traced to the Bible'; however, 'the physical appearance of the chuppah and its religious significance have undergone many changes since then'.<ref name="Bloch32"/>

There were for centuries regional differences in what constituted a 'huppah'. Indeed, [[Solomon Freehof]] finds that the wedding canopy was unknown before the 16th century.<ref>Freehof, S. B. 'Chuppah' in D. J. Silver, ''In the Time of Harvest'' NY: Macmillan, 1963, p. 193</ref> [[Alfred J. Kolatch]] notes that it was during the [[Middle Ages]] that the '''chupa'' ... in use today' became customary.<ref>Kolatch, Alfred J. "The Jewish Book of Why" Middle Village: Jonathan David Publishers, Inc., 2000), p. 35</ref> [[Daniel Sperber]] notes that for many communities prior to the 16th century, the huppah consisted of a veil worn by the bride.<ref name="DS">The Jewish Lifecycle, pp.&nbsp;194–264</ref> In others, it was a cloth spread over the shoulders of the bride and groom.<ref name="DS"/> Numerous illustrations of Jewish weddings in medieval Europe, North Africa and Italy show no evidence of a huppah as it is known today. [[Moses Isserles]] (1520–1572) notes that the portable marriage canopy was widely adopted by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] (as a symbol of the chamber within which marriages originally took place) in the generation before he composed his commentary to the [[Shulchan Aruch]].<ref name="DS"/>

In Biblical times, a couple consummated their marriage in a room or tent.<ref>Eisenberg, Ronald L. "Jewish Traditions: A JPS Guide". (JPS, Philadelphia: 2004, p. 35; cf. Genesis 24:67</ref> In [[Talmud]]ic times, the room where the marriage was consummated was called the ''chuppah''.<ref name="Bloch32">Bloch, Abraham P. "The Biblical and historical background of Jewish customs and ceremonies". KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 1980, pp. 31-32</ref> There is however a reference of a wedding canopy in the Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 57a: "It was the custom when a boy was born to plant a cedar tree and when a girl was born to plant a pine tree, and when they married, the tree was cut down and a canopy made of the branches".

Jewish weddings consist of two separate parts: the [[erusin|betrothal]] ceremony, known as ''erusin'' or ''kiddushin'', and the actual wedding ceremony, known as ''nisuin''. The first ceremony (the betrothal, which is today accomplished when the groom gives a wedding ring to the bride) prohibits the bride to all other men and cannot be dissolved without a religious divorce (''[[Get (conflict)|get]]''). The second ceremony permits the bride to her husband. Originally, the two ceremonies usually took place separately.<ref name="Kaplan18"/> After the initial betrothal, the bride lived with her parents until the day the actual marriage ceremony arrived; the wedding ceremony would then take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. After the ceremony the bride and groom would spend an hour together in an ordinary room, and then the bride would enter the ''chuppah'' and, after gaining her permission, the groom would join her.<ref name="Bloch32"/>

In the [[Middle Ages]] these two stages were increasingly combined into a single ceremony (which, from the 16th century, became the 'all but universal Jewish custom' and the ''chuppah'' lost its original meaning, with various other customs replacing it.<ref name=Rayner/> Indeed, in post-talmudic times the use of the ''chuppa'' chamber ceased;<ref name="Bloch32"/> the custom that became most common instead was to 'perform the whole combined ceremony under a canopy, to which the term ''chuppah'' was then applied, and to regard the bride's entry under the canopy as a symbol of the consummation of the marriage'.<ref name=Rayner>{{cite book| first=Rabbi John| last=Rayner| author-link=John Rayner| title=Guide to Jewish Marriage| location=London| year=1975| pages= 19–20}}</ref> The canopy 'created the semblance of a room'.<ref name="Bloch32"/>

There are legal varying opinions as to how the chuppah ceremony is to be performed today. Major opinions include standing under the canopy, and secluding the couple together in a room (''[[Jewish_wedding#Yichud|yichud]]'').<ref name="Kaplan18"/> The betrothal and chuppah ceremonies are separated by the reading of the ''[[ketubah]]''.<ref name="Kaplan21">{{cite book| last=Kaplan| first=Rabbi Aryeh| title=Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide| year=1983| publisher=Moznaim Publishers| location=New York / Jerusalem| isbn=978-0940118126| chapter=21}}</ref>

This ''chuppah'' ceremony is connected to the seven blessings which are recited over a cup of wine at the conclusion of the ceremony (''birchat nisuin'' or ''[[sheva brachot]]'').

==Symbolism==
The chuppah represents a Jewish home symbolized by the cloth canopy and the four poles. Just as a chuppah is open on all four sides, so was the tent of [[Abraham]] open for hospitality. Thus, the ''chuppah'' represents hospitality to one's guests. This "home" initially lacks furniture as a reminder that the basis of a Jewish home is the people within it, not the possessions. In a spiritual sense, the covering of the ''chuppah'' represents the presence of God over the covenant of marriage. As the [[kippah]] served as a reminder of the Creator above all, (also a symbol of separation from God), so the ''chuppah'' was erected to signify that the ceremony and institution of marriage has divine origins.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In Ashkenazic communities, before going under the ''chuppah'' the groom covers the bride's face with a [[veil]], known as the [[badeken]] (in [[Yiddish]]) or hinuma (in [[Hebrew]]). The origin of this tradition and its original purpose are in dispute. There are opinions that the ''chuppah'' means "covering the bride's face", hence covering the couple to be married. Others suggest that the purpose was for others to witness the act of covering, formalizing the family's home in a community, as it is a public part of the wedding. In Sephardic communities, this custom is not practiced. Instead, underneath the chuppah, the couple is wrapped together underneath a tallit.{{Clarify|date=October 2014|reason=They are wrapped in what?}}

The groom enters the ''chuppah'' first to represent his ownership of the home on behalf of the couple. When the bride then enters the ''chuppah'' it is as though the groom is providing her with shelter or clothing, and he thus publicly demonstrates his new responsibilities toward her.<ref>Levush, 54:1; Aruch HaShulchan, 55:18.</ref>

==Modern trends==
A ''chuppah'' can be made of any material. A tallit or embroidered velvet cloth are commonly used. Silk or quilted ''chuppot'' are increasingly common, and can often be customized or personalized to suit the couple's unique interests and occupations.<ref>{{cite news| title=My Very Own Chuppah| url=https://jewishjournal.com/culture/special_sections/celebrations_simchas/5500/| last=Davis| first=Carin| date=February 7, 2002| newspaper=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]| accessdate=June 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Home Page| website=Jeanette Kuvin Oren| url=http://www.kuvinoren.com/#!huppah/cfau| accessdate=June 29, 2020}}</ref>
