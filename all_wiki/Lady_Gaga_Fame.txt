'''Lady Gaga Fame''' is the first fragrance created by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. A  women's fragrance, it was released in [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] and in [[Macy's]] stores in the United States and a range of different stores in the United Kingdom on August 22, 2012, and worldwide in September through the singer's [[Haus Laboratories]] label in association with [[Coty, Inc.]] According to promotional materials, the perfume uses "push-pull technology", rather than the pyramidal structure traditional of perfumes, to combine [[Note (perfumery)|notes]] of ''[[atropa belladonna]]'', [[tiger orchid]], [[incense]], [[apricot]], [[saffron]] and [[honey]]. As of 2013, the perfume has sold more than 30 million bottles and has earned more than 1.5 billion dollars worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7440253/lady-gaga-sells-30-million-bottles-of-fame-perfume|title=Lady Gaga Sold 30 Million Bottles Of Fame Perfume, She Says|publisher=Idolator|date=February 10, 2013|accessdate=December 29, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140320083946/http://www.idolator.com/7440253/lady-gaga-sells-30-million-bottles-of-fame-perfume|archivedate=March 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spetteguless.it/2013/02/lady-gaga-boom-con-fame-nella-top10-dei-profumieri/|title=Lady Gaga boom con FAME: è entrata nella Top10 dei profumieri? - Spetteguless|website=Spetteguless.it|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=December 29, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716134621/http://thewhaleandtherose.com/2013/2013-canadian-fragrance-awards-and-the-winners-are/|archivedate=July 16, 2015}}</ref>

In July 2010, British magazine ''Marketing'' reported that singer [[Lady Gaga]] had begun working on an "unusual" fragrance with [[Coty, Inc.]], set for release around [[Christmas]] of that year and to be accompanied by a large advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2010/07/lady_gaga_rumored_to_be_workin.html|title=Lady Gaga Rumored to Be Working on a Fragrance|last=Odell|first=Amy|date=July 13, 2010|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=July 9, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716212255/http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2010/07/lady_gaga_rumored_to_be_workin.html|archivedate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> "I know nothing of this project," Coty Beauty vice president Steve Mormoris said at the time.

==Scent and packaging==
Reports circulated in early 2011 that Gaga wanted the perfume to smell of blood and semen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/lady_gagas_perfume_inspired_by_blood/222896|title=Lady Gaga's Perfume Inspired by Blood and Semen?|last=Stewart|first=Ella|date=January 27, 2011|publisher=[[E!]]|accessdate=July 9, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616105234/http://www.eonline.com/news/lady_gagas_perfume_inspired_by_blood/222896|archivedate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> The packaging lists the perfume's [[Note (perfumery)|notes]] as "tears of [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], crushed heart of [[Tiger Orchid|tiger orchidea]] with a black veil of [[incense]], pulverized [[apricot]] and the combinative essences of [[saffron]] and [[honey]] drops".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1687383/lady-gaga-fame-perfume.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's Fame Perfume Smells Like 'Tears Of Belladonna'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=July 9, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616212338/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1687383/lady-gaga-fame-perfume.jhtml|archivedate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> According to the product packaging, instead of the pyramidal structure used in most perfumes, Lady Gaga Fame uses "push-pull technology", where the ingredients demonstrate aspects of each note without precedence.<ref name="pressrelease"/> Rather than utilizing top, middle, and base notes, the perfume is based on three accords – "dark" (containing the Belladonna notes), "sensual" (containing the honey, saffron, and apricot notes), and "light" (containing the Tiger Orchid notes) which come together to produce a floral, fruity scent.<ref name="pressrelease"/>

The perfume references the allure of fame and fortune with its sweet scent and gold crown, a theme Gaga has often explored in her career; the inclusion of the poisonous [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], along with the black liquid, represent the dark or destructive effect fame can have on an individual. Gaga states on the back of the packaging that the perfume is "black, like the soul of fame".

Uniquely, Fame is a black perfume that sprays clear and becomes invisible once airborne; according to the [[Coty, Inc.|Coty]] press release, it is the first perfume to utilize such technology.<ref name="pressrelease"/> The bottle, designed by Gaga and photographer [[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]],<ref name="pressrelease"/> was described by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine as "simple and unfussy" and "crowned with an edgy and alien-like gold cap".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-hook/483207/lady-gaga-reveals-new-perfume-bottle|title=Lady Gaga Reveals New Perfume Bottle|last=DelliCarpini Jr.|first=Gregory|date=June 14, 2012|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=July 9, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509171634/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-hook/483207/lady-gaga-reveals-new-perfume-bottle|archivedate=May 9, 2013}}</ref> Many high personalities were surprised by the perfume's sophistication when compared to other celebrity scents. Two versions of the perfume were released: a less expensive version, which includes a smaller bottle with a plastic cap, while a more expensive "premiere edition", known as Le Masterpiece, includes a larger bottle with a solid metal cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/lady-gaga/news/le-masterpiece-fame/|title=Lady Gaga Announces Le Masterpiece Premiere Edition Of New Fragrance Fame|date=July 8, 2012|work=[[Capital (radio network)|Capitol]]|publisher=[[Global Radio]]|accessdate=July 9, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710223541/http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/lady-gaga/news/le-masterpiece-fame/|archivedate=July 10, 2012}}</ref>

===Promotional video===
On August 14, 2012, Gaga released a 30-second trailer of the Lady Gaga Fame commercial which uses her song "[[Scheiße (song)|Scheiße]]" as background music.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/born-this-way-bonus-track/id438731876 |title=''Born This Way'' (Bonus Track Version) by Lady GaGa - Download ''Born This Way'' (Bonus Track Version) on iTunes |access-date=August 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526051934/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/born-this-way-bonus-track/id438731876 |archive-date=May 26, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On August 23, 2012, a day after the official launch of the fragrance at Macy's, Lady Gaga aired a second follow-up commercial. It follows the same story line and features Gaga scratching off black ooze, representing her black eau de parfum, from the male model's face. At the end of the ad, Lady Gaga's "Gulliver pose" is transformed into a golden statue similar to the cap from Le Masterpiece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFXi4sSa5Kg|title=YouTube|via=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=December 29, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623222147/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFXi4sSa5Kg|archivedate=June 23, 2016}}</ref> Later the same day, a third subsequent ad was premiered on TV. It features Gaga parading between two sets of male models. On one side there are partially nude men dressed in latex; on the other side are giant size male figures frontally clothed in a half-gown and nude at the side and seemingly at the back. Their faces are disguised by a plastic shield. The two "Gulliver" statues of Gaga are also featured, one with tiny men climbing all over her and the other cast in gold.

The complete commercial video debuted on September 13, 2012 at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], in New York and was released online on the same day at Littlemonsters.com. It was directed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]], who previously directed her music video for "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]".
