'''Egypt''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|dʒ|ɪ|p|t
| audio = En-us-Egypt.ogg
}} {{Respell|EE|jipt}}; {{lang-ar|مِصر}} {{transl|ar|''Miṣr''}}), officially the '''Arab Republic of Egypt''', is a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]] spanning the [[North Africa|northeast corner of Africa]] and [[Western Asia|southwest corner of Asia]] by a [[land bridge]] formed by the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. Egypt is a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean country]] bordered by the [[Gaza Strip]] ([[State of Palestine|Palestine]]) and [[Israel]] to [[Egypt–Israel barrier|the northeast]], the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the east, [[Sudan]] to [[Egypt–Sudan border|the south]], and [[Libya]] to [[Egypt–Libya border|the west]]. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies [[Jordan]], across the Red Sea lies [[Saudi Arabia]], and across the Mediterranean lie [[Greece]], [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]], although none share a land border with Egypt.

Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage along the [[Nile Delta]] back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE. Considered a [[cradle of civilisation]], [[Ancient Egypt]] saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Prehistory of Egypt: From the First Egyptians to the First Kings|last=Midant-Reynes|first=Béatrix|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford}}</ref> Iconic monuments such as the [[Giza Necropolis]] and its [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], as well the ruins of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Karnak]], and the [[Valley of the Kings]], reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest. Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has endured, and often assimilated, various foreign influences, including [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Persians|Persian]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Arab]], [[Ottomans|Ottoman Turkish]], and [[Nubian people|Nubian]]. Egypt was an early and important [[Christianity in Egypt|centre of Christianity]], but was largely [[Islamisation|Islamised]] in the seventh century and remains a predominantly [[Muslim]] country, albeit with a [[Copts in Egypt|significant Christian minority]].

Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained independence from the [[British Empire]] as a monarchy. Following the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], Egypt declared itself a [[Republic of Egypt (1953–58)|republic]], and in 1958 it merged with [[Syrian Republic (1930–58)|Syria]] to form the [[United Arab Republic]], which dissolved in 1961. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Egypt endured social and religious strife and political instability, fighting [[Arab–Israeli conflict|several armed conflicts]] with [[Israel]] in [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948]], [[Suez Crisis|1956]], [[Six-Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973]], and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupying]] the [[Gaza Strip]] intermittently until 1967. In 1978, Egypt signed the [[Camp David Accords]], officially withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|recognising Israel]]. The country continues to face challenges, from political unrest, including the recent [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|2011 revolution]] and [[Egyptian crisis (2011–14)|its aftermath]], to terrorism and economic underdevelopment. Egypt's current government is a [[semi-presidential republic]] headed by President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], which has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian or heading an authoritarian regime, responsible for perpetuating the country's problematic [[Human rights in Egypt|human rights record]].

[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] of Egypt and [[Arabic]] is its official language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/Newvr/Dustor-en001.pdf|title=Constitution of The Arab Republic of Egypt 2014|website=sis.gov.eg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718052913/http://www.sis.gov.eg/Newvr/Dustor-en001.pdf|archive-date=18 July 2015|access-date=13 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> With over 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Arab world]], the [[List of African countries by population|third-most populous]] in Africa (after [[Nigeria]] and [[Ethiopia]]), and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|thirteenth-most populous]] in the world. The great majority of its people live near the banks of the [[Nile]] River, an area of about {{convert|40000|km2|-3}}, where the only [[arable land]] is found. The large regions of the [[Sahara]] [[desert]], which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]] and other major cities in the Nile Delta.

Egypt is considered to be a [[regional power]] in [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and the [[Muslim world]], and a [[middle power]] worldwide.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Lessons from/for BRICSAM about south–north Relations at the Start of the 21st Century: Economic Size Trumps All Else?|journal=International Studies Review|volume=9}}</ref> With one of the largest and most diversified economies in the Middle East, which is projected to become [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next Eleven|one of the largest]] in the world in the 21st century, Egypt has the [[List of African countries by GDP (nominal)|third-largest economy in Africa]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|40th-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|19-largest by PPP]].

<div>The English name "Egypt" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] "{{transl|grc|Aígyptos}}" ("{{lang|grc|Αἴγυπτος}}"), via [[Middle French]] "Egypte" and [[Latin]] "{{lang|la|Aegyptus}}". It is reflected in [[Mycenaean Greek|early Greek]] [[Linear B]] tablets as "a-ku-pi-ti-yo". The adjective "aigýpti-"/"aigýptios" was borrowed into Coptic as "{{transl|cop|gyptios}}", and from there into [[Arabic]] as "{{transl|ar|qubṭī}}", back formed into "{{lang|ar|قبط}}" ("{{Transl|ar|qubṭ}}"), whence English "[[Copt]]".

The oldest attestation of this name for Egypt is the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] "mi-iṣ-ru" ("miṣru")<ref>The ending of the Hebrew form is either a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] or an ending identical to the dual in form (perhaps a [[locative]]), and this has sometimes been taken as referring to the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt. However, the application of the (possibly) "dual" ending to some toponyms and other words, a development peculiar to Hebrew, does not in fact imply any "two-ness" about the place. The ending is found, for example, in the Hebrew words for such single entities as "water" ("מַיִם"), "noon" ("צָהֳרַיִם"), "sky/heaven" ("שָׁמַיִם"), and in the ''[[Qere and Ketiv|qere]]'' – but not the original "ketiv" – of "Jerusalem" ("ירושל[י]ם").

In 525&nbsp;BCE, the powerful [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]], led by [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]], began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] at the battle of [[Pelusium]].

The entire [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt]], from 525 to 402 BCE, save for [[Petubastis III]], was an entirely Persian ruled period, with the Achaemenid Emperors all being granted the title of pharaoh. A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BCE, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Shaw|editor-first=Ian|title=The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-280458-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofa00shaw/page/383 383]|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofa00shaw/page/383}}</ref>

The [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch. It [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|fell to the Persians again]] in 343 BCE after the last native Pharaoh, King [[Nectanebo II]], was defeated in battle. This [[Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt]], however, did not last long, for the Persians were toppled several decades later by [[Alexander the Great]]. The Macedonian Greek general of Alexander, [[Ptolemy I Soter]], founded the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

The [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] was a powerful [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] state, extending from southern [[Syria]] in the east, to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia. [[Alexandria]] became the capital city and a centre of [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bowman |first = Alan K |title= Egypt after the Pharaohs 332 BC – AD 642 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1996 |edition=2nd |pages=25–26 |isbn=0-520-20531-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Stanwick |first = Paul Edmond |title= Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek kings as Egyptian pharaohs |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |location=Austin |year=2003 |isbn=0-292-77772-8}}</ref>

The last ruler from the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] line was [[Cleopatra VII]], who committed suicide following the burial of her lover [[Mark Antony]] who had died in her arms (from a self-inflicted stab wound), after [[Octavian]] had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled.
The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome. Nevertheless, [[Hellenistic culture]] continued to thrive in Egypt well after the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Muslim conquest]].

Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the 1st century.<ref name="georgetown">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |access-date=14 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=20 December 2011 |url-status=dead  }} See drop-down essay on "Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire"</ref> [[Diocletian]]'s reign (284–305 CE) marked the transition from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted.

The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief [[Aegyptus (Roman province)#Persian and Arab conquests|Sasanian Persian]] invasion early in the 7th century amidst the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]] during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as [[Sasanian Egypt]], until 639–42, when Egypt was invaded and
[[Muslim conquest of Egypt|conquered by the Islamic Empire]] by the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]]. When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought [[Sunni Islam]] to the country. Early in this period, Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders that have flourished to this day.<ref name="georgetown" /> These earlier rites had survived the period of [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=El-Daly|first=Okasha|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium|year=2005|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|page=140}}</ref>

In 639 an army of some 4,000 men were sent against Egypt by the second caliph, Umar, under the command of Amr ibn al-As. This army was joined by another 5,000 men in 640 and defeated a Byzantine army at the battle of Heliopolis. Amr next proceeded in the direction of Alexandria, which was surrendered to him by a treaty signed on 8 November 641. Alexandria was regained for the Byzantine Empire in 645 but was retaken by Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II]] was repulsed. From that time no serious effort was made by the Byzantines to regain possession of the country.

The Arabs founded the capital of Egypt called [[Fustat]], which was later burned down during the Crusades. Cairo was later built in the year 986 to grow to become the largest and richest city in the [[Arab Empire]], and one of the biggest and richest in the world.

==== Abbasid period ====
[[File:ساحة مسجد احمد بن طولون.jpg|thumb|The [[Ibn Tulun Mosque]] in Cairo, of [[Ahmad Ibn Tulun]]]]
The [[Abbasid]] period was marked by new taxations, and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule. At the beginning of the 9th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under [[Abdallah ibn Tahir]], who decided to reside at [[Baghdad]], sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him. In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out, and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government. Eventually the power loss of the Abbasids in Baghdad has led for general upon general to take over rule of Egypt, yet being under Abbasid allegiance, the [[Tulunid dynasty]] (868–905) and [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] (935–969) were among the most successful to defy the Abbasid Caliph.

Egypt was conquered by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517, after which it became a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions.<ref name="Abu-Lughod" /> The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion.

Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman [[Sultans]] to control, due in part to the continuing power and influence of the [[Mamluks]], the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries.

Egypt remained semi-autonomous under the Mamluks until it was invaded by the [[First French Republic|French]] forces of [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte in 1798 (see [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]]). After the French were defeated by the British, a power vacuum was created in Egypt, and a three-way power struggle ensued between the [[Ottoman Turks]], Egyptian [[Mamluk]]s who had ruled Egypt for centuries, and [[Arnauts|Albanian mercenaries]] in the service of the Ottomans.

After the French were expelled, power was seized in 1805 by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], an [[Albanians in Egypt|Albanian]] military commander of the Ottoman army in Egypt. While he carried the title of [[viceroy]] of Egypt, his subordination to the Ottoman porte was merely nominal.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Muhammad Ali [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|massacred]] the Mamluks and established a [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|dynasty]] that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952.

The introduction in 1820 of long-staple [[cotton]] transformed its agriculture into a cash-crop [[monoculture]] before the end of the century, concentrating land ownership and shifting production towards international markets.<ref name="Nejla M.

Muhammad Ali annexed [[Northern Sudan]] (1820–1824), [[Syria]] (1833), and parts of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Anatolia]]; but in 1841 the European powers, fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself, forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans. His military ambition required him to modernise the country: he built industries, a system of canals for irrigation and transport, and reformed the [[civil service]].<ref name="Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin 1973, p 2" />

He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing various similarities to the Soviet strategies (without communism) conducted in the 20th century.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the [[corvée]] to a great modernised army. He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century Egypt, and took a novel approach to create his great army, strengthening it with numbers and in skill. Education and training of the new soldiers became mandatory; the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation. The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with. The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold, one of nationalism and pride. It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fahmy|first=Khaled|title=All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt|year=1997|pages=119–147}}</ref>

The policy that Mohammad Ali Pasha followed during his reign explains partly why the numeracy in Egypt compared to other North-African and Middle-Eastern countries increased only at a remarkably small rate, as investment in further education only took place in the military and industrial sector.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim]] (in September 1848), then by a grandson [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] (in November 1848), then by [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said]] (in 1854), and [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma'il]] (in 1863) who encouraged science and agriculture and banned slavery in Egypt.<ref name="auto" />

=== Khedivate of Egypt (1867–1914) ===
{{Main|Khedivate of Egypt}}
[[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty]] remained nominally an Ottoman province. It was granted the status of an [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|autonomous vassal state]] or ''[[Khedivate of Egypt|Khedivate]]'' in 1867, a legal status which was to remain in place until 1914 although the Ottomans had no power or presence.

The [[Suez Canal]], built in partnership with the French, was completed in 1869. Its construction was financed by European banks. Large sums also went to patronage and corruption. New taxes caused popular discontent.  In 1875 Isma'il avoided bankruptcy by selling all Egypt's shares in the canal to the British government. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French [[Dual control (politics)|controllers]] who sat in the Egyptian cabinet, and, "with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were the real power in the Government."<ref>Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin, ''Nasser of the Arabs'', p. 2.</ref>

Other circumstances like epidemic diseases (cattle disease in the 1880s), floods and wars drove the economic downturn and increased Egypt's dependency on foreign debt even further.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Local dissatisfaction with the Khedive and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879, with [[Ahmed ʻUrabi]] a prominent figure. After increasing tensions and nationalist revolts, the United Kingdom invaded Egypt in 1882, crushing the Egyptian army at the [[Battle of Tell El Kebir]] and militarily occupying the country.<ref>Anglo French motivation: Derek Hopwood, ''Egypt: Politics and Society 1945–1981''.

In 1899 the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement was signed: the Agreement stated that Sudan would be jointly governed by the Khedivate of Egypt and the United Kingdom. However, actual control of Sudan was in British hands only.

In 1906, the [[Denshawai incident]] prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement.

In 1914 the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered World War I in alliance with the Central Empires; Khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] (who had grown increasingly hostile to the British in preceding years) decided to support the motherland in war. Following such decision, the British forcibly removed him from power and replaced him with his brother [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jankowski|first=James|title=Egypt, A Short History|page=111}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne|title=Treaty of Lausanne – World War I Document Archive|website=wwi.lib.byu.edu|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

Hussein Kamel declared Egypt's independence from the Ottoman Empire, assuming the title of [[Sultanate of Egypt|Sultan of Egypt]]. Shortly following independence, Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom.[[File:Cairo-Demonstrations1919.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|Female nationalists demonstrating in [[Cairo]], 1919]]
After [[World War I]], [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local [[Legislative Assembly]]. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to [[Malta]] on 8 March 1919, the country arose in its [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. The revolt led the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916–1922)|UK government]] to issue a [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence]] on 22 February 1922.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jankowski|first=James|title=Egypt, A Short History|page=112}}</ref>

Following independence from the United Kingdom, Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] assumed the title of [[Kingdom of Egypt|King of Egypt]]; despite being nominally independent, the Kingdom was still under British military occupation and the UK still had great influence over the state.[[File:1stAlameinBritDefense.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|British infantry near [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], 17 July 1942]]
The [[Kingdom of Egypt|new government]] drafted and implemented a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 based on a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] system. The nationalist Wafd Party won a landslide victory in the [[1923–24 Egyptian parliamentary election|1923–1924 election]] and [[Saad Zaghloul]] was appointed as the new Prime Minister.

In 1936, the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded and British troops withdrew from Egypt, except for the Suez Canal. The treaty did not resolve the question of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], which, under the terms of the existing Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899, stated that Sudan should be jointly governed by Egypt and Britain, but with real power remaining in British hands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zpShVWIxwIC&q=%22Anglo-Egyptian+Condominium+Agreement%22+%221899%22&pg=PA33|title=A History of Modern Sudan|last1=Collins|first1=Robert O.|last2=Collins|first2=Professor of History Robert O.|date=2008-05-29|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85820-5|language=en}}</ref>

Britain used Egypt as a base for Allied operations throughout the region, especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany. Its highest priorities were control of the Eastern Mediterranean, and especially keeping the Suez Canal open for merchant ships and for military connections with India and Australia. The government of Egypt, and the Egyptian population, played a minor role in the Second World War. When the war began in September 1939, Egypt declared martial law and broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. It did not declare war on Germany, but the Prime Minister associated Egypt with the British war effort. It broke diplomatic relations with Italy in 1940, but never declared war, even when the Italian army invaded Egypt. King Farouk took practically a neutral position, which accorded with elite opinion among the Egyptians. The Egyptian army did no fighting. It was apathetic about the war, with the leading officers looking on the British as occupiers and sometimes holding some private sympathy with the Axis. In June 1940 the King dismissed Prime Minister Aly Maher, who got on poorly with the British. A new coalition Government was formed with the Independent Hassan Pasha Sabri as Prime Minister.

Following a ministerial crisis in February 1942, the ambassador Sir [[Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn|Miles Lampson]], pressed Farouk to have a [[Wafd Party|Wafd]] or Wafd-coalition government replace [[Hussein Sirri Pasha]]'s government. On the night of 4 February 1942, [[Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942|British troops and tanks surrounded Abdeen Palace in Cairo and Lampson presented Farouk with an ultimatum]]. Farouk capitulated, and Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter. However, the humiliation meted out to Farouk, and the actions of the Wafd in cooperating with the British and taking power, lost support for both the British and the Wafd among both civilians and, more importantly, the [[Military of Egypt|Egyptian military]].

Most British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947 (although the British army maintained a military base in the area), but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the War. Anti-monarchy sentiments further increased following the disastrous performance of the Kingdom in the [[First Arab-Israeli War]]. The 1950 election saw a landslide victory of the nationalist [[Wafd Party]] and the King was forced to appoint [[Mostafa El-Nahas]] as new Prime Minister. In 1951 Egypt unilaterally withdrew from the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] and ordered all remaining British troops to leave the Suez Canal.

As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal, the Egyptian government cut off the water and refused to allow food into the Suez Canal base, announced a boycott of British goods, forbade Egyptian workers from entering the base and sponsored guerrilla attacks, turning the area around the Suez Canal into a low level war zone. On 24 January 1952, Egyptian guerrillas staged a fierce attack on the British forces around the Suez Canal, during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas. In response, on 25 January, General [[George Erskine]] sent out British tanks and infantry to surround the auxiliary police station in Ismailia and gave the policemen an hour to surrender their arms on the grounds the police were arming the guerrillas. The police commander called the Interior Minister, [[Fouad Serageddin]], Nahas's right-hand man, who was smoking cigars in his bath at the time, to ask if he should surrender or fight. Serageddin ordered the police to fight "to the last man and the last bullet". The resulting battle saw the police station levelled and 43 Egyptian policemen killed together with 3 British soldiers. The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt. The next day, 26 January 1952 was [[Cairo fire|"Black Saturday"]], as the anti-British riot was known, that saw much of downtown Cairo which the Khedive Ismail the Magnificent had rebuilt in the style of Paris, burned down. Farouk blamed the Wafd for the Black Saturday riot, and dismissed Nahas as prime minister the next day. He was replaced by [[Aly Maher Pasha]].<ref name="factbook">{{cite web|title=Egypt |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA|access-date=2 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611035416/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|archive-date=11 June 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 22–23, 1952, the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]], led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], launched a coup d'état ([[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]) against the king. Farouk I abdicated the throne to his son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fouad II]], who was, at the time, a seven month old baby. The Royal Family left Egypt some days later and the Council of Regency, led by [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] was formed, The council, however, held only nominal authority and the real power was actually in the hands of the [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]], led by Naguib and Nasser.

Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers' riots in [[Kafr Dawar]] on 12 August 1952, which resulted in two death sentences. Following a brief experiment with civilian rule, the Free Officers abrogated the monarchy and the 1923 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953. Naguib was proclaimed as president, while Nasser was appointed as the new Prime Minister.

{{Main|History of the Republic of Egypt}}
Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] by the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]], the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned. On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic, serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years.

In October 1954 Egypt and the United Kingdom agreed to abolish the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement]] of 1899 and grant Sudan independence; the agreement came into force on 1 January 1956.

Nasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as president in June 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. He [[nationalised]] the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956; his hostile approach towards Israel and economic nationalism prompted the beginning of the [[Second Arab-Israeli War]] (Suez Crisis), in which Israel (with support from France and the United Kingdom) occupied the Sinai peninsula and the Canal. The war came to an end because of US and USSR diplomatic intervention and the ''status quo'' was restored.

=== United Arab Republic (1958–1971) ===
[[File:Port Said from air.jpg|thumb|Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the [[Suez Canal]] hit during the initial [[Suez Crisis|Anglo-French assault]] on Egypt, 5 November 1956]]
In 1958, Egypt and [[Syria]] formed a sovereign union known as the [[United Arab Republic]]. The union was short-lived, ending in 1961 when [[Syria]] seceded, thus ending the union. During most of its existence, the United Arab Republic was also in a loose [[confederation]] with [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]] (or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen), known as the [[United Arab States]]. In 1959, the [[All-Palestine Government]] of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian client state, was absorbed into the [[United Arab Republic]] under the pretext of Arab union, and was never restored.  The [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]], a new nasserist state-party was founded in 1962.

In the early 1960s, Egypt became fully involved in the [[North Yemen Civil War]]. The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the Yemeni republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and chemical weapons. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egyptian commitment in Yemen was greatly undermined later.

In mid May 1967, the Soviet Union issued warnings to [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] of an impending Israeli attack on Syria. Although the chief of staff [[Mohamed Fawzi (general)|Mohamed Fawzi]] verified them as "baseless",<ref>{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=252}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=76}}</ref> Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable: on 14 May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel, on 19 May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel, and on 23 May he closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping.<ref>Shlaim, Rogan, 2012 pp. 7, 106</ref> On 26 May [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] declared, "The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel".<ref>{{cite book|author=Samir A.

Israel re-iterated that the [[Straits of Tiran]] closure was a [[Casus belli]]. This prompted the beginning of the [[Third Arab-Israeli War|Third Arab Israeli War]] (Six-Day War) in which Israel attacked Egypt, and occupied [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]], which Egypt had [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied]] since the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. During the 1967 war, an [[Emergency law in Egypt|Emergency Law]] was enacted, and remained in effect until 2012, with the exception of an 18-month break in 1980/81.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emergency Law in Egypt|url=http://www.fidh.org/THE-EMERGENCY-LAW-IN-EGYPT|work=International Federation for Human Rights|access-date=2 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201210318/http://fidh.org/THE-EMERGENCY-LAW-IN-EGYPT|archive-date=1 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Under this law, police powers were extended, constitutional rights suspended and censorship legalised.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor.<ref name="Tarek Osman 2010, p. 120">''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p. 120</ref> Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, most of them being boys.

From academic year 1953–54 through 1965–66, overall public school enrolments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.<ref name="Tarek Osman 2010, p. 120" /> During the 1960s, the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jesse Ferris|title=Nasser's Gamble: How Intervention in Yemen Caused the Six-Day War and the Decline of Egyptian Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UC4_aVRh7MgC&pg=PA172|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-15514-2|page=2|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906085333/https://books.google.com/books?id=UC4_aVRh7MgC&pg=PA172|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1970, President Nasser died of a heart attack and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition. In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the [[Fourth Arab-Israeli War]] (Yom Kippur War), a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. It presented Sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the Sinai later in return for peace with Israel.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1973 Arab-Israeli War: Arab Policies, Strategies, and Campaigns |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1997/Jordan.htm |author=Major Michael C.

In 1975, Sadat shifted Nasser's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah. Through this policy, incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors, but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction, abandoning Egypt's infant industries.<ref>Amin, Galal.

In 1977, Sadat dissolved the Arab Socialist Union and replaced it with the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]].

Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the [[Arab world]] and led to Egypt's expulsion from the [[Arab League]], but it was supported by most Egyptians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vatikiotis|first=P.J.|title=The History of Modern Egypt: From Muhammad Ali to Mubarak|year=1991|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-82034-5|page=443|edition=4.}}</ref> [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|Sadat was assassinated]] by an Islamic extremist in October 1981.

Hosni Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt's relationship with Israel yet eased the tensions with Egypt's Arab neighbours. Domestically, Mubarak faced serious problems. Even though farm and industry output expanded, the economy could not keep pace with the population boom. Mass poverty and unemployment led rural families to stream into cities like Cairo where they ended up in crowded slums, barely managing to survive.

On [[1986 Egyptian conscripts riot|25 February 1986]] Security Police started rioting, protesting against reports that their term of duty was to be extended from 3 to 4 years. Hotels, nightclubs, restaurants and casinos were attacked in Cairo and there were riots in other cities. A day time curfew was imposed. It took the army 3 days to restore order. 107 people were killed.<ref>Middle East International No 270, 7 March 1986, Publishers [[Christopher Mayhew|Lord Mayhew]], [[Dennis Walters]].

A new parliamentary election was held in December 2015, resulting in a landslide victory for pro-Sisi parties, which secured a strong majority in the newly formed [[House of Representatives (Egypt)|House of Representatives]].

In 2016, Egypt entered in a diplomatic crisis with Italy following the [[Murder of Giulio Regeni|murder of researcher Giulio Regeni]]: in April 2016, Prime Minister [[Matteo Renzi]] recalled the Italian ambassador from Cairo because of lack of co-operation from the Egyptian Government in the investigation. The ambassador was sent back to Egypt in 2017 by the new Prime Minister [[Paolo Gentiloni]].

El-Sisi was [[2018 Egyptian presidential election|re-elected in 2018]], facing no serious opposition. In 2019, a series of constitutional amendments were approved by the parliament, further increasing the President's and the military's power, increasing presidential terms from 4 years to 6 years and allowing El-Sisi to run for other two mandates. The proposals [[2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum|were approved in a referendum]].

Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west, the Sudan to the south, and the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east. Egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a [[transcontinental nation]], it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between Africa and Asia, traversed by a navigable waterway (the [[Suez Canal]]) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by way of the Red Sea.

Apart from the Nile Valley, the majority of Egypt's landscape is desert, with a few [[oasis|oases]] scattered about. Winds create prolific [[Dune|sand dunes]] that peak at more than {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|-1}} high. Egypt includes parts of the [[Sahara]] desert and of the [[Libyan Desert]]. These deserts protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats and were referred to as the "red land" in ancient Egypt.

Towns and cities include [[Alexandria]], the second largest city; [[Aswan]]; [[Asyut]]; [[Cairo]], the modern Egyptian capital and largest city; [[El Mahalla El Kubra]]; [[Giza]], the site of the Pyramid of Khufu; [[Hurghada]]; [[Luxor]]; [[Kom Ombo]]; [[Port Safaga]]; [[Port Said]]; [[Sharm El Sheikh]]; [[Suez]], where the south end of the Suez Canal is located; [[Zagazig]]; and [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]]. [[Oasis|Oases]] include [[Bahariya Oasis|Bahariya]], [[Dakhla Oasis|Dakhla]], [[Farafra, Egypt|Farafra]], [[Kharga Oasis|Kharga]] and [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]. [[Protectorates]] include Ras Mohamed National Park, Zaranik Protectorate and Siwa.

On 13 March 2015, plans for a [[proposed new capital of Egypt]] were announced.<ref>{{cite news|title=Egypt to build new administrative and business capital|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31874886|work=BBC News|date=13 March 2015|access-date=20 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216003921/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31874886|archive-date=16 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world, and most of its land surface is desert.

[[File:Sand Dunes (Qattara Depression).jpg|thumb|The [[Qattara Depression]] in Egypt's north west.]]
Egypt has an unusually hot, sunny and dry climate. Average high temperatures are high in the north but very to extremely high in the rest of the country during summer. The cooler Mediterranean winds consistently blow over the northern sea coast, which helps to get more moderated temperatures, especially at the height of the summertime. The [[Khamaseen]] is a hot, dry wind that originates from the vast deserts in the south and blows in the spring or in the early summer. It brings scorching sand and dust particles, and usually brings daytime temperatures over {{convert|40|°C}} and sometimes over {{convert|50|°C}} in the interior, while the relative humidity can drop to 5% or even less. The absolute highest temperatures in Egypt occur when the Khamaseen blows. The weather is always sunny and clear in Egypt, especially in cities such as [[Aswan]], [[Luxor]] and [[Asyut]]. It is one of the least cloudy and least rainy regions on Earth.

Prior to the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], the Nile flooded annually (colloquially ''The Gift of the Nile'') replenishing Egypt's soil. This gave Egypt a consistent harvest throughout the years.

The potential rise in sea levels due to [[global warming]] could threaten Egypt's densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the country's economy, agriculture and industry. Combined with growing demographic pressures, a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into [[environmental refugees]] by the end of the 21st century, according to some climate experts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77240 |title=Contingency planning for rising sea levels in Egypt &#124; IRIN News, March 2008 |publisher=Irinnews.org |access-date=25 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827210253/http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77240 |archive-date=27 August 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=El Deeb and Keath|first=Sarah and Lee|title=Islamist claims victory in Egypt president vote|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_EGYPT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2012-06-17-23-11-03|agency=Associated Press|access-date=18 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620080939/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_EGYPT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2012-06-17-23-11-03|archive-date=20 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt: algae (1483 species), animals (about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects), fungi (more than 627 species), monera (319 species), plants (2426 species), protozoans (371 species). For some major groups, for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms, the number was not known. Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles, the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt. For the fungi, including lichen-forming species, for example, subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt, and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher.<ref>A.M.

Egypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum imports, natural gas, and tourism; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[Persian Gulf]] and Europe. The completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] in 1970 and the resultant [[Lake Nasser]] have altered the time-honoured place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population, limited [[arable land]], and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.

The government has invested in communications and physical infrastructure. Egypt has received [[United States foreign aid]] since 1979 (an average of $2.2 billion per year) and is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war. Egypt's economy mainly relies on these sources of income: tourism, remittances from Egyptians working abroad and revenues from the Suez Canal.<ref>[http://www.undp.org.eg/Default.aspx?tabid=75 Egypt Country Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601071446/http://www.undp.org.eg/Default.aspx?tabid=75 |date=1 June 2013}}.

Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about {{convert|600000|t|-4}} per year.

In 2013, the Egyptian General Petroleum Co (EGPC) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest, Reuters has reported. Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas (LNG) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer, while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand, said EGPC chairman, Tarek El Barkatawy. Egypt produces its own energy, but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/egypt-reduce-natural-gas-exports-avoid-343607 |title=Egypt to reduce natural gas exports to avoid energy crisis |publisher=AMEinfo.com |access-date=6 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803013304/http://www.ameinfo.com/egypt-reduce-natural-gas-exports-avoid-343607 |archive-date= 3 August 2013 }}</ref>

Economic conditions have started to improve considerably, after a period of stagnation, due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming [[stock market]].

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Egypt}}

Transport in Egypt is centred around Cairo and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the Nile. The main line of the nation's {{convert|40800|km|mi|adj=on}} railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]]. The vehicle road network has expanded rapidly to over {{convert|21000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, consisting of 28 line, 796 stations, 1800 train covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta, the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, the Sinai, and the Western oases.

[[File:Metro-1-l.jpg|thumb|right|The Cairo Metro (line 2)]] The [[Cairo Metro]] in Egypt is the first of only two full-fledged metro systems in Africa and the Arab World. It is considered one of the most important recent projects in Egypt which cost around 12 billion Egyptian pounds. The system consists of three operational lines with a fourth line expected in the future.

[[EgyptAir]], which is now the country's [[flag carrier]] and largest airline, was founded in 1932 by Egyptian industrialist [[Talaat Harb]], today owned by the Egyptian government. The airline is based at [[Cairo International Airport]], its main hub, operating scheduled passenger and freight services to more than 75 destinations in the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[the Americas]]. The Current [[EgyptAir]] fleet includes 80 aeroplanes.

==== Suez Canal ====
{{Main|Suez Canal}}
[[File:Capesize bulk carrier at Suez Canal Bridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Suez Canal Bridge]].]]
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the [[Middle East]], connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work, it allows ship transport between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] without navigation around [[Africa]]. The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez. Ismailia lies on its west bank, {{convert|3|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=off}} from the half-way point.

The canal is {{convert|193.30|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=off}} deep and {{convert|205|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide {{As of|2010|lc=y}}. It consists of the northern access channel of {{convert|22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, the canal itself of {{convert|162.25|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} and the southern access channel of {{convert|9|km|mi|frac=2|abbr=on}}. The canal is a single lane with passing places in the Ballah By-Pass and the Great Bitter Lake. It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal. In general, the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer. The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez.

On 26 August 2014 a proposal was made for opening a [[New Suez Canal]]. Work on the New Suez Canal was completed in July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt Says Work Finished on New Suez Canal|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/egypt-says-work-is-finished-on-new-suez-canal/2883548.html|publisher=Voice of America|date=29 July 2015|access-date=24 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803133542/http://www.voanews.com/content/egypt-says-work-is-finished-on-new-suez-canal/2883548.html|archive-date=3 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt's New Suez Canal to Be Completed for Aug. 6 Ceremony|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/13/world/middleeast/ap-ml-egypt-suez-canal.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 August 2015|date=30 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616163211/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/13/world/middleeast/ap-ml-egypt-suez-canal.html|archive-date=16 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The channel was officially inaugurated with a ceremony attended by foreign leaders and featuring military flyovers on 6 August 2015, in accordance with the budgets laid out for the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33800076|title=Egypt launches Suez Canal expansion|date=6 August 2015|access-date=6 August 2015|agency=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806152649/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33800076|archive-date=6 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1531052/egypt-opens-new-6bn-suez-canal|title=Egypt Opens New £6bn Suez Canal|first=Sherine|last=Tadros|agency=Sky News|date=6 August 2015|access-date=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806194926/http://news.sky.com/story/1531052/egypt-opens-new-6bn-suez-canal|archive-date=6 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Egypt}}
The piped [[water supply]] in Egypt increased between 1990 and 2010 from 89% to 100% in urban areas and from 39% to 93% in rural areas despite rapid population growth. Over that period, Egypt achieved the elimination of [[open defecation]] in rural areas and invested in infrastructure. Access to an [[improved water source]] in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99%. About one half of the population is connected to [[sanitary sewer]]s.<ref>As per the 2006 census</ref>

Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of [[diarrhoea]].<ref name="IDRC">National Water Research Center, Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (2007): [https://web.archive.org/web/20160118112500/http://web.idrc.ca/en/ev-127200-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html Actualizing the Right to Water: An Egyptian Perspective for an Action Plan], Shaden Abdel-Gawad. Retrieved 30 April 2012.</ref> Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world. This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs, a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the [[Arab Spring]]. Poor operation of facilities, such as water and wastewater treatment plants, as well as limited government accountability and transparency, are also issues.
[[File:Egypt sat.png|thumb|Green irrigated land along the Nile amidst the desert and in the delta]]

=== Irrigated land and crops ===
Due to the absence of appreciable rainfall, Egypt's agriculture depends entirely on irrigation. The main source of irrigation water is the river Nile of which the flow is controlled by the high dam at Aswan. It releases, on average, 55 cubic kilometres (45,000,000 acre·ft) water per year, of which some 46 cubic kilometres (37,000,000 acre·ft) are diverted into the irrigation canals.<ref name="ewup">Egyptian Water Use Management Project (EWUP), 1984. Improving Egypt's Irrigation System in the Old Lands, Final Report. Colorado State University and Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources.</ref>

In the Nile valley and delta, almost 33,600 square kilometres (13,000 sq mi) of land benefit from these irrigation waters producing on average 1.8 crops per year.<ref name="ewup" />

Egypt is a recognised cultural trend-setter of the Arabic-speaking world. Contemporary Arabic and Middle-Eastern culture is heavily influenced by Egyptian literature, music, film and television. Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s, giving a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arabic-speaking world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49061 |title=Mideast: Egypt Makes Cultural Clout Count (IPS, Oct.&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2009) |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=29 October 2009 |access-date=25 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427044804/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49061 |archive-date=27 April 2011 }}</ref>

The work of early 19th century scholar [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and exposed Egyptian society to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer [[Ali Mubarak]] a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars, such as [[Suyuti]] and [[Maqrizi]], who themselves studied the [[History of ancient Egypt|history]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|antiquities]] of Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last=El-Daly|first=Okasha|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium|year=2005|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|page=29}}</ref>

The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]]. [[Egyptian blue]], also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years. It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment. The wall paintings done in the service of the [[Pharaoh]]s followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], [[Egyptian temple|temples]] and monumental tombs.

Well-known examples are the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] designed by ancient architect and engineer [[Imhotep]], the [[Sphinx]], and the temple of [[Abu Simbel]]. Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene, from the vernacular architecture of [[Hassan Fathy]] and [[Ramses Wissa Wassef]], to [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]'s sculptures, to the distinctive [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] of [[Isaac Fanous]]. The [[Cairo Opera House]] serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Egypt}}

[[Music of Egypt|Egyptian music]] is a rich mixture of indigenous, Mediterranean, African and Western elements. It has been an integral part of [[culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] since antiquity. The ancient [[Egyptians]] credited one of their gods [[Hathor]] with the invention of [[music]], which [[Osiris]] in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world. Egyptians used music instruments since then.<ref>[http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Exhibits/MIRE/Introduction/AncientEgypt/AncientEgypt.html Music of Ancient Egypt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013114158/http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Exhibits/MIRE/Introduction/AncientEgypt/AncientEgypt.html |date=13 October 2015}}, [[Kelsey Museum of Archaeology]], [[University of Michigan]].</ref>

Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as [[Abdu al-Hamuli]], Almaz and Mahmoud Osman, who influenced the later work of [[Sayed Darwish]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]] and [[Abdel Halim Hafez]] whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Arab world. Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include [[Amr Diab]] and [[Mohamed Mounir]].

=== Dances ===
[[File:Tanoura Dancing.jpg|thumb|[[Tanoura (dance)|Tanoura]] dancers performing in Wekalet El Ghoury, Cairo.]]
Today, Egypt is often considered the home of [[belly dance]]. Egyptian [[belly dance]] has two main styles – [[raqs baladi]] and [[raqs sharqi]]. There are also numerous folkloric and character dances that may be part of an Egyptian-style belly dancer's repertoire, as well as the modern shaabi street dance which shares some elements with [[raqs baladi]].

Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world. It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras, starting from prehistoric age to the modern age, passing through so many ages such as; Pharonic, Roman, Greek, Islamic and many other ages. Because of this wide variation of ages, the continuous contact with other nations and [[List of conflicts in Egypt|the big number of conflicts]] Egypt had been through, at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt, mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts.

=== Festivals ===
Egypt celebrates many festivals and religious carnivals, also known as ''mulid''. They are usually associated with a particular Coptic or Sufi saint, but are often celebrated by Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion. [[Ramadan]] has a special flavour in Egypt, celebrated with sounds, lights (local lanterns known as ''fawanees'') and much flare that many Muslim tourists from the region flock to Egypt to witness during Ramadan.

The ancient spring festival of [[Sham El Nessim|Sham en Nisim]] ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|Ϭⲱⲙ‘ⲛⲛⲓⲥⲓⲙ}} ''shom en nisim'') has been celebrated by Egyptians for thousands of years, typically between the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian months]] of [[Paremoude]] (April) and [[Pashons]] (May), following [[Easter]] Sunday.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Egyptian cuisine}}
[[File:Egyptian food Koshary.jpg|thumb|[[Kushari]], one of Egypt's national dishes.]]
Egyptian cuisine is notably conducive to vegetarian diets, as it relies heavily on legume and vegetable dishes. Although food in Alexandria and the coast of Egypt tends to use a great deal of fish and other seafood, for the most part Egyptian cuisine is based on foods that grow out of the ground. Meat has been very expensive for most Egyptians throughout history, so a great number of vegetarian dishes have been developed.

Some consider [[kushari]] (a mixture of rice, lentils, and macaroni) to be the [[national dish]]. Fried onions can be also added to kushari. In addition, [[ful medames]] (mashed fava beans) is one of the most popular dishes. Fava bean is also used in making [[falafel]] (also known as "ta‘miya"), which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East. Garlic fried with coriander is added to [[mulukhiyya|molokhiya]], a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves, sometimes with chicken or rabbit.
