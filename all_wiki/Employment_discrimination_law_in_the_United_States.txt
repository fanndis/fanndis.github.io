[[Employment discrimination law]] in the [[United States]] derives from the [[common law]], and is codified in numerous state, federal, and local laws. These laws prohibit discrimination based on certain characteristics or "protected categories." The [[United States Constitution]] also prohibits discrimination by federal and state governments against their public employees. Discrimination in the [[private sector]] is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but has become subject to a growing body of federal and state law, including the Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Federal law prohibits discrimination in a number of areas, including recruiting, hiring, job evaluations, promotion policies, training, compensation and disciplinary action. State laws often extend protection to additional categories or employers.

==Constitutional basis==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2009}}
The [[United States Constitution]] does not directly address employment discrimination, but its prohibitions on discrimination by the federal government have been held to protect federal government employees.

The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution]] limit the power of the federal and state governments to discriminate. The Fifth Amendment has an explicit requirement that the federal government does not deprive individuals of "life, liberty, or property", without due process of the law. It also contains an implicit guarantee that the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly prohibits states from violating an individual's rights of [[due process]] and [[equal protection]]. In the employment context, these Constitutional provisions would limit the right of the state and federal governments to discriminate in their employment practices by treating employees, former employees, or job applicants unequally because of membership in a group (such as a race or sex). Due process protection requires that government employees have a fair procedural process before they are terminated if the termination is related to a "liberty" (such as the right to [[free speech]]) or property interest. As both Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses are passive, the clause that empowers Congress to pass anti-discrimination bills (so they are not unconstitutional under Tenth Amendment) is [[Congressional power of enforcement|Section 5 of Fourteenth Amendment]].

Employment discrimination or harassment in the private sector is not unconstitutional because Federal and most State Constitutions do not expressly give their respective government the power to enact civil rights laws that apply to the private sector.  The Federal government's authority to regulate a private business, including civil rights laws, stems from their power to regulate all commerce between the States.  Some State Constitutions do expressly afford some protection from public and private employment discrimination, such as Article I of the [[California Constitution]].  However, most State Constitutions only address discriminatory treatment by the government, including a public employer.

Absent of a provision in a State Constitution, State civil rights laws that regulate the private sector are generally Constitutional under the "[[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police powers]]" doctrine or the power of a State to enact laws designed to protect public health, safety and morals.   All States must adhere to the Federal Civil Rights laws, but States may enact civil rights laws that offer additional employment protection.

For example, some State civil rights laws offer protection from employment discrimination on the basis of political affiliation, even though such forms of discrimination are not yet covered in federal civil rights laws.

==History of federal laws==
Federal law governing employment discrimination has developed over time.

The [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] in 1963. It is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. '''<ref name=":22">{{cite journal |jstor=189578|title=Bringing Gender and Race in: U.S. Employment Discrimination Policy|journal=Gender and Society|volume=7|issue=2|pages=204–226|last1=Blankenship|first1=Kim M|year=1993|doi=10.1177/089124393007002004|s2cid=144175260}}</ref>''' The Equal Pay Act prohibits employers and unions from paying different wages based on sex. It does not prohibit other discriminatory practices in hiring.

[[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits discrimination in many more aspects of the employment relationship. "Title VII created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to administer the act"'''.''' <ref name=":22"/> It applies to most employers engaged in interstate commerce with more than 15 employees, labor organizations, and employment agencies. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on race, color, [[religion]], [[sex]] or national origin.

The [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] (ADEA), enacted in 1968 and amended in 1978 and 1986, prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of age. The prohibited practices are nearly identical to those outlined in Title VII, except that the ADEA protects workers in firms with 20 or more workers rather than 15 or more. An employee is protected from discrimination based on age if he or she is over 40.  Since 1978, the ADEA has phased out and prohibited mandatory retirement, except for high-powered decision-making positions (that also provide large pensions). The ADEA contains explicit guidelines for benefit, pension and retirement plans.<ref name="ADEA">[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]</ref> Though ADEA is the center of most discussion of age discrimination legislation, there is a longer history starting with the abolishment of "maximum ages of entry into employment in 1956" by the United States Civil Service Commission.

The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) was enacted to eliminate discriminatory barriers against qualified individuals with disabilities, individuals with a record of a disability, or individuals who are regarded as having a disability. It prohibits discrimination based on real or perceived physical or mental disabilities. It also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees who need them because of a disability to apply for a job, perform the essential functions of a job, or enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment, unless the employer can show that [[undue hardship]] will result. There are strict limitations on when an employer can ask disability-related questions or require medical examinations, and all medical information must be treated as confidential. A disability is defined under the ADA as a mental or physical health condition that "substantially limits one or more major life activities."<ref name="ADA">[http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, AS AMENDED]</ref>

==LGBT employment discrimination==
[[Title VII|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. This is encompassed by the law's prohibition of employment discrimination on the basis of sex. Prior to the landmark cases ''[[Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia]]'' and ''[[R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'' (2020), employment protections for LGBT people were patchwork; several states and localities explicitly prohibit harassment and bias in employment decisions on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity, although some only cover public employees.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tilcsik|first=András|date=1 January 2011|title=Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States|url=http://osf.io/j9ybs/download|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=117|issue=2|pages=586–626|doi=10.1086/661653|jstor=10.1086/661653|pmid=22268247|hdl=1807/34998|s2cid=23542996}}</ref> Prior to the ''Bostock'' decision, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) interpreted Title VII to cover LGBT employees; the EEOC's determined that transgender employees were protected under Title VII in 2012,<ref name="Edgeboston.com">{{cite web|date=2012-04-25|title=In Landmark Ruling, Feds Add Transgendered to Anti-Discrimination Law :: EDGE Boston, MA|url=http://www.edgeboston.com/news/national/news//132290/in_landmark_ruling,_feds_add_transgendered_to_anti-discrimination_law|accessdate=2015-07-17|publisher=Edgeboston.com}}</ref> and extended the protection to encompass sexual orientation in 2015.<ref name="Carpenter">{{cite news|last=Carpenter|first=Dale|date=2012-12-14|title=Anti-gay discrimination is sex discrimination, says the EEOC|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/07/16/anti-gay-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination-says-the-eeoc/|accessdate=2015-07-17}}</ref><ref name="Tatectate">{{cite web|last=Tatectate|first=Curtis|date=|title=EEOC: Federal law bans workplace bias against gays, lesbians, bisexuals &#124; Miami Herald Miami Herald|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article27469123.html|accessdate=2015-07-17|publisher=Miamiherald.com}}</ref>

According to Crosby Burns and Jeff Krehely: "Studies show that anywhere from 15 percent to 43 percent of gay people have experienced some form of discrimination and harassment at the workplace. Moreover, a staggering 90 percent of transgender workers report some form of harassment or mistreatment on the job." Many people in the LGBT community have lost their job, including Vandy Beth Glenn, a transgender woman who claims that her boss told her that her presence may make other people feel uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burns|first1=Crosby|last2=Krehely|first2=Jeff|title=Gay and Transgender People Face High Rates of Workplace Discrimination and Harassment|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9872/gay-and-transgender-people-face-high-rates-of-workplace-discrimination-and-harassment/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref>

Almost half of the United States also have state-level or municipal-level laws banning the discrimination of gender non-conforming and transgender people in both public and private workplaces. A few more states ban LGBT discrimination in only public workplaces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Workplace|url=http://employment.findlaw.com/employment-discrimination/sexual-orientation-discrimination-in-the-workplace.html|website=FindLaw|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref> Some opponents of these laws believe that it would intrude on religious liberty, even though these laws are focused more on discriminatory actions, not beliefs.

==State law==
State statutes also provide extensive protection from employment discrimination. Some laws extend similar protection as provided by the federal acts to employers who are not covered by those statutes.  Other statutes provide protection to groups not covered by the federal acts.  Some state laws provide greater protection to employees of the state or of state contractors.

The following table lists categories not protected by federal law. Age is included as well, since federal law only covers workers over 40.

==Government employees==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

Employees of federal and state governments have additional protections against employment discrimination.

The [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]] prohibits discrimination in federal employment on the basis of conduct that does not affect [[job performance]].  The [[Office of Personnel Management]] has interpreted this as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.<ref name="OPM Sexual Orientation">[http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/Guide04.asp Addressing Sexual Orientation Discrimination In Federal Civilian Employment: A Guide to Employee's Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114092004/http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/Guide04.asp |date=2007-01-14 }}</ref>  In June 2009, it was announced that the interpretation would be expanded to include gender identity.<ref name="NYT federal transgender">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24transgender.html New Protections for Transgender Federal Workers]</ref>

==Exceptions==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2009}}

===Bona fide occupational qualifications===
{{Main|Bona fide occupational qualifications}}

Employers are generally allowed to consider characteristics that would otherwise be discriminatory if they are bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ).  For example, a manufacturer of men's clothing may lawfully advertise for male models.

===Religious employment discrimination===
“[[Religious discrimination]] is treating individuals differently in their employment because of their [[religion]], their religious beliefs and practices, and/or their request for accommodation (a change in a workplace rule or policy) of their religious beliefs and practices. It also includes treating individuals differently in their employment because of their lack of religious belief or practice” ([[Workplace Fairness]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.workplacefairness.org/religious-discrimination|title=Religious Discrimination - Workplace Fairness|website=www.workplacefairness.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> According to The U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], employers are prohibited from refusing to hire an individual based on their religion- alike race, sex, age, and disability. If an employee believes that they have experienced religious discrimination, they should address this to the alleged offender. On the other hand, employees are protected by the law for reporting job discrimination and are able to file charges with the EEOC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/qanda_religion.html|title=Questions and Answers about Religious Discrimination in the Workplace|date=2011-01-31|website=www.eeoc.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> Some locations in the U.S. now have clauses that ban discrimination against atheists. The courts and laws of the United States give certain exemptions in these laws to businesses or institutions that are religious or religiously-affiliated, however, to varying degrees in different locations, depending on the setting and the context; some of these have been upheld and others reversed over time.

===Members of the Communist Party===

[[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] explicitly permits discrimination against members of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]].

===Military===

The military has faced criticism for prohibiting women from serving in combat roles. In 2016, however, the law was amended to allow them to serve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/us/women-combat-us-military/index.html|title=Get ready for more US women in combat|author=Thom Patterson|website=CNN|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref>http://www.militaryaerospace.com/blogs/mil-aero-blog/2012/12/conspicuous-gallantry-doris-miller-at-pearl-harbor-was-one-of-world-war-ii-s-first-heroes.html

In the article posted on the PBS website, Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes about the way in which black men were treated in the military during the 1940s. According to Gates, during that time the whites gave the African Americans a chance to prove themselves as Americans by having them participate in the war. The National Geographic website states, however, that when black soldiers joined the Navy, they were only allowed to work as servants; their participation was limited to the roles of mess attendants, stewards, and cooks. Even when African Americans wanted to defend the country they lived in, they were denied the power to do so.

==Unintentional discrimination==
{{Main|Adverse impact}}

Employment practices that do not directly discriminate against a protected category may still be illegal if they produce a disparate impact on members of a protected group.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment practices that have a discriminatory impact, unless they are related to job performance.

<blockquote>The Act requires the elimination of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment that operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of race, and, if, as here, an employment practice that operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, it is prohibited, notwithstanding the employer's lack of discriminatory intent.<ref name="Griggs">{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/401/424.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref></blockquote>

However, when defending against a disparate impact claim that alleges [[age discrimination]], an employer does not need to demonstrate necessity; rather, it must simply show that its practice is reasonable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
