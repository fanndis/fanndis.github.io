'''Volodymyr Mykhailovych Lytvyn''' ({{lang-uk|Володи́мир Миха́йлович Литви́н}}, {{IPA-uk|woloˈdɪmɪr mɪˈxɑjlowɪtʃ lɪtˈwɪn|IPA}}; born April 28, 1956) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[politician]] best known for being [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada]], the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]]. Having previously served in that position from 2002 until 2006, he was re-elected in December 2008 after his party agreed to join the former coalition of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] in an expanded capacity and stayed Chairman till December 2012.<ref name=VRVRCR/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/.stm }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> From 1994 to 1999, Lytvyn was the aide to President [[Leonid Kuchma]] and, later, the head of his [[Office of the President of Ukraine|office]].

==Early biography and private life==

Lytvyn was born in Sloboda-Romanivska village in the [[Novohrad-Volynskyi]] [[Raion]] of the [[Zhytomyr Oblast]]. Lytvyn graduated from the [[Kyiv University]] (Faculty of History) in 1978. In 1984, he defended his dissertation "Efforts of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]] in improving the preparation of teachers in social disciplines".

Lytvyn started his career at the Kyiv State University (1978−86), then he worked as Head of Directorate in the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Vocational Training of the Ukrainian SSR (1986−89). Between 1989 and 1991 he worked as a [[political science|political analyst]] at the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]], the Ukrainian branch of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]].

Lytvyn is a correspondent member of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], Honored Worker of Sciences and Technology of Ukraine. However, in 2002 he was publicly and reasonably accused of plagiarizing a Western scholar when writing his article to [[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] newspaper.

He is married to Tetyana Kostyantynivna (born 1960), an economist. Their daughter Olena (born 1982) is a [[Beauty salon|beauty industry]] entrepreneur, and their son Ivan (born 1989)  is a student.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Lytvyn's hobbies include reading, [[Association football|football]], and taking care of [[Dalmatian (dog)|dalmatian]] dogs.

==Political career==
In 1994, Lytvyn became the aide to the newly elected [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]].<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/57069/ Lytvyn manages to keep foothold in power despite his close ties to Kuchma, questions about his past], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 14, 2010)</ref> In 1999, he was appointed as the head of the [[Secretariat of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Administration]]. During the [[Cassette Scandal]] audiotapes were released on which Kuchma, Lytvyn and other top-level administration officials are allegedly heard discussing the need to silence [[Georgiy Gongadze]] for his online news reports about high-level corruption.<ref name=KP>[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/45690 Key suspect in Gongadze murder arrested; Pukach allegedly strangled journalist, but who gave the order? (UPDATED)], [[Kyiv Post]], (July 22, 2009)</ref> Gongadze's decapitated body was found in the suburbs of [[Kyiv]] in November 2000.<ref name=KP/>

===Parliamentary career===
[[File:Lyty + Demi.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Lytvyn meeting with [[Russia]]n [[President of Russia|President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in December 2008.]]

In 2002, Lytvyn was elected to Verkhovna Rada as the head of the party bloc [[For United Ukraine]] ("Za edynu Ukrainu"). He became the [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada]] ([[speaker (politics)|speaker]]) of the legislature as a compromising figure among the parliamentary factions.

Lytvyn refused to take part in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|presidential election of 2004]] despite his significant political influence.

Lytvyn's brother, Mykola Lytvyn was the chief of [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine|Ukraine's Border Guard]].

Lytvyn is known for his [[irony|ironic]] political expressions. One of his best-known sentences is "I do not protest at forming an artificial [[majority]] in our parliament. But I want this majority to include every member of parliament."

At the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on March 26, 2006, his [[Lytvyn's People's Bloc]] won 2.44% of the popular vote and no seats since it did not meet the 3 percent threshold. Lytvyn's allies (together with other parties) declared the voting results forged, filing a court suit and starting a public campaign. However, Lytvyn himself avoids press and shows deep disappointment since the results announced. Elected vice-chairman NAN.

In the [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|early parliamentary election]] held on September 30, 2007, the [[Lytvyn Bloc]] (renamed from Lytvyn's People's Bloc) consisted of the [[People's Party (Ukraine)|People's Party]] and the [[Labour Party of Ukraine|Labour Party]]. The bloc placed fifth<ref>

===2010 presidential election, and 2012–14 parliamentary elections===
On December 6, 2009, [[Mykola Melnychenko]], former bodyguard to Kuchma, accused Lytvyn of ordering the murder of journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]] in 2000. A spokesperson for Lytvyn dismissed the claims as part of the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]] campaign.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/54544/ Former guard accuses parliament speaker of Gongadze murder], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 8, 2009)</ref> During the election Lytvyn received 2,35% of the votes.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://gazeta.ua/index.php?id=324402 ЦВК оприлюднила офіційні результати 1-го туру виборів], Gazeta.ua (January 25, 2010)</ref>

Lytvyn took part in the [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] as a [[People's Party (Ukraine)|People's Party]] candidate in [[single-member districts]] number 65 ([[first-past-the-post]] wins a parliament seat) located in [[Narodychi Raion]].<ref>{{in lang|uk}}[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP033?PT001F01=900&pf7331=65 Одномандатний виборчий округ №65 ''Single-mandate constituency № 65''], [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]]</ref><ref>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/60083 Strange Familiar Faces], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (15 September 2012)</ref> He won a parliamentary seat by winning this [[constituency]].<ref name=Ukrelct2012resCECU>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vnd2012/wp300pt001f01=900.html Proportional votes]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030000000/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vnd2012/wp300pt001f01%3D900.html |date=October 30, 2012 }} & [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vnd2012/wp039pt001f01=900.html Constituency seats]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105073259/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vnd2012/wp039pt001f01%3D900.html |date=November 5, 2012 }}, [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]]</ref> Lytvyn did not join any parliamentary faction after taking his seat.<ref name="LIGAB Volodymyr Lytvyn">{{in lang|ru}}'''/(website has automatic [[Google Translate]] option)''' [http://file.liga.net/person/599-vladimir-litvin.html Short biography of Volodymyr Lytvyn], LIGA</ref>

==Gongadze murder==
In 2000, Melnychenko released a secretly-taped recording allegedly of a conversation between Kuchma and Lytvyn in which the two discussed getting rid of Gongadze. Lytvyn is alleged to have said that Kuchma should "let loose [Interior Minister] [[Yuriy Kravchenko|Kravchenko]] to use alternative methods" on Gongadze. Lytvyn denied the allegation, saying that the tape was a fabrication. Independent experts who have analysed the tapes are divided as to their authenticity. Gongadze was found beheaded in a shallow grave in 2000. In 2005, Kravchenko was found dead with two bullets in his head. Official investigations concluded that he had committed suicide and that he had ordered Gongadze's murder. Lytvyn stated "The investigation confirmed my innocence in this case, despite the fact that efforts have been, are being and will be taken to make me practically the main person accused [of killing the journalist]".<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/alexa-chopivsky/ukraine-don%25E2%2580%2599t-ask-who-killed-georgiy-gongadze ''Ukraine: don’t ask who killed Georgiy Gongadze''], Opendemocracy.net</ref>

During the trial of [[Oleksiy Pukach]], Pukach claimed that (former) [[Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] and Lytvyn (at the time of the murder Kuchma's head of his [[Presidential Administration of Ukraine|Presidential Administration]]) had ordered the murder of Gongadze.<ref name=KPR29113PGC>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/court-gives-pukach-life-sentence-for-murdering-gongadze-disregards-contract-murder-319519.html Court sentences Pukach to life for murdering Gongadze, disregards claims against Kuchma, Lytvyn], [[Kyiv Post]] (29 January 2013)<br />[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/29/ukraine-gongadze-sentence-idUSL5N0AYEEJ20130129 Ukraine police officer accuses ex-president after being jailed for life], [[Reuters]] (29 January 2013)<br />[http://news.liga.net/video/politics/803761-ubiytsa_gongadze_ukazal_na_kuchmu_i_litvina_video_iz_suda.htm Gongadze killer pointed on Kuchma and Lytvyn].
