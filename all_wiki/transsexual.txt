The term 'transgender' is a word employed by activists to encompass as many groups of gender diverse people as possible. However, many of these groups individually don't identify with the term. Many health clinics and services set up to serve gender variant communities employ the term, however most of the people using these services again don't identify with this term. The rejection of this political category by those that it is designed to cover clearly illustrates the difference between self-identification and categories that are imposed by observers to understand other people.}}</ref> A medical diagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]] can be made if a person expresses a desire to live and be accepted as a member of their identified sex<ref name="icd-10">{{cite web|title=ICD-10|url=https://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/gF60.htm#F640|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921055034/http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/gf60.htm|archive-date=September 21, 2008|access-date=2008-09-28}}</ref><!-- ICD 2016 is here: http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F64.0 but does not support the claim--> and if a person experiences impaired functioning or [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] as a result of their gender identity.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">{{Cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (Text Revision)|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1930, Hirschfeld supervised the second genital reassignment surgery to be reported in detail in a peer-reviewed journal, that of [[Lili Elbe]] of [[Denmark]]. In 1923, Hirschfeld introduced the (German) term "Transsexualismus",<ref>Hirschfeld, Magnus; "Die intersexuelle Konstitution" in ''Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen'' 1923.</ref> after which [[David Oliver Cauldwell]] introduced "transsexualism" and "transsexual" to English in 1949 and 1950.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cauldwell, David Oliver|author-link=D.

{{quote|True transsexuals feel that they belong to the other sex, they want to be and function as members of the opposite sex, not only to appear as such.

Benjamin suggested that moderate intensity male to female transsexual people may benefit from estrogen medication as a "substitute for or preliminary to operation."<ref name="benjaminscale"/> Some people have had [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS) but do not meet the above definition of transsexual.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Other people do not desire SRS although they meet the other elements of Benjamin's definition of a "true transsexual".{{cn|date=February 2020}} Transsexuality was included for the first time in the [[DSM-III]] in 1980 and again in the [[DSM-III-R]] in 1987, where it was located under ''Disorders Usually First Evident in Infancy, Childhood or Adolescence''.

Beyond Benjamin's work, which focused on male-to-female transsexual people, there are cases of the female to male transsexual, for whom genital surgery may not be practical. Benjamin gave certifying letters to his MTF transsexual patients that stated "Their anatomical sex, that is to say, the body, is male. Their psychological sex, that is to say, the mind, is female." After 1967{{clarify|date=August 2020}}, Benjamin abandoned his early terminology and adopted that of "gender identity."<ref name="ekins2006">{{cite book|last=Ekins|first=Richard|title=The Transgender Phenomenon|author2=King, Dave|publisher=SAGE|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7619-7164-1|location=London}}</ref>

=== Relationship to ''transgender'' ===
The term ''transgender'' was coined by John Oliven in 1965.<ref name="Bevan"/> By the 1990s, ''transsexual'' had come to be considered a subset of the [[umbrella term]] ''[[transgender]]''.<ref name="TR2006"/><ref name="Bevan"/><ref name="Alegria"/> The term ''transgender'' is now more common, and many transgender people prefer the designation ''transgender'' and reject ''transsexual''.<ref name="Polly">R Polly, J Nicole, ''Understanding the transsexual patient: culturally sensitive care in emergency nursing practice'', in the ''[[Advanced Emergency Nursing Journal]]'' (2011): "The use of terminology by transsexual individuals to self-identify varies. As aforementioned, many transsexual individuals prefer the term transgender, or simply trans, as it is more inclusive and carries fewer stigmas. There are some transsexual individuals[,] however, who reject the term transgender; these individuals view transsexualism as a treatable congenital condition. Following medical and/or surgical transition, they live within the binary as either a man or a woman and may not disclose their transition history."</ref><ref name="Swanson">A Swenson, ''Medical Care of the Transgender Patient'', in ''Family Medicine'' (2014): "While some transsexual people still prefer to use the term to describe themselves, many transgender people prefer the term transgender to transsexual."</ref><ref name="GLAAD Media Reference Guide">{{cite web|date=2011-09-09|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide|url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender|access-date=2013-12-27}}</ref> The term ''transsexual'', however, continues to be used,<ref name="Pauly">{{cite journal|last=Pauly MD|first=Ira B.|date=28 May 1993|title=Terminology and Classification of Gender Identity Disorders|url=http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=DPRJKLWKVGB58LR50W0AD29WXCGU5XC7&ID=77620|journal=Journal of Psychology & Human Sexuality|volume=5|issue=4|pages=1–12|doi=10.1300/J056v05n04_01|issn=0890-7064|access-date=2007-02-26}}</ref> and some people who pursue medical assistance (for example, [[sex reassignment surgery]]) to change their sexual characteristics to match their gender identity prefer the designation ''transsexual'' and reject ''transgender''.<ref name="Polly" /><ref name="Swanson" /><ref name="GLAAD Media Reference Guide" /> One perspective offered by transsexual people who reject a transgender label for that of ''transsexed'' is that, for people who have gone through sexual reassignment surgery, their anatomical sex has been altered, whilst their gender remains constant.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McGuinness|first1=S|last2=Alghrani|first2=A|date=2008|title=Gender and parenthood: the case for realignment|url=https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/gender-and-parenthood(a58f6bfe-0d1a-45e5-99f8-b0c0ee37eaab).html|journal=Medical Law Review|volume=16|issue=2|pages=261–83|doi=10.1093/medlaw/fwn010|pmid=18441087}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Whittle|first1=S|url=https://archive.org/details/respectequalityt00whit|title=Respect and Equality: Transsexual and Transgender Rights|date=2002|publisher=Cavendish|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/respectequalityt00whit/page/n31 7]|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Alex|date=2012|title=Non-binary Gender Concepts and the Evolving Legal Treatment of UK Transsexed Individuals: A Practical Consideration of the Possibilities of Butler|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol13/iss6/6|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=13|issue=6|pages=57–71}}</ref>

Historically, one reason some people preferred ''transsexual'' to ''transgender'' is that the medical community in the 1950s through the 1980s encouraged a distinction between the terms that would only allow the former access to medical treatment.<ref name="denny">{{cite book|last=Denny|first=Dallas|title=Transgender Rights|year=2006|editor-last=Currah|editor-first=Paisley|chapter=Chapter 9: Transgender Communities of the United States in the Late Twentieth Century}}</ref> Other self-identified transsexual people state that those who do not seek sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are fundamentally different from those who do, and that the two have different concerns,<ref name="Ts-Si_Gaughan"/> but this view is controversial, and others argue that merely having some medical procedures does not have such far-reaching consequences as to put those who have them and those who have not (e.g. because they cannot afford them) into such distinctive categories. Some have objected to the term ''transsexual'' on the basis that it describes a condition related to [[gender identity]] rather than [[sexuality]].<ref name="Fenway Health Glossary">{{cite web |date=January 2010 |publisher=Fenway Health |location=Boston, Mass. |title=Glossary of Gender and Transgender Terms |url=http://www.fenwayhealth.org/site/DocServer/Handout_7-C_Glossary_of_Gender_and_Transgender_Terms__fi.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019120607/http://www.fenwayhealth.org/site/DocServer/Handout_7-C_Glossary_of_Gender_and_Transgender_Terms__fi.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2013 |page=15}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=November 2020}} For example, [[Christine Jorgensen]], the first person widely known to have sex reassignment surgery (in this case, [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|male-to-female]]), rejected ''transsexual'' and instead identified herself in newsprint as ''trans-gender'', on this basis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Jerry|date=October 18, 1979|title=Christine Recalls Life as Boy from the Bronx|newspaper=Newsday/Winnipeg Free Press|url=http://research.cristanwilliams.com/2011/08/21/christine-jorgensen-transgender-woman/|access-date=28 May 2012|quote="If you understand trans-genders," she says, (the word she prefers to transsexuals), "then you understand that gender doesn’t have to do with bed partners, it has to do with identity."}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=May 11, 1982|title=News From California: 'Transgender'|pages=A–10|newspaper=Appeal-Democrat/Associate Press|url=http://research.cristanwilliams.com/2012/02/06/1982-transgenders-transsexuals-christine-jorgensen/|access-date=28 May 2012|quote=she describes people who have had such operations’ "transgender" rather than transsexual. "Sexuality is who you sleep with, but gender is who you are," she explained}}</ref>

=== Terminological variance ===
The word ''transsexual'' is most often used as an adjective rather than a noun&nbsp;– a "transsexual person" rather than simply "a transsexual".{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} {{As of|2018}}, use of the noun form (e.g. referring to people as ''transsexuals'') is often deprecated by those in the transsexual community.<ref name="OED">{{cite OED |term=transsexual, adj. and n. |id=205059 |edition=3rd |date=March 2018}}</ref> Like other trans people, transsexual people prefer to be referred to by the gender pronouns and terms associated with their gender identity. For example, a trans man is a person who was assigned the female sex at birth on the basis of his [[Sex organ|genitals]], but despite that assignment, identifies as a man and is transitioning or has transitioned to a male gender role; in the case of a ''transsexual'' man, he furthermore has or will have a masculine body. Transsexual people are sometimes referred to with directional terms, such as "female-to-male" for a transsexual man, abbreviated to "F2M", "FTM", and "F to M", or "male-to-female" for a transsexual woman, abbreviated "M2F", "MTF" and "M to F".

Individuals who have undergone and completed sex reassignment surgery are sometimes referred to as ''transsexed'' individuals;<ref>{{cite web|title=Journal of International Women's Studies: ...Treatment of UK Transsexed Individuals...|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=jiws|website=bridgew.edu}}</ref> however, the term ''transsexed'' is not to be confused with the term ''transsexual'', which can also refer to individuals who have not yet undergone SRS, and whose anatomical sex (still) does not match their psychological sense of personal gender identity.

The terms ''gender dysphoria'' and ''gender identity disorder'' were not used until the 1970s,<ref name="Pauly" /> when Laub and Fisk published several works on transsexualism using these terms.<ref name="Laub">{{Cite journal|last=Laub|first=D.

Fisk|date=April 1974|title=A rehabilitation program for gender dysphoria syndrome by surgical sex change|journal=Plast Reconstr Surg|volume=53|issue=4|pages=388–403|doi=10.1097/00006534-197404000-00003|pmid=4592953|s2cid=42739374}}</ref><ref name="Fisk">{{Cite journal|last=Fisk|first=N.|year=1974|editor2=Gandy P.|title=Gender Dysphoria Syndrome|journal=Proceedings of the Second Interdisciplinary Symposium on Gender Dysphoria Syndrome|pages=7–14|editor=Laub, D.}}</ref> "Transsexualism" was replaced in the [[DSM-IV]] by "gender identity disorder in adolescents and adults".

Male-to-female transsexualism has sometimes been called "Harry Benjamin's syndrome" after the endocrinologist who pioneered the study of dysphoria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aggrawal|first=Anil|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|year=2008}}</ref> As the present-day medical study of gender variance is much broader than Benjamin's early description, there is greater understanding of its aspects,<ref name="ekins2006"/> and use of the term ''Harry Benjamin's syndrome'' has been criticized for delegitimizing gender-variant people with different experiences.<ref>Labonte, Richard and Lawrence Schimel, eds.

=== Surgical status ===
Several terms are in common use, especially within the community itself relating to the surgical or operative status of someone who is transsexual, depending on whether they have already had [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS), have not had SRS but still intend to, or do not intend to have SRS. They are, post-op, pre-op, and non-op, respectively.<ref name="Girshick-2009">{{cite book|last=Girshick|first=Lori B.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCPC96leH7UC&pg=PA16|title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men|date=15 September 2009|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=978-1-58465-838-2|location=Hanover|page=16|oclc=929272452}}</ref>

The previous version, ICD-10, had incorporated ''transsexualism'', ''dual role transvestism,'' and ''gender identity disorder of childhood'' into its [[gender identity disorder]] category. It defined transsexualism as "[a] desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex."

Historically, transsexualism has also been included in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM). With the [[DSM-5]], transsexualism was removed as a diagnosis, and a diagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]] was created in its place.<ref name="DSM-V">{{Cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-0-89042-554-1|url-access=registration}}</ref> This change was made to reflect the consensus view by members of the APA that transsexuality is not in and of itself a disorder and that transsexual people should not be stigmatized unnecessarily.<ref>http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf</ref> By including a diagnosis for gender dysphoria, transsexual people are still able to access medical care through the process of transition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

=== Sex reassignment therapy ===
{{Main|Sex reassignment therapy}}

''Sex reassignment therapy'' (SRT) is an umbrella term for all medical treatments related to sex reassignment of both transgender and [[intersex]] people.
Individuals make different choices regarding sex reassignment therapy, which may include [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|female-to-male]] or [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|male-to-female]] [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT) to modify [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, [[sex reassignment surgery]] (such as [[orchiectomy]]) to alter [[primary sex characteristics]], chest surgery such as [[Mastectomy|top surgery]] or [[breast augmentation]], or, in the case of trans women, a [[trachea shave]], [[facial feminization surgery]] or [[epilation|permanent hair removal]].

To obtain sex reassignment therapy, transsexual people are generally required to undergo a psychological evaluation and receive a diagnosis of gender identity disorder in accordance with the Standards of Care (SOC) as published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.<ref name="WPATH web" /> This assessment is usually accompanied by counseling on issues of adjustment to the desired gender role, effects and risks of medical treatments, and sometimes also by psychological therapy.  The SOC are intended as guidelines, not inflexible rules, and are intended to ensure that clients are properly informed and in sound psychological health, and to discourage people from [[Transitioning (transgender)|transition]]ing based on unrealistic expectations.

==== Gender roles and transitioning ====
After an initial psychological evaluation, trans men and trans women may begin medical treatment, starting with hormone replacement therapy<ref name="WPATHSOCs"/><ref name="Gooren">{{cite journal|last1=Gooren|first1=LJ|last2=Giltay|first2=EJ|last3=Bunck|first3=MC|year=2008|title=Long-term treatment of transsexuals with cross-sex hormones: extensive personal experience|journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab|volume=93|issue=1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1210/jc.2007-1809|pmid=17986639|doi-access=free}}</ref> or hormone blockers. In these cases, people who change their gender are usually required to live as members of their target gender for at least one year prior to genital surgery, gaining [[Real-life experience (transgender)|real-life experience]], which is sometimes called the "real-life test" (RLT).<ref name="WPATHSOCs"/> Transsexual individuals may undergo some, all, or none of the medical procedures available, depending on personal feelings, health, income, and other considerations. Some people posit that transsexualism is a physical condition, not a psychological issue, and assert that sex reassignment therapy should be given on request. (Brown 103)

Like other trans people, transsexual people may refer to themselves as trans men or trans women. Transsexual people desire to establish a permanent gender role as a member of the gender with which they identify, and many transsexual people pursue medical interventions as part of the process of expressing their gender. The entire process of switching from one physical sex and social gender presentation to another is often referred to as transitioning, and usually takes several years. Transsexual people who transition usually change their social gender roles, [[legal name]]s and legal sex designation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Not all transsexual people undergo a physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, the expense of surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the use of hormones or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary gender role. Others may find balance at a midpoint during the process, regardless of whether or not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they are comfortable with their own genitals, or because they are concerned about nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of [[phalloplasty]], which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results.<!-- NOTE: All of this phalloplasty content is sourced after the metoidioplasty comparison.--> For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men.<!-- NOTE: All of this phalloplasty content is sourced after the metoidioplasty comparison.--> By contrast, [[metoidioplasty]], which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.<ref name="Teich">{{cite book|last=Teich|first=Nicholas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdA7AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA55|title=Transgender 101: A Simple Guide to a Complex Issue|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0231504270|page=55|quote=Historically, many transmen who have had phalloplasty have not been satisfied with the results. Doctors continue to make improvements to this surgery, but many surgeons in the United States choose not to perform it because of the high risk of complications (severe scarring or fistulas for example), the significant risk of never regaining sensation in the penis or donor sites, and the chance that the result will not be aesthetically pleasing. However, some transmen are satisfied with their results and would choose to do it again if given the choice.|access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Stryker & Whittle">{{cite book|last1=Stryker|first1=Susan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfqOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA353|title=The Transgender Studies Reader|last2=Whittle|first2=Stephen|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2013|isbn=978-1135398842|page=353|quote=In addition, phalloplasty 'cannot produce an organ rich in the sexual feeling of the natural one.'|access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Carroll">{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Janell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy9-BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT132|title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1305446038|page=132|quote=Penises made from phalloplasty cannot achieve a natural erection, so penile implants of some kind are usually used (we will discuss these implants in more detail in Chapter 14). Overall, metoidioplasty is a simpler procedure than phalloplasty, which explains its popularity. It also has fewer complications, takes less time, and is less expensive (e.g., a metoidioplasty takes about 1 to 2 hours and can cost around $15,000 to 20,000, whereas, a phalloplasty can take about 8 hours can cost more than $65,000).|access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref>

Transsexual people can be heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual; many choose the language of how they refer to their sexual orientation based on their gender identity, not their birth [[sex assignment|assigned sex]].<ref name="ekins2006" />

=== Psychological treatment ===
Psychological techniques that attempt to alter gender identity to one considered appropriate for the person's assigned sex are typically ineffective. The widely recognized Standards of Care<ref name="WPATHSOCs" /> note that sometimes the only reasonable and effective course of treatment for transsexual people is to go through sex reassignment therapy.<ref name="WPATHSOCs"/><ref>[http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/88/8/3467 Endocrine Treatment of Transsexual People: A Review of Treatment Regimens, Outcomes, and Adverse Effects], Eva Moore, Amy Wisniewski and Adrian Dobs</ref>

The need for treatment of transsexual people is emphasized by the high rate of [[mental health]] problems, including [[clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], and various [[Substance dependence|addictions]], as well as a higher [[suicide]] rate among untreated transsexual people than in the general population.<ref>{{cite web|date=18 August 2000|title=Transgender Health|url=http://www.metrokc.gov/health/glbt/transgender.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818182316/http://www.metrokc.gov/health/glbt/transgender.htm|archive-date=18 August 2000}}</ref> These problems are alleviated by a change of gender role and/or physical characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Cuypere|first1=Greta|date=2006|title=Long-term follow-up: psychosocial outcome of Belgian transsexuals after sex reassignment surgery|journal=Sexologies|volume=15|issue=2|pages=126–133|doi=10.1016/j.sexol.2006.04.002|quote=...the suicide attempt rate dropped significantly from 29.3% to 5.1%}}</ref>

Many transgender and transsexual activists, and many caregivers, note that these problems are not usually related to the gender identity issues themselves, but the social and cultural responses to gender-variant individuals. Some transsexual people reject the counseling that is recommended by the Standards of Care<ref name="WPATHSOCs"/> because they do not consider their gender identity to be a cause of psychological problems.

Brown and Rounsley<ref>Brown, Mildred L.; Chloe Ann Rounsley (1996). True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism&nbsp;– For Families, Friends, Co-workers, and Helping Professionals. Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|978-0-7879-6702-4}}.</ref> noted that "[s]ome transsexual people acquiesce to legal and medical expectations in order to gain rights granted through the medical/psychological hierarchy." Legal needs, such as a change of sex on legal documents, and medical needs, such as sex reassignment surgery, are usually difficult to obtain without a doctor or therapist's approval. Because of this, some transsexual people feel coerced into affirming outdated concepts of gender to overcome simple legal and medical hurdles (Brown 107).

=== Regrets and detransitions ===
{{See also|Detransition}}
People who undergo sex reassignment surgery can develop regret for the procedure later in life, largely due to lack of support from family or peers, with data from the 1990s suggesting a rate of 3.8%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landén|first=M|author2=Wålinder, J|author3=Hambert, G|author4=Lundström, B.|date=April 1998|title=Factors predictive of regret in sex reassignment|journal=[[Acta Psychiatr Scand]]|volume=97|issue=4|pages=284–9|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1998.tb10001.x|pmid=9570489|s2cid=19652697}}</ref><ref>For examples see Jill Stark, [http://www.theage.com.au/national/i-will-never-be-able-to-have-sex-again-ever-20090530-br41.html#ixzz2AjKMBl67 'I will never be able to have sex again.

A 2010 meta-study, based on 28 previous long-term studies of transsexual men and women, found that the overall psychological functioning of transsexual people after transition was similar to that of the general population and significantly better than that of untreated transsexual people.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Murad|first1=Mohammad|last2=Elamin|first2=Mohomed|last3=Garcia|first3=Magaly|last4=Mullan|first4=Rebecca|last5=Murad|first5=Ayman|last6=Erwin|first6=Patricia|last7=Montori|first7=Victor|date=2010|title=Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of quality of life and psychosocial outcomes|journal=Clinical Endocrinology|volume=72|issue=2|pages=214–231|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03625.x|pmid=19473181|s2cid=19590739}}</ref>

== Incidence and prevalence ==
[[Prevalence]] is the proportion of a population found to be affected by a condition. It is usually expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or as the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people.  [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is a measure of new cases arising in a population over a given period (per year, etc.).

The difference between prevalence and incidence in this context can be summarized thus: prevalence answers "How many people are transsexual right now?" and incidence answers "How many people were identified as transsexual this year?"

=== Incidence ===
A 1996 study of Swedes estimated an incidence of transsexualism of 0.17 per {{formatnum:100000}} inhabitants per year, and a sex ratio (male:female) of 1.4:1 for those trans men and trans women requesting sex reassignment surgery and a ratio of 1:1 for those who proceeded.<ref name="sept2207">{{cite journal|last1=Landén|first1=M.|last2=Wålinder|first2=J.|last3=Lundstrom|first3=B.|year=1996|title=Incidence and sex ratio of transsexualism in Sweden|journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]]|volume=93|issue=4|pages=261–263|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1996.tb10645.x|pmid=8712025|quote=...Results: During the 20-year period of the study, 233 requests for sex reassignment were processed, and the incidence data were calculated on the basis of this group. This means that the average annual frequency was 11.6 cases. The number of inhabitants in Sweden over 15 years of age increased during the study period from 6.5&nbsp;million to 7.1&nbsp;million, i.e. there was a mean population of 6.8&nbsp;million (12), which gives an annual incidence of request for sex reassignment of 0.17 per {{formatnum:100000}} inhabitants. The sex ratio (male:female) is 1.4 :1. To resolve the question of whether transsexualism increases or decreases, we divided the group into two 10-year periods. As can be seen from Table 1, not only do our results agree with the Swedish incidence data published in the 1970s, but also they remain remarkably stable over time. Separating from all applications the group with primary transsexualism yielded 188 cases, i.e. 9.4 cases annually. As is shown in Table 2, this corresponds to an incidence of primary transsexualism of 0.14 per {{formatnum:100000}} inhabitants over 15 years of age. It should also be noted that primary transsexualism is equally common in women and men...|s2cid=145126158}}</ref>

Estimates of the [[prevalence]] of transsexual people are highly dependent on the specific case definitions used in the studies, with prevalence rates varying by orders of magnitude.<ref name="jsm.jsexmed.org">[http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(16)00133-8/abstract Collin, Lindsay, et al.

In the United States, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-V 2013) gives the following estimates: "For natal adult males [MTF], prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for natal females [FTM], from 0.002% to 0.003%." It states, however, that these are likely underestimates since the figures are based on referrals to specialty clinics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/454|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425541|edition=5th|location=Washington, D.C.|page=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/454 454]}}</ref>

The Amsterdam Gender Dysphoria Clinic over four decades has treated roughly 95% of Dutch transsexual clients, and it suggests (1997) a prevalence of 1:10,000 among assigned males and 1:30,000 among assigned females.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=van Kesteren|first1=Paul J.

Olyslager and [[Lynn Conway|Conway]] presented a paper<ref>{{Cite document|last1=Olyslager|first1=Femke|last2=Conway|first2=Lynn|year=2007|title=On the Calculation of the Prevalence of Transsexualism|url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Prevalence/Reports/Prevalence%20of%20Transsexualism.pdf}}</ref> at the WPATH 20th International Symposium (2007) arguing that the data from their own and other studies actually imply much higher prevalence, with minimum lower bounds of 1:4,500 male-to-female transsexual people and 1:8,000 female-to-male transsexual people for a number of countries worldwide. They estimate the number of post-op women in the US to be 32,000 and obtain a figure of 1:2500 male-to-female transsexual people. They further compare the annual incidences of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and male birth in the U.S. to obtain a figure of 1:1000 MTF transsexual people and suggest a prevalence of 1:500 extrapolated from the rising rates of SRS in the US and a "common sense" estimate of the number of undiagnosed transsexual people. Olyslager and Conway also argue that the US population of assigned males having already undergone reassignment surgery by the top three US SRS surgeons alone is enough to account for the entire transsexual population implied by the 1:10,000 prevalence number, yet this excludes all other US SRS surgeons, surgeons in countries such as Thailand, Canada, and others, and the high proportion of transsexual people who have not yet sought treatment, suggesting that a prevalence of 1:10,000 is too low.

Of studies assessing self-reported transgender identity, prevalence was 355 (95% CI = 144–566), equal to 1 in 282. However, a single outlier study would have influenced the result to 871 (95% CI = 519–1,224), equal to 1 in 115; this study was removed. "Significant heterogeneity was observed in most analyses."<ref name="jsm.jsexmed.org" />

== Society and culture ==
A number of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] cultures have traditional social and ceremonial roles for individuals who do not fit into the usual roles for males and females in that culture. These roles can vary widely between tribes, because gender roles, when they exist at all, also vary considerably among different Native cultures. However, a modern, [[pan-Indian]] status known as [[Two-Spirit]] has emerged among LGBT Natives in recent years.<ref name="Gilley">Gilley, Brian Joseph (2006: 8).

Laws regarding changes to the legal status of transsexual people are different from country to country. Some jurisdictions allow an individual to [[name change|change their name]], and sometimes, their legal gender, to reflect their gender identity. Within the US, some states allow amendments or complete replacement of the original birth certificates.<ref name="transgenderlaw.org">{{cite web|title=The Transgender Law and Policy Institute: Home Page|url=http://transgenderlaw.org/|access-date=2011-07-06|publisher=Transgenderlaw.org}}</ref> Some states seal earlier records against all but court orders in order to protect the transsexual person's privacy.

In many places, it is not possible to change birth records or other legal designations of sex, although changes are occurring. [[Estelle Asmodelle]]’s book documented her struggle to change the Australian birth certificate and passport laws, although there are other individuals who have been instrumental in changing laws and thus attaining more acceptance for transsexual people in general.

Medical treatment for transsexual and transgender people is available in most Western countries. However, transsexual and transgender people challenge the "normative" gender roles of many cultures and often face considerable hatred and prejudice. The film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' chronicles the case of [[Brandon Teena]], a transsexual man who was raped and murdered after his status was discovered. The project ''Remembering Our Dead'', founded by Gwendolyn Ann Smith, archives numerous cases of transsexual and transgender people being murdered.<ref>[http://www.gender.org/remember/ Remembering Our Dead] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623071009/http://gender.org/remember/|date=2014-06-23}}&nbsp;– a memorial to transgender people who have been murdered</ref> In the United States, November 20 has been set aside as the "Day of Remembrance" for all murdered transgender people.<ref>[http://www.campkc.com/campkc-content.php?Page_ID=760 '' Don't Forget Transgender Day of Rememberance (sic)<!-- PLEASE NOTE that "Rememberance" is deliberately spelled incorrectly here, reflecting the mistake on the external page. -->''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321233502/http://www.campkc.com/campkc-content.php?Page_ID=760|date=2009-03-21}} by Jamie Tyroler, January 18, 2008, Kansas City Camp</ref>

Jurisdictions allowing changes to birth records generally allow [[Transgender marriage|trans people to marry]] members of the opposite sex to their gender identity and to adopt children. Jurisdictions which prohibit [[same sex marriage]] often require pre-transition marriages to be ended before they will issue an amended birth certificate.<ref>{{cite news|date=December 28, 2014|title=When Albert met Ann: 'Ridiculous' marriage laws force transgender divorce|work=The Age|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/when-albert-met-ann-ridiculous-marriage-laws-force-transgender-divorce-20141210-124b8q.html}}</ref>

Sometimes transsexual people have to correct their friends and family members many times before they begin to use the transsexual person's desired pronouns consistently. According to [[Julia Serano]], deliberate mis-gendering of transsexual people is "an arrogant attempt to belittle and humiliate trans people"<ref>Julia Serano, "Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity", Seal press, 2009</ref>

Both "transsexualism" and "gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments" are specifically excluded from coverage under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] Section 12211.<ref>{{cite web|title=Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 - ADA - 42 U.S. Code Chapter 126|url=http://finduslaw.com/americans_with_disabilities_act_of_1990_ada_42_u_s_code_chapter_126#3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227074955/http://finduslaw.com/americans_with_disabilities_act_of_1990_ada_42_u_s_code_chapter_126#3|archive-date=2011-12-27|access-date=2011-07-06|publisher=find US law}}</ref>

==== Employment issues ====
Openly transsexual people can have difficulty maintaining employment. Most find it necessary to remain employed during transition in order to cover the costs of living and transition. However, [[employment discrimination]] against trans people is rampant and many of them are fired when they come out or are involuntarily [[outing|outed]] at work.<ref>[http://www.tsroadmap.com/reality/jobtrans.html Work transition for transsexual women]&nbsp;– TS Road Map</ref> Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job,<ref>[http://www.jessicamckinnon.com/web/Resources/SampleTransitionDocuments/tabid/56/Default.aspx Making a successful transition at work]&nbsp;– helpful guide by [[Jessica McKinnon]] and sample transition-related documents</ref> or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging.<ref>{{harvnb|Pepper|2008}}</ref> Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.

Laws regarding name and gender changes in many countries make it difficult for transsexual people to conceal their trans status from their employers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Jillian Todd|year=2001|title=The Gender Caste System: Identity, Privacy and Heteronormativity|url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Law & Sexuality]]|publisher=Tulane Law School|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070621130831/http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf|archive-date=2007-06-21|access-date=2007-02-25}}</ref> Because the Harry Benjamin Standards of Care requires one-year of real life experience prior to SRS, some feel this creates a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] situation which makes it difficult for trans people to remain employed or obtain SRS.

In many countries, laws provide protection from workplace discrimination based on gender identity or gender expression, including masculine women and feminine men. An increasing number of companies are including "gender identity and expression" in their non-discrimination policies.<ref name="transgenderlaw.org"/><ref>[http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=transgender_issues&template=/TaggedPage/Taggedpagedisplay.cfm&TPLID=26&ContentID=31022 Workplace Discrimination: Gender Identity or Expression] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402211359/http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=transgender_issues&template=%2FTaggedPage%2FTaggedpagedisplay.cfm&TPLID=26&ContentID=31022|date=2012-04-02}}&nbsp;– Human Rights Campaign Foundation</ref> Often these laws and policies do not cover all situations and are not strictly enforced. [[California]]'s [[anti-discrimination law]]s protect transsexual persons in the workplace and specifically prohibit employers from terminating or refusing to hire a person based on their transsexuality. The [[European Union]] provides employment protection as part of gender discrimination protections following the [[European Court of Justice]] decisions in ''[[P v S and Cornwall County Council]]''.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994J0013:EN:HTML Judgment of the Court of 30 April 1996.&nbsp;– P v S and Cornwall County Council.&nbsp;– Reference for a preliminary ruling: Industrial Tribunal, Truro&nbsp;– United Kingdom.&nbsp;– Equal treatment for men and women&nbsp;– Dismissal of a transsexual.&nbsp;– Case C-13/94]&nbsp;– European Court reports 1996 Page I-02143</ref>

=== Stealth ===
Many transsexual men and women choose to live completely as members of their gender without disclosing details of their birth-assigned sex. This approach is sometimes called ''stealth.''{{citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=true, but needs a source}} Stealth transsexuals choose not to disclose their past for numerous reasons, including fear of discrimination and fear of physical violence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Jaime M.|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|last2=Mottet|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Tanis|first3=Justin|last4=Harrison|first4=Jack|last5=Herman|first5=Jody L.|last6=Keisling|first6=Mara|date=2011|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|location=Washington|page=63|access-date=19 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162958/http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|archive-date=6 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  There are examples of people having been denied medical treatment upon discovery of their trans status, whether it was revealed by the patient or inadvertently discovered by the doctors.<ref name="TyraTGR">{{Cite book|last1=Stryker|first1=Susan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBRR1isU-VAC|title=The Transgender Studies Reader|last2=Whittle|first2=Stephen|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=9780415947091|author-link=Susan Stryker|author2-link=Stephen Whittle|access-date=2009-11-24}}</ref>

[[File:Nina Poon threefour Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|thumb|Nina Poon, a transsexual model who has appeared in [[Kenneth Cole Productions|Kenneth Cole]] ads, at the 2010 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].]] Transsexualism was discussed in the mass media as long ago as the 1930s. The American magazine ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' in 1936 devoted an article to what it called "[[Hermaphrodites#Other uses of the term|hermaphrodites]]", treating the subject with sensitivity and not sensationalism.<ref>{{cite news|date=24 Aug 1936|title=Medicine: Change of Sex|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756527-1,00.html|access-date=23 December 2010}}</ref> It described the call by [[Avery Brundage]], who led the American team to the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], that a system be established to examine female athletes for "sex ambiguities"; two athletes changed sex after the Games.

[[Christine Jorgensen]] was a transgender woman who received considerable attention in American mass media in the 1950s. Jorgensen was a former [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] that went to Denmark to receive sex reassignment surgery. Her story appeared in publications including [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and ''[[Newsweek]]''. Other representations of transgender women appeared in mainstream media in the 1950s and 1960s, such as [[Delisa Newton]], Charlotte McLeod, Tamara Rees, and Marta Olmos Ramiro, but Jorgensen received the most attention. Her story was sensationalized, but received positively. In comparison, news articles about Newton, McLeod, Rees, and Ramiro had negative implications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skidmore|first=Emily|year=2011|title=Constructing the "Good Transsexual": Christine Jorgensen, Whiteness, and Heteronormativity in the Mid-Twentieth-Century Press|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=37|issue=2|pages=270–296|jstor=23069901}}</ref>

Aleshia never portrayed a transsexual person, though she appeared in eight Hollywood-produced films, on most of the popular variety shows of the day, including ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', and was a regular on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' and ''[[One Life to Live]]'' before returning to university to teach drama and acting.<ref name="Brevard-2011" /><ref>{{IMDb name|0108087|Aleshia Brevard}}</ref>

[[Thomas Harris]]'s ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|Silence of the Lambs]]'' included a serial killer who considered himself a transsexual. After being turned down for sex reassignment surgery due to not meeting necessary psychological evaluations, he then harvested female bodies to make a feminine suit. In the novel, it is noted that the character is not actually a transsexual; this distinction is made only briefly in the film.<ref>{{IMDb title|0102926|title=Silence of the Lambs}}</ref>

Films depicting transgender issues include: ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]''; ''[[The World According to Garp]]''; ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]''; ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', ''[[All About My Mother]]'' and ''[[The Crying Game]]''. The film ''[[Different for Girls (film)|Different for Girls]]'' is notable for its depiction of a transsexual woman who meets up with, and forms a romantic relationship with, her former best friend from her all-male boarding school. ''[[Ma Vie en Rose]]'' portrays a six-year-old child who is [[Gender variance|gender variant]]. The film ''[[Wild Zero]]'' features Kwancharu Shitichai, a transsexual Thai actor. When the main character is conflicted about falling in love with a "woman who is also a man", [[Guitar Wolf]] tells him "Love knows no race, nationality or gender!"{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Although ''[[Better Than Chocolate]]'' is primarily about the romance of two lesbians, a subplot in the 1999 Canadian film has Judy ([[Peter Outerbridge]]), a [[trans woman]] with a crush on Frances ([[Ann-Marie MacDonald]]), the owner of a lesbian bookstore. The film has a few scenes showing how Judy loses her parents, who are unable to accept her and buy her off with a home as a goodbye forever present.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

''[[Southern Comfort (2001 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' is a 2001 documentary by filmmaker Katie Davis, which follows the final months of the life of [[Robert Eads]], a transsexual man living in Georgia. Eads was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and rejected for treatment by over two dozen doctors due to his transsexuality. The documentary follows Eads and several of his closest friends, a support group of transsexual southerners known as "Southern Comfort". The documentary won several awards, including the Grand Jury Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], First Prize at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], and the Special Audience Award at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|author=LovelyShiksa|date=23 May 2002|title=Southern Comfort (2001)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276515/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt|access-date=29 August 2015|work=IMDb}}</ref>

Two notable films depict transphobic violence based on true events: ''[[Soldier's Girl]]'' (about the relationship between [[Barry Winchell]] and [[Calpernia Addams]], and Winchell's subsequent murder) and ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' (about [[Brandon Teena]]'s murder). Calpernia Addams has appeared in numerous movies and television shows, including the 2005 movie ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]'', in which [[Felicity Huffman]] portrays a transsexual woman.<ref>{{IMDb title|0407265|Transamerica}}</ref>

In fall 2005, the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] aired a documentary series known as ''[[TransGeneration]]''. This series focused on four transsexual college students, including two trans women and two trans men, in various stages of transition.<ref>{{IMDb title|0461110|TransGeneration}}</ref> In February 2006, [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] aired ''Beautiful Daughters'', a documentary film about the first all-trans cast of ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', which included Addams, [[Lynn Conway]], [[Andrea James]], and Leslie Townsend.<ref>[http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/beautiful_daughters/series.jhtml Beautiful Daughters]&nbsp;– [[LOGO (TV channel)]] Documentary</ref> Also in 2006, [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]] aired a movie biography on [[Murder of Gwen Araujo|the murder of "Eddie"/"Gwen" Araujo]] called ''[[A Girl Like Me: The Gwen Araujo Story]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Transsexual people have also been depicted in popular television shows. In part of the first season of the 1970s t.v. comedy series, ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', Billy Crystal plays [[Jodie Dallas]], a gay man who is about to undergo a sex change in order to legally marry his male lover, who breaks off the relationship just before the surgery.  In ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'', [[David Spade]]'s character meets up with his childhood male friend, who has transitioned to living as a woman. After initially being frightened, he eventually forms sexual attraction to his friend, but is scorned, as he is 'not her type'. In an episode of ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'' Dr. Becker gets an out-of-town visit from an old friend who turns out to have undergone SRS, it plays out very similar to the situations in ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]''. In a 1980s episode of ''[[The Love Boat]]'', [[McKenzie Phillips]] portrays a trans woman who is eventually accepted as a friend by her old high school classmate, series regular [[Fred Grandy]]. In the 1970s on ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', George's Navy buddy Eddie shows up as Edie and is eventually accepted by George.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Dramas including ''[[Law & Order]]'' and ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' have had episodes featuring transsexual characters and actresses. While in Nip/Tuck the role was played by a non-transsexual woman, in Law & Order some were played by professional cross-dressers. ''[[Without a Trace]]'' and ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' have had episodes dealing with violence against transsexual characters. Many transsexual actresses and extras appeared on the CSI episode, "Ch-Ch-Changes," including [[Marci Bowers]] and [[Calpernia Addams]].<ref>{{IMDb name|1679529|Calpernia Addams}}</ref> The trans woman victim, Wendy, was played by [[Sarah Buxton (actress)|Sarah Buxton]], a [[cisgender]] woman. [[Candis Cayne]], a transsexual actress, appeared in ''[[CSI: NY]]'' as a transsexual character.
