'''Wellesley College''' is a [[Private college|private]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]. Founded in 1870 by [[Henry Fowle Durant|Henry]] and Pauline Durant as a [[female seminary]], it is a member of the original [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters Colleges]], an unofficial grouping of elite women's colleges in the northeastern United States. Wellesley's endowment of $2.2&nbsp;billion is the largest out of all women's colleges and the 49th largest among all colleges and universities in the United States in 2019.<ref name=endowment/> 

Wellesley is home to 56 departmental and interdepartmental majors spanning the liberal arts, as well as over 150 student clubs and organizations. Wellesley athletes compete in the [[NCAA Division III]] [[New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference]]. Its 500-acre (200 ha) campus was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Frederick Law Olmstead]] and houses the Davis Museum and a [[Wellesley College Botanic Gardens|Botanic Garden]]. 

Admissions is considered highly selective, with one of the lowest acceptance rates among women's colleges in the country,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ivy League Admissions Stats & Acceptance Rates, Class of 2020|url=https://www.toptieradmissions.com/resources/college-admissions-statistics/ivy-league-admission-statistics-for-class-of-2020/|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Top Tier Admissions|language=en-US}}</ref> and is exclusively restricted to women, though it adopted a more [[transgender]] inclusive admissions policy in 2015. Notable alumnae and affiliates include two [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretaries of State]]; the first female nominee for [[President of the United States]] from a major party; noted academics, journalists, writers, politicians, diplomats, activists, businesspeople, filmmakers, and entertainers; and recipients of [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], [[Tony Award|Tony]], [[Academy Awards|Academy]], and [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] Awards, the [[Nobel Prize]], and the [[Pulitzer Prize]].

==History==
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}
[[Image:Wellesley College 1881.JPG|thumb|Campus of Wellesley College as it appeared circa 1880]]
Wellesley was founded by Pauline and [[Henry Fowle Durant]], believers in educational opportunity for women, who intended that the college should prepare women for "...great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/About/briefhistory.html |title=A Brief History of Wellesley College |publisher=Wellesley College |year=2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622094214/http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/About/briefhistory.html |archive-date=June 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Its charter was signed on March 17, 1870, by Massachusetts Governor [[William Claflin]]. The original name of the college was the Wellesley Female Seminary; its renaming to Wellesley College was approved by the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts legislature]] on March 7, 1873. Wellesley first opened its doors to students on September 8, 1875.  At the time of its founding, Wellesley College's campus was actually situated in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]]; however, in 1880 residents of West Needham voted to secede and in 1881 the area was chartered as a new town, Wellesley.

The first president of Wellesley was [[Ada Howard]]. There have been thirteen more presidents in its history: [[Alice Elvira Freeman Palmer]], [[Helen Almira Shafer]], [[Julia Irvine|Julia Josephine Thomas Irvine]], [[Caroline Hazard]], [[Ellen Fitz Pendleton]], [[Mildred H. McAfee]] (later Mildred McAfee Horton), [[Margaret Clapp]], Ruth M. Adams, [[Barbara W. Newell|Barbara Warne Newell]], [[Nannerl O. Keohane|Nannerl Overholser Keohane]] (later the president of [[Duke University]] from 1993–2004), [[Diana Chapman Walsh]], [[H. Kim Bottomly]], and current president [[Paula Johnson]].

The original architecture of the college consisted of one very large building, College Hall, which was approximately {{convert|150|m|ft}} in length and five stories in height.  It was completed in 1875. The architect was [[Hammatt Billings]]. College Hall was both an academic building and residential building. On March 17, 1914, it was destroyed by fire, the precise cause of which was never officially established. The fire was first noticed by students who lived on the fourth floor near the zoology laboratory. It has been suggested that an electrical or chemical accident in this laboratory—specifically, an electrical incubator used in the breeding of beetles—triggered the fire.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

A group of residence halls known as the Tower Court complex are located on top of the hill where the old College Hall once stood.

After the loss of the Central College Hall in 1914, the college adopted a master plan in 1921 and expanded into several new buildings. The campus hosted a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps|Naval Reserve Officer Training program]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and began to significantly revise its curriculum after the war and through the late 1960s. In 2013 the faculty adopted an [[open-access policy]] to make its scholarship [[open access|publicly accessible]] online.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://roarmap.eprints.org/561/ |title= Wellesley College |work= [[ROARMAP]]: Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies |publisher= [[University of Southampton]] |location= UK |accessdate= July 24, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170714090848/http://roarmap.eprints.org/561/ |archive-date= July 14, 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:Davis Museum at Wellesley College.jpg|thumb|The Davis Museum art collections are open to the public]]
The {{convert|500|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus overlooks Lake Waban and includes evergreen, deciduous woodlands and open meadows. [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]], Boston's preeminent landscape architect at the beginning of the 20th century, described Wellesley's landscape as "not merely beautiful, but with a marked individual character not represented so far as I know on the ground of any other college in the country".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesley.edu/Welcome/HistoricalMaps/maps_main.html |title=Historical Maps |work=Wellesley.edu |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727034458/http://www.wellesley.edu/Welcome/HistoricalMaps/maps_main.html |archivedate=2010-07-27 }}</ref> He also wrote: "I must admit that the exceedingly intricate and complex topography and the peculiarly scattered arrangement of most of the buildings somewhat baffled me".<ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Robert |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2005/11/13/center_of_attention_on_a_centerless_campus/ |title=Center of Attention on a Centerless Campus |work=Boston Globe |date=November 13, 2005 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808115818/http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2005/11/13/center_of_attention_on_a_centerless_campus/ |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The campus is adjacent to the privately owned [[Hunnewell Estates Historic District]], the gardens of which can be viewed from the lake's edge on campus.

The original master plan for Wellesley's campus landscape was developed by Olmsted, [[Arthur Shurcliff]], and [[Ralph Adams Cram]] in 1921. This landscape-based concept represented a break from the architecturally-defined courtyard and quadrangle campus arrangement that was typical of American campuses at the time. The {{convert|720|acre|km2|adj=on}} site's glaciated topography, a series of meadows, and native plant communities shaped the original layout of the campus, resulting in a campus architecture that is integrated into its landscape.

The campus offers multiple housing options, including Tower Court, which was built after College Hall burnt down, the Quad (Quint, including Munger), the “New Dorms”, referring to the east-side dormitories erected in the 1950s, and multiple “Branch Halls”, including both a Spanish and French-speaking house. In total, Wellesley offers 17 different residence halls for students to live in.

The most recent master plan for Wellesley College was completed in 1998 by [[Michael Van Valkenburgh]] Associates. According to the designers, this plan was intended to restore and recapture the original landscape character of the campus that had been partially lost as the campus evolved through the 20th century. In 2011, Wellesley was listed by [[Travel+Leisure]] as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/23|title=America's most beautiful college campuses|newspaper=Travel+Leisure|date=September 2011|access-date=January 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121080558/http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/23|archive-date=January 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1905 [[Andrew Carnegie]] donated $125,000 to build what is now known as Clapp Library, on the condition that the College match the amount for an endowment.  The money was raised by 1907 and construction began June 5, 1909. In 1915 Carnegie gave another $95,446 towards an addition. This renovation added a recreational reading room, offices, archives, a reserve reading room, added space for rare books and additional stacks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.wellesley.edu/fall-2014/rewriting-the-book-on-clapp-library|title=Rewriting the Book on Clapp Library {{!}} Wellesley Magazine|website=magazine.wellesley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424071659/http://magazine.wellesley.edu/fall-2014/rewriting-the-book-on-clapp-library|archive-date=April 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  The building underwent renovations from 1956–1959, that doubled its size. From 1973 to 1975 a major addition was added to the right-hand side of the building.  In 1974 the building was renamed for Margaret Antoinette Clapp, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and member of the 1930 class who served as the 8th college president from 1949–1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellesley.edu/academics/centers/clapplibrary|title=Clapp Library|website=Wellesley College|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424135520/https://www.wellesley.edu/academics/centers/clapplibrary|archive-date=April 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Davis Museum, opened in 1993, was the first building in North America designed by [[Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[Rafael Moneo]], whose notion of the museum as a “treasury” or “treasure chamber” informs its design.  The Davis is at the heart of the arts on the Wellesley campus adjacent to the academic quad and is connected by an enclosed bridge to the Jewett Arts Center, designed by [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]. The collections span from ancient art from around the world to contemporary art exhibitions, and admission is free to the general public.

==Student life==
Approximately 98% of students live on campus. Some cooperative housing is available, including a sustainable living co-op and a French language house located slightly off-campus. Wellesley offers housing for [[Davis Scholar]]s as well, though not for their children or spouses, which is a point of frequent debate on campus.<ref>{{cite web |last=Farrell |first=Elizabeth F. |url=http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i38/38a04001.htm |title=A Pregnant Cause – Student Affairs – The Chronicle of Higher Education |work=Chronicle.com |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614093621/http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i38/38a04001.htm |archive-date=June 14, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The college has five dining halls, one each in Pomeroy, Tower Court, Stone-Davis, and Bates Halls, and another in the Lulu Chow Wang Campus Center. Additional food options on campus include a [[convenience store]]/coffee shop in the Campus Center, a bakery in Claflin Hall, Collins Café outside the movie theater, El Table, a student-run sandwich shop in Founders Hall (an academic building housing many of the humanities classes), and Café Hoop, a student-run cooperative cafe in the basement of the Campus Center that is known for its late hours and queer-friendly environment. Next to Café Hoop is the pub, Punch's Alley, which serves alcohol to those over 21.

For more than 30 years, Wellesley has offered a cross-registration program with [[MIT]]. Students can participate in research at MIT through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).<ref>{{Cite web|title=UROP for Wellesley College Students {{!}} MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program|url=https://urop.mit.edu/research-exploration/urop/options/urop-wellesley-college-students|access-date=2020-11-16|website=urop.mit.edu}}</ref> In recent years, cross-registration opportunities have expanded to include nearby [[Babson College]], [[Brandeis University]], and [[Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering|Olin College of Engineering]]. To facilitate cross-registration, the [[Wellesley College Senate bus]] connects Wellesley to the [[Harvard University]] and MIT campuses in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]; additionally the college also operates a shuttle to the [[Babson College]] and [[Olin College]] campuses. It is also a member of a number of exchange programs with other small colleges, including opportunities for students to study a year at [[Amherst College|Amherst]], [[Connecticut College]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]], [[Smith College|Smith]], [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], and [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = Opportunities at Other Schools|url = http://www.wellesley.edu/academics/theacademicprogram/otherschools|website = Wellesley College|accessdate = 2015-06-25|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626133643/http://www.wellesley.edu/academics/theacademicprogram/otherschools|archive-date = June 26, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>

===Organizations===
The college has approximately 180 student organizations, ranging from cultural and political organizations to community service, publications, [[campus radio]], and [[college athletics|club sports]].

WZLY is the college's campus radio station. It is entirely student-run and plays on 91.5 FM in the town of Wellesley and some surrounding areas. Founded in 1942, it holds claim to the oldest still-running women's college radio station in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2016/01/05/investigating-some-contenders-for-the-oldest-womens-college-radio-station/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218010740/http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2016/01/05/investigating-some-contenders-for-the-oldest-womens-college-radio-station/ |archive-date=December 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wellesley.edu/news/stories/node/18346 |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218010806/https://www.wellesley.edu/news/stories/node/18346 |archive-date=December 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the 80s, it earned the nickname "Electric Ladyland" after the Jimi Hendrix album of the same name.

Wellesley College does not have any [[Sororities|fraternities or sororities]]; it does, however, have a number of societies centered around common academic interests. There are currently six active societies on campus: Alpha Kappa Chi (the "history" society), Alpha Phi Sigma (the "lecture" society), Tau Zeta Epsilon (the "art and music" society), Zeta Alpha (the "literature" society), Agora Society (the "political science" society), and Shakespeare Society. The societies sponsor many lectures and events on campus, and contribute funding to events sponsored by other departments and organizations. They have an application process called "tea-ing", and organize on-campus parties. The majority of students are not members of societies.

Publications on campus include ''Counterpoint'', the monthly journal of campus life; ''The Wellesley News'', the campus newspaper; ''International Relations Council Journal,'' the internationally oriented campus publication; and ''The Wellesley Review'', the literary magazine.

===Athletics===
[[File:Setting up for Quidditch, Wellesley College, Wellesley MA.jpg|thumb|Preparations for a spring game of [[quidditch]]]]
Wellesley fields 13 [[varsity sports]] teams – basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball.  Wellesley does not have a mascot in the traditional sense – its sports teams are referred to both individually and collectively as "the Blue" (the school colors are [[royal blue]] and white). Wellesley's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) is composed of representatives from the athletic and club teams. 

Wellesley is a member of the [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|NCAA Division III]] and the Eastern Conference Athletic Conference (ECAC) and competes primarily as a member of the [[New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference]] (NEWMAC).  Additionally, the fencing team competes as a member of the Northeast Fencing Conference (NFC) and the golf team became an associate member of the Liberty League during the 2012–2013 school year. In 1951 Barbara Bruning won women's individual intercollegiate golf championship (an event conducted by the [[AIAW|Division of Girls' and Women's Sports]] (DGWS) — which later evolved into the current NCAA women's golf championship).

Wellesley is also a member of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] consortium of women's colleges, and participates in competitions in cross-country, volleyball, crew, swimming & diving, squash, and tennis.

Wellesley Athletics is headquartered out of the Keohane Sports Center (the KSC), named for former college president [[Nannerl O. Keohane|Nannerl Keohane]].  Built in 1985, the KSC features a field house, a pool, squash and racquetball courts, a 200m track, a climbing wall, four indoor tennis courts, and various other exercising areas.  It also houses the administrative offices.  The campus also has four outdoor playing fields and an outdoor track, as well as eight outdoor tennis courts and a boathouse.

The Wellesley College Crew Team, affectionately known as "Blue Crew", was founded in 1970 and was the first women's intercollegiate rowing team in the country. In 2016, "Blue Crew" won the [[NCAA Division III Rowing Championship]] as a team for the first time in Wellesley history, with their 1st Varsity boat coming in first place and their 2nd Varsity 8+ boat coming in second place. This historic win marked the first time a team from Wellesley College won a national championship, and also marked the first time a women's college won the NCAA Rowing Championships.

Wellesley also fields club teams in archery, alpine & Nordic skiing, equestrian, ice hockey, rugby, sailing, squash, Ultimate Frisbee, and water polo. Squash was originally a varsity sport but was downgraded to a club sport status in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-22|title=Wellesley College Squash To Compete As A Club Sport Beginning In 2017-18|url=https://www.wellesleyblue.com/sports/wsquash/2016-17/releases/20170320nev8r0|access-date=2020-11-16|website=Wellesley|language=en}}</ref>. In addition, there is a Quidditch team that competes with teams from other colleges and universities in the area.<ref>https://sites.google.com/site/wellesleyquidditch/</ref>

Wellesley has taken home one team national championship (Blue Crew's win at the NCAA Championships in 2016), three individual national champions, and one individual boat champion in its history.  In 1991, Karyn Cooper was the NCAA Tennis Singles Champion. In 2011, Randelle Boots was the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Champion in the mile. In 2015, Maura Sticco-Ivins was the NCAA National Champion in the 3 meter diving competition and runner-up in the 1 meter diving competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmacsports.com/sports/wswimdive/2014-15/releases/Maura_Sticco-Ivins-_Wellesley_-_3-Meter_Dive_Women-s_Champion_--d3swim- |title=Watch Wellesley College's Maura Sticco-Ivins Interview After Winning NCAA DIII 3-Meter Championship |work=NEWMAC: New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference |publisher=Newmacsports.com |date=March 23, 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122071539/http://www.newmacsports.com/sports/wswimdive/2014-15/releases/Maura_Sticco-Ivins-_Wellesley_-_3-Meter_Dive_Women-s_Champion_--d3swim- |archive-date=November 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Sticco-Ivins was named the 2015 NCAA Division III Diver of The Meet.

Additionally, Wellesley College Crew Team's coaching staff (Tessa Spillane, Hannah Woodruff, and Seth Hussey) received the 2015-16 Division III National Coaching Staff of the Year award.

===Traditions===
[[File:Wellesley College Library.jpg|thumb|upright|Wellesley College Library]]
As is the case with all of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]], Wellesley College has many traditions, many of them carried over from the late nineteenth-century. Some have been adapted and modified over time, but the original focus and fun remains.

[[Hoop rolling]] is a highly anticipated annual tradition at the college dating back to 1895.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Releases/2009/042509.html | title = Susan Wang Wins Wellesley's 114th Annual Hoop Rolling Contest | date = April 25, 2009 | author = Wellesley College Office for Public Affairs | publisher = Wellesley College | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516033729/http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Releases/2009/042509.html | archive-date=May 16, 2010 }}</ref> Each upperclasswoman has a wooden hoop, often passed down to her from her "big sister". Before graduation, the seniors, wearing their graduation robes, run a short race while rolling their hoops. The winner of the race is said to be the first woman in her class to achieve success, however she defines it. This was changed after the 1990 Commencement speech by then first lady, Barbara Bush. In the early 20th century, however, the winner was said to be the first in her class to marry; in the 1980s, the winner was said to become the class's first CEO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesley.edu/Welcome/Traditions/hooprolling.html |title=All About Hooprolling |work=Wellesley.edu |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108110054/http://www.wellesley.edu/Welcome/Traditions/hooprolling.html |archivedate=2010-01-08 }}</ref>. The winner is awarded flowers by the president of the College, and then tossed into Lake Waban by her classmates. The tossing of the winner into the lake began several decades ago when a [[Harvard University]] male, dressed as a Wellesley student, won the race. When, upon his victory, it was discovered that he wasn't a Wellesley student, he was thrown into the lake. The night before the race, many "little sisters" will camp out on the racecourse near the Library to save a good starting position for their "big sisters".

Some other traditions include step-singing, dorm and class crew races, "Lake Day", "Spring Week", "Flower Sunday", and "Marathon Monday". Class trees are one of Wellesley's more visible traditions; each graduating class plants a tree during its sophomore year. Class trees, as they are called, can be found all over the campus, marked with each class year on a stone at the base of the tree. During sophomore year, students also design and purchase class sweatshirts.

The Wellesley campus is just before the halfway mark on the [[Boston Marathon]] course, and students come out to cheer runners in what has become known as the "Scream Tunnel".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/wellesley-scream-tunnel-cheers-kisses-and-funny-signs|title=Wellesley Scream Tunnel: Cheers, Kisses, and Funny Signs|date=2017-04-17|work=Runner's World|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430051140/https://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/wellesley-scream-tunnel-cheers-kisses-and-funny-signs|archive-date=April 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  Student have been cheering on runners since the first running of the marathon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/about/collegehistory/traditions/marathonmonday|title=Marathon Monday|website=Wellesley College|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430113839/http://www.wellesley.edu/about/collegehistory/traditions/marathonmonday|archive-date=April 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  In 1966 the school heard word that a woman was running in the race and turned out in numbers in cheer her on. [[Bobbi Gibb]] claims to have heard them from half a mile away. The women ran out into the road and raised their arms to form a tunnel. [[Diana Chapman Walsh]], who would later serve as Wellesley president from 1993 to 2007 was present for the 1966 race. “The word spread to all of us lining the route that a woman was running the course. We scanned face after face in breathless anticipation until a ripple of recognition shot through the lines and we cheered as we never had before. We let out a roar that day, sensing that this woman had done more than just break the gender barrier in a famous race.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/first-lady-of-boston|title=First Lady of Boston|date=2016-04-06|work=Runner's World|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430051150/https://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/first-lady-of-boston|archive-date=April 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  Once women were officially allowed to register for the 1972 race the campus cheer tradition became more popular. Before current crowd control techniques that only allow students to cheer from the south side of the street, students would form a tunnel anywhere from 5 to 8 feet wide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-marathon/2018/04/12/kissing-posters-and-so-much-screeching-a-history-of-the-wellesley-college-scream-tunnel|title=A history of the Wellesley College Boston Marathon ‘Scream Tunnel’|date=2018-04-12|work=Boston.com|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430050004/https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-marathon/2018/04/12/kissing-posters-and-so-much-screeching-a-history-of-the-wellesley-college-scream-tunnel|archive-date=April 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Alumnae Achievement Awards, begun in 1970, are another annual tradition; each year, three alumnae are recognized for outstanding achievements in their respective fields. Recipients have included [[Lynn Sherr]], [[Diane Sawyer]], [[Pamela Melroy]], [[Judith Martin]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Ophelia Dahl]], [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Madeleine Korbel Albright]], among many others.

The Ruhlman and Tanner Conferences, supported by Wellesley alumnae, are held every year for students to share their learning experience within the college community. Classes are canceled on these days. The Tanner Conference is held in the fall to celebrate outside-the-classroom education, including internships and summer or winter session research projects. Ruhlman, in the spring, is a chance for students to present projects they've been working on in courses or independent research during the year. Both conferences encompass panels, readings, and multimedia projects.
