==History==
The channel was launched on 15 November 2006, at 12:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]. It had aimed to begin broadcasting in June 2006 but had to postpone its launch because its [[High-definition television|HDTV]] technology was not yet ready.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/4/12/nation/20060412152145&sec=nation |title=Al Jazeera International targets June launch |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514163142/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F4%2F12%2Fnation%2F20060412152145&sec=nation |archive-date=14 May 2006 |website=The Star |first=Kuala |last=Lumpur |date=12 April 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5512019 |title=The Challenges of Working at Al-Jazeera |website=NPR |publisher=Talk of the Nation |date=26 June 2006}}</ref> The channel was due to be called ''[[Al Jazeera International]]'', but the name was changed nine months before the launch because one of the channel's backers argued that original Arabic-language channel already had an international scope.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Leigh |last=Holmwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/nov/14/tvnews.television1 |title=Al-Jazeera Renames English-Language Channel |publisher=MediaGuardian |date=14 November 2006}}</ref>

The channel was anticipated to reach around 40 million households, but it far exceeded that launch target, reaching 80&nbsp;million homes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6149310.stm |title=Al-Jazeera English hits airwaves |work=BBC News |date=15 November 2006}}</ref> By 2009, the service could be viewed in every major European market and was available to 130 million homes in over 100 countries via cable and satellite, according to a spokeswoman for the network in Washington.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/technology/11iht-jazeera.4.19256575.html?_r=1 |title=Al Jazeera provides an inside look at Gaza conflict |work=The New York Times |date=1 January 2009 |first=Noam |last=Cohen}}</ref>

The channel, however, has poor penetration in the American market, where it has been carried by only one satellite service and a small number of cable networks.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101071599 |title=Al-Jazeera English Struggles For U.S. Audience |website=NPR |date=24 February 2009}}</ref> Al Jazeera English later began a campaign to enter the North American market, including a dedicated website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://iwantaje.com/ |title=Demand Al Jazeera |website=Al Jazeera English}}</ref> It became available to some cable subscribers in New York in August 2011, having previously been available as an option for some viewers in Washington, D.C., Ohio and Los Angeles.<ref name="nycable">{{cite news|title=Al Jazeera English launches on New York cable |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2011/08/02/al-jazeera-english-launches-on-new-york-cable/ |accessdate=2 August 2011 |work=The Spy Report |date=2 August 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205170849/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2011/08/02/al-jazeera-english-launches-on-new-york-cable/ |archivedate=5 December 2011 }}</ref> The channel primarily reaches the United States via its live online streaming.

Al Jazeera English and Iran's state-run [[Press TV]] were the only international English-language television broadcasters with journalists reporting from inside both Gaza and Israel during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008–2009 Israel-Gaza conflict]]. Foreign press access to Gaza has been limited via either Egypt or Israel. However, Al Jazeera's reporters [[Ayman Mohyeldin]] and [[Sherine Tadros]] were already inside Gaza when the conflict began and the network's coverage was often compared to [[CNN]]'s initial coverage from inside Baghdad in the early days of the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Al-Jazeera becomes the face of the frontline |work=Financial Times|date=13 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2009/01/200911316261575852.html |title=Israel pushes further into Gaza |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=13 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Ahmed |last=Shihab-Eldin |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ahmed-shihabeldin/al-jazeera-english-beats_b_155125.html |title=Al Jazeera English Beats Israel's Ban on Reporters in Gaza with Exclusive Coverage |work=The Huffington Post|date=5 January 2009}}</ref>

The channel may also be viewed online. It recommends online viewing at its own website<ref name=LiveStream>[http://www.aljazeera.com/watch_now/ Al Jazeera English: Live Stream] Al Jazeera English</ref> or at its channel on YouTube.<ref name=YTAJE>[https://www.youtube.com/aljazeeraenglish Al Jazeera English's Channel] YouTube</ref> Al Jazeera English HD launched in the United Kingdom on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] on 26 November 2013, and began streaming in HD on YouTube in 2015.

On 1 January 2020, Al Jazeera English debuted a new major graphics package for the first time since the channel launched and a remodeled main Doha studio, the last main studio of the channel's three in Doha, London, and Washington D.C. to receive an upgrade since the channel's launch in 2006.

===Al Jazeera America / United States===
{{Main|Al Jazeera America}}
On 3 January 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network announced that it had purchased [[Current TV]] in the United States and would be launching an American news channel. 60% of the channel's programming would be produced in America while 40% would be from Al Jazeera English.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/02/business/al-jazeera-current-tv/index.html?eref=edition Al Jazeera buys Al Gore's Current TV] CNN, 3 January 2013</ref><ref name=BuysUS/><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20896484 Al Jazeera targets US expansion after buying Current TV] BBC News, 3 January 2013</ref> That was later changed at the request of pay-television providers to almost 100% American programing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/business/media/american-al-jazeera-channel-shifs-focus-to-us-news.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Brian | last=Stelter | title=American Al Jazeera Channel Shifts Focus to U.S. News | date=26 May 2013}}</ref> Regardless Al Jazeera America maintained a close working relationship with Al Jazeera English. The channel aired ''Newshour'' in the morning and midday hours and cut to live Al Jazeera English coverage of large breaking international news stories outside of that. Al Jazeera English programmes ''[[Witness (2006 TV programme)|Witness]]'', ''Earthrise'', ''[[Listening Post (TV programme)|Listening Post]]'', ''Talk To Al Jazeera'' ''Al Jazeera Correspondent'' and ''[[101 East]]'' along with ''Al Jazeera Investigates'' regularly aired on Al Jazeera America.

On 13 January 2016, Al Jazeera America announced that the network would be terminated on 12 April 2016, citing the "economic landscape".<ref>{{Cite news |title = Al Jazeera America to Shut Down|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/al-jazeera-america-shut-down-855477|newspaper = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = 13 January 2016}}</ref>

===Al Jazeera UK / Europe===
In 2014, Al Jazeera moved its UK London operations including its newsroom, studios and shows from Knightsbridge to its new space on floor 16 of [[The Shard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-shard.com/office-occupiers/|title=Occupiers|website=The Shard}}</ref> The last day of broadcasting from the Knightsbridge studios was September, 12th 2014.<ref>https://twitter.com/nowtro/status/502176783505305602{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref> The space was officially opened on 3 November 2014, with the first Newshour broadcast on 10 October 2014.<ref>{{cite AV Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ClH5ZiKnFE|title=(unknown)|via=YouTube|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522130657/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ClH5ZiKnFE|archivedate=22 May 2015}}</ref> The new facility is capable of running an entire channel, independently of the Doha hub.

In 2013 [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] began planning a new channel called ''Al Jazeera UK''. If launched, the British channel would broadcast for five hours during prime time as cut-in UK content aired on Al Jazeera English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-reinforces-its-global-position |title=Al Jazeera reinforces its global position with French news channel |publisher=BroadcastPro ME|date=21 March 2013}}</ref> It would in effect function much like [[RT UK]] and [[RT America]] does in the United States.

==International bureaux==
In addition to its two main broadcast centres, Al Jazeera English itself has 21 bureaux around the world that gather and produce news. It also shares resources with its [[Arabic]]-language sister channel's 42 bureaux, Al Jazeera Balkan's bureaux and Al Jazeera Turk's bureaux for 70 bureaux.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://network.aljazeera.net/about-us/locations|title=Global Presence|work=Al Jazeera Media Network|access-date=24 November 2018|language=en}}</ref> This is a significant difference from the present trend:
 
"The mainstream American networks have cut their bureaux to the bone.... They're basically only in London now. Even CNN has pulled back. I remember in the '80s when I covered these events there would be a truckload of American journalists and crews and editors and now Al Jazeera outnumbers them all.... That's where, in the absence of alternatives, Al Jazeera English can fill a vacuum, simply because we're going in the opposite direction."<br>
 
[[Tony Burman]], former managing director, AJE (quoted in [[Adbusters]])<ref>[https://www.adbusters.org/magazine/87/aljazeera-english.html Broadcaster of the Year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802194919/https://www.adbusters.org/magazine/87/aljazeera-english.html |date=2 August 2010 }} Adbusters, 7 January 2010</ref>	
 
Also Al Jazeera presenters can alternate between broadcast centres. Al Jazeera also shares English-speaking correspondents with [[Al Jazeera Arabic]], [[Al Jazeera Turk]] and [[Al Jazeera Balkans]] and vice versa.

===On-air staff===
Al Jazeera English uses a combination of full-time 'staffers' and local freelancers. So long as the journalists are appearing – or are providing credited commentaries – regularly on-air, no distinction has been made as to their contractual arrangements. However, those who have received a recent on-air profile and whose names therefore appear in bold, may well be assumed to be on the staff.

===Recruitment===
[[File:Al Jazeera English Newsroom.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera English Newsroom]]
The late veteran British broadcaster [[David Frost]] joined Al Jazeera English in 2005<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4318284.stm "David Frost Joins al-Jazeera TV"] BBC News, 7 October 2005</ref> to host his show ''Frost Over the World''.

Former [[BBC]] and CNN anchor [[Rizwan Khan|Riz Khan]], who previously had been the host of the CNN talk show ''[[Q & A (U.S. talk show)|Q&A]]'', also joined. He hosts his shows ''Riz Khan'' and ''Riz Khan's One on One''.

Former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Josh Rushing joined Al Jazeera in September 2005.<ref>Nick Madigan and Annie Linskey [https://web.archive.org/web/20060210095852/http://mediachannel.org/blog/node/680 Mission of Former Marine: Arab TV] MediaChannel.org via Wayback Machine, 18 August 2005</ref> He had been the press officer for the [[United States Central Command]] during the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], and in that role had been featured in the documentary ''[[Control Room (film)|Control Room]]''. When subsequently joining Al Jazeera, Rushing commented that "In a time when American media has become so nationalized, I'm excited about joining an organization that truly wants to be a source of global information...."<ref>[http://www.ameinfo.com/68321.html "Josh Rushing, Former U.S. Marine, Joins Al Jazeera International"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211220456/http://www.ameinfo.com/68321.html |date=11 February 2007 }} AMEInfo, 22 September 2005</ref> Rushing worked from the Washington DC broadcasting centre until the formation of Al Jazeera America, he now works from AJAM's San Francisco hub.

Former CNN and BBC news anchorwoman and award-winning journalist Veronica Pedrosa also joined the team,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ameinfo.com/72194.html| title=Veronica Pedrosa joins Al Jazeera| accessdate=3 June 2006| date=20 November 2005| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614223758/http://www.ameinfo.com/72194.html| archivedate=14 June 2006|url-status = dead}}</ref> along with CNN producer James Wright, and Kieran Baker, a former editor and producer for CNN, who had been acting general manager, Communications and Public Participation for [[ICANN]]. On 2 December 2005, Stephen Cole, a senior anchor on BBC World and ''[[Click Online]]'' presenter, announced he was joining Al Jazeera International.<ref>Chris Tryhorn [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/02/iraqandthemedia.tvnews BBC's "'Peter Pan' Joins al-Jazeera"] ''MediaGuardian'', 2 December 2005</ref>

The network announced on 12 January 2006 that former ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' correspondent Dave Marash would be the co-anchor from their Washington studio. Marash described his new position as "the most interesting job on Earth".<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/13/nation/na-jazeera13 "Former 'Nightline' Reporter Joins English-Language Al Jazeera"] ''Los Angeles Times'', 13 January 2006</ref>
On 6 February 2006, it was announced that the former BBC reporter Rageh Omaar would host the weeknight documentary series, ''Witness''.<ref>Whitworth, Damien [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-2027561,00.html "Farewell to the Front Line (For Now)"] ''The Times'', 7 February 2006 {{subscription}}</ref>

The managing director for Al Jazeera English was previously [[Tony Burman]], who replaced Nigel Parsons in May 2008.<ref>Chris Tryhorn [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/14/television1 "Burman Named al-Jazeera English MD"] ''guardian.co.uk'', 14 May 2008</ref> The current managing director is Al Anstey.

In mid 2014 Al Jazeera English froze employment of both permanent and freelance staff for its Qatar network and cut freelance pay rates by 30-40% without warning, while at the same time Al Jazeera lodged a $150&nbsp;million claim for compensation against Egypt, arguing that by arresting and attacking Al Jazeera journalists, seizing the broadcaster's property and jamming its signal, the Egyptian government has violated its rights as a foreign investor in the country and put the $90&nbsp;million it has invested in Egypt since 2001 at risk.

==Al Jazeera Investigative Unit==
Formed in 2010, in its own words: ''the role of Al Jazeera Investigations is not to report the news, but to make the news''.

The Unit, is based at the Network headquarters in [[Doha]], but also has representation in [[London]] and [[Washington, DC]]. The unit is an [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] asset and its reports appear equally on the other channels, tailored appropriately for the relevant language and audience. The documentaries are presented as specials under their own strand: ''[[Al Jazeera Investigates]]''.

The Unit's investigations have included the documentary ''What Killed Arafat?'' This film won a [[CINE]] Golden Eagle Award and was nominated for a BAFTA. In 2013, Al Jazeera released a follow-up named "Killing Arafat" which revealed findings of scientific analysis of the exhumed remains of the Palestinian leader that discovered traces of polonium in his bones. The Arafat findings led news agendas globally.

Other major investigations have included:

How to Sell a Massacre, in which concealed cameras record an Australian political party promising to soften anti-gun laws while seeking millions in political funding from America's gun lobby.

Generation Hate, which exposes secret links between one of France's largest political parties and a movement calling for the expulsion of Muslims from Europe.

Football's Wall of Silence, which investigates the deadly scandal of long-term sexual abuse of young players in British football.

Broken Dreams: The Boeing 787, which revealed Boeing's "Dreamliner" workers feared to fly the plane they build, citing quality concerns and alleging drug use on the job.

The current Manager of Investigative Journalism for the Al Jazeera Media Network is Phil Rees. Before that, it was Clayton Swisher. Other leading figures include: Peter Charley, Will Thorne, Deborah Davies, Will Jordan, Simon Boazman, David Harrison, Kevin Hirten and Jason Gwynne.

It permitted the announcement following unrest in Egypt so American viewers can watch the latest events going on in the Middle East. A Roku user must add the private channel Newscaster from the Roku website.<ref>[https://owner.roku.com/Add/newscaster Add newscaster]{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Roku</ref>

On 1 August 2011, Al Jazeera English began airing 23 hours a day in New York City as part of a sublet agreement with cable channel RISE, a former Spanish-language network, which is carried on [[WRNN-TV]]'s DT2 subchannel (the other hours were used to meet FCC [[E/I]] and local programming guidelines). The network aired on [[Time Warner Cable]] on channel 92 and on [[Verizon FiOS]] on channel 481.<ref name="THR-AJE-NYC">{{cite news |title=Al Jazeera English Begins Airing in New York City |author=THR Staff |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/al-jazeera-english-begins-airing-217620 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=1 August 2011|accessdate=8 September 2011|quote=Al Jazeera English began airing in New York City 23 hours a day Monday in a sublet agreement on cable channel RISE }}</ref>

On 2 January 2013, Al Jazeera announced that it had acquired the U.S.-based cable TV channel [[Current TV]] for a reported $500&nbsp;million. With this acquisition, Al Jazeera launched a new channel, called [[Al Jazeera America]], with a heavy dose of U.S. domestic news along with Al Jazeera English programming and news, to an estimated 40 million U.S. households—putting it in direct competition with [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]] and [[Fox News Channel]].

Due to contracts with U.S. cable and satellite carriers for [[Al Jazeera America]] the official Al Jazeera English live stream was geo-blocked in the United States on 18 August 2013. With the launch of Al Jazeera America, Al Jazeera English was excluded from all US services carrying or providing the channel, including YouTube, with Al Jazeera America material replacing all Al Jazeera English video content and live streams. Most Al Jazeera English video content was no longer officially available in the United States.

In April 2014 the Al Jazeera English show [[Empire (Al Jazeera TV series)|Empire]] wasn't geo-blocked in the United States. Shortly after the programs Indian Hospital (AJE show)|Indian Hospital, 
Viewfinder (AJE show)|Viewfinder, Lifelines (AJE show)|Lifelines and Head to Head were available also. These programs were the only AJE shows officially non-geoblocked for American viewing during the time that Al Jazeera America was in existence.

With the closure of Al Jazeera America in April 2016 it was expected that the official live stream of Al Jazeera English and access to its programmes would eventually be restored to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advanced-television.com/2016/07/22/al-jazeera-digital-streaming-service-for-us/|title=Al-Jazeera streaming service for US|last=Editor|website=advanced-television.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aljazeera-usa-streaming/al-jazeera-to-launch-english-language-digital-streaming-service-in-u-s-idUSKCN1012PF|title=Al Jazeera to launch English language digital streaming service in U.S.|date=21 July 2016|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> The online live stream of Al Jazeera English was made available to viewers in the United States once again in September 2016.

==Controversies==

===Al Jazeera English journalists Egyptian detainment===
{{main|2013–15 detention of Al Jazeera journalists by Egypt}}
 
In December 2013, three Al Jazeera English journalists, [[Peter Greste]], [[Mohamed Fahmy]] and Baher Mohamed, were arrested in their Cairo [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel rooms. They were detained on charges of delivering "false news" and "aiding a terrorist organization" in Egypt following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]]. Al Jazeera was one of several websites to which the Egyptian government blocked access after accusing the network of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which was removed from power during the 2013 coup. Egypt has been accused of limiting freedom of expression in an attempt to suppress opposition to president al-Sisi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/afp/2017/05/egypt-politics-media-internet.html#ixzz4tuX6UHqg|title=Sisi's Egypt cracks down on news websites|last=AFP|date=25 May 2017}}</ref>
 		 	
The crew has had court trials that have been adjourned over 10 times where questionable evidence including video from other news organizations claimed to be from Al Jazeera English, inaudible audio recordings, pictures from a family vacation, a music video and video of sheep had been presented as evidence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/06/23/al-jazeera-jail-gotye-she_n_5521245.html|title=9 Ludicrous Pieces of Evidence Used in Egypt To Jail Al Jazeera Journalists|date=23 June 2014|publisher=The Huffington Post UK}}</ref> The trial has been called out by free press groups and rights groups as a sham. The former Cairo Bureau chief from Al Jazeera English now works for sister channel [[AJ+]] after the shutdown of the bureau. During the detainment of the journalists Al Jazeera along with the [[BBC]] and other major news organizations launched the [[Twitter]] and social media campaign #FreeAJStaff. The campaign included moments of silence while holding the [[hashtag]] as well as protesting at Egyptian embassies in various countries among other things. Calls from the United Nations, European Union and the United States for the journalists to be released were ignored.
 
On 23 June 2014, the three journalists were found guilty by an Egyptian court. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to 7 years in prison while Mohamed was sentenced to 10 years. The ruling was denounced by fellow journalists, including some at [[BBC]], [[CNN]], ABC Australia and most other major news outlets along with world leaders from [[Australia]], [[Canada]], The [[United States]], [[United Nations]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] primarily because they were found guilty based on no actual evidence in a case that has been deemed politically motivated and also because the ruling was seen as an attack on press freedom. The response was especially negative on the part of United States Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] who a day earlier was in Egypt and was made a promise of [[Freedom of the Press|press freedom]] by Egyptian President [[Abdel Fattah al-Sisi]]. The ruling has resulted in many negative stories in print, online and on television by various news outlets around the world calling the Egyptian justice system a [[kangaroo court]] and calling the Egyptian government authoritarian.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Loveluck|first1=Louisa|title=David Cameron 'appalled' as Egypt sentences Al Jazeera journalists to seven years in prison|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/10919226/Al-Jazeera-journalists-working-in-Egypt-sentenced-to-seven-years-in-prison.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Secretary Kerry: Prison sentences for Al Jazeera reporters 'deeply disturbing set-back' for Egypt |url=http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/index.php/sid/223187693 |publisher=Big News Network |date=23 June 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026153954/http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/index.php/sid/223187693 |archivedate=26 October 2014}}</ref>
 
There were various calls for amnesty, clemancy and pardons by various governments and news agencies all of which were declined by the Egyptian government who claimed that their justice system was independent and to respect the courts decision and stay out of Egyptian affairs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/24/al-jazeera-journalists-sisi-egypt-denied-celemency|title=Egyptian president ignores Obama call for clemency over al-Jazeera journalists|first=Patrick|last=Kingsley|date=24 June 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> There were also calls for the United States to end or hold funding for the Egyptian military in response to the case.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Al Jazeera controversies and criticism}}
As with Al Jazeera's Arabic counterpart, the network has received criticism from having bias from several sides.

=== Allegations of Anti-American bias ===
Al Jazeera English has frequently been criticized for having an anti-American bias, although some commentators{{who|date=May 2013}} have asserted that this has been lessened over time.

Emmy award-winning journalist [[Dave Marash]], who served as a veteran correspondent for ABC's ''[[Nightline]]'', resigned from his position as Washington anchor for Al Jazeera English in 2008. Marash cited "reflexive adversarial editorial stance" against Americans and "anti-American bias".<ref>[https://www.cjr.org/the_water_cooler/dave_marash_why_i_quit.php?page=all "Dave Marash: Why I Quit"] ''Columbia Journalism Review'', 4 April 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3524639,00.html "Anchor Quits Al Jazeera, Cites Anti-American Tone"] Ynetnews, 28 March 2008</ref>

According to the media scholar [[Marwan M. Kraidy]], when launching the English network, Al Jazeera framed the new channel as a competitor to BBC and CNN, but with coverage oriented towards the [[Global South]].<ref>{{Cite book| first = Marwan |last = Marwan Kraidy| editor-last = Kugelman | editor-first = Michael | author-link = Marwan M. Kraidy | title=Kuala Lumpur calling: Al Jazeera English in Asia| date=2008|  publisher= Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars| chapter = Al Jazeera and Al Jazeera English: A Comparative Institutional Analysis|isbn=978-1-933549-44-6| location=Washington, DC |oclc=326860884}}</ref>

It is often unclear whether recent discussions of anti-American bias at Al Jazeera are referring also to Al Jazeera English or only to Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel. There are significant differences in tone between the English and Arabic-language channels. (According to bilingual Palestinian journalist [[Daoud Kuttab]], "The English channel uses more neutral terminology; the Arab channel is much harsher.")<ref name="ajr">{{cite web |author=Sherry Ricchiardi |url= http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=5077 |title=The Al Jazeera Effect |date=March 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2012 |work=American Journalism Review |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120120215822/http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=5077 |archive-date=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> An example of this is a 2011 claim by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] that Al Jazeera is "anti-Semitic" and "anti-American" and a subsequent defense of Al Jazeera against these claims made by former Al Jazeera English anchor Dave Marash on the ''[[O'Reilly Factor]]''.<ref name="ajr"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&showID=2801 |title=The O'Reilly Factor – Monday, February 14, 2011| publisher=Bill O'Reilly| date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> Another example concerns statements by former US Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who in April 2004 denounced Al-Jazeera's Arabic-language coverage of the Iraq War as "vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable", but took a more conciliatory tone in a 2011 interview for ''[[Frost Over The World]]'', Al Jazeera English's news and public affairs program hosted by [[David Frost]], praising the network as "an important means of communication in the world".<ref name="Huffington-Rumsfeld">{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/09/29/donald-rumsfeld-tells-al-_n_986856.html |title= Donald Rumsfeld Tells Al Jazeera 'I Am Delighted You Are Doing What You Are Doing' |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=The Huffington Post UK | first = Paul| last =Vale |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> The government of which Rumsfeld was part had deliberately targeted Al Jazeera journalists in Iraq and Afghanistan, and discussed bombing its headquarters in Doha.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Miles |first = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Miles (journalist) |title =Al-Jazeera : how Arab TV news challenged the world |date=2006| publisher=Abacus| isbn=0-349-11925-2| location=London| oclc=224996796}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2020}}

On 12 October 2008, Al Jazeera English broadcast interviews with people attending a [[Sarah Palin]] [[2008 United States presidential election|United States presidential election]] rally in [[St. Clairsville, Ohio]], with interviewees making comments about [[Barack Obama]] such as "he regards white people as trash" and "I'm afraid if he wins, the blacks will take over". The report received over two million views on YouTube.<ref>{{cite AV Media |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRqcfqiXCX0|title=Misconceptions of Obama fuel Republican campaign |date=13 October 2008 |publisher=Al Jazeera| first=Casey| last=Kauffman |via= YouTube |author-link = Casey Kauffman }}</ref> Following this, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran an [[op-ed]],<ref name=Post181008>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/17/AR2008101702496.html| title=A Rage No One Should Be Stoking |author-link = Colbert I.

Subsequent endeavours have been seen as tests by Al Jazeera to see whether it can get rid of the hostility Americans feel toward it. One example was a day's worth of special coverage marking the 10th anniversary of [[September 11 attacks|the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001]].<ref>{{cite news|first =David |last = Bauder |url= http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9PKH2U02.htm |title=Al Jazeera English maps out 9/11 coverage |publisher=Bloomberg BusinessWeek| agency=Associated Press |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate =28 January 2012}}</ref> Al Jazeera has also launched ''[[The Stream]]'', a show based in Washington D.C. that discusses social media, which targets an American audience.<ref>{{cite web| author=Teemu Henriksson |url= http://www.editorsweblog.org/web_20/2011/04/al_jazeera_takes_social_media_to_the_air.php |title= Al Jazeera takes social media to the airwaves, targeting US audiences in particular |publisher=World Editors Forum| work= EditorsWebLog.org |date=19 April 2011| accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  |url= http://www.cyberjournalist.net/al-jazeera-launches-the-stream-social-media-experiment-online |title=Al Jazeera launches 'The Stream' social media experiment online |publisher=CyberJournalist |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120131131851/http://www.cyberjournalist.net/al-jazeera-launches-the-stream-social-media-experiment-online |archive-date=31 January 2012 |url-status = dead}}</ref> On 2 January 2013, Al Jazeera purchased the American channel [[Current TV]] and rebranded as [[Al Jazeera America]] in August 2013.<ref name=BuysUS>{{cite news |title= Al Jazeera buys US channel Current TV| url= http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/01/2013132255769130.html| publisher=Al Jazeera |date= 2 January 2013| accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url= https://theweek.com/articles/469065/why-al-gore-sold-current-tv-al-jazeera |title=Why Al Gore sold Current TV to Al Jazeera|date=3 January 2013| website= theweek.com |language=en |access-date =21 February 2020}}</ref>
