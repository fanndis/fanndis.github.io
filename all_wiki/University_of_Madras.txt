The first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating "some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education." This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a ‘university.’ This university had twin departments&nbsp;– a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Madras|first=University of|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eANAAAAQAAJ|title=The Madras University Calendar|date=1879|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=History and Heritage|url=https://www.unom.ac.in/index.php?route=university/history|access-date=27 June 2020|website=University of Madras}}</ref>

The University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for "creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University." The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships "for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages." As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=University|first=Madras|url=http://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10973/26033|title=History of higher education in South India. Vol. I|date=1957|publisher=Associated priters (Madras) Pvt Ltd, Madras|language=en}}</ref>

The university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[Alagappa University]] (1985), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R.

In 1912 endowments were made to the university to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics. In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the university were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slater|first=Gilbert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCRHDwAAQBAJ&q=Madras+University+mysore+travancore&pg=PT136|title=Revival: Southern India (1936): Its Political and Economic Problems|date=16 January 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-34409-8|language=en}}</ref>

Between 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/tamil-lex/</ref>
