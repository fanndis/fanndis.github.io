==History==

===1969–1970: Beginnings===
In 1969, [[Maurice White]], a former [[Session musician|session drummer]] for [[Chess Records]] and former member of the [[Ramsey Lewis|Ramsey Lewis Trio]], joined two friends in Chicago, [[Wade Flemons]] and Don Whitehead, as a songwriting team composing songs and commercials in the Chicago area. The three friends eventually got a recording contract with [[Capitol Records]]. Calling themselves "The Salty Peppers", they went on to have a marginal hit single in the Midwestern area titled "La La Time".<ref name = "Nathan-1993" /><ref name="allmusicWhiteBio">{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Ed|title=Maurice White|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/maurice-white-mn0000333796/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref>

The Salty Peppers' second single, "Uh Huh Yeah", did not fare as well. Maurice moved on from Chicago to Los Angeles. He added to the band singer Sherry Scott<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-6891_1_jazz-singer|title=Sherry Scott Belts Out Thrilling Jazz in Her Rich Alto|author=Washburn, Jim|date=December 21, 1990|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> and percussionist Yackov Ben Israel, both from Chicago, and then asked his younger brother [[Verdine White|Verdine]] how he would feel about heading out to the West Coast. On June 6, 1970, Verdine left Chicago to join the band as their new bassist. Maurice began shopping demo tapes of the band, featuring [[Donny Hathaway]], around to different record labels and the band was eventually signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name = "Nathan-1993" />

===1970–1974: Formation and early years===
Maurice's [[astrological sign]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], has a primary [[Classical element|elemental]] quality of [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] and seasonal qualities of [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] and [[Air (classical element)|air]], according to [[Astrology and the classical elements#Triplicities by season|classical triplicities]]. Sagittarius in the northern hemisphere occurs in the autumn, whose element is earth, and in the southern hemisphere, it is spring, whose element is air. Hence the omission of [[Water (classical element)|Water]], the fourth [[classical element]]. Based on this, he changed the band's name, to "Earth, Wind & Fire". Maurice held further auditions in L.A. where he added Michael Beal on guitar, Chester Washington on [[Reed (instrument)|reeds]], and Leslie Drayton on trumpet. With Maurice as a percussionist and lead vocalist Drayton also served as the group's musical arranger. Trombonist Alex Thomas completed the then ten-man EWF lineup. Warner Bros also designated [[Joe Wissert]] to be the band's producer.<ref name=chuck>{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckthewriter.com/ewf.html|title=Earth Wind and Fire I'll Write a Song for You|work=Goldmine Magazine|first= Miller|last=Chuck|access-date=May 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name = "Nathan-1993" /><ref name="rock hall" />

The band's [[Earth, Wind & Fire (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in February 1971 on Warner Bros. The album got to No. 24 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top Soul Albums]] chart and has been certified Gold in France by the [[SNEP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/ws1905|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Earth, Wind & Fire|publisher=45worlds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/BLP/song/820657|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Earth, Wind & Fire (Top Soul Albums)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://snepmusique.com/les-certifications/?interprete=Earth&titre=Earth|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Earth, Wind & Fire|publisher=[[SNEP]]|website=snepmusique.com}}</ref>

[[Lester Bangs]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted a "heavy [[Sly and the Family Stone|Sly]] influence" and the "smooth harmonies" of [[The Fifth Dimension]] on the LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/earth-wind-fire-19710624|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Earth, Wind & Fire|author=[[Lester Bangs|Bangs, Lester]]|date=June 24, 1971|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> Bob Talbert of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' also wrote "I'm not sure what to call this group. Afro-gospel-jazz-blues-rock? Must there be a label?".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/98957871/?terms=%22Earth%2C%2BWind%2B%26%2BFire%22|title=Music's Finest Hour Symphonic Jazz|page=47|date=May 9, 1971|author=Talbert, Bob|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>

EWF went on to perform the entire [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the [[Melvin Van Peebles]] feature film ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]''. The soundtrack, composed by Van Peebles, was released in April 1971 on [[Stax Records]].<ref>{{cite work|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song|date=April 1971|publisher=Stax Records}}</ref> The album reached No. 13 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&B Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/soundtrack/chart-history/BLP/song/826183|title=Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song: Soundtrack (Top Soul Albums)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

In November 1971, EWF's second album, titled ''[[The Need of Love]]'', was issued. The LP got to No. 35 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top Soul Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/ws1958|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: The Need Of Love|publisher=45worlds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/BLP/song/829487|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: The Need of Love (Top Soul Albums)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Bruce Lindsay of [[Jazz Journal]] called The Need of Love "a worthwhile album".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jazzjournal.co.uk/2019/07/13/earth-wind-and-fire-earth-wind-and-fire-the-need-of-love/|title=Earth, Wind and Fire: Earth, Wind and Fire / The Need of Love |work=[[Jazz Journal]]}}</ref> Al Rudis of [[The Chicago Sun Times]] also wrote the LP "works beautifully and while the elements of Earth, Wind & Fire aren't new, this mixture of them is a unique sound".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/162559742/?terms=%22Earth%2C%2BWind%2B%26%2BFire%22|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: The Need of Love|page=43|date=December 3, 1971|author=Rudis, Al|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>

A single from the album called "[[I Think About Lovin' You]]" reached No. 44 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Songs]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/BSI/song/895976|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: I Think About Lovin' You (Hot Soul Songs)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

The band developed a growing popularity on college campuses but, in spite of this, some members of EWF started to become restless. As such the band eventually split apart. With only Verdine left, Maurice decided to re-form the group.<ref name = "Nathan-1993" />

During 1972, Maurice added vocalist Helena Davis, [[Ronnie Laws]] on the [[flute]] and saxophone, rhythm guitarist [[Roland Bautista]], keyboardist [[Larry Dunn]], vocalist [[Philip Bailey]] and percussionist [[Ralph Johnson (musician)|Ralph Johnson]] to the group. Davis was soon replaced by [[Jessica Cleaves]], a former member of the [[R&B]] group [[The Friends of Distinction]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC">{{cite web|last1=Huey|first1=Steve|title=Earth, Wind & Fire|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/earth-wind-fire-mn0000135273/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref name = "Nathan-1993" />

The band successfully auditioned for managers Bob Cavallo and Joe Ruffalo. Cavallo's management of [[John Sebastian]] led to a series of gigs as the opening act for the pop/folk singer and [[The Lovin' Spoonful]] founder. A performance at New York's [[Rockefeller Center]] introduced EWF to [[Clive Davis]], then the President of [[Columbia Records]]. Davis was very impressed with the band's performance and bought out their contract from Warner Bros. Wissert also, went along with the band to Columbia, as their producer.<ref name = "Nathan-1993">{{cite work|title=The Eternal Dance|year=1992|author=[[David Nathan (music writer)|Nathan, David]]|work=[[The Eternal Dance|Earth, Wind & Fire: The Eternal Dance]]|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]}}</ref><ref name=chuck /><ref>{{cite work|title=Lack of Pop-Music Trend is Healthy Sign to Producer|author=Lloyd, Jack|page=27|date=January 9, 1975|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]}}</ref>

Their debut album on CBS/Columbia Records, ''[[Last Days and Time]]'', was issued in October 1972. The album got to No. 15 on the US ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top Soul Albums]] chart and No. 9 on the UK [[Blues & Soul]] Top British Soul Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/kc31702|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Last Days & Time|publisher=45worlds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/BLP/song/827027|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Last Days & Time (Top Soul Albums)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top British Soul Albums|issue=292|date=December 4, 1979|magazine=[[Blues & Soul]]}}</ref> Paul Sexton of [[Record Mirror]] proclaimed "Musical historians and EW&F fans alike will welcome" Last Days and Time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Last Days and Time|page=16|volume=26|author=Sexton, Paul|date=November 17, 1979|magazine=[[Record Mirror]]}}</ref> Ovid Goode Jr. of ''[[The Los Angeles Daily News]]'' also declared that the LP is full of "moving tunes" that "sprouts forth with a fresh sound which sets it apart from many of the ho-hum aggregations around today".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/30312539/|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Last Days and Time|page=37|date=November 17, 1972|author=Goode, Ovid Jr. |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |via=newspapers.com}}</ref>

A single called "Mom" got to No. 39 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] Top R&B Singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-r/70s_files/19730310R.html|title=The CASH BOX R&B Top 65|date=March 23, 1973|work=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]}}</ref>

Soon thereafter, Roland Bautista and Ronnie Laws left the band to pursue new musical opportunities. Denver native Philip Bailey recommended his former [[East High School (Denver)|East High School]] classmate, saxophonist [[Andrew Woolfolk]] as a replacement for Laws. Woolfolk had been busy in New York studying sax with sax maestro [[Joe Henderson]] and was due to start a career in banking at the time. To fill the void created by Bautista's departure, rhythm guitarists [[Al McKay]] and Johnny Graham were added to round out the new lineup. Graham previously played with the R&B group [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]] while McKay was a former member of the [[Ike and Tina Turner|Ike and Tina Turner Revue]] and [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band|The Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band]].<ref name = "Nathan-1993" />

EWF's fourth studio album, ''[[Head to the Sky]]'', was released in May 1973. The album rose to No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' Top Soul Albums chart and No. 27 on the [[Billboard 200]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/kc32194|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Head to the Sky|publisher=45worlds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/BLP/song/825365|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Head To The Sky (Top Soul Albums)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/TLP/song/825365|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Head To The Sky (Billboard 200)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> ''Head to the Sky'' has also been certified Platinum in the US by the [[RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Earth%2C+Wind+%26+Fire++&ti=Head+to+The+sky&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section |title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Head to the Sky|work=[[RIAA]]}}</ref>

[[Vince Aletti]] of [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] declared that EWF "sound like a cosmic choir and generate a Sly Stone effect" on an album that's "certainly beyond all expectations".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/head-to-the-sky-19730817|title=Earth, Wind & Fire Head To The Sky|date=August 17, 1973|author=[[Vince Aletti|Aletti, Vince]]|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also described the record as "a movin' new package.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/963287955|title=Record Review: Nilsson, 'Superstar', Womack, Kirk, Lobo, Savoy, 'Good Times', Cody, Roberts, founders Top New LP's|page=50|issue=6|volume=271 |date=June 20, 1973 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|id={{ProQuest|963287955}}|via=Proquest}}</ref>

===1975–1980: Ornate sound===
During 1975, EWF was approached by [[Sig Shore]], producer of the motion picture ''[[Super Fly (1972 film)|Super Fly]]'', to record the soundtrack to a new film titled ''[[That's the Way of the World (film)|That's the Way of the World]]''. With a screenplay from [[Robert Lipsyte]], the film was produced and directed by Shore. The film starred [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Ed Nelson]], EWF as "The Group" and Maurice as Early, "The Group"'s leader. Keitel played the role of a record producer who hears "The Group" performing and is wowed by their act.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0073703/|title=That's The Way Of The World|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>

When the band saw the film they were convinced that it would become a [[box office bomb]], which it eventually was.<ref name=chuck /> They therefore released the film's soundtrack before the film's premiere. The LP was produced by White and [[Charles Stepney]] and recorded at the Caribou Ranch Studio. Stepney had previously worked with artists such as [[the Dells]], [[Terry Callier]] and [[Minnie Riperton]] and the collective group [[the Rotary Connection]], of which Riperton was a member. Stepney's writing and production style included a more ornate, orchestral flourish, which influenced the production of the soundtrack album.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.voicesofeastanglia.com/2011/07/interrupted-greatness-charles-stepney.html | title=Interrupted Greatness - Charles Stepney| date=July 15, 2011}}</ref>

''[[That's the Way of the World]]'' was eventually issued in March 1975 by Columbia.

From the LP came the single "[[Shining Star (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Shining Star]]", which rose to No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts. By this achievement, EWF became the first black act to top both the ''Billboard'' album and singles charts.

With the album's success the band was able to hire their own [[horn section]], dubbed the [[Phenix Horns]]. They were composed of saxophonist [[Don Myrick]], [[trombonist]] [[Louis Satterfield]], and trumpeters Rahmlee Davis and [[Michael Harris (trumpeter)|Michael Harris]]. Myrick and Satterfield had both previously worked with White during his days as a session drummer at Chess Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/entertainment/events/fl-xpm-2010-06-14-fl-music-earth-wind-fire-072510-20100614-story.html|title=Earth, Wind & Fire in their element|author=Hagwood Stafford, Ron|date=June 14, 2010 |work=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>

After their first tour of Europe, EWF returned to the studio in June 1975 for a follow-up release. The band eventually came away with an album of mostly live concert material together with some newly recorded tracks. As a double LP the new album titled ''[[Gratitude (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|Gratitude]]'' was issued in November 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/pg33694|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Gratitude|publisher=45worlds}}</ref> It rose to No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Soul Albums charts respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/HLP/song/317059|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Gratitude (Billboard 200) |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/BLP/song/317059|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Gratitude (Top Soul Albums)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The album was certified triple platinum in the US by the [[RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Earth%2C+Wind+%26+Fire+&ti=GRATITUDE&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Gratitude|publisher=[[RIAA]]}}</ref>

During 1975, White also established a production company called Kalimba Productions. Artists such as his former bandleader Ramsey Lewis; singer [[Deniece Williams]], who had once been a member of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "Wonderlove" backup group; and [[girl group]] [[the Emotions]], were signed to the production company. Maurice loaned the band's signature Phenix Horns and most of the other band members and put these and others artists who were signed to Kalimba Productions on tour with EWF.<ref name="Nathan-1993" />

While co-producing and arranging EWF's follow-up LP, Williams's debut album, ''[[This Is Niecy]]'', Ramsey Lewis's ''[[Salongo]]'', and the Emotions' ''[[Flowers (The Emotions album)|Flowers]]'', their first album on [[Columbia Records]], Charles Stepney died of a heart attack on May 17, 1976 in Chicago at the age of 43.

With Stepney's death, White went on to produce on his own the band's new LP, ''[[Spirit (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|Spirit]]'', which was issued in October 1976. With the album's title EWF paid tribute to Stepney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wholecircleround.co.uk/discovision/spins/stepney7.htm |title=Charles Stepney – A Shining Star Eclipsed |publisher=wholecircleround.co.uk |access-date=May 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010223059/http://www.wholecircleround.co.uk/discovision/spins/stepney7.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/pc34241|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Spirit|publisher=45worlds}}</ref> The LP rose to No. 2 on both the ''Billboard'' Top Pop Albums and Top Soul Albums charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/TLP/song/316009|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Spirit (Top Pop Albums) |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/earth-wind-fire/chart-history/BLP/song/316009|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Spirit (Top Soul Albums) |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Craig Werner of ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' called ''Spirit'' "one of the group's defining moments" and "gospel soul for the ages."<ref>{{cite magazine|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fiYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA200|title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Spirit|author=Werner, Craig|page=200|issue=3|volume=9|date=March 2001|magazine=[[Vibe Magazine]]|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>[[John Rockwell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also declared "what is most interesting about Maurice White and his musicians..is their refusal to be locked into any stylistic format."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/22/archives/the-pop-life.html|title=The Pop Life|date=October 22, 1976|author=[[John Rockwell|Rockwell, John]] |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> ''Spirit'' was certified [[Music recording certification|double platinum]] in the US by the RIAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Earth%2C+Wind+%26+Fire+&ti=SPIRIT&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section |title=Earth, Wind & Fire: Spirit|publisher=[[RIAA]]}}</ref>
