The '''Central Tibetan Administration''' ({{bo|t=བོད་མིའི་སྒྲིག་འཛུགས་|w=bod mi'i sgrig 'dzugs|s=Bömi Drikdzuk}}, {{IPA-bo|ˈpʰỳmìː ˈʈìʔt͡sùʔ}}, translated as '''''Exile Tibetan People's Organisation''''')<ref name="CTA" /> is Tibet's elected parliamentary government based in  Dharamshala, [[India]]. It is also referred to as the '''''Tibetan Government in Exile'''''. It is composed of a judiciary branch, a legislative branch, and an executive branch. Since its formation in 1959, the Central Tibetan Administration has not been officially recognized by [[China]].<ref>{{cite web |title=外交部：中方从来不承认所谓的西藏"流亡政府" |url=http://www.tibet.cn/wap/news/focus/1458278498557.shtml |publisher=中国西藏网 |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=1 March 2020 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929044336/http://www.tibet.cn/wap/news/focus/1458278498557.shtml |archivedate=29 September 2017 |language=zh-s }}</ref> The [[Tibetan diaspora]] and [[Refugee|refugees]] support the Central Tibetan Administration by voting for members of Parliament, the President and by making annual financial contributions through the use of the "[[Green Book (Tibetan document)|Green Book]]." The Central Tibetan Administration also receives international support from organizations and individuals.

The Central Tibetan Administration's internal structure is governmental; it has stated that it is "not designed to take power in Tibet"; rather, it will be dissolved "as soon as freedom is restored in Tibet" in favor of a government formed by Tibetans inside Tibet.<ref name="CTA">{{cite web |url = http://www.tibet.net/en/index.php?id=14 |title = Central Tibetan Administration |publisher = [Central Tibetan Administration |access-date = 28 August 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100803041342/http://www.tibet.net/en/index.php?id=14 |archivedate = 3 August 2010 }}</ref> In addition to political representation, it authors reports and press releases, and it administers a network of schools and other cultural activities for [[Refugees in India#Tibetan refugees|Tibetans in India]].

== Position on Tibet ==
The territory of Tibet is administered by the [[China|People's Republic of China]], a situation that the Central Tibetan Administration considers an illegitimate [[military occupation]]. The position of the CTA is that Tibet is a distinct nation with a long history of independence. The position of the People's Republic of China holds that China is [[List of ethnic groups in China|multi-ethnic]] and that Tibetans are among the recognised nations, that the central government of China (throughout its incarnations) has continuously exercised sovereignty over Tibet for over 700 years, that Tibet has not been independent but its ''[[de facto]]'' [[Tibet (1912–1951)|independence between 1912 and 1951]] was "nothing but a fiction of the imperialists who committed aggression against China in modern history".<ref>{{cite web |title = Tell you a true Tibet – Origins of so-called "Tibetan Independence" |publisher = National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China |date = 18 March 2009 |url = http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Special_NPC_Delegation/2009-03/18/content_1493948.htm |access-date = 27 September 2009}}</ref>

== Funding ==
The funding of the Central Tibetan Administration comes mostly from private donations collected with the help of organizations like the [[Tibet Fund]], revenue from the [[Green Book (Tibetan document)|Green Book]] (the "Tibetan in exile passport")<ref>Fiona McConnell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wkE1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA138 Rehearsing the State: The Political Practices of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile], p. 138</ref> and aid from governments like India and the US.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Namgyal|first1=Tsewang|title=Central Tibetan Administration's Financial Viability|url=http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=33499|accessdate=27 September 2017|agency=Phayul|date=28 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Central Tibetan Administration|title=Department of Finance|url=http://tibet.net/department/finance/|website=Central Tibetan Administration|access-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>

The annual revenue of the Central Tibetan Administration is officially 22 million (measured in US dollars),{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} with the biggest shares going to political activity ($7 million), and administration ($4.5 million){{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. However, according to Michael Backman, these sums are "remarkably low" for what the organisation claims to do, and it probably receives millions more in donations. The CTA does not acknowledge such donations or their sources.<ref name="backman">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/behind-dalai-lamas-holy-cloak/2007/05/22/1179601410290.html|title=Behind Dalai Lama's holy cloak|first=Michael|last=Backman|date=23 March 2007|access-date=20 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Age]]}}</ref>

The United States have funded the CTA as well in some periods. According to a Chinese source, between 1964 and 1968, the U.S. provided 1.735 million dollars each year.<ref>{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://gb.cri.cn/12764/2008/04/11/2945@2016740.htm |script-title=zh:美印出资养活达赖集团 – 世界新闻报 – 国际在线|website=gb.CRI.cn|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|{{zh|美国政府的一份解密文件显示，1964至1968年，美国给予达赖集团的财政拨款每年达173.5万美元，其中包括给达赖喇嘛个人津贴18万美元}}  "{{lang|en|A declassified document from the U.S. government shows that from 1964 to 1968, the U.S. financial allocation to the Dalai Group amounted to $1.735 million per year, including a personal allowance of $180,000 to the Dalai Lama.}}"}} In October 1998, the CTA stated that it had received US$1.7 million a year during the 1960s from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref name="tnyt 10-2-1998"/>

In 2012, the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 was passed in the U.S. to subsidize the CTA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rpt/20699.htm|title=Tibetan Policy Act of 2002|website=2001-2009.State.gov|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. government intends to withdraw aid to exiled Tibetans (美政府拟撤销对流亡藏人援助 ) |url=http://news.dwnews.com/china/news/2017-05-31/59817805.html |website=news.dwnews.com |language=zh|date=31 May 2017 }}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=November 2019}}

In 2017, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] proposed to stop aid to the CTA in 2018.<ref name="firstpost">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/trump-administration-makes-tough-choices-proposes-zero-aid-to-tibetans-wants-other-countries-to-follow-suit-3482781.html|title=Trump administration makes 'tough choices,' proposes zero aid to Tibetans; wants other countries to follow suit|date=26 May 2017|website=FirstPost.com|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref> Trump's proposal was criticized heavily by members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] like [[Nancy Pelosi]]<ref name="firstpost" /> and co-chair of the bipartisan Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission [[Jim McGovern (U.S. politician)|Jim McGovern]].<ref>{{cite news|title=McGovern: America Must Stand Up for Human Rights in Tibet|url=https://mcgovern.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=397016|access-date=27 September 2017|date=2 May 2017}}</ref> In February 2020 at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, Pelosi prayed as Trump attended; "Let us pray for the Panchen Lama and all the Tibetan Buddhists in prison in China or missing for following their faith".<ref>''Tibet’s disappeared Panchen Lama remembered in US National Prayer Breakfast'', (7 February 2020), Tibetan Review, https://www.tibetanreview.net/tibets-disappeared-panchen-lama-remembered-in-us-national-prayer-breakfast/</ref>

== Headquarters ==
[[File:Tibetan Library Dharamsala.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in 2010]]

The Central Tibetan Administration is headquartered in [[McLeod Ganj]], [[Dharamshala]], [[India]]. It represents the people of the entire [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and [[Qinghai|Qinghai province]], as well as two Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and one Tibetan Autonomous County in [[Sichuan]] Province, one Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and one Tibetan Autonomous County in [[Gansu]] Province and one Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in [[Yunnan]] Province<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tibet.net/map-of-tibet/|title=Map of Tibet|website=Tibet.net|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref> – all of which is termed "Historic Tibet" by the CTA.

The CTA attends to the welfare of the Tibetan exile community in India, who number around 100,000. It runs schools, health services, cultural activities and economic development projects for the Tibetan community. More than 1,000 refugees still arrive each year from China,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3f51f90821.html|title=India: Information on Tibetan Refugees and Settlements|publisher=United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services|date=30 May 2003|id=IND03002.ZNY|via=Refworld|access-date=3 June 2019}}</ref> usually via [[Nepal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savetibet.org/documents/pdfs/2003RefugeeReport.pdf|title=Dangerous Crossing|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613165802/http://savetibet.org/documents/pdfs/2003RefugeeReport.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2008|publisher=The International Campaign for Tibet|year=2003}}</ref>

=== Green Book ===
{{main|Green Book (Tibetan document)}}

Tibetans living outside Tibet can apply at a Central Tibetan Administration office in their country of residence for a personal document called the ''[[Green Book (Tibetan document)|Green Book]]'', which serves as a receipt book for the person's "voluntary contributions" to the CTA and the evidence of their claims for "Tibetan citizenship".<ref name="gb">{{cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/45f1470c2.html|title=China: The 'Green Book' issued to Tibetans; how it is obtained and maintained, and whether holders enjoy rights equivalent to Indian citizenship (April 2006)|date=28 April 2006|type=Responses to Information Requests (RIRs)|publisher=[[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]]|id=CHN101133.E|access-date=3 June 2019|via=Refworld}}</ref>

For this purpose, CTA defines a Tibetan as "any person born in Tibet, or any person with one parent who was born in Tibet." As Tibetan refugees often lack documents attesting to their place of birth, the eligibility is usually established by an interview.<ref name="gb" />

=== Blue Book ===
The Blue Book or Tibetan Solidarity Partnership is a project by Central Tibetan Administration, in which the CTA issues any supporter of Tibet who is of age 18 years or more a Blue Book. This initiative enables supporters of Tibet worldwide to make financial contributions to help the administration in supporting educational, cultural, developmental and humanitarian activities related to Tibetan children and refugees. The book is issued at various CTA offices worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tibet.net/support-tibet/blue-book-frequently-asked-questions/|title=Blue Book: Frequently Asked Questions (Updated 2020)|website=Central Tibetan Administration}}</ref>

== Internal structure ==
[[File:SamdhongRinpoche.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The former Chairman of the Cabinet of the CTA, [[Samdhong Rinpoche]], addresses a fundraising dinner in Sydney, Australia, February 2006]]

The Central Tibetan Administration currently operates under the "Charter of the Tibetans In-Exile", adopted in 1991.<ref name="CharterOfTibet">{{cite web |last = Staff |title = Constitution: Charter of the Tibetans in Exile |publisher = Central Tibetan Administration |url = http://www.tibet.net/en/index.php?id=15 |access-date = 3 February 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100127164356/http://www.tibet.net/en/index.php?id=15 |archivedate = 27 January 2010 }}</ref> Executive authority is vested in the Sikyong (also known as the President) an office currently held by [[Lobsang Sangay]], who was elected in 2011. The Sikyong is supported by a cabinet of ministers responsible for specific portfolios. Legislative authority is vested in the [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration]].

The Central Tibetan Administration's Department of Finance is made of seven departments and several special offices. Until 2003, it operated 24 businesses, including publishing, hotels, and [[handicraft]]s distribution companies.

At the time of its founding in 1959, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] was head of the Central Tibetan Administration. Over the ensuing decades, a gradual transition to democratic governance was effected. The first elections for an [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration|exile parliament]] took place on 2 September 1960. The position of Sikyong was later empowered to share executive authority with the Dalai Lama. The Sikyong was initially appointed by the Dalai Lama, but, beginning in 2001, this position was democratically elected by the Tibetan exile voters. The first elected Sikyong was a 62-year-old Buddhist monk, [[Lobsang Tenzin]] (better known as Samdhong Rinpoche), to the position of [[Kalon Tripa|President of the CTA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N56_6.php |title=Snow Lion Publications |publisher=Snowlionpub.com |date=5 September 2001 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> On 10 March 2011, the Dalai Lama proposed changes to the exile charter which would remove his position of authority within the organisation. These changes were ratified on 29 May 2011, resulting in the Sikyong becoming the highest-ranking office holder.<ref>The CTA's website lists "Head of State" as "Kalon Tripa".</ref>

==Media activities==
A 1978 study by [[Melvyn Goldstein]] and a 1983 study by Lynn Pulman on Tibetan communities-in-exile in southern India argue that the CTA adopted a stance of preserving an "idea of return" and fostering the development of an intense feeling of Tibetan cultural and political nationalism among Tibetans" in order to remain a necessary part of the communities.<ref name="Goldstein">{{cite book |chapter=Ethnogenesis and resource competition among Tibetan refugees in South India: A new face to the Indo-Tibetan interface |first= Melvyn C. |last= Goldstein |authorlink=Melvyn Goldstein |title= Himalayan Anthropology: The Indo-Tibetan Interface |editor-first=James F. |editor-last= Fisher |pages=395–420 |year=1978 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]}}</ref>{{rp|408–410}}<ref name="Pulman">{{Cite journal |url = http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/kailash/pdf/kailash_10_0102_04.pdf |title=Tibetans in Karnataka|first=Lynn |last=Pulman |journal=[[Kailash: A Journal of Himalayan Studies|Kailash]] |volume=10 |number=1–2 |year=1983 |pages=119–171}}</ref>{{rp|158–159}} They state that this was accomplished through the creation of the [[Tibetan Uprising Day]] holiday, a [[Tibetan National Anthem]], and the CTA control over local Tibetan-language media that promotes the idea of Chinese endeavors to "eradicate the Tibetan race".<ref name="Goldstein"/>{{rp|410–417}}<ref name="Pulman"/>{{rp|159–161}} From the 1990s onwards, the CTA used Hollywood films in addition to local media to emphasize the Tibetan exile struggle, secure the loyalty of Tibetans both in exile and in Tibet, promote Tibetan nationalism, and foster the CTA's legitimacy to act in the name of the entire Tibetan nation.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Tibetan Government-in-Exile: Politics at Large |first=Stephanie |last=Römer |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2008 |pages=150–152}}</ref>
