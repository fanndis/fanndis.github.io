The '''Knesset''' ({{lang-he-n|הַכְּנֶסֶת}} {{IPA-he|ha ˈkneset||knesset.ogg}}; lit. "gathering"<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of English, Oxford University Press, 2005</ref> or "assembly") is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[list of legislatures by country|national legislature]] of [[Israel]]. As the [[legislative branch]] of the [[Israeli system of government|Israeli government]], the Knesset passes all laws, elects the [[President of Israel|President]] and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] (although the latter is ceremonially appointed by the President), approves the [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet]], and supervises the work of the government. In addition, the Knesset elects the [[State Comptroller of Israel|State Comptroller]]. It also has the power to waive the immunity of its members, remove the [[President of Israel|President]] and the State Comptroller from office, dissolve the government in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]], and to dissolve itself and call new elections. The Prime Minister may also [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolve]] the Knesset. However, until an election is completed, the Knesset maintains authority in its current composition.<ref name="virtual">[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/knesset.html The Knesset]. Jewishvirtuallibrary.org. Retrieved 8 September 2011.</ref> The Knesset is located in [[Givat Ram]], [[West Jerusalem|Western Jerusalem]]. The Knesset was elected on 2 March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/final-results-confirm-likud-with-36-seats-right-short-of-majority-with-58/|title=Final results show Likud with 36 seats, Netanyahu bloc short of majority with 58|author=Raoul Wootliff|website=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=5 March 2020|accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref> 

==Name==
The term "Knesset" is derived from the ancient ''Knesset HaGdola'' ({{lang-he|כְּנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה}}) or "[[Great Assembly]]", which according to [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]] was an assembly of 120 scribes, sages, and prophets, in the period from the end of the Biblical prophets to the time of the development of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] – about two centuries ending c. 200 BCE.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0019_0_19428.html Synagogue, The Great (Heb. כְּנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה, Keneset ha-Gedolah)] Jewish Virtual Library</ref> There is, however, no organisational continuity and aside from the number of members, there is little similarity, as the ancient Knesset was a religious, completely unelected body.

===Members===

Members of the Knesset are known in Hebrew as חֲבֵר הַכְּנֶסֶת (''Haver HaKnesset''), if male, or חַבְרַת הַכְּנֶסֶת (''Havrat HaKnesset''), if female.

==Role in Israeli government==
As the [[legislative branch]] of the [[Government of Israel|Israeli government]], the Knesset passes all [[law]]s, elects the [[President of Israel|president]], approves the [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet]], and supervises the work of the government through its committees. It also has the power to waive the immunity of its members, remove the [[President of Israel|President]] and the [[Comptroller of Israel|State Comptroller]] from office, and to dissolve itself and call new elections.

The Knesset has ''[[de jure]]'' [[parliamentary supremacy]], and can pass any law by a simple majority, even one that might arguably conflict with the [[Basic Laws of Israel]], unless the basic law includes specific conditions for its modification; in accordance with a plan adopted in 1950, the Basic Laws can be adopted and amended by the Knesset, acting in its capacity as a [[Constituent Assembly]].<ref name=basiclaw /> The Knesset itself is regulated by a Basic Law called "Basic Law: the Knesset".

In addition to the absence of a formal [[constitution]], and with no Basic Law thus far being adopted which formally grants a power of [[judicial review]] to the [[judiciary]], the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] has since the early 1990s asserted its authority, when sitting as the High Court of Justice, to invalidate provisions of Knesset laws it has found to be inconsistent with Basic Law.<ref name=basiclaw>{{cite web |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_yesod.htm |title=Basic Laws - Introduction |publisher=Knesset |accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref> The Knesset is presided over by a [[List of Knesset speakers|Speaker]] and a Deputy Speaker.

==Committees==
{{Politics of Israel}}
The Knesset is divided into committees, which amend bills on various appropriate subjects. Committee chairpersons are chosen by their members, on recommendation of the House Committee, and their factional composition represents that of the Knesset itself. Committees may elect sub-committees and delegate powers to them, or establish joint committees for issues concerning more than one committee. To further their deliberations, they invite government ministers, senior officials, and experts in the matter being discussed. Committees may request explanations and information from any relevant ministers in any matter within their competence, and the ministers or persons appointed by them must provide the explanation or information requested.<ref name="virtual"/>

There are four types of committees in the Knesset. Permanent committees amend proposed legislation dealing with their area of expertise, and may initiate legislation. However, such legislation may only deal with Basic Laws and laws dealing with the Knesset, elections to the Knesset, Knesset members, or the [[State Comptroller of Israel|State Comptroller]]. Special committees function in a similar manner to permanent committees, but are appointed to deal with particular manners at hand, and can be dissolved or turned into permanent committees. Parliamentary inquiry committees are appointed by the plenum to deal with issues viewed as having special national importance. In addition, there are two types of committees that convene only when needed: the Interpretations Committee, made up of the Speaker and eight members chosen by the House Committee, deals with appeals against the interpretation given by the Speaker during a sitting of the plenum to the Knesset rules of procedure or precedents, and Public Committees, established to deal with issues that are connected to the Knesset.<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_work_mel2.htm Legislation]. Knesset.gov.il. Retrieved 8 September 2011.</ref><ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_work_vaada.htm Knesset Committees]. Knesset.gov.il. Retrieved 8 September 2011.</ref>

'''Permanent committees:'''

*House Committee
*Finance Committee
*Economic Affairs Committee
*[[Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee]]
*Interior and Environment Committee
*Immigration, Absorption, and Diaspora Affairs Committee
*[[The Knesset Committee on Education, Culture and Sport|Education, Culture, and Sports Committee]]
*Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee
*Labour, Welfare, and Health Committee
*Science and Technology Committee
*State Control Committee
*Committee on the Status of Women

'''Special committees:'''

*Committee on Drug Abuse
*Committee on the Rights of the Child
*Committee on Foreign Workers
*[[Israeli Central Elections Committee]]
*Public Petitions Committee

The other committees are the Arrangements Committee and the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee is responsible for jurisdiction over Knesset members who violate the rules of ethics of the Knesset, or involved in illegal activities outside the Knesset. Within the framework of responsibility, the Ethics Committee may place various sanctions on a member, but is not allowed to restrict a members' right to vote. The Arrangements Committee proposes the makeup of the permanent committees following each election, as well as suggesting committee chairs, lays down the sitting arrangements of political parties in the Knesset, and the distribution of rooms in the Knesset building to members and parties.<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_work_org.htm#2 The Organisation of the Work of the Knesset]. Knesset.gov.il (17 February 2003). Retrieved 8 September 2011.</ref>

==Caucuses==
Knesset members often join together in formal or informal groups known as "lobbies" or "caucuses", to advocate for a particular topic. There are hundreds of such caucuses in the Knesset. The [[Knesset Christian Allies Caucus]] and the [[Knesset Land of Israel Caucus]] are two of the largest and most actives caucuses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://knesset.gov.il/lobby/eng/LobbyList_eng.asp|title=Lobbies of the Twentieth Knesset|website=knesset.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/coalition-chief-heading-caucus-that-seeks-to-retain-entire-west-bank/|title=Coalition chief heading caucus that seeks to retain entire West Bank|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|work=The Times of Israel|date=11 June 2013|quote=Knesset caucuses, sometimes called lobbies, are informal groups of parliamentarians that gather around a certain cause or topic. There are hundreds of such caucuses, but the one Levin and Strock now head is one of the largest — if not the largest, with 20-30 members in the last Knesset — and most active.}}</ref>

==Size==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 7260 Knesset-Room.jpg|thumb|right|Knesset chamber, celebrating 61 years of the Knesset]]
The Knesset numbers 120 members, after the size of the [[Great Assembly]]. The subject of Knesset membership has often been a cause for proposed reforms. In 1996, then-Justice Minister [[Yossi Beilin]], backed the ultimately unsuccessful institution of the so-called "Norwegian law", which would require appointed members of the cabinet to resign their seats in the Knesset and allow other members of their parties to take their positions while they serve in the cabinet; this would have resulted in more active members of the legislature being present in regular sessions and committee meetings. This proposed law has also been favoured by other politicians, including [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/netanyahu-considering-forcing-ministers-to-vacate-knesset-seats-1.270057 Netanyahu considering forcing ministers to vacate Knesset seats] Haaretz, 13 February 2009</ref>

==Elections==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}
{{main|Elections in Israel}}
The 120 members of the Knesset (MKs)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/by-the-lists-all-120-incoming-knesset-members/|title=All 120 incoming Knesset members|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=6 June 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> are popularly elected from a single nationwide electoral district to concurrent four-year terms, subject to calls for early elections (which are quite common). All Israeli citizens 18 years or older may vote in legislative elections, which are conducted by [[secret ballot]].

Knesset seats are allocated among the various parties using the [[D'Hondt method]] of [[party list proportional representation]]. A party or electoral alliance must pass the [[election threshold]] of 3.25%<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=11193 www.knesset.gov.il]</ref> of the overall vote to be allocated a Knesset seat. Parties select their candidates using a [[closed list]]. Thus, voters select the party of their choice, not any specific candidate.

The electoral threshold was previously set at 1% from 1949 to 1992, then 1.5% from 1992 to 2003, and then 2% until March 2014 when the current threshold of 3.25% was passed (effective with elections for the 20th Knesset).<ref name="newthreshold325">{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.579289 | title=Israel raises electoral threshold to 3.25 percent | work=Haaretz | date=12 March 2014 | accessdate=8 January 2015 | author=Lis, Jonathan}}</ref> As a result of the low threshold, a typical Knesset has 10 or more factions represented. With so many parties, it is nearly impossible for one party or faction to govern alone, let alone win a majority. No party or faction has ever won the 61 seats necessary for a majority; the closest being the 56 seats won by the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] in the [[1969 Israeli legislative election|1969 elections]] (the Alignment had briefly held 63 seats going into the 1969 elections after being formed shortly beforehand by the merger of several parties, the only occasion on which any party or faction has ever held a majority). Every Israeli government has been a coalition of two or more parties.

After an election, the president meets with the leaders of every party that won Knesset seats and asks them to recommend which party leader should form the government. The president then nominates the party leader who is most likely to command the support of a majority in the Knesset (though not necessarily the leader of the largest party/faction in the chamber). The prime minister-designate has 42 days to put together a viable coalition (extensions can be granted and often are), and then must win a vote of confidence in the Knesset before taking office.

==Functioning==
Despite numerous [[motion of no confidence|motions of no confidence]] being tabled in the Knesset, a government has only been defeated by one once,<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_work_mel5.htm The Plenum - Motions of No-Confidence] Knesset website</ref> when [[Yitzhak Shamir]]'s [[Twenty-third government of Israel|government]] was brought down on 15 March 1990 as part of a plot that became known as "[[The dirty trick (Israel)|the dirty trick]]" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: התרגיל המסריח, ''HaTargil HaMasriaḥ'', lit. "the stinking trick").

However, several governments have resigned as a result of no-confidence motions, even when they were not defeated. These include the [[Fifth government of Israel|fifth government]], which fell after Prime Minister [[Moshe Sharett]] resigned in June 1955 following the abstention of the [[General Zionists]] (part of the governing coalition) during a vote of no-confidence;<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/history/eng/eng_hist2_s.htm Factional and Government Make-Up of the Second Knesset] Knesset website</ref> the [[Ninth government of Israel|ninth government]], which fell after Prime Minister Ben-Gurion resigned in January 1961 over a motion of no-confidence on the [[Lavon Affair]];<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/history/eng/eng_hist4_s.htm Factional and Government Make-Up of the Fourth Knesset] Knesset website</ref> and the [[Seventeenth government of Israel|seventeenth government]], which resigned in December 1976 after the [[National Religious Party]] (part of the governing coalition) abstained in a motion of no-confidence against the government.

==History==
[[File:Frumin entrance.jpg|thumb|Historic engraving on the [[Frumin House]], [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George St., Jerusalem]]]]
The Knesset first convened on 14 February 1949, following the [[1949 Israeli legislative election|20 January elections]], replacing the [[Provisional State Council]] which acted as Israel's official legislature from its date of independence on 14 May 1948 and succeeding the [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandatory Palestine)|Assembly of Representatives]] that had functioned as the [[Yishuv|Jewish community]]'s representative body during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate]] era.

The Knesset compound sits on a hilltop in western Jerusalem in a district known as [[Sheikh Badr]] before the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], now [[Givat Ram]]. The main building was financed by [[James de Rothschild (politician)|James de Rothschild]] as a gift to the State of Israel in his will and was completed in 1966. It was built on land leased from the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/771564.html Defacement in Jerusalem monastery threatens diplomatic crisis] Haaretz, 8 October 2006</ref> Over the years, significant additions to the structure were constructed, however, these were built at levels below and behind the main 1966 structure as not to detract from the original assembly building's appearance.

Before the construction of its permanent home, the Knesset met in the [[Jewish Agency]] building in Jerusalem, the Kessem Cinema building in Tel Aviv and the [[Frumin House|Froumine building]] in Jerusalem.<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/beit_fromin_eng.htm Beit Froumine]. Knesset.gov.il (30 August 1966). Retrieved 8 September 2011.</ref>

===Knesset assemblies===
Each Knesset session is known by its election number. Thus the Knesset elected by Israel's first election in 1949 is known as the '''First Knesset'''. The current Knesset, elected in 2020, is the Twenty-third Knesset.

==Security==
[[File:Knesset Guard P5200034.JPG|thumb|right|120px|upright|A member of the Knesset Guard]]
The Knesset is protected by the [[Knesset Guard]], a [[protective security unit]] responsible for the security of the Knesset building and Knesset members. Guards are stationed outside the building to provide armed protection, and ushers are stationed inside to maintain order. The Knesset Guard also plays a ceremonial role, participating in state ceremonies, which includes greeting dignitaries on [[Mount Herzl]] on the eve of [[Yom HaAtzmaut|Israeli Independence Day]].

==Public perception==
A poll conducted by the [[Israeli Democracy Institute]] in April and May 2014 showed that while a majority of both Jews and Arabs in Israel are proud to be citizens of the country, both groups share a distrust of Israel's government, including the Knesset. Almost three quarters of Israelis surveyed said corruption in Israel's political leadership was either "widespread or somewhat prevalent". A majority of both Arabs and Jews trusted the [[Israel Defense Forces]], the [[President of Israel]], and the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], but Jews and Arabs reported similar levels of mistrust, with little more than a third of each group claiming confidence in the Knesset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jews-and-arabs-proud-to-be-israeli-distrust-government/|title="Tamar Pileggi 'Jews and Arabs proud to be Israeli, distrust government: Poll conducted before war shows marked rise in support for state among Arabs; religious establishment scores low on trust'|last=Pileggi|first=Tamar|date=4 January 2015|work=The Times of Israel}}</ref>
