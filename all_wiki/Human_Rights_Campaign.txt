The '''Human Rights Campaign''' ('''HRC''') is the largest [[LGBTQ]] [[advocacy group]] and political [[lobbying]] organization in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/10/gay.forum/|title=Democratic hopefuls pressed on gay issues at forum|date=August 10, 2007|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref> The organization focuses on protecting and expanding [[LGBT rights in the United States|rights for LGBTQ individuals]], most notably advocating for [[same-sex marriage]], anti-discrimination and [[hate crime]]s legislation, and [[HIV/AIDS]] advocacy. The organization has a number of legislative initiatives as well as supporting resources for LGBTQ individuals.

==Structure==
HRC is an umbrella group of two separate [[non-profit organization]]s and a [[political action committee]]: the HRC Foundation, a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN FOUNDATION|url=https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/521481896|publisher=ProPublica|access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> organization that focuses on research, advocacy and education; the Human Rights Campaign, a [[501(c)|501(c)(4)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Rights Campaign|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/nonprof_contrib_summ.php?id=521243457|website=OpenSecrets.org|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> organization that focuses on promoting [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] (LGBTQ) rights through lobbying Congress and state and local officials for support of pro-LGBTQ bills, and mobilizing grassroots action amongst its members; and the HRC [[Political Action Committee]], a super PAC which supports and opposes political candidates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Leven|first1=Rachel|title=Human Rights Campaign creates super-PAC|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/202105-human-rights-campaign-creates-super-pac|access-date=16 September 2015|newspaper=The Hill|date=January 3, 2012}}</ref>

===Leadership===
The Human Rights Campaign's leadership includes President [[Alphonso David]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Simon |first1=Carolyn |title=We Will Win: Get to Know New HRC President Alphonso David |url=https://www.hrc.org/blog/we-will-win-get-to-know-new-hrc-president-alphonso-david |website=Human Rights Campaign |access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> HRC's work is supported by three boards: the Board of Directors, which is the governing body for the organization; the HRC Foundation Board, which manages the foundation's finances and establishes official policies governing the foundation; and the Board of Governors, which manages the organization's local outreach nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=The HRC Story: Boards|url=https://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/boards|work=hrc.org|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=August 24, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Human Right Campaign headquarters.JPG|thumb|Human Rights Campaign headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[Steve Endean]], who had worked with a previously established [[Gay Rights National Lobby]] from 1978, established the Human Rights Campaign Fund [[political action committee]] in 1980.<ref name="Endean">{{Failed verification|date=January 2020}} {{cite news|last1=Lambert|first1=Bruce|title=Stephen R.

In 1983, [[Vic Basile]], at the time one of the leading LGBT rights activists in Washington, D.C., was elected as the first executive director. In October 1986, the HRC Foundation (HRCF) was formed as a non-profit organization.<ref name="Basile">{{cite book|last1=Haggerty|first1=George|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Bonnie|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures|date=2003|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=9781135578718|page=710}}</ref>

In January 1989, Basile announced his departure, and HRC reorganized from serving mainly as a political action committee (PAC) to broadening its function to encompass lobbying, research, education, and media outreach.<ref name=HRCJournal-history>{{cite journal|last=Birch|first=Elizabeth|title=The Human Rights Campaign: So Much More Than a Fund.|date=Fall 1995|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|pages=2â€“3|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/human_rights_campaign.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213150637/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/human_rights_campaign.html|archive-date=2012-02-13}}</ref> HRC decided on a new Statement of Purpose: "For the promotion of the social welfare of the gay and lesbian community by drafting, supporting and influencing legislation and policy at the federal, state and local level." [[Tim McFeeley]], a [[Harvard Law School]] graduate, founder of the Boston Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance, and a co-chair of the [[New England]] HRC Committee, was elected the new executive director. Total membership was then approximately 25,000 members.<ref name=Bailey-history>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Mark|title="Human Rights Campaign."

In 1992, HRC endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, [[Bill Clinton]]. In March 1993, HRC began a new project, [[National Coming Out Day]]. From January 1995 until January 2004, [[Elizabeth Birch]] served as the executive director of the HRC. Under her leadership, the institution more than quadrupled its membership to 500,000 members.<ref name="Birch">{{cite web|last=Althafer|first=Emily|title=Leading gay rights advocate to speak at UF|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2006/01/23/human-rights-talk/|publisher=University of Florida News: source: Adelisse Fontanet, xxx-1665 ext. 326|access-date=February 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916211856/http://news.ufl.edu/2006/01/23/human-rights-talk/|archive-date=September 16, 2006}}</ref>

In 1995, the organization dropped the word "Fund" from its name, becoming the Human Rights Campaign. That same year, it underwent a complete reorganization. The HRC Foundation added new programs such as the Workplace Project and the Family Project, while HRC itself broadly expanded its research, communications, and marketing/public relations functions. The organization also unveiled a new [[logo]], a yellow equal sign inside of a blue square.<ref name="HRC Logo">{{cite web|title=The HRC Story: About Our Logo|url=https://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/about-our-logo|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=February 22, 2012}}</ref>

[[Image:ChicagoGayPride2005 1.jpg|thumb|The Human Rights Campaign often has a large presence at LGBT-related events such as the [[Chicago Pride Parade]] as seen above.]]
As part of the activities surrounding the [[Millennium March on Washington]], the HRC Foundation sponsored a fundraising concert at Washington, D.C.'s [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 29, 2000. Billed as a concert to end hate crimes, "Equality Rocks" honored hate crime victims and their families, such as featured speakers Dennis and [[Judy Shepard]], the parents of [[Matthew Shepard]]. The event included [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Albita RodrÃ­guez]], and [[Chaka Khan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=More Artists Added to Equality Rocks: Michael Feinstein, Chaka Khan, Kathy Najimy and Rufus Wainwright Join Garth Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Melissa Etheridge, Anne Heche, Kristen Johnston, kd lang, Nathan Lane and Pet Shop Boys To Benefit the Human Rights Campaign Foundation|url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041200a.asp|publisher=nyrock.com World Beat|access-date=February 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115095023/http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041200a.asp|archive-date=November 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name="concert-hate crimes">{{cite web|title=Resources: Hate Crimes Timeline|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/hate-crimes-timeline#2000|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=February 22, 2012}}</ref>

Elizabeth Birch's successor, [[Cheryl Jacques]], resigned in November 2004 after only 11 months as executive director. Jacques said she had resigned over "a difference in management philosophy".<ref name="Jacques">{{cite news|last1=Seelye|first1=Katharine|title=Gay Advocacy Group Says Its President Is Resigning|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/politics/gay-advocacy-group-says-its-president-is-resigning.html|access-date=15 September 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 1, 2004}}</ref>

In March 2005, HRC announced the appointment of [[Joe Solmonese]] as the president.

HRC launched its Religion and Faith Program in 2005 to mobilize clergy to advocate for LGBT people, and helped form DC Clergy United for Marriage Equality, which was involved in the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia]].<ref name="Fenty to sign same-sex marriage bill at church in NW D.C.">{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/17/AR2009121704330.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Nikita | last=Stewart | title=Fenty to sign same-sex marriage bill at church in NW D.C | date=December 18, 2009}}</ref> On March 10, 2010, the first legally recognized same-sex weddings in the [[District of Columbia]] were held at the headquarters of the Human Rights Campaign.<ref name="First gay marriages in District performed">{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/09/AR2010030901904.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Ann E. | last1=Marimow | first2=Keith L. | last2=Alexander | title=First gay marriages in District performed | date=March 10, 2010}}</ref>

===Annual fundraisers===
Each year since 1997, HRC has hosted a national dinner that serves as the organization's single largest annual fundraiser. In 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] spoke at HRC's 13th Annual National Dinner. In his speech, President Obama reaffirmed his pledge to repeal "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), as well as his commitment to passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.<ref name="Huffington Post â€“ Obama HRC Speech">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/10/obama-says-he-will-end-do_n_316524.html|title=Obama HRC Speech: "I Will End Don't Ask, Don't Tell," Says President Obama|date=October 10, 2009|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref> He gave the keynote speech in 2011 as well, reiterating his pledge to fight for DOMA repeal and for the passage of ENDA, and to combat bullying of LGBT youth.

===HRC historical records===
The historical records of the Human Rights Campaign are maintained in a collection at the [[Cornell University Library]]. Arriving at Cornell in 2004, the records include [[strategic planning]] documents, faxes, minutes, e-mails, press releases, posters, and campaign buttons. Taking up {{convert|84|cuft|m3}}, the archive is the second largest in the library's Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Human Sexuality Collection. In February 2007, the archive was opened to scholars at the library, and selected records were organized into an online exhibit called "25 Years of Political Influence: The Records of the Human Rights Campaign".<ref>Lowery, George.

In recent years, HRC has addressed discrimination in health care settings for LGBT employees, patients and their families. Since 2007, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation has published the "Healthcare Equality Index", which rates hospitals on issues such as patient and employee non-discrimination policies, employee [[cultural competence|cultural competency]] training, and hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients' families.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petty|first1=Janie|title=Tallahassee memorial highlighted in Healthcare Equality Index 2014|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/life/chronicle/2014/11/21/tallahassee-memorial-highlighted-healthcare-equality-index/19333703/|access-date=16 September 2015|newspaper=The Tallahassee Democrat|date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

HRC shared a red version of its logo â€“ selected by marketing director Anastasia Khoo because the color is synonymous with love â€“ on [[social network service]]s on March 25, 2013, and asked its supporters to do the same to show support for same-sex marriage in light of two cases that were before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]''). The logo went viral, and [[Facebook]] saw a 120% increase in the number of profile photo changes on March 26. Celebrities such as [[George Takei]], [[BeyoncÃ© Knowles|Beyonce]], [[Sophia Bush]], [[Padma Lakshmi]], [[Martha Stewart]], [[Macklemore]], [[Ryan Lewis]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]] shared the logo with their millions of followers on social network services and politicians like [[Claire McCaskill|Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO)]], [[Jay Rockefeller|Jay Rockefeller (D-WV)]], and [[Kay Hagan|Kay Hagan (D-NC)]] did the same.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thielman|first=Sam|title=DOMA Nation: The Human Rights Campaign had no idea this was going to happen|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/doma-nation-148206|access-date=June 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Adweek]]|date=March 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wjla.com/features/working-women/working-women-anastasia-khoo-builds-viral-content-for-human-rights-campaign-108694|title=Working Women: Anastasia Khoo builds viral content for Human Rights Campaign|author=Alison Starling|work=wjla.com}}</ref>

==Criticism and controversies==
Critics have taken HRC to task for its working environment. In the fall of 2014, HRC commissioned outside consultants to conduct a series of focus groups and surveys with the organization's staff. In the report, which was obtained by [[BuzzFeed]], staff of the organization described the working environment at HRC as "judgmental", "exclusionary", "sexist", and "homogenous". The report stated that "Leadership culture is experienced as homogenous â€” gay, white, male." Acknowledging the report, HRC president Chad Griffin said: "Like many organizations and companies throughout our country, HRC has embarked on a thoughtful and comprehensive diversity and inclusion effort with the goals of better representing the communities we serve."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/internal-report-major-diversity-organizational-problems-at-h#.ejaYK5MjO|title=Internal Report: Major Diversity, Organizational Problems At Human Rights Campaign|date=June 3, 2015|publisher=BuzzFeed|last1=Geider|first1=Chris|access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> In August 2015, [[Pride at Work]], an LGBT affiliate of the [[AFLâ€“CIO]], approved a resolution that calls on member organizations to stop funding HRC until the group addresses what Pride at Work sees as problems with HRC's Corporate Equality Index.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brydum|first1=Sunnivie|title=Pride at Work Tells HRC: 'Enough Is Enough'|url=http://www.advocate.com/business/2015/08/30/pride-work-tells-human-rights-campaign-enough-enough|access-date=16 September 2015|publisher=The Advocate|date=August 30, 2015}}</ref>

=== Endorsement of Republican candidates ===
Critics of the HRC have accused the organization of favoring the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. [[Andrew Sullivan]], a gay political columnist and blogger, has been critical of the HRC, calling it "a patronage wing of the Democratic party."<ref>Sullivan, Andrew.

HRC was criticized for its endorsement of New York Republican [[Al D'Amato]] in his 1998 campaign for re-election to the U.S. Senate. HRC defended the endorsement because of D'Amato's support for the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) and the repeal of "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]". However, many liberal LGBT leaders objected to D'Amato's conservative stances, including his opposition to [[affirmative action]] and [[abortion]], and thought that HRC should have taken those positions into account when deciding on the endorsement.<ref>Kaiser, Charles.

In 2014, long-time supporter of same-sex marriage [[Shenna Bellows]] was nominated for a U.S. Senate seat in Maine. HRC endorsed her opponent, incumbent Republican Senator [[Susan Collins]], who had previously lacked a history of supporting same-sex marriage initiatives. However, Collins later clarified her view in support of it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/susan-collins-human-rights-campaign_n_5530867.html|title=Susan Collins Endorsed By Major Gay Rights Group, Despite Not Backing Marriage Equality|date=June 25, 2014|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref>
