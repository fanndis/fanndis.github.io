'''Michel Miguel Elias Temer Lulia''' ({{IPA-pt|miˈʃɛw miˈɡɛw eˈliɐs ˈtemeɾ luˈliɐ|br}}; born 23 September 1940) is a Brazilian politician, lawyer and writer who served as the [[List of Presidents of Brazil|37th]] [[president of Brazil]] from 31 August 2016 to 31 December 2018. He took office after the [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|impeachment]] and removal from office of his predecessor [[Dilma Rousseff]]. He had been [[Vice President of Brazil|vice president]] since 2011 and Acting President since 12 May 2016, when Rousseff was suspended pending an impeachment trial.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/dilma-rousseff-brazil-president-impeached-senate-vote |title=Dilma Rousseff suspended as senate votes to impeach Brazilian president |last=Watts |first=Jonathan |date=12 May 2016 |work=The Guardian |access-date=3 September 2016 |language=en |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> At the age of 75, he is the oldest person to have taken the office.

The Senate's 61–20 vote on 31 August 2016 to remove Rousseff from office meant that Temer succeeded her and served out the remainder of her second year term. In his first speech in office, Temer called for a government of "national salvation" and asked for the trust of the Brazilian people.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36283027 |title=Brazil impeachment: New leader Temer calls for trust |date=13 May 2016 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=13 May 2016 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> He also signaled his intention to overhaul the pension system and labor laws, and to curb public spending.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/michel-temer-seeks-new-start-as-brazils-president-1472676685|title=Michel Temer Seeks New Start as Brazil's President|last1=Magalhaes|first1=Luciana|date=31 August 2016|last2=Jelmayer|first2=Rogerio|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=3 September 2016|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Tietê, São Paulo]], Temer is the son of Nakhoul "Miguel" Elias Temer Lulia and March Barbar Lulia, [[Maronite Catholic]] [[Lebanese Brazilian|Lebanese immigrants]] who came to Brazil in 1925.<ref name="PRES">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.planalto.gov.br/acompanhe-planalto|title=Biografia – Michel Temer, presidente da República|work=Portal do Planalto|date=12 May 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2015/04/10/opinion/1428617634_077955.html|first=Juan|last=Arias|title=O cardeal Temer|work=El País Brasil|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=2 February 2017|language=pt}}</ref> His parents, along with three older siblings, immigrated to Brazil from [[Btaaboura|Abadiyeh]], a small village in northern [[Lebanon]], to escape [[Great Famine of Mount Lebanon|famine]] and [[Aftermath of World War I|instability due]] to [[World War I]]. In Brazil, his parents had five more children, and Temer is the youngest.

As a child, Temer dreamed of becoming a [[pianist]]. However, there were no piano teachers in his city.<ref>{{Cite news|first1=Adriano|last1=Ceolin|first2=Severino|last2=Motta|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/eleicoes/agora-com-dilma-temer-quase-foi-vice-de-serra/n1237660566498.html|title=Agora com Dilma, Temer quase foi vice de Serra|newspaper=Último Segundo|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref> As a teenager, he wanted to be a writer.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|first=Sérgio|last=Rodas|url=http://www.conjur.com.br/2016-abr-16/houver-impeachment-michel-temer-22-advogado-presidente|title=Se houver impeachment, Michel Temer será 22º advogado a presidir o Brasil|newspaper=Consultor Jurídico|language=pt-BR|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref> After failing chemistry and physics classes in his first year of high school, he gave up the "curso científico", which prioritized hard sciences and math. In 1957, he moved to [[São Paulo]] to finish high school in the "curso clássico", composed mainly of subjects in the humanities and languages.

In 1959, like his four older brothers he joined the [[Law School, University of São Paulo|Law School of the University of São Paulo]], graduating in 1963.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://observador.pt/especiais/michel-temer-brasileiro-paciente/|title=Michel Temer, o paciente.

In 1962, Temer ran for the presidency of the union, but was defeated by 82 votes.<ref name=":1" />

Temer stayed neutral before the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup d'état]].<ref name=":0" /> With the beginning of [[Brazilian military government|military rule]], he moved away from politics. In 1974, he completed a doctorate in [[public law]] at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]] (PUC-SP).

Temer has often confirmed his affiliation as a [[Roman Catholic]].<ref name="www1.folha.uol.com.br">{{Cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/05/1769102-vilarejo-libanes-do-filho-michel-temer-segue-igreja-ortodoxa-grega.shtml |title=Vilarejo libanês do 'filho Michel Temer' segue igreja ortodoxa grega |date=8 May 2016 |website=Folha de S.Paulo |publisher=Grupo Folha |access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>

==Academic career==
[[File:Michel Temer colar do Mérito Judiciário - Cortada.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Temer receives the "judicial merit medal"]]
In 1968, Temer began teaching [[constitutional law]] at [[Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo|PUC-SP]], where he also taught [[Private law|civil law]] and was director of the postgraduate department and of the Brazilian Institute Of Constitutional Law as well as a member of the Ibero-American Institute of Constitutional Law.

===Publications===
Temer published four major works in constitutional law. His most famous book is ''Elements of Constitutional Law'', published in 1982, which sold over 240,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Thiago|last=Guimarães|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/03/1755944-temer-ja-foi-chamado-de-charmosao-e-de-mordomo-de-filme-de-terror.shtml|title=Conheça Temer, poeta chamado de 'charmosão' e de professor 'bonzinho'|date=31 March 2016|work=Folha de S.Paulo|publisher=Grupo Folha|access-date=23 January 2017|language=pt}}</ref> The book focuses on the organization of the Brazilian state, especially on the [[separation of powers]].

His 2006 book ''Democracy and Citizenship'' highlighted the relevance of law and included some of his speeches as a federal deputy. In his works, he showed himself to be a supporter of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]] and a [[Recall election|political recall]] system, while opposing [[economic interventionism]] and tax increases.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.conjur.com.br/2016-abr-17/livros-revelam-posicoes-temer-tambem-arriscou-poesia|title=Livros revelam posições de Temer, que também se arriscou na poesia|newspaper=Consultor Jurídico|language=pt-BR|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>

However, he considered himself a writer only in 2013, when he published ''Anonymous Intimacy'', a book of poems. It consists of 120 poems, many of which were written on napkins during his plane trips between São Paulo and [[Brasília|Brasílla]].<ref name=":2" /> Temer said writing poems helped him recover from the "barren arena of legislative politics".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.faditu.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=201:michel-temer-lanca-livro-de-poesia-em-sao-paulo&catid=79&Itemid=172|title=Michel Temer lança livro de poesia em São Paulo|website=www.faditu.com.br|url-access=subscription|language=pt-BR|access-date=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601190054/http://www.faditu.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=201:michel-temer-lanca-livro-de-poesia-em-sao-paulo&catid=79&Itemid=172|archive-date=1 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Investigations===
[[File:Michel Temer recebe vice-presidente norte-americano.jpg|thumb|Temer with [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] at the [[Itamaraty Palace]] in [[Brasília]], 11 October 2013.]]
In 2016, he was accused of having a lobbyist bribe others between 1997 and 2001 in ethanol deals through state-run oil company [[Petrobras]]. He was also under investigation for accepting more than $1.5 million in funds from construction company [[Camargo Correa]], which works with Petrobras. Spreadsheets from the construction company listed Temer's name 21 times. The numbers next to his name added up to $345,000, which authorities alleged were bribes and which Temer said were legal campaign contributions.<ref name=APMenLine>{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/05b443cf3bb74b5e8fdc36b83ac1c367|title=2 men in line for Brazilian presidency accused of corruption|work=Associated Press|publisher=2 men in line for Brazilian presidency accused of corruption|date=May 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.vox.com/2016/5/24/11760336/romero-juca-tape |title=A Brazilian Cabinet member was just caught on tape plotting to take down the president|work=Vox|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> The claim was dismissed by the courts, and Temer denied any wrongdoing.<ref name=APMenLine/> Temer has also been accused of electoral fraud; in 2016, he allegedly solicited $2.9m in illegal campaign donations in 2014. Part of investigation is into whether bribe money helped fund the 2014 campaign that saw Dilma Rousseff re-elected president with Temer as her running mate; Temer also denies this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/brazil-president-michel-temer-illegal-campaign-donations|title=Brazil president Michel Temer accused of soliciting millions in illegal donations|last=Phillips|first=Dom|date=2016-12-12|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref>

In 2017 Brazil's federal police said that investigators have found evidence the president received bribes to help businesses. A released video made by investigators shows Rodrigo Rocha Loures, former Temer aide, carrying a suitcase filled with about $150,000 in cash allegedly being sent from [[JBS S.A.]] to the president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/21/brazil-police-claim-to-have-evidence-president-michel-temer-received-bribes|title=Brazil: police claim to have evidence President Michel Temer received bribes|agency=Associated Press|date=2017-06-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref>

In 2018, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice ordered Temer be included in an ongoing investigation into $3.07 million in illicit funds his Brazilian Democratic Party allegedly received from construction firm Odebrecht.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/21/brazil-police-claim-to-have-evidence-president-michel-temer-received-bribes|title=Brazil: police claim to have evidence President Michel Temer received bribes|agency=Associated Press|date=2017-06-21|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref>

===Role in the impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff ===
In 2015 and 2016, Temer was involved in controversy as [[Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff|Dilma Rousseff's impeachment process]] unfolded. In December 2015, Temer sent a letter to the president complaining about his distance from government decisions. The letter began with the Latin proverb "[[Verba volant, scripta manent|''Verba Volant, Scripta Manent'']]" (spoken words fly, written words remain). Temer described the communication as a "personal" unburdening about various complaints against the president. He said Rousseff had made him look like a "decorative" vice president, not an active one, despite having been invited to support her government several times in the dialogue with Congress, a role he only accepted in 2015.

The letter was commented on and mocked in Brazilian social media, with images depicting the vice president as a Christmas decoration, making fun of his use of Latin, and photos purporting to show the president laughing as she read the missive, among many other things. The president's office had no immediate comment on the images,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Brazil Vice President Sends Letter Criticizing President Dilma Rousseff |last1=Trevisani|first1=Paulo|last2=Jelmayer |first2=Rogerio|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=8 December 2015 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-vice-president-sends-letter-criticizing-president-dilma-rousseff-1449576925|access-date=17 April 2016 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> but Rousseff condemned him as a traitor to her administration.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Romero, Simon |date=21 April 2016 |title=Brazil's Vice President, Unpopular and Under Scrutiny, Prepares to Lead |newspaper=The New York Times|url-access=limited |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/world/americas/michel-temer-prepares-to-lead-brazil.html |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hQhr8hUD?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/world/americas/michel-temer-prepares-to-lead-brazil.html?_r=0 |archive-date=11 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 2016, an audio file of Temer was leaked to the media. In it, Temer speaks as if the impeachment process had already ended and he was the new [[President of Brazil|president]].<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Anna |last1=Edgerton |first2=Raymond |last2=Colitt |date=11 April 2016 |title=Leaked Brazil Tape Shows VP Temer Practicing Unity Address |website=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/brazil-s-vp-practices-national-unity-speech-in-leaked-audio |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hQdQnxaF?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/brazil-s-vp-practices-national-unity-speech-in-leaked-audio |archive-date=11 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> "I don't want to generate false expectations," Temer said on the recordings, which were first published by ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' on 23 May. "Let's not think that a possible change in government will solve everything in three or four months."

The leak came just hours before a special lower house committee was scheduled to vote whether to back the request to impeach the president, generating complaints and accusations of treachery and lack of support from a vice president conspiring against the elected president. Temer alleged it was sent incorrectly to a [[WhatsApp]] group of his party's representatives in Congress.

===Acting president===
[[File:Michel Temer Ministerial meeting.jpg|thumb|right|Vice President Temer holds his first cabinet meeting as Acting President at the [[Planalto Palace]], 13 May 2016.]]
[[File:2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony 1035350-olimpiadas abertura-1328.jpg|thumb|right|Temer attended the [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]]]]
In the early hours of 12 May 2016, the Federal Senate voted to accept Rousseff's impeachment. Per the Brazilian Constitution, Rousseff's powers were suspended and Temer became acting president. Temer was to serve as acting president for up to 180 days while the Senate decided whether to convict Rousseff and remove her from office, which would make Temer president for the remainder of her term, or to acquit her of ''crimes of responsibility'' charges and restore her presidential powers. Temer was awaiting a decision from the Supreme Federal Court to start an [[Impeachment proposal against Michel Temer|impeachment process against him]].

On his first day as acting president, Vice President Temer appointed a new cabinet, reducing the number of ministries from 31 to 22. Women's rights and Afro-Brazilian rights activists criticized the fact that all of the appointed ministers were white men, for the first time since 1979.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shannonsims/2016/05/12/brazils-new-president-michel-temer-fills-cabinet-with-only-men/#3cfa2d3340c6|title=Brazil's New President Michel Temer Fills Cabinet With Only Men|last=Sims|first=Shannon|date=12 May 2016|website=Forbes|access-date=4 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/brazil-cabinet-rousseff-temer/483372/|title=Who's Missing From Brazil's Cabinet?|last=Koren|first=Marina|date=25 May 2016|website=The Atlantic|access-date=4 September 2016}}</ref>

On 2 June 2016, Temer received an eight-year ban from running for office after being convicted of violating election laws. This effectively ended any chance of Temer running for a full term as president in [[2018 Brazilian general election|the 2018 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/06/03/credibility-of-brazils-interim-president-collapses-receives-8-year-ban-on-running/|title=Credibility of Brazil's Interim President Collapses as He Receives 8-Year Ban on Running for Office|work=[[The Intercept]]|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> It can be argued that he was already ineligible to run in 2018 in any event. Under the Constitution, the vice president becomes acting president whenever the president travels abroad. Due to the manner in which the Constitution's provisions on term limits are worded, whenever a vice president serves as acting president for any reason, it counts toward the limit of two consecutive terms.

As acting president, he [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opened]] the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 5 August 2016.

On 2 August, lawmakers in the lower house in Congress voted not to refer the case against the scandal-plagued President to the supreme court, which has the power to try him.

Raised by [[Maronites|Maronite]] parents, Temer considers himself a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/05/1769102-vilarejo-libanes-do-filho-michel-temer-segue-igreja-ortodoxa-grega.shtml |title=Vilarejo libanês do 'filho Michel Temer' segue igreja ortodoxa grega |newspaper=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=8 May 2016 |accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>

Temer and his first wife Maria Célia Toledo had three daughters: Luciana (1969), Maristela (1972), and Clarissa (1974). 
Temer is also father to Eduardo (born in 1999 in [[London]]) with journalist Érica Ferraz.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,foco-no-poder-e-agora-na-propria-biografia,10000050674 |title=Foco no poder e, agora, na própria biografia |newspaper=[[Estadão]]|date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/cotidian/ff26039926.htm |title=Filho de brasileiro nasce no exterior e fica sem nacionalidade
