An '''NRJ Music Award''' (commonly abbreviated as an '''NMA''') is an award presented by the French radio station [[NRJ]] to honor the best in the French and worldwide music industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seecannes.com/news/winners-of-the-cannes-nrj-music-awards-2017-cannes-712137|website=See|publisher=See|accessdate=4 November 2017 |title=Winners of Cannes NRJ Music Awards 2017}}</ref> 

The awards ceremony, created in 2000 by NRJ in partnership with the [[television]] network [[TF1]], traditionally took place every year in mid-January at [[Cannes]] ([[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], [[France]]) as the opening of [[MIDEM]] (''Marché international de l'édition musicale''). It is now held in the month of November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cannes-or-bust.com/cannes-events/nrj-music-awards/|website=Cannes or Bust|publisher=Cannes or Bust|accessdate=4 November 2015 |title=NRJ Music Awards}}</ref> They give out awards to popular musicians in different categories.

The name "[[NRJ Group|NRJ]]" means  "Nouvelle Radio des Jeunes" (new radio of the young). It is a play on words between the pronunciation of the French letters and the French word "énergie" (energy).

[[Val Kahl]] hosted and presented "Les Coulisses des NRJ Music Awards" Season 2011, 2012 and 2013 on [[NRJ12]].
