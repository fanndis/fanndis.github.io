A minority of Anglo-Catholics, sometimes called [[Anglican Papalism|Anglican Papalists]], consider themselves under [[papal supremacy]] even though they are not in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. Such Anglo-Catholics, especially in England, often celebrate Mass according to the [[Mass of Paul VI|contemporary Roman Catholic rite]] and are concerned with seeking reunion with the Roman Catholic Church.

In addition, members of the [[personal ordinariate]]s for former Anglicans created by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] are sometimes unofficially referred to as "Anglican Catholics".<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Anglican Catholic Ordinariate to be Established in June 2012|url=http://www.catholicanada.com/2012/05/note-australian-anglican-catholic-ordinariate-to-be-established-in-june/|publisher=Catholic Canada|date=May 2012|accessdate=31 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011061100/http://www.catholicanada.com/2012/05/note-australian-anglican-catholic-ordinariate-to-be-established-in-june/|archive-date=11 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Anglican Catholic ordinariate for US formally established| url= http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=12832| publisher= Catholic Culture | accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
Following the passing of the [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy]] and [[Henry VIII]]'s break with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of England]] continued to adhere to traditional Catholic teachings and did not initially make any alterations to doctrine.<ref>{{cite book |last=Scruton |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |date=1996 |title=A Dictionary of Political Thought |publisher=Macmillan |page=470 |isbn=978-0-333-64786-8}}</ref> The ''[[Ten Articles]]'' were published in 1536 and constitute the first official Anglican articles of faith.<ref>Schofield, John (2006).

A major shift in Anglican doctrine came in the reign of Henry's son, [[Edward VI]], who repealed the ''Six Articles''{{sfn|Simon|1979|p=215}} and under whose rule the Church of England became more identifiably Protestant. Though the Church's practices and approach to the sacraments became strongly influenced by those of [[Europe|continental]] reformers,{{sfn|Pavlac|2011|p=182}} it nevertheless retained [[episcopal polity|episcopal]] church structure.<ref>Bagchi, David V.

=== Oxford Movement ===
{{Main|Oxford Movement}}

The modern Anglo-Catholic movement began with the [[Oxford Movement]] in the [[Victorian era]], sometimes termed "Tractarianism".

In the early 19th century, various factors caused misgivings among English church people, including the decline of church life and the spread of unconventional practices in the Church of England. The British government's action in 1833 of beginning a reduction in the number of [[Church of Ireland]] bishoprics and archbishoprics inspired a sermon from [[John Keble]] in the University Church in Oxford on the subject of "[[National Apostasy]]". This sermon marked the inception of what became known as the Oxford Movement.

The principal objective of the Oxford Movement was the defence of the Church of England as a divinely-founded institution, of the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]] and of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' as a "rule of faith". The key idea was that Anglicanism was not a [[Protestant]] denomination but a [[Branch theory|branch]] of the historic Catholic Church, along with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches. It was argued that Anglicanism had preserved the historical apostolic succession of priests and bishops and thus the Catholic [[sacrament]]s. These ideas were promoted in a series of ninety "[[Tracts for the Times]]".

The principal leaders of the Oxford Movement were [[John Keble]], [[John Henry Newman]] and [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]]. The movement gained influential support, but it was also attacked by some bishops of the Church and by the [[latitudinarian]]s within the [[University of Oxford]], who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organization were of relatively little importance. Within the Oxford movement, there gradually arose a much smaller group which tended towards submission to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1845, the university censured a tract entitled ''Ideal of a Christian Church'' and its author, the pro-Roman Catholic theologian W. G. Ward, on which basis was imputed the moniker "[[W. G. Ward|Ideal Ward]]". The year 1850 saw the victory of the Evangelical cleric [[George Cornelius Gorham]] in a celebrated legal action against church authorities. Consequently, some Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship were received into the Roman Catholic Church, while others, such as [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]], embraced [[Latitudinarian|Latitudinarian Anglicanism]], and yet others, such as [[James Anthony Froude]], became [[Religious skepticism|sceptics]].<ref name="WHS1932">{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/whstowe/what1932.html|title=Anglo-Catholicism: What It Is Not and What It Is|last=Stowe|first=Walter Herbert|year=1932|publisher=Church Literature Association|accessdate=12 June 2015|location=London|quote=Newman and several of his inner circle went to Rome, but the vast majority of the Tractarians, including Keble and Pusey, never did. Another group of Tractarians, such as Mark Pattison and James Anthony Froude, lapsed into latitudinarianism or scepticism.}}</ref> The majority of adherents of the movement, however, remained in the Church of England and, despite hostility in the press and in government, the movement spread. Its liturgical practices were influential, as were its social achievements (including its slum settlements) and its revival of male and female monasticism within Anglicanism.

===Recent developments===

Since at least the 1970s, Anglo-Catholicism has been dividing into two distinct camps, along a fault-line which can perhaps be traced back to Bishop [[Charles Gore]]'s work in the 19th century.

The Oxford Movement had been inspired in the first place by a rejection of [[Liberal Christianity|liberalism]] and [[latitudinarianism]] in favour of the traditional faith of the "Church Catholic", defined by the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] and the common doctrines of the historical [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western Christian churches]].

[[File:Anglican Service Book (1991).jpg|thumb|left|[[Anglican Service Book]] (1991), a traditional-language version of the Book of Common Prayer]]

Because of the emphasis on upholding traditions, until the 1970s most Anglo-Catholics rejected liberalising development such as the conferral of [[holy orders]] on women. Present-day "traditionalist" Anglo-Catholics seek to maintain tradition and to keep Anglican doctrine in line with that of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. They often ally themselves with conservative [[evangelical Anglicans]] to defend traditional teachings on [[Fornication#Christianity|sexual morality]] and women's roles in the Church. The main organisation in the Church of England that opposes the ordination of women, [[Forward in Faith]], is largely composed of Anglo-Catholics.

[[Charles Gore|Gore's]] work, however, bearing the mark of liberal Protestant [[higher criticism]], paved the way for an alternative form of Anglo-Catholicism influenced by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]]. Thus in recent years, many Anglo-Catholics have accepted the [[ordination of women]], the use of [[inclusive language]] in Bible translations and the liturgy, and progressive attitudes towards [[homosexuality]] and the blessing of [[same-sex marriage|same sex unions]]. Such Anglicans often refer to themselves as "[[Liberal Anglo-Catholicism|Liberal Catholics]]". The more "progressive" or "liberal" style of Anglo-Catholicism is represented by [[Affirming Catholicism]] and the [[Society of Catholic Priests]].

A third strand of Anglican Catholicism criticises elements of both liberalism and conservatism, drawing instead on the 20th century Roman Catholic ''[[Nouvelle Théologie]]'', especially [[Henri de Lubac]]. This movement rejected the dominance of [[Thomism]] and [[Neo-Scholasticism]] in Catholic theology, and advocated instead for a "return to the sources" of the Christian faith (scripture and the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]) while remaining open to dialogue with the contemporary world on issues of theology.  [[John Milbank]] and others within this strand have been instrumental in the creation of the ecumenical (though predominantly Anglican and Roman Catholic) movement known as [[Radical Orthodoxy]].

Some traditionalist Anglo-Catholics have left official Anglicanism to form "[[Continuing Anglican Movement|continuing Anglican churches]]" such as those in the [[Anglican Catholic Church]] and [[Traditional Anglican Communion]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Others such as [[Ann Widdecombe]] have left Anglicanism altogether for the Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches, in the belief that liberal doctrinal changes in the Anglican churches have gone too far.

=== Anglican ordinariates ===
{{Main|Personal ordinariate}}

In late 2009, in response to requests from various groups of Anglicans around the world who were dissatisfied with liberalizing movements within the Anglican Communion, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued the [[apostolic constitution]] ''Anglicanorum Coetibus''. This document invites groups of traditionalist Anglicans to form what are termed "Anglican ordinariates" or "[[personal ordinariate]]s" under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the [[Holy See]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in Rome, while preserving elements of the liturgical, musical, theological and other aspects of their Anglican patrimony. Under these terms, regional groupings of Anglican Catholics may apply for reception by the Holy See under the jurisdiction of an "[[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]" (i.e. a bishop or priest{{NoteTag|In the Roman Catholic Church in general, ordinaries are supposed to be bishops, or at least episcopal vicars, but this condition was relaxed for Anglican ordinariates so as to allow married former Anglican bishops to become ordinaries: while priests in Anglican ordinariates may be married, bishops may not, as this is the general rule in both Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches. Therefore, married Anglican bishops or priests converting to Roman Catholicism receive the priestly ordination, and may not become Roman Catholic bishops afterwards.}}) appointed by Rome to oversee the community. While being in a country or region which is part of the [[Latin Church]] of the Roman Catholic Church, these ordinaries will nonetheless retain aspects of the Anglican patrimony, such as married priests and traditional English choral music and liturgy. Because apostolic constitutions are the highest level of papal legislation and are not time-limited, the invitation is open into the indefinite future.

Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} have drawn parallels with the [[Eastern Catholic Church]]es. However, although there are some commonalities, Anglican ordinariates are part of the [[Latin Church]] sui iuris within the Catholic Church, as they had been before the breach with Rome following the reign of Mary I of England, and their Anglican Use liturgy is a use (variation) of the [[Roman Rite]].

The first Anglican ordinariate, known as the [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham]], was established on 15 January 2011 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Citation | first = Anna | last = Arco | url = http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2011/01/15/priests-ordained-to-the-worlds-first-ordinariate | title = Priests ordained to the world's first ordinariate | newspaper = [[The Catholic Herald]] | location = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | date = 15 January 2011 }}.</ref> The second Anglican ordinariate, known as the [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]], was established on 1 January 2012 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://ordinariate.net/documents/2015/11/Fast_Facts_Ordinariate.FINAL.pdf |title = What is the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter? |publisher=Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter |access-date = 3 June 2016 }}</ref> The already existing [[Anglican Use]] parishes in the United States, which have existed since the 1980s, formed a portion of the first American Anglican ordinariate.<ref>{{cite news |author = CWN |title = US ordinariate receives first priest, parish |url = http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=14255 |publisher=Catholic Culture |date = 9 May 2012 |accessdate=11 July 2012 }}</ref> These parishes were already in communion with Rome and use modified Anglican liturgies approved by the Holy See.

==Practices and beliefs==

===Theology===
Historically, Anglo-Catholics have valued "highly the tradition of the early, undivided Church, they saw its authority as co-extensive with Scripture. They re-emphasized the Church's institutional history and form. Anglo-Catholicism was emotionally intense, and yet drawn to aspects of the pre-Reformation Church, including the revival of religious orders, the reintroduction of the language and symbolism of the eucharistic sacrifice," and "the revival of private confession. Its spirituality was Evangelical, but High Church in content and form."<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheldrake|first=Philip |title=The New Westminster Dictionary of Christian Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPOft7krR84C&pg=PA110|year=2005|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=0664230032}}</ref> At the same time, Anglo-Catholics held that "the Roman Catholic has corrupted the original ritualism; and she [the Anglican Church] claims that the ritualism which she presents is a revival in purity of the original ritualism of the Catholic Church."<ref>{{cite book|last=Bassett|first=Allen Lee|title=The Northern Monthly Magazine, Volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvIaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA348|year=1863|quote=The Anglo-Catholic asserts that the Roman Catholic has corrupted the original ritualism; and she claims that the ritualism which she presents in a revival in purity of the original ritualism of the Church.}}</ref> The spirituality of Anglo-Catholics is drawn largely from the teachings of the [[early Church]], in addition to the [[Caroline Divines]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheldrake|first=Philip |title=The New Westminster Dictionary of Christian Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPOft7krR84C&pg=PA110|year=2005|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=0664230032|quote=Anglo-Catholic spirituality has drawn inspiration from two sources in particular, the early Church, and the seventeenth-century 'Caroline Divines'.}}</ref> Archbishop of Canterbury [[Matthew Parker]], in 1572, published ''De Antiquitate Britannicæ Ecclesiæ'', which traced the roots of the Anglican Church, arguing "that the early British Church differed from Roman Catholicism in key points and thus provided an alternative model for [[patristic]] Christianity,"<ref name="DaviesO'Loughlin1999">{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Oliver|last2=O'Loughlin|first2=Thomas|title=Celtic Spirituality|url=https://archive.org/details/celticspirituali00paul_0|url-access=registration|accessdate=28 March 2014|year=1999|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9780809138944|page=[https://archive.org/details/celticspirituali00paul_0/page/7 7]|quote=In 1572 Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, published his important work ''De Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae'', in which he argued that the early British Church differed from Catholicism in key points and thus provided an alternative model for patristic Christianity, in which the newly established Anglican tradition could see its own ancient roots.

In agreement with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], Anglo-Catholics—along with [[Old-Catholic]]s and [[Lutheran]]s—generally appeal to the "canon" (or rule) of [[Vincent of Lerins|St Vincent of Lerins]]: "What everywhere, what always, and what by all has been believed, that is truly and properly Catholic."

The Anglican [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] make distinctions between Anglican and Roman Catholic understandings of doctrine; in the eyes of Anglo-Catholics, the Thirty-Nine Articles are [[Catholic]], containing statements that profess the universal faith of the early Church.<ref name="Albion1935">{{cite book|last=Albion|first=Gordon|title=Charles I and the Court of Rome: A Study in 17th Century Diplomacy|year=1935|publisher=Burns, Oates & Washbourne, Limited|page=169|quote=The " Catholic" articles are N°" 1–5, 7–8, 9 (first half), 10, 12, 15 (first half), 16–18, 19 (first half), 20 (first half), 23, 25 (half), 26, 27, 33, 34, 38, 39.}}</ref> As the Articles were intentionally written in such a way as to be open to a range of interpretations,<ref>{{cite book |last=Martz |first=Louis L |year=1991 |title=From Renaissance to Baroque: Essays on Literature and Art |publisher=University of Missouri Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromrenaissancet00mart/page/65 65] |ISBN=978-0-8262-0796-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/fromrenaissancet00mart/page/65 }}.</ref> Anglo-Catholics have defended their practices and beliefs as being consistent with the Thirty-Nine Articles.<ref name="Buchanan2009"/> A recent trend in Anglo-Catholic thought related to the Thirty-Nine Articles has included the [[New Perspective on Paul]].

Anglo-Catholic [[priest]]s often hear private [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s and [[Anointing of the Sick|anoint the sick]], regarding these practices as sacraments. The classic Anglican aphorism regarding private confession is: "All may, some should, none must." Anglo-Catholics also offer prayers for the departed and the intercession of the saints; [[C. S. Lewis]], often considered an Anglo-Catholic in his theological sensibilities, was once quoted as stating that,
{{quote|Of course I pray for the dead. The action is so spontaneous, so all but inevitable, that only the most compulsive theological case against it would deter me. And I hardly know how the rest of my prayers would survive if those for the dead were forbidden. At our age, the majority of those we love best are dead. What sort of intercourse with God could I have if what I love best were unmentionable to him?{{Sfn|Lewis|1964|pp=107–109}}}}

Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship also believe in the [[Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist|real objective presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist and understand the way He is manifest in the sacrament to be a [[mystery of faith]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Herbert Stowe|first1=Walter|title=Anglo-Catholicism: What It Is Not and What It Is|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/whstowe/what1932.html|publisher=Church Literature Association|year=1932|quote=How the bread and wine of the Eucharist become the Body and Blood of Christ after a special, sacramental and heavenly manner and still remain bread and wine, and how our Lord is really present (real as being the presence of a reality), is a mystery which no human mind can satisfactorily explain. It is a mystery of the same order as how the divine Logos could take upon himself human nature and become man without ceasing to be divine. It is a mystery of the Faith, and we were never promised that all the mysteries would be solved in this life. The plain man (and some not so plain) is wisest in sticking to the oft-quoted lines ascribed to Queen Elizabeth, but probably written by John Donne: "Christ was the Word that spake it; He took the bread and brake it; And what the Word did make it, That I believe and take it." The mysteries of the Eucharist are three: The mystery of identification, the mystery of conversion, the mystery of presence. The first and primary mystery is that of identification; the other two are inferences from it. The ancient Fathers were free from Eucharistic controversy because they took their stand on the first and primary mystery—that of identification—and accepted our Lord's words, " This is my Body," " This is my Blood," as the pledge of the blessings which this Sacrament conveys. We have since the early Middle Ages lost their peace because we have insisted on trying to explain unexplainable mysteries. But let it be repeated, Anglo-Catholics are not committed to the doctrine of Transubstantiation; they are committed to the doctrine of the Real Presence.}}</ref><ref name="Lears1981">{{cite book|last=Lears|first=T.

This fundamental issue centres in the Papacy and its authority, land from this conflict flow all other differences of faith, worship, discipline and atmosphere. The four key phrases which make up the Papal claims are primacy, spiritual supremacy, temporal supremacy, and infallibility in faith and morals.}}</ref>
{{quote|Anglo-Catholics reject all these claims except that of Primacy on the following grounds: (i) There is no evidence in Scripture or anywhere else that Christ conferred these powers upon St. Peter; (2) there is no evidence that St. Peter claimed them for himself or his successors; (3) there is strong contrary evidence that St. Peter erred in [[Incident at Antioch|an important matter of faith in Antioch]], the eating together and social intercourse of Jewish and Gentile Christians affecting the whole future of the Church and the Christian Religion, and this lapse was so serious that St. Paul withstood him to the face; (4) he did not preside at the first Council of the Church in Jerusalem and did not hand down the decision of the Council; (5) he was Bishop of Antioch before he was bishop anywhere else, and, if the papal claims are in any way true, the Bishop of Antioch has a better right to hold them; (6) that St. Peter was ever in Rome is disputed, and the most that can be said for it is that it is an interesting historical problem; (7) there is no evidence whatsoever that he conferred such powers upon his successors-to-be in the See of Rome; (8) there was no primitive acceptance of such claims, and there never has been universal acceptance in any later age.<ref name="WHS32">{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/whstowe/what1932.html|title=Anglo-Catholicism: What It Is Not and What It Is|last=Stowe|first=Walter Herbert|year=1932|publisher=Church Literature Association|accessdate=12 June 2015|location=London}}</ref>}} However, Anglo-Catholics share with Roman Catholics a belief in the sacramental nature of the priesthood and in the sacrificial character of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. A minority of Anglo-Catholics also encourage priestly [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]].

===Liturgical practices===
Anglo-Catholics are often identified by their liturgical practices and ornaments. These have traditionally been characterised by the "six points" of the later Catholic Revival's eucharistic practice:

[[File:High Altar, Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania).jpg|thumb|right|High Altar, Anglo-Catholic [[Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania)]]]]

* Eucharistic [[vestment]]s.
* [[Ad orientem|Eastward-facing orientation]] of the priest at the altar instead of at the north side, the traditional evangelical Anglican practice. Many Anglo-Catholics now prefer "facing the people".
* Unleavened bread for the Eucharist. 
* Mixing of water with the eucharistic wine.
* Incense
* 'Lights' (candles).

Many other traditional Catholic practices are observed within Anglo-Catholicism, including [[eucharistic adoration]]. Most of these Anglo-Catholic "innovations" have since been accepted by [[broad church]] Anglicans, if not by Evangelical or [[Low Church]] Anglicans.

Various liturgical strands exist within Anglo-Catholicism:
* Some, such as the original members of the Oxford Movement, use official Anglican liturgical texts such as the [[Book of Common Prayer]].
* Some use the modern [[Mass of Paul VI|Catholic rite of Mass]].
* Some use the [[Tridentine Mass|older "Tridentine"]] Catholic rite of Mass, in English or Latin, or liturgies based on it, such as the [[English Missal]] or [[Anglican Missal]].
* Some occasionally use the mediaeval English [[Sarum Rite]], which is broadly similar to the Tridentine Mass, in English or Latin.

Preferences for Elizabethan English and modern English texts vary within the movement.

In the United States a group of Anglo-Catholics at the Episcopal [[Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania)]] published, under the rubrics of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, the ''[[Anglican Service Book]]'' as "a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and additional devotions."  This book is based on the 1979 Book of Common Prayer but includes offices and devotions in the traditional language of the 1928 Prayer Book that are not in the 1979 edition. The book also draws from sources such as the [[Anglican Missal]].

In many Anglo-Catholic churches, clergy are referred to as Father, and in places where the priestly ministry of women is accepted, Mother, instead of Reverend.
