==History==

[[File:Campus Tiscali.jpg|thumbnail|Tiscali Campus in Cagliari]]
Tiscali was created in January 1998 in Cagliari by [[Renato Soru]], following the deregulation of Italian telephone system. The company owes its name to a Sardinian mountain at which [[Tiscali (Tiscali Village)|remains of an ancient village]] were found. From March 1999 onward, Tiscali offered ''Tiscali Free Net'', a subscription-free Internet service where customers only had to pay for the time they were online. This pushed other Italian providers to repeal their fixed subscription fees, thus contributing to making the Internet accessible to the masses in Italy.

===IPO===
In October 1999 (during the [[dot-com bubble]]), the company went through an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) to be traded on the Italian stock exchange at a share price of 46 Euros. 3,098,000 shares were offered to investors of which 2,658,000 shares were created through a capital increase and the rest were sold by Soru. Soru made 20,240,000 Euros on the IPO. In 2012, the price per share had plummeted to 0.04 Euros.{{Citation needed |date= June 2013}}

Between 2001 and 2003, shares were also traded on the French stock exchange.

==Services==
Each of Tiscali's regional companies offer many services, which may include [[broadband]] internet access and telephone services. Between 2007 and 2008, Tiscali briefly operated an [[IPTV]] service in [[Italy]] (available in the cities of [[Bologna]], [[Cagliari]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Palermo]], [[Rome]], [[Turin]] and [[Trieste]]). Its UK television service, [[TalkTalk TV|Tiscali TV]] was acquired by [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]] in 2009.

Tiscali's former carrier company, [[Tinet|Tiscali International Network]], was a <!-- English please: these are confusing buzzwords -->[[Pure play|pure-play]] carrier business delivering wholesale services including Global IP Connectivity, [[Multiprotocol Label Switching|MPLS lines]], [[Voice over IP]] and Network Monitoring.{{CN|date=August 2019}} In May 2009, its IP/MPLS backbone counted 90 [[Point of presence|Points of Presence]] and extended over 17 European countries and across the United States and Hong Kong. Its Autonomous System (AS3257) was a core ASN in the global Internet routing table, as well as the largest IPv6 backbone outside Asia. The network was sold to the Italian private equity firm BS Private Equity SpA on 27 May 2009, and renamed [[Tinet]].<ref name="tinet">{{Cite news

Tiscali ran similar [[web portal]]s for each of its countries, which include features such as [[webmail]], reviews, news, videos, [[online dating|dating]], [[chatroom|chat]], [[radio]], TV guide, streaming TV channels and others.

Tiscali published a self-branded [[web browser]] of the same name which was distributed with its [[dial-up]] Internet packages. It was produced by [[UltraBrowser]] and used the core of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] to display web pages. The software has not been included in installation packages since Tiscali's corporate rebranding in 2004.

Tiscali offered dial-up Internet access in Finland under service name ''Surfeu''.

Tiscali Campus in Cagliari has 1,000 employees. The center includes a development division for Internet technologies where researchers like Antonio Tuzzi (one of the developers of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[macOS]]), Luca Manunza (inventor of the first [[webmail]] service) and Domenico Dato (developer of ''Arianna'', the first Italian search engine) work.<ref>{{cite web
