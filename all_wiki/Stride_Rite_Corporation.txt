== History ==
=== Founding and early years ===
Stride Rite was founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1919, as the Green Shoe Manufacturing Company (“Green Shoe”) by Jacob A. Slosberg and Philip Green. After founding the company, Green sold his interest to Slosberg twelve years later and Slosberg's sons Samuel and Charles lead up the company as the heads of sales and manufacturing respectively. Green Shoe became a [[public company]] in 1960 and was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

In 1966 Green Shoe adopted the Stride Rite Corporation name to emphasize the brand name of one of its best-known products.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The name was purchased from another shoe manufacturer in 1933.<ref name="strideritecorporate">[http://www.striderite.com/store/SiteController/striderite/staticpage?content=history_striderite]</ref>

In 1968 [[Arnold Hiatt]], the son of a [[Lithuania]]n immigrant, became president of the firm and sales were $35 million.<ref name="twsM15">{{cite news
