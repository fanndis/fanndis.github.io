The '''Wilson Sporting Goods Company''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sports equipment]] manufacturer based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. From 1989, it has been a [[subsidiary]] of the [[Finland|Finnish]] group [[Amer Sports]], since 2019 itself a subsidiary of the Chinese group [[ANTA Sports]].<ref>Freudenheim, Milt. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DF1038F932A15751C0A96F948260 Amer Group to Acquire Wilson Sporting Goods], ''The New York Times'', 1989-02-21</ref> Wilson makes equipment for many sports, among them [[baseball]], [[badminton]], [[American football]], [[basketball]], [[fastpitch softball]], [[golf]], [[racquetball]], [[association football|soccer]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[tennis]], [[pickleball]] and [[volleyball]].

The company owns the brands Atec, [[DeMarini]], [[EvoShield]], [[Hillerich & Bradsby|Louisville Slugger]], and Luxilon to provide sports equipment and [[protective gear]] for baseball, lacrosse, softball, and tennis.

==History==
[[File:Thomas_E._Wilson.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Thomas Wilson founded the company, also serving as its president and chairman for 35 years]]
The company traces its roots to the "Schwarzschild & Sulzberger" meatpacking company (later changed to "Sulzberger & Son's") based in [[New York (state)|New York]], that operated [[meat packing]] slaughterhouses.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4cDAAAAYAAJ&q=Sulzberger+&pg=RA5-PA785| title=Everybody's Magazine| last1=Norris| first1=Frank| last2=Henry| first2=O| year=1905}}</ref>

Sulzberger & Son's founded the "Ashland Manufacturing Company" in 1913 to use [[animal by-products]] from its slaughterhouses. It started out in 1914, making tennis racket strings, violin strings, and surgical sutures, but soon expanded into baseball shoes and tennis racquets.<ref name=funding>{{cite web| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Wilson-Sporting-Goods-Company-Company-History.html| title=History of Wilson Sporting Goods Company| website=Funding Universe}}</ref>

In 1915, [[Thomas E. Wilson]], former president of meatpacker [[Morris & Company]], was appointed President by the controlling banks and renamed the company "Thomas E. Wilson Company". The company acquired the Hetzinger Knitting Mills to produce athletic uniforms and a caddie bag company which produced golf balls but soon expanded into footballs and basketballs.<ref name=funding/>

In 1918, Wilson left to concentrate on the beef-packing business, changing the Sulzberger company to Wilson & Co. (which would ultimately become [[Iowa Beef Packers]] and then be taken over by [[Tyson Foods]]).  The packing company continued to have control in the company until 1967 when it was sold to [[Ling-Temco-Vought]].<ref name=funding/>

Under new president Lawrence Blaine Icely, it acquired the "Chicago Sporting Goods Company" and struck a deal to supply the [[Chicago Cubs]].  It also hired Arch Turner, a leather designer who would design the leather football.<ref name=funding/>

In 1922, it introduced the [[Ray Schalk]] catcher's mitt which later became the standard.  It worked with [[Knute Rockne]] to introduce the double-lined leather football and first valve football and the first waist-line football pants with pads.<ref name=funding/> In 1925, it was renamed "Wilson-Western Sporting Goods" following a distribution agreement with "Western Sporting Goods".

After Rockne's death, the company focused on golf, introducing the R-90, a sand wedge golf club inspired by [[Gene Sarazen]]'s victory in the 1932 [[British Open]].<ref name=funding/>

In 1931, it renamed itself "Wilson Sporting Goods Company". During [[World War II]] it introduced the Wilson ''Duke'' [[ball (gridiron football)|football]], featuring high-quality leather, ends that were hand-sewn, lock-stitch seams, and triple lining, which was adopted as the official ball of the [[National Football League]].<ref name=funding/>

[[Horween Leather Company]] has supplied Wilson with pebbled cowhide since 1941 for use in the manufacture of footballs and basketballs. Wilson is Horween Leather Company's largest customer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&p_theme=mwsb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=120F68CA56273420&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |first=John |last=Schmid |title= Getting a grip |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name="businessweek1">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-05-16/horween-leather-faces-an-uncertain-futurebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |first=Howard |last=Wolinsky |title=Horween Leather Faces an Uncertain Future |magazine=[[Bloomberg Business Week]] |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}</ref>

In 1941, Wilson became official provider of [[ball (gridiron football)|game balls]] for the [[National Football League]] ([[American football]]), a partnership that continues to this day.<ref>[https://www.wilson.com/en-us/explore/football/nfl Wilson & the NFL since 1941] on Wilson website, 13 Mar 2019</ref> Wilson became the official NBA ball supplier in 1946, in a partnership that would last 37 years.<ref name=cnbc/>

After the [[World War II]], Wilson focused on tennis and signed [[Jack Kramer]], who developed its line of Jack Kramer signed tennis rackets. L. B. Icely died in 1950, but the company continued to expand. In 1955, it acquired Ohio-Kentucky Manufacturing for making footballs.

[[File:Seles outfit and racket.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wilson steel racquet T2000, used by [[Jimmy Connors]]]]
In 1964, Wilson acquired "Wonder Products Company", which made toys and custom-molded items. The company transformed the custom-mold section to make [[protective gear in sports|protective equipment]] for American football and baseball, such as face masks for [[football helmet]]s and [[pads|leg guards]] for [[catcher|baseball catchers]].

In 1967, the company was acquired by Ling-Temco-Vought. Only three years later, [[PepsiCo]] became new Wilson's owner. In those days, the company manufactured and commercialized the official balls of both, NBA and NFL, and provided most of the uniforms of teams in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and the [[United States Olympic Committee|United States Summer Olympics teams]].

In 1979, Wilson tennis balls were first used in the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wilson.com/wilson/racquet/products.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673975924&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302756175&bmUID=1182358231397 |title=Wilson Tennis Balls |website=Wilson}}</ref> and still are used to this day. In 2006, the [[Australian Open]] began using Wilson Tennis Balls.<ref>[http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/sponsors.html Australian Open Sponsors], 2007-06-23</ref> In 1985, Wilson was acquired by Westray Capital Corporation through subsidiary WSGC Holdings. In 1989, WSGC merged with Bogey Acquisitions Company, which is affiliated with the Finnish group [[Amer Sports]].<ref name=funding/>

In May 2020, it was announced that Wilson became the NBA official ball supplier, starting with the 2021 season. Wilson will return as NBA ball maker, replacing [[Spalding (company)|Spalding]], after over 30 years of partnership with the league.<ref name=cnbc>[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/nba-drops-spalding-as-maker-of-official-basketball-after-more-than-30-years.html NBA drops Spalding as maker of official basketball after more than 30 years] by Jabari Young on CNBC, 13 May 2020</ref>

[[File:Roger Federer (26 June 2009, Wimbledon) 2 (crop-2).jpg|thumb|[[Roger Federer]] used Wilson racquets in the [[2009 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] championship of 2009]]
Wilson is a major manufacturer of tennis rackets. The original [[kevlar]] [[Wilson ProStaff Original 6.0|Pro Staff]] model racket, known for its use by [[Pete Sampras]], was heavy (more than 350g strung) and small-headed (85 sq. in.); Roger Federer also used the same racket model. As of 2015, he uses the Pro Staff RF97 Autograph model that is heavy (340 g/12 oz unstrung) and larger (97 sq. in.). Jim Courier and Stefan Edberg also used the Pro Staff Original, Edberg later switching to the Pro Staff Classic in 1991, which was the same racket (85 sq. in. with slightly rounded frame edges) but with different paint work. In late 2009, Wilson unveiled their latest line of rackets, codenamed 20x, which they would later rename BLX. This line directly replaces their previous K-Factor series with all new technologies.<ref>[https://cuzgeek.com/best-badminton-rackets/ Latest Wilson Rackets - CuzGeek]</ref> Also, many pros use custom-made rackets that perform differently from the mass-produced versions.

Aside from tennis rackets, the Wilson sporting goods company also makes [[tennis balls]] (including the official balls of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and starting in 2020, the [[French Open]] major championships), shoes, balls, strings, clothes, and racquet bags.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wilson.com/en-us/tennis/| title=Wilson Tennis Rackets, Equipment and Accessories| website=Wilson}}</ref>
