The '''chief justice of the United States'''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-GoBN_2w-jQC&q=%22Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States%22&pg=PA1|title=The Chief Justice of the United States|last=Rutkus|first=Denis Steven|date=2007|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=9781600212253|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxJlDwAAQBAJ&q=%22chief%20justice%20of%20the%20united%22&pg=PT406|title=The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts|last=Biskupic|first=Joan|date=March 26, 2019|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465093281|language=en}}</ref> is the [[chief judge]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|U.S. federal judiciary]]. [[Appointments Clause|Article II, Section 2, Clause 2]] of the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] grants [[plenary power]] to the [[president of the United States]] to nominate, and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]], appoint "Judges of the supreme Court", who serve until they resign, retire, are [[Impeachment in the United States|impeached and convicted]], or die. The existence of a chief justice is explicit in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Trial of Impeachment|Article One, Section 3, Clause 6]] which states that the chief justice shall preside on the impeachment trial of the president.

The chief justice has significant influence in the [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States#Selection of cases|selection of cases for review]], presides when [[Oral argument|oral arguments]] are held, and leads the discussion of cases among the justices. Additionally, when the court renders an opinion, the chief justice, if in the majority, chooses who writes the court's opinion. When deciding a case, however, the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|any other justice]]. 

Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 designates the chief justice to preside during presidential impeachment trials in the Senate; this has occurred three times. While nowhere mandated, the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]] is by tradition typically administered by the chief justice. The chief justice serves as a spokesperson for the federal government's judicial branch and acts as a [[chief administrative officer]] for the federal courts. The chief justice presides over the [[Judicial Conference of the United States|Judicial Conference]] and, in that capacity, appoints the director and deputy director of the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts|Administrative Office]]. The chief justice is an [[Ex officio member|''ex officio'' member]] of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and, by custom, is elected [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the board.

Since the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 17 people have served as chief justice, beginning with [[John Jay]] (1789–1795). The current chief justice is [[John Roberts]] (since 2005). Five of the 17 chief justices—[[John Rutledge]], [[Edward Douglass White]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone]], and [[William Rehnquist]]—served as associate justice prior to becoming chief justice.

==Origin, title, and appointment==
The United States Constitution does not explicitly establish an office of chief justice but presupposes its existence with a single reference in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: "When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside." Nothing more is said in the Constitution regarding the office. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III, Section 1]], which authorizes the establishment of the Supreme Court, refers to all members of the court simply as "judges". The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] created the distinctive titles of ''Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States'' and ''Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States''.

In 1866, [[Salmon P. Chase]] assumed the title of ''Chief Justice of the United States,'' and Congress began using the new title in subsequent legislation.<ref name=":0" /> The first person whose Supreme Court commission contained the modified title was [[Melville Fuller]] in 1888.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/administration/administrative-agencies-office-chief-justice-1789-present|title=Administrative Agencies: Office of the Chief Justice, 1789–present|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> The associate justice title was not altered in 1866 and remains as originally created.

The chief justice, like all [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], is [[Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States|nominated by the president and confirmed to office by the U.S. Senate]]. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that they "shall hold their Offices during good Behavior". This language means that the appointments are effectively [[Life tenure|for life]] and that once in office, a justice's tenure ends only when the justice dies, retires, resigns, or is removed from office through the impeachment process. Since 1789, 15 presidents have made a total of 22 [[List of nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States|official nominations]] to the position.<ref name="fas">{{cite web|last1=McMillion|first1=Barry J.|last2=Rutkus|first2=Denis Steven|date=July 6, 2018|title=Supreme Court Nominations, 1789 to 2017: Actions by the Senate, the Judiciary Committee, and the President|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33225.pdf|website=fas.org (Federation of American Scientists)|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}</ref>

The salary of the chief justice is set by Congress; the current (2019) annual salary is $270,700, which is slightly higher than that of associate justices, which is $258,900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-compensation |title=Judicial Compensation |publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts |accessdate=July 9, 2020}}</ref> The practice of appointing an individual to serve as chief justice is grounded in tradition; while the Constitution mandates that there be a chief justice, it is silent on the subject of how one is chosen and by whom. There is no specific constitutional prohibition against using another method to select the chief justice from among those justices properly appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court.

Three [[incumbent]] associate justices have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as chief justice: Edward Douglass White in 1910, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941, and William Rehnquist in 1986. A fourth, [[Abe Fortas]], was nominated to the position in 1968 but was not confirmed. As an associate justice does not have to resign his or her seat on the court in order to be nominated as chief justice, Fortas remained an associate justice. Similarly, when Associate Justice [[William Cushing]] was nominated and confirmed as chief justice in January 1796 but declined the office, he too remained on the court. Two former associate justices subsequently returned to service on the court as chief justice. [[John Rutledge]] was the first. President Washington gave him a [[recess appointment]] in 1795. However, his subsequent nomination to the office was not confirmed by the Senate, and he left office and the court. In 1930, former Associate Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] was confirmed as chief justice. Additionally, in December 1800, former Chief Justice John Jay was nominated and confirmed to the position a second time but ultimately declined it, opening the way for the appointment of [[John Marshall]].<ref name="fas" />

==Powers and duties==
Along with his general responsibilities as a member of the Supreme Court, the chief justice has several unique duties to fulfill.

===Impeachment trials===
Article I, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the chief justice shall [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|preside over the Senate]] trial of an [[Impeachment|impeached]] president of the United States. Three chief justices have presided over presidential impeachment trials: Salmon P. Chase ([[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|1868 trial of Andrew Johnson]]), William Rehnquist ([[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|1999 trial of Bill Clinton]]), and John Roberts ([[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|2020 trial of Donald Trump]]). All three presidents were acquitted in the Senate. Although the Constitution is silent on the matter, the chief justice would, under Senate rules adopted in 1999 prior to the Clinton trial, preside over the trial of an impeached vice president.<ref>https://www.senate.gov/reference/Index/Impeachment.htm</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf|title=IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS; RULES OF PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE IN THE SENATE WHEN SITTING ON IMPEACHMENT TRIALS; ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON; PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ANSWER; AND REPLICATION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES|last=Sisco|first=Gary|date=January 13, 1999|website=govinfo.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref> This rule was established to preclude the possibility of a vice president presiding over their own trial.

===Seniority===
Many of the court's [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|procedures and inner workings]] are governed by the rules of protocol based on the [[seniority]] of the justices. The chief justice always ranks first in the [[order of precedence]]—regardless of the length of the officeholder's service (even if shorter than that of one or more associate justices). This elevated status has enabled successive chief justices to define and refine both the court's culture and its judicial priorities.

The chief justice sets the agenda for the weekly meetings where the justices review the petitions for [[certiorari]], to decide whether to hear or deny each case. The Supreme Court agrees to hear less than one percent of the cases petitioned to it. While associate justices may append items to the weekly agenda, in practice this initial agenda-setting power of the chief justice has significant influence over the direction of the court. Nonetheless, a chief justice's influence may be limited by circumstances and the associate justices' understanding of [[Jurisprudence|legal principles]]; it is definitely limited by the fact that he has only a single vote of nine on the decision whether to grant or deny certiorari.<ref name=LIICornell>{{cite web|title=Judiciary|publisher=Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School|location=Ithaca, New York|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/judiciary| accessdate=May 23, 2017}}</ref><ref name=UPennLaw>{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Frank B.|last2=Lindquist| first2=Stefanie|date=June 2006|volume=154|issue=6|title=The decisional significance of the Chief Justice| journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Law School|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/lawreview/articles/volume154/issue6/CrossLindquist154U.Pa.L.Rev.1665(2006).pdf| pages=1665–1707|doi=10.2307/40041349|jstor=40041349}}</ref>

Despite the chief justice's elevated stature, his vote carries the same legal weight as the vote of each associate justice. Additionally, he has no legal authority to overrule the verdicts or interpretations of the other eight judges or tamper with them.<ref name=LIICornell/> The task of assigning who shall write the opinion for the majority falls to the most senior justice in the majority. Thus, when the chief justice is in the majority, he always assigns the opinion.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Brien |first=David M. |title=Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics |edition=8th |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2008 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-93218-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stormcentersupre0000obri_a4l4/page/267 267] |url=https://archive.org/details/stormcentersupre0000obri_a4l4/page/267 }}</ref> Early in his tenure, Chief Justice John Marshall insisted upon holdings which the justices could unanimously back as a means to establish and build the court's national prestige. In doing so, Marshall would often write the opinions himself and actively discouraged dissenting opinions. Associate Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] eventually persuaded Marshall and the rest of the court to adopt its present practice: one justice writes an opinion for the majority, and the rest are free to write their own separate opinions or not, whether concurring or dissenting.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Brien |first=David M. |title=Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics |edition=8th |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2008 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-93218-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stormcentersupre0000obri_a4l4/page/115 115] |url=https://archive.org/details/stormcentersupre0000obri_a4l4/page/115 }}</ref>

The chief justice's formal prerogative—when in the majority—to assign which justice will write the court's opinion is perhaps his most influential power,<ref name=UPennLaw/> as this enables him to influence the historical record.<ref name=LIICornell/> He may assign this task to the individual justice best able to hold together a fragile coalition, to an ideologically amenable colleague, or to himself. Opinion authors can have a large influence on the content of an opinion; two justices in the same majority, given the opportunity, might write very different majority opinions.<ref name=UPennLaw/> A chief justice who knows the associate justices well can therefore do much—by the simple act of selecting the justice who writes the opinion of the court—to affect the general character or tone of an opinion, which in turn can affect the interpretation of that opinion in cases before lower courts in the years to come.

The chief justice chairs the conferences where cases are discussed and tentatively voted on by the justices. He normally speaks first and so has influence in framing the discussion. Although the chief justice votes first—the court votes in order of seniority—he may strategically pass in order to ensure membership in the majority if desired.<ref name=UPennLaw/> It is reported that:
{{Quote|Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] was renowned, and even vilified in some quarters, for voting strategically during conference discussions on the Supreme Court in order to control the Court's agenda through opinion assignment. Indeed, Burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition, cast "phony votes" by voting against his preferred position, and declined to express a position at conference.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Passing and Strategic Voting on the U.S. Supreme Court|last1=Johnson|first1=Timothy R.|last2=Spriggs II|first2=James F.|last3=Wahlbeck|first3=Paul J.|journal=Law & Society Review| publisher=Law and Society Association, through Wiley|date=June 2005|volume=39|issue=2|pages=349–377|citeseerx=10.1.1.509.6707|doi=10.1111/j.0023-9216.2005.00085.x}}</ref>}}

===Presidential oath===
The chief justice commonly administers the [[oath of office of the president of the United States]]. This is a tradition, rather than a constitutional responsibility of the chief justice; the Constitution does not require that the oath be administered by anyone in particular, simply that it be taken by the president. Law empowers any federal or state judge, as well as [[notary public|notaries public]], to administer oaths and [[Affirmation (law)|affirmations]]. The chief justice ordinarily administers the oath of office to newly appointed and confirmed associate justices, whereas the seniormost associate justice will normally swear in a new chief justice.

If the chief justice is ill or incapacitated, the oath is usually administered by the seniormost member of the Supreme Court. Seven times, someone other than the chief justice of the United States administered the oath of office to the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pioaths.html |title=Presidential Inaugurations: Presidential Oaths of Office |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}</ref> [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], as chancellor of the state of New York (the state's highest ranking judicial office), administered the oath of office to [[George Washington]] at his first inauguration; there was no chief justice of the United States, nor any other federal judge prior to their appointments by President Washington in the months following his inauguration. [[William Cushing]], an associate justice of the Supreme Court, administered Washington's second oath of office in 1793. [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s [[John Calvin Coolidge Sr.|father]], a notary public, administered the oath to his son after the death of Warren Harding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicvermont.org/coolidge/oathrm.html |title=Excerpt from Coolidge's autobiography |publisher=Historicvermont.org |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> This, however, was contested upon Coolidge's return to Washington, and his oath was re-administered by Judge [[Adolph A. Hoehling Jr.|Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr.]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2000/winter/abrupt-transition-1.html |title=Prologue: Selected Articles |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref>  [[John Tyler]] and [[Millard Fillmore]] were both sworn in on the death of their predecessors by Chief Justice [[William Cranch]] of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/daysevents/potusswearingin05.cfm |title=Presidential Swearing-In Ceremony, Part 5 of 6 |publisher=Inaugural.senate.gov |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203094226/http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/daysevents/potusswearingin05.cfm |archivedate=February 3, 2011 }}</ref> [[Chester A. Arthur]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s initial oaths reflected the unexpected nature of their taking office. On November 22, 1963, after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of]] President [[John F. Kennedy]], Judge [[Sarah T. Hughes]], a federal district court judge of the [[United States District Court]] for the Northern District of Texas, administered the oath of office to Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] aboard [[Air Force One|the presidential airplane]].

===Other duties===
Since the tenure of [[William Howard Taft]], the office of chief justice has moved beyond just [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]].<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Brien |first=David M. |title=Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics |edition=8th |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2008 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-93218-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stormcentersupre0000obri_a4l4/page/153 153] |url=https://archive.org/details/stormcentersupre0000obri_a4l4/page/153 }}</ref> The chief justice also:
*Serves as the head of the federal judiciary.
*Serves as the head of the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]], the chief administrative body of the United States federal courts. The Judicial Conference is empowered by the [[Rules Enabling Act]] to propose rules, which are then promulgated by the Supreme Court (subject to disapproval by Congress under the [[Congressional Review Act]]), to ensure the smooth operation of the federal courts. Major portions of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] have been adopted by most state legislatures and are considered canonical by American [[law school]]s.
*Appoints sitting federal judges to the membership of the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], a "secret court" which oversees requests for surveillance warrants by federal police agencies (primarily the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]) against suspected foreign [[Espionage|intelligence agents]] inside the United States. (''see ''{{UnitedStatesCode|50|1803}}).
*Appoints sitting federal judges to the membership of the [[United States Alien Terrorist Removal Court]], a special court constituted to determine whether aliens should be deported from the United States on the grounds that they are terrorists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alien Terrorist Removal Court, 1996-present|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/courts/alien-terrorist-removal-court-1996-present|accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>
*Appoints the members of the [[Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation]], a special tribunal of seven sitting federal judges responsible for selecting the venue for coordinated pretrial proceedings in situations where multiple related federal actions have been filed in different judicial districts.
*Serves as an ''ex officio'' member of the Board of Regents and as the chancellor of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].
*Supervises the acquisition of books for the [[Law Library of Congress|Law Library]] of the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name="loc history">{{cite web|title=Jefferson's Legacy: A Brief History of the Library of Congress|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html|date=March 6, 2006|accessdate=January 14, 2008}}</ref>

Unlike Senators and Representatives, who are constitutionally prohibited from holding any other "office of trust or profit" of the United States or of any state while holding their congressional seats, the chief justice and the other members of the federal judiciary are not barred from serving in other positions. John Jay served as a diplomat to negotiate the [[Jay Treaty]], [[Robert H. Jackson]] was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. prosecutor in the [[Nuremberg trials]] of leading Nazis, and [[Earl Warren]] chaired [[Warren Commission|the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy]].

===Disability or vacancy===
Under {{USC|28|3}}, when the chief justice is unable to discharge his functions, or when that office is vacant, the chief justice's duties are carried out by the most senior associate justice until the disability or vacancy ends.<ref name="Pettys">{{Cite journal |first=Todd E. |last=Pettys |title=Choosing a Chief Justice: Presidential Prerogative or a Job for the Court? |journal=Journal of Law & Politics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=231–281 |year=2006 |publisher=The University of Iowa College of Law  |url=https://works.bepress.com/todd_pettys/8/ |ssrn=958829 }}</ref> Currently, [[Clarence Thomas]] is the most senior associate justice.
