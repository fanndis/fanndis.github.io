'''Guggenheim Fellowships''' are [[Grant (money)|grants]] that have been awarded annually since 1925 by the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] to those "who have demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability in the arts."

Each year, the foundation issues awards in each of two separate competitions:
* One open to citizens and permanent residents of the United States and Canada. 
* The other to citizens and permanent residents of Latin America and the Caribbean.

The performing arts are excluded, although composers, film directors, and choreographers are eligible. The fellowships are not open to students, only to "advanced professionals in mid-career" such as published authors. The fellows may spend the money as they see fit, as the purpose is to give fellows "blocks of time in which they can work with as much creative freedom as possible," but they should also be "substantially free of their regular duties." Applicants are required to submit references as well as a [[curriculum vitae|CV]] and [[Career portfolio|portfolio]].

The Foundation receives between 3,500 and 4,000 applications every year. Approximately 175 Fellowships are awarded each year.<ref>{{cite web
