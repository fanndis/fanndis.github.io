The cloture procedure originated in the [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]], from which the name is taken. ''Clôture'' is [[French language|French]] for "the act of terminating something". It was introduced into the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] to overcome the [[obstructionism]] of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] and was made permanent in 1887. It was subsequently adopted by the [[United States Senate]] and other legislatures. The name ''cloture'' remains in the United States;<ref name="oxforddictionariesuk" /> in Commonwealth countries it is usually ''closure''<ref name="oxforddictionariesuk" /> or, informally, ''guillotine''; [[#United Kingdom|in the United Kingdom]] ''closure'' and ''guillotine'' are distinct motions.<ref name="ukparlclosure" /><ref name="allocationukparl" />

==Australia==
In Australia, the procedure by which finite debating times for particular bills are set, or protracted debates are brought to a close, is referred to as a "guillotine". Generally, a minister will declare that a bill must be considered as urgent, and move a motion to limit debating time. The declaration and motion may refer to a single bill, or to multiple bills or packages of bills. A guillotine motion may not be debated or amended, and must be put to a vote immediately.<ref name=oz/>

==Canada==
Closure in [[Canada]] was adopted by the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in 1913 by [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Borden]]. The new closure rule was immediately tested by the government only a few days after its adoption during debate at the [[Committee of the Whole#Canada|Committee of the Whole]] stage of the [[Naval Aid Bill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/procedure-book-livre/Document.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&sbdid=68A2776A-F2A5-4DC3-A6CE-6F0D88B0CF66&sbpid=F59D79FC-ECD0-4548-A987-B346EFAC5008|title=House of Commons Procedure and Practice - Second Edition, 2009|publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]]|accessdate=2011-06-24}}</ref> "Closure" is the term used in Canada; "cloture" and "guillotine" are not used.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Procedure on closure in Canada is governed under Standing Order no. 57 of the House of Commons and consists of three parts: Notice of closure, a motion of closure, and a final period of debate before final voting on the bill being closured.

Notice of closure is an oral statement announcing intention to call for closure given by any Minister at a prior sitting of the [[Committee of the Whole]]. The notice need not be the day immediately prior to the sitting at which the bill will be closured, but cannot be in the same sitting as the final motion of closure.

The motion of closure, referred to as a motion "that the debate shall not be further adjourned", is passed by a simple majority of the House of Commons, although in the event of a tie, the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House]] will apply [[Speaker Denison's rule]] to issue the [[casting vote]].

Should the motion of closure pass, all members are given a single period in which to speak lasting no more than 20 minutes. If the final period of speaking to the bill has not been finished by 8:00&nbsp;p.m. that same day, no MP may speak after that point, and the bill moves to a final vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/StandingOrders/Chap8-e.htm|title=Standing Orders of the House of Commons, Chapter VIII (Motions)|publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]]|accessdate=2018-09-28}}</ref>

==Hong Kong==
The first cloture in [[Hong Kong]] was introduced in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] on 17 May 2012, by [[Tsang Yok-sing]] ([[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]]), to abruptly halt [[filibuster]] during debate at the Committee of the Whole stage of the [[Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/elocal/news.htm?elocal&20120517&56&841059 |title=Legco president sets vote deadline |date=17 May 2012 |publisher=RTHK |accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref> The motion to end debate was submitted by Council member Philip Wong Yu-hong some time after 4 am Hong Kong time, after a marathon session that lasted over 33 hours.  Wong stood up and suggested that legislatures in other countries have a procedure called "cloture motion", and suggested Council President should end debate immediately. President Tsang agreed and said that he considered ending debate even without Wong's suggestion because he would not allow debate to go on endlessly.  Cloture is not defined by any rule or precedent of the Legislative Council. Tsang made reference to Standing Order 92, which stated "In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures".<ref>[http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/procedur/content/partn.htm#92 Procedure if Rules of Procedure do not Provide] The Legislative Council -- Procedures</ref> Standing Order 92 therefore may implicitly give Council President discretion on whether he should or should not follow the cloture rules of other legislatures, but this is up to debate. Legislative Council President Tsang chose to end debate without calling for a cloture vote, which is questionable. Council member Leung Kwok-hung then stood up and said that he had never heard of cloture without a vote anywhere else and suggested there should have been a cloture vote.

Cloture was again invoked by Tsang Yok-sing on 13 May 2013 to halt debate of the 2013 Appropriation Bill.

==New Zealand==
In the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]], any MP called to speak may move a closure motion. If the length of the debate is not fixed by [[rules of order|standing orders]] or the [[Select committees in the New Zealand Parliament|Business Committee]], the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker]] may decide to put the closure motion to a vote, which is carried by a [[majority|simple majority]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/rules/standing-orders/chapter3/00HOHPBReferenceStOrdersChapter3GClosure1/closure-of-debate |title=Chapter 3: General procedures |publisher=[[Parliament of New Zealand]] |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>

==United Kingdom==

===Procedures===
A ''closure motion''  may be adopted to end debate on a matter in both the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]<ref name="ukparlclosure">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/closure-motion/|title=Closure motions|work=Glossary|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> and in the [[House of Lords]]<ref name="ukparlclosure"/> by a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]] of those voting. In the House of Commons, at least 100 MPs (not counting two acting as tellers) must vote in favour of the motion for closure to be adopted;<ref name="ukparlclosure"/> the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] may choose to deny the closure motion,<ref name="ukparlclosure"/> if he or she feels that insufficient debate has occurred, or that the procedure is being used to violate the rights of the minority.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the House of Lords, the [[Lord Speaker]] does not possess an equivalent power.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Only one closure motion is permitted per debate.<ref name="ukparlclosure"/>

Specific to legislation, a ''guillotine motion'', formally an ''allocation of time motion'', limits the amount of time for a particular [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Stages of a bill|stage of a bill]].<ref name="allocationukparl">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/allocation-of-time-motion/|title=Allocation of time motions|work=Glossary|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Debate ceases when the allotted time expires; a single vote is taken immediately to pass the stage of the bill and, in the case of a [[committee stage]] or [[report stage]], to accept all undebated sections and government amendments.

{{United States Senate}}

===History===
On 8 March 1917, during [[World War I]], a rule allowing cloture of a debate was adopted by the Senate on a 76–3 roll call vote<ref>55 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNOm2K-A4AoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Congressional Record] p. 45 (8 March 1917)</ref> at the urging of President [[Woodrow Wilson]],<ref name="Filibuster_Cloture">{{cite web |url = https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm | title= Filibuster and Cloture |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref> after a group of 12 anti-war senators managed to kill a bill that would have allowed Wilson to arm [[Merchant Vessel|merchant vessels]] in the face of unrestricted [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German submarine warfare]].<ref>See [[John F.

The Senate's cloture rule originally<ref>Koger, Gregory ''Cloture Reform and Party Government in the Senate, 1918-1925'', Journal of Politics, Vol. 68, No. 3 (Aug 2006), pp. 708–719.</ref> required a [[supermajority]] of two-thirds of all senators "present and voting" to be considered ''filibuster-proof''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Times staff, wires |title=Q&A: How does a filibuster work? |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=2008-11-18 |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article907426.ece |accessdate=2008-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202070420/http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article907426.ece |archive-date=2 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Democrats still in the quest for 60 Senate seats |publisher=CNN |date=2008-11-04 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/senate.races.results/ |accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref> For example, if all 100 senators voted on a cloture motion, 67 of those votes would have to be for cloture for it to pass; however if some senators were absent and only 80 senators voted on a cloture motion, only 54 would have to vote in favor.<ref name="senate.gov">[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30360.pdf ''Filibusters and Cloture in the Senate''], Richard S. Beth and Stanley Bach, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress: 23 March 2003, p. 13.</ref> However, it proved very difficult to achieve this. The Senate tried 11 times between 1927 and 1962 to invoke cloture but failed each time. Filibuster use was particularly heavy by Democratic senators from southern states to block [[civil rights]] legislation.<ref>Loevy, Robert D. (1997). ''The Civil Rights Act of 1964: The Passage of the Law that Ended Racial Segregation'' SUNY Press. p. 29.</ref>

In 1975, the [[94th United States Congress|Democratic Senate majority]], having achieved a net gain of four seats in the [[1974 United States Senate elections|1974 Senate elections]] to attain a strength of 61 (with an additional independent senator caucusing with them for a total of 62), reduced the necessary supermajority to three-fifths (60 out of 100).<ref>[http://rule22.wordpress.com/what-is-rule-22/ "What is Rule 22?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521094452/http://rule22.wordpress.com/what-is-rule-22/ |date=21 May 2011 }}, Rule22 Blog, 5/28/2011.</ref> However, as a compromise to those who were against the revision, the new rule also changed the requirement for determining the number of votes needed for a cloture motion's passage from those senators "present and voting" to those senators "duly chosen and sworn". Thus, 60 votes for cloture would be necessary regardless of whether every senator voted. The only time a lesser number would become acceptable is when a Senate seat is vacant. For example, if there were two vacancies in the Senate, thereby making 98 senators "duly chosen and sworn", it would take only 59 votes for a cloture motion to pass.<ref name="senate.gov"/>

The new version of the cloture rule requiring three-fifths (60%) rather than two-thirds (66.7%) approval, which has remained in place since 1975, makes it considerably easier for the Senate majority to invoke cloture.{{cn|date=October 2020}}<!-- for a 'forever since' claim like this to stay in, WP is going to need a source from recent years nearer 2020 -->  Even so, a successful cloture motion on legislation is uncommon.

Bills considered under the [[reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation process]] established in 1974 (certain bills concerning spending and the budget) cannot be filibustered and therefore don't require a supermajority cloture vote.

The U.S. House of Representatives does not have a cloture procedure, since filibustering is not possible in that body.

===Procedure===
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2013}}
The three-fifths version of the cloture rule does not apply to motions to end filibusters relating to Senate Rule changes. To invoke cloture to end debate over changing the Senate rules, the original version of the rule (two-thirds of those Senators "present and voting") still applies.<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/98-425.pdf ''Invoking Cloture in the Senate''], Christopher M. Davis, 4 June 2007, page 2.</ref>

The procedure for "invoking cloture", or ending a filibuster, is as follows:
* A minimum of 16 senators must sign a petition for cloture.
* The petition may be presented by interrupting another Senator's speech.
* The clerk reads the petition.
* The cloture petition is ignored for one full day during which the Senate is sitting (called a "Legislative Day"). For example, if the petition is filed on Monday, it is ignored until Wednesday; if the petition is filed on a Friday, it is ignored until Tuesday, assuming that the Senate did not sit on Saturday or Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Christopher|title=Invoking Cloture in the Senate|url=https://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%26*2%3C4QLS%3E%0A|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref>
* On the second Legislative Day after the presentation of the petition, after the Senate has been sitting for one hour, a "[[quorum call]]" is undertaken to ensure a majority of the Senators are present. However, the mandatory quorum call is often waived by [[unanimous consent]].
* The [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]] presents the petition.
* The Senate votes on the petition; three-fifths of the whole number of Senators (sixty if there are no vacancies) is the required majority; however, when cloture is invoked on a question of changing the rules of the Senate, two-thirds of the Senators voting (not necessarily two-thirds of all Senators) is the requisite majority. This is commonly referred to as a "test vote".
* Cloture on a presidential nomination requires a simple majority of those present and voting. This was changed for all presidential appointments other than [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominees in a 21 November 2013 Senate vote (the so-called "[[nuclear option]]"),<ref name="crs">{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Christopher M.|title=Invoking Cloture in the Senate|url=https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/be873e40-a966-4feb-9d72-cf23a93cbe46.pdf|website=CRS Reports|publisher=Congressional Research Service | date=24 April 2015|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref> and was further extended to include Supreme Court nominees in an 6 April 2017 Senate vote.

* No more than 30 additional hours of debate may occur on the bill in question<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Cloture_vrd.htm|title=Virtual Reference Desk - Cloture|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref> (though this additional time is commonly shortened or vitiated altogether; in addition, since the [[nuclear option]] of April 2019, nominations to subcabinet [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]], or [[Federal government of the United States#Judicial branch|district court]], positions normally mandate only 2 additional hours).
* No Senator may speak for more than one hour.
* No [[Bill (proposed law)|amendments]] may be moved unless they were filed on the day between the presentation of the petition and the actual cloture vote.
* All amendments must be relevant to the debate.
* Certain procedural [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] are not permissible. Senate Rule XXII provides that no [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)#Dilatory motions and tactics|dilatory]] motion or amendment is in order under cloture.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rules.senate.gov/rules-of-the-senate | title=Rules of the Senate | publisher=United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration | accessdate=25 May 2020}}</ref> While there is no exact list of what motions are dilatory, "Motions to adjourn, postpone, recess, suspend the rules, and reconsider have been held to be dilatory. There also is precedent supporting the authority of the presiding officer to rule that a quorum call is dilatory under these circumstances."<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30360.pdf "Filibusters and Cloture in the Senate"], Valerie Heitshusen and Richard S. Beth, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress: 7 April 2017 p.17</ref>
* The [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|presiding officer]] gains additional powers in controlling debate such as the power to count to determine whether a quorum is present and to rule amendments, motions, and other actions out of order on the grounds that they are dilatory.
* No other matters may be considered until the question upon which cloture was invoked is resolved.
