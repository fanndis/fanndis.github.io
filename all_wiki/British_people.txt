{{See also|Glossary of names for the British}}
The earliest known reference to the inhabitants of Great Britain may have come from 4th century BC records of the voyage of [[Pytheas]], a [[ancient Greece|Greek]] geographer who made a voyage of exploration around the [[British Isles]]. Although none of his own writings remain, writers during the time of the [[Roman Empire]] made much reference to them. Pytheas called the islands collectively {{lang|grc|αἱ Βρεττανίαι}} (''hai Brettaniai''), which has been translated as the ''Brittanic Isles'', and the peoples of what are today [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]] of ''Prettanike'' were called the {{lang|grc|Πρεττανοί}} (''Prettanoi''), ''Priteni'', ''Pritani'' or ''Pretani''.

The group included [[Ireland]], which was referred to as ''Ierne'' (''Insula sacra'' "sacred island" as the Greeks interpreted it) "inhabited by the different race of ''Hiberni''" (''gens hibernorum''), and Britain as ''insula Albionum'', "island of the Albions".<ref name=snyder>{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=Christopher A.|title=The Britons|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|year=2003|isbn=0-631-22260-X|url=https://archive.org/details/britons00snyd}}</ref><ref name=ohi>{{cite book|author=Donnchadh Ó Corráin|editor-last=Foster|editor-first=R.

By 50 BC Greek geographers were using equivalents of ''Prettanikē'' as a collective name for the [[British Isles]].<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Rahilly| 1946}}</ref> However, with the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] the Latin term ''[[Britannia]]'' was used for the island of Great Britain, and later Roman-occupied Britain south of [[Caledonia]] (modern day Scotland north of the rivers Forth & Clyde), although the people of Caledonia and the north were also the self same Britons during the Roman period, the Gaels arriving four centuries later.<ref>[[wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#20|4.20]] provides a translation describing Caesar's first invasion, using terms which from [[wikisource:Commentarii de bello Gallico - Liber IV#20|IV.XX]] appear in [[Latin]] as arriving ''tamen in Britanniam'', the inhabitants being ''Britannos'', and on p.30 ''principes Britanniae'' is translated as "chiefs of Britain".</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Cunliffe|2002|pp=94–95}}</ref> Following the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the island of Great Britain was left open to invasion by [[paganism|pagan]], seafaring warriors such as [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] from [[Continental Europe]], who gained control in areas around the south east, and to [[Middle Irish]]-speaking people migrating from what is today [[Northern Ireland]] to the north of Great Britain (modern [[Scotland]]), founding Gaelic kingdoms such as [[Dál Riata]] and [[Alba]], which would eventually subsume the native Brittonic and Pictish kingdoms and become Scotland.<ref name="sax1">{{cite web | title = Anglo-Saxons | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/ | work = BBC News | accessdate = 5 September 2009}}</ref>

In this [[sub-Roman Britain]], as Anglo-Saxon culture spread across southern and eastern Britain and Gaelic through much of the north, the demonym "Briton" became restricted to the Brittonic-speaking inhabitants of what would later be called [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[North West England]] ([[Cumbria]]), and  a southern part of [[Scotland]]<ref>Foster, Sally M.

However, the term Britannia persisted as the Latin name for the island. The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' claimed legendary origins as a prestigious [[genealogy]] for [[King of the Britons|Brittonic kings]], followed by the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' which popularised this pseudo-history to support the claims of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]].<ref name="Consci1" />

During the [[Middle Ages]], and particularly in the [[Tudor period]], the term "British" was used to refer to the [[Welsh people]] and [[Cornish people]].

Between the 8th and 11th centuries, "three major cultural divisions" had emerged in Great Britain: the [[English people|English]], the [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Welsh people|Welsh]], the earlier Brittonic Celtic polities in what are today England and Scotland having finally been absorbed into Anglo-Saxon England and Gaelic Scotland by the early 11th century.<ref name="Smyth24-25">{{Harvnb|Smyth|1998|pp=24–25}}</ref> The English had been unified under a single [[nation state]] in 937 by King [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan of Wessex]] after the [[Battle of Brunanburh]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/athelstan.shtml | title = Athelstan (c.895 – 939) | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 18 May 2009}}</ref> Before then, the English (known then in [[Old English]] as the ''Anglecynn'') were under the governance of independent Anglo-Saxon [[petty kingdom]]s which gradually coalesced into a [[Heptarchy]] of seven powerful states, the most powerful of which were [[Mercia]] and [[Wessex]].

After 1707, a British national identity began to develop, though it was initially resisted, particularly by the English.<ref name="Colley1213" /> The peoples of Great Britain had by the 1750s begun to assume a "layered identity": to think of themselves as simultaneously British and also Scottish, English, or Welsh.<ref name="Colley1213" />

The terms [[North Briton]] and [[South Briton]] were devised for the Scots and the English respectively, with the former gaining some preference in Scotland, particularly by the economists and philosophers of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|Skinner|1985|p=39}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Broadie|2003|p=14}}.</ref> Indeed, it was the "Scots [who] played key roles in shaping the contours of British identity";<ref name="Gottlieb15">{{Harvnb|Gottlieb|2007|p=15}}.</ref> "their scepticism about the Union allowed the Scots the space and time in which

[[Britannia]], the new [[national personification]] of Great Britain, was established in the 1750s as a representation of "nation and empire rather than any single national hero".{{sfn|Whale|Copley|1992|p=81}} On Britannia and British identity, historian Peter Borsay wrote: {{quote|Up until 1797 Britannia was conventionally depicted holding a spear, but as a consequence of the increasingly prominent role of the Royal Navy in the war against the French, and of several spectacular victories, the spear was replaced by a trident...

Myth, memory, and place: Monmouth and Bath 1750–1900.'' [[Journal of Social History]] March 22, 2006</ref>}}

From the Union of 1707 through to the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, Great Britain was "involved in successive, very dangerous wars with Catholic France",<ref name="Colley18">{{Harvnb|Colley|1992|p=18}}.</ref> but which "all brought enough military and naval victories&nbsp;... to flatter British pride".<ref name="Colley52">{{Harvnb|Colley|1992|p=52}}.</ref> As the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with the [[First French Empire]] advanced, "the English and Scottish learned to define themselves as similar primarily by virtue of not being French or Catholic".<ref name="Allan17">{{Harvnb|Allan|2008|p=17}}.</ref> In combination with sea power and empire, the notion of Britishness became more "closely bound up with Protestantism",<ref name="Colley8">{{Harvnb|Colley|1992|p=8}}.</ref> a cultural commonality through which the English, Scots and Welsh became "fused together, and remain[ed] so, despite their many cultural divergences".<ref name="Colley386">{{Harvnb|Colley|1992|p=368}}.</ref>

The neo-classical monuments that proliferated at the end of the 18th century and the start of the 19th century, such as [[The Kymin]] at [[Monmouth]], were attempts to meld the concepts of Britishness with the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman empires]] of [[classical antiquity]]. The new and expanding [[British Empire]] provided "unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility and the accumulations of wealth", and so the "Scottish, Welsh and Irish populations were prepared to suppress nationalist issues on pragmatic grounds".{{sfn|Rojek|2008|p=8}} The British Empire was "crucial to the idea of a British identity and to the self-image of Britishness".<ref>{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|p=xi}}</ref> Indeed, the Scottish welcomed Britishness during the 19th century "for it offered a context within which they could hold on to their own identity whilst participating in, and benefiting from, the expansion of the [British] Empire".<ref name="Williams17" /> Similarly, the "new emphasis of Britishness was broadly welcomed by the Welsh who considered themselves to be the lineal descendants of the ancient Britons – a word that was still used to refer exclusively to the Welsh".<ref name="Williams17">{{Harvnb|Williams|2006|p=17}}.</ref> For the English, however, by the [[Victorian era]] their enthusiastic adoption of Britishness had meant that, for them, Britishness "meant the same as 'Englishness'",<ref>{{Harvnb|Hilton|2006|p=714}}.</ref>{{sfn|Caunce et al. 2004|p=92}} so much so that "Englishness and Britishness" and "'England' and 'Britain' were used interchangeably in a variety of contexts".<ref name="Anderson34">{{Harvnb|Anderson|2006|p=34}}.</ref> Britishness came to borrow{{clarify|date=January 2016}} heavily from English political history because England had "always been the dominant component of the British Isles in terms of size, population and power"; [[Magna Carta]], [[common law]] and hostility to [[continental Europe]] were English factors that influenced British sensibilities.<ref name="Langlands">{{citation | first=Rebecca | last = Langlands | year = 1999 | title = Britishness or Englishness?

===Union with Ireland===
The [[Acts of Union 1800|political union in 1800]] of the predominantly Catholic [[Kingdom of Ireland]] with Great Britain, coupled with the outbreak of peace with France in the early 19th century, challenged the previous century's concept of militant Protestant Britishness.<ref name="Colley322">{{Harvnb|Colley|1992|p=322}}.</ref><ref name="Spohn22" /> The new, expanded [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] meant that the state had to re-evaluate its position on the civil rights of Catholics, and extend its definition of Britishness to the [[Irish people]].<ref name="Spohn22">{{Harvnb|Ichijo|Spohn|2005|p=22}}</ref><ref name="Howe40">{{Harvnb|Howe|2002|p=40}}.</ref> Like the terms that had been invented at the time of the Acts of Union 1707, "[[West Brit]]on" was introduced for the Irish after 1800. In 1832 [[Daniel O'Connell]], an Irish politician who campaigned for [[Catholic Emancipation]], stated in Britain's [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]: {{quote|[[Irish people|The people of Ireland]] are ready to become a portion of the [[British Empire]], provided they be made so in reality and not in name alone; they are ready to become a kind of West Briton if made so in benefits and justice; but if not, we are Irishmen again.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|Rose|2006|p=93}}.</ref>}}

[[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Ireland, from 1801 to 1923]], was marked by a succession of economic and political mismanagement and neglect, which marginalised the Irish,<ref name="Howe40" /> and advanced [[Irish nationalism]].

The [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]] reflected a "marked change in attitudes" in Great Britain towards Catholics and Catholicism.<ref name="Colley324">{{Harvnb|Colley|1992|pp=324–325}}.</ref> A "significant" example of this was the collaboration between [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]], an "ardent Roman Catholic" and son of a Frenchman, and Sir [[Charles Barry]], "a confirmed Protestant", in redesigning the [[Palace of Westminster]]—"the building that most enshrines&nbsp;... Britain's national and imperial pre-tensions".<ref name="Colley324" /> Protestantism gave way to [[imperialism]] as the leading element of British national identity during the Victorian and [[Edwardian era]]s,<ref name="Ward16" /> and as such, a series of royal, imperial and national celebrations were introduced to the British people to assert imperial British culture and give themselves a sense of uniqueness, superiority and national consciousness.<ref name="Spohn22" /><ref name="Ward16" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Bush|2006|p=177}}.</ref> [[Empire Day]] and jubilees of [[Queen Victoria]] were introduced to the British [[middle class]],<ref name="Ward16" /> but quickly "merged into a national 'tradition'".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacKenzie|1989|p=135}}.</ref>

(Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|thumb|right|A famous [[World War I|First World War]]-era [[Lord Kitchener Wants You|recruitment poster]], stressing the concept of British national identity]]

The [[World War I|First World War]] "reinforced the sense of Britishness" and patriotism in the early 20th century.<ref name="Spohn22" /><ref name="Ward96" /> Through war service (including conscription in Great Britain), "the English, Welsh, Scots and Irish fought as British".<ref name="Spohn22" /> The aftermath of the war institutionalised British national commemoration through [[Remembrance Sunday]] and the [[Poppy Appeal]].<ref name="Spohn22" /> The [[World War II|Second World War]] had a similar unifying effect upon the British people,<ref name="Spohn23">{{Harvnb|Ichijo|Spohn|2005|p=23}}</ref> however, its outcome was to recondition Britishness on a basis of [[Democracy|democratic values]] and its marked contrast to [[Europeanism]].<ref name="Spohn23" /> Notions that the British "constituted an Island race, and that it stood for democracy were reinforced during the war and they were circulated in the country through [[Winston Churchill]]'s speeches, history books and newspapers".<ref name="Spohn23" />

At its international zenith, "Britishness joined peoples around the world in shared traditions and common loyalties that were strenuously maintained".<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian-Smith et al. 2007|p=1}}.</ref> But following the two world wars, the British Empire experienced rapid [[decolonisation]]. The secession of the [[Irish Free State]] from the United Kingdom meant that Britishness had lost "its Irish dimension" in 1922,<ref name="Spohn23" /> and the shrinking empire supplanted by independence movements dwindled the appeal of British identity in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] during the mid-20th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian-Smith et al. 2007|p=236}}.</ref>

Since the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] and the subsequent mass [[immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|immigration to the United Kingdom]] from the Commonwealth and elsewhere in the world, "the expression and experience of cultural life in Britain has become fragmented and reshaped by the influences of gender, ethnicity, class and region".<ref>{{Harvnb|Christopher|1999|p=xi}}.</ref> Furthermore, the United Kingdom's membership of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 eroded the concept of Britishness as distinct from [[continental Europe]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian-Smith et al. 2007|p=3}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|p=240}}.</ref> As such, since the 1970s "there has been a sense of crisis about what it has meant to be British",<ref name="Ward1">{{Harvnb|Ward|2004|p=1}}.</ref> exacerbated by growing demands for greater political autonomy for [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]].<ref name="Spohn25">{{Harvnb|Ichijo|Spohn|2005|p=25}}</ref>

The earliest migrations of Britons date from the 5th and 6th centuries AD, when Brittonic Celts fleeing the Anglo-Saxon invasions migrated what is today northern France and north western Spain and forged the colonies of [[Brittany]] and [[Britonia]]. Brittany remained independent of France until the early 16th century and still retains a distinct Brittonic culture and language, whilst Britonia in modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] was absorbed into Spanish states by the end of the 9th century AD.

Britons – people with British citizenship or of British descent – have a significant presence in a number of countries other than the United Kingdom, and in particular in those with historic connections to the [[British Empire]]. After the [[Age of Discovery]] the British were one of the earliest and largest communities to emigrate out of [[Europe]], and the British Empire's expansion during the first half of the 19th century triggered an "extraordinary dispersion of the British people", resulting in particular concentrations "in [[Australasia]] and [[North America]]".<ref name="BritDis47">{{Harvnb|Ember et al. 2004|p=47}}.</ref>

The British Empire was "built on waves of migration overseas by British people",<ref name="Marsh254">{{harvnb|Marshall|2001|p=254}}.</ref> who left the United Kingdom and "reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures in three continents".<ref name="BritDis47" /> As a result of the [[British colonisation of the Americas]], what became the [[United States]] was "easily the greatest single destination of emigrant British", but in [[Australia]] the British experienced a [[birth rate]] higher than "anything seen before" resulting in the displacement of [[indigenous Australians]].<ref name="BritDis47" />

In colonies such as [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[British East Africa]] and [[Cape Colony]], permanently resident British communities were established and whilst never more than a numerical minority these Britons "exercised a dominant influence" upon the culture and politics of those lands.<ref name="Marsh254" /> In Australia, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] "people of British origin came to constitute the majority of the population" contributing to these states becoming integral to the [[Anglosphere]].<ref name="Marsh254" />

France ceded nearly all of [[New France]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]], and so after the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]] formed "the nucleus of the colonies that constituted Britain's remaining stake on the North American continent".<ref name="Marsh34">{{harvnb|Marshall|2001|p=34}}</ref> [[British North America]] attracted the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, Britons who migrated out of what they considered the "rebellious" [[United States]], increasing the size of British communities in what was to become Canada.<ref name="Marsh34" />

=== Hong Kong ===
{{see also|British nationality law and Hong Kong|British National (Overseas)|Britons in Hong Kong|Hong Kong Handover}}{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
British nationality law as it pertains to [[Hong Kong]] has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a [[British colony]] in 1842. From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to its modern role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.
Citizenship matters were complicated by the fact that [[British nationality law]] treated those born in Hong Kong as [[British subjects]] (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as such. The main reason for this was that recognising these people as British was seen as a tacit acceptance of a series of historical treaties that the PRC labelled as "unequal", including the ones which ceded [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the [[New Territories]] to Britain. The British government, however, recognising the unique political situation of Hong Kong, granted 3.4&nbsp;million Hong Kongers a new type of nationality known as [[British National (Overseas)]], which is established in accordance with the Hong Kong Act 1985. Among those 3.4&nbsp;million people, there are many British Nationals (Overseas) who are eligible for full British citizenship. Both British Nationals (Overseas) and British citizens are British nationals and [[Commonwealth citizen]]s according to the British Nationality Law, which enables them to various rights in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[European Union]].

A significant number of them settled in [[Magallanes Province]], especially in the city of [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]] when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan. Around 32,000 English settled in [[Valparaíso]], influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name=galeon>{{cite web |url=http://www.galeon.com/typepad/ |title=Inmigración britanica en Chile |accessdate=25 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822074242/http://www.galeon.com/typepad/ |archive-date=22 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914 and the outbreak of the [[First World War]] drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe.

In [[Valparaíso]], they created their largest and most important colony, bringing with them neighbourhoods of British character, schools, [[social clubs]], [[sports clubs]], [[business organisations]] and [[periodicals]]. Even today their influence is apparent in specific areas, such as the banks and the navy, as well as in certain social activities, such as [[Association football|football]], horse racing, and the custom of drinking tea.

During the movement for [[independence]] (1818), it was mainly the British who formed the [[Chilean Navy]], under the command of [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]].

British investment helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific. Chile won two wars, the first against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the second, the [[War of the Pacific]], in 1878–79, against an alliance between [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. The liberal-socialist "Revolution of 1891" introduced political reforms modelled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking.

British immigrants were also important in the northern zone of the country during the [[saltpetre]] boom, in the ports of [[Iquique]] and [[Pisagua, Chile|Pisagua]]. The "King of Saltpetre", [[John Thomas North]], was the principal tycoon of nitrate mining. The British legacy is reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of Iquique, with the foundation of various institutions, such as the [[Club Hipico de Santiago|Club Hípico]] (Racing Club). Nevertheless, the British active presence came to an end with the saltpetre crisis during the 1930s.

Some [[Scottish people|Scots]] settled in the country's more temperate regions, where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland) while [[English Chilean|English]] and [[Welsh Chilean|Welsh]] made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, arrived as [[merchants]], [[tradesmen]] and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports.

An important contingent of British (principally Welsh) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950, settling in the present-day region of [[Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes]]. British families were established in other areas of the country, such as [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Coquimbo]], the [[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]], and [[Chiloé]].

The cultural legacy of the British in Chile is notable and has spread beyond the British Chilean community into society at large. Customs taken from the British include [[afternoon tea]] (called [[Tea|onces]] by Chileans), [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and [[horse racing]]. Another legacy is the widespread use of British personal names by Chileans.

Chile has the largest population of descendants of British settlers in Latin America. Over 700,000 Chileans may have British (English, [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]]) origin, amounting to 4.5% of Chile's population.<ref name="british">{{citation | url = http://www.biografiadechile.cl/detalle.php?IdContenido=1673&IdCategoria=91&IdArea=488&TituloPagina=Historia%20de%20Chile | title = Historia de Chile, Británicos y Anglosajones en Chile durante el siglo XIX | accessdate = 15 September 2009 | publisher = biografiadechile.cl}}</ref>

The British arrived in the area which would become the modern-day [[South Africa]] during the early 18th century, yet substantial settlement only started end of the 18th century, in the [[Cape of Good Hope]]; the British first explored the area for conquests for or related to the Slave Trade. In the late 19th century, the discovery of gold and diamonds further encouraged colonisation of South Africa by the British, and the population of the British-South Africans rose substantially, although there was fierce rivalry between the British and [[Afrikaners]] (descendants of Dutch colonists) in the period known as the [[Boer Wars]]. When apartheid first started most British-South Africans were mostly keen on keeping and even strengthening its ties with the United Kingdom. The latest census in South Africa showed that there are almost 2&nbsp;million British-South Africans; they make up about 40% of the total [[White South African]] demographic, and the greatest white British ancestry populations in South Africa are in the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province and in the cities of [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]] and [[Port Elizabeth]].

Plantations of Ireland introduced large numbers of people from Great Britain to [[Ireland]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]]. The resulting [[Protestant Ascendancy]], the aristocratic class of the [[Lordship of Ireland]], broadly identified themselves as [[Anglo-Irish]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Finnegan|McCarron|2000|p=14}}.</ref> In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Protestant British settlers subjugated Catholic, Gaelic inhabitants in the north of Ireland during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]; it was "an explicit attempt to control Ireland strategically by introducing ethnic and religious elements loyal to the British interest in Ireland".<ref name="Craith169">{{harvnb|Craith|2002|p=169}}.</ref>

The [[Ulster Scots people]] are an ethnic group of British origin in Ireland, broadly descended from [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]] who settled in large numbers in the Province of [[Ulster]] during the planned process of [[colonisation]]s of Ireland which took place in the reign of James VI of Scotland and I of England. Together with English and Welsh settlers, these Scots introduced Protestantism (particularly the [[Presbyterianism]] of the [[Church of Scotland]]) and the [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] and [[English language]]s to, mainly, northeastern Ireland. With the partition of Ireland and independence for what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] some of these people found themselves no longer living within the United Kingdom.

Northern Ireland itself was, for many years, the site of a violent and bitter ethno-sectarian conflict—[[The Troubles]]—between those claiming to represent [[Irish nationalism]], who are predominantly [[Roman Catholic]], and those claiming to represent [[Unionism in Ireland|British unionism]], who are predominantly [[Protestant]].<ref>{{citation | title = Northern Ireland LIFE & TIMES survey.

Since the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998, most of the paramilitary groups involved in the Troubles have ceased their armed campaigns, and constitutionally, the [[people of Northern Ireland]] have been recognised as "all persons born in Northern Ireland and having, at the time of their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence".<ref name="GFA">{{Citation

== Culture ==
{{See also|Culture of the United Kingdom}}

Result from the expansion of the [[British Empire]], British cultural influence can be observed in the language and culture of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United States]], and the [[British overseas territory|British overseas territories]]. These states are sometimes collectively known as the [[Anglosphere]].{{sfn|Bennett|2004|p=80}} As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly [[British cuisine]]. Innovations and movements within the wider-[[culture of Europe]] have also changed the United Kingdom; [[Humanism]], [[Protestantism]], and [[representative democracy]] have developed from broader [[Western culture]].

As a result of the [[history of the formation of the United Kingdom]], the [[Culture of England|cultures of England]], [[Culture of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Culture of Wales|Wales]], and [[Culture of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] are diverse and have varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|British cuisine}}
[[File:Fish and chips.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fish and chips]], a popular [[take-away food]] throughout the United Kingdom, has been described as the quintessential British dish.<ref name="Walton">{{Harvnb|Walton|2000|p=1}}.</ref>]]
Historically, [[British cuisine]] has meant "unfussy dishes made with quality local ingredients, matched with simple sauces to accentuate flavour, rather than disguise it".<ref>{{citation |url = http://goodfood.uktv.co.uk|publisher = uktv.co.uk|work = [[UKTV]]|title = British cuisine|accessdate = 23 May 2008}}</ref> It has been "vilified as unimaginative and heavy", and traditionally been limited in its international recognition to the [[full breakfast]] and the [[Christmas dinner]].<ref name="Spencer">{{Harvnb|Spencer|2003|pp=7–10}}.</ref> This is despite British cuisine having absorbed the culinary influences of those who have [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|settled in Britain]], resulting in hybrid dishes such as the [[British Asian]] [[Chicken tikka masala]], hailed by some as "Britain's true national dish".<ref name="bbcenc">{{citation | author= BBC E-Cyclopedia | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1285804.stm | title=Chicken tikka masala: Spice and easy does it | work = [[BBC News]] | accessdate=28 September 2007 | date=20 April 2001}}</ref>

[[Celtic fields|Celtic agriculture]] and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for Celts and Britons. The Anglo-Saxons developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe. The [[Norman conquest of England]] introduced exotic spices into Britain in the Middle Ages.<ref name="Spencer" /> The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of [[Indian cuisine|India's food tradition]] of "strong, penetrating spices and herbs".<ref name="Spencer" /> [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|Food rationing policies]], imposed by the British government during wartime periods of the 20th century, are said to have been the stimulus for British cuisine's poor international reputation.<ref name="Spencer" />

British dishes include [[fish and chips]], the [[Sunday roast]], and [[bangers and mash]]. British cuisine has several national and regional varieties, including [[English cuisine|English]], [[Scottish cuisine|Scottish]] and [[Welsh cuisine]], each of which has developed its own regional or local dishes, many of which are [[Geographically indicated foods of the United Kingdom|geographically indicated foods]] such as [[Cheddar cheese]], [[Cheshire cheese]], the [[Yorkshire pudding]], [[Arbroath Smokie]], [[Cornish pasty]] and [[Welsh cake]]s.

Historically, [[Christianity]] has been the most influential and important religion in Britain, and it remains the declared faith of the majority of the British people.<ref name="Briton2001234">{{Harvnb|Office for National Statistics|2000|p=234}}</ref> The influence of Christianity on British culture has been "widespread, extending beyond the spheres of prayer and worship. Churches and cathedrals make a significant contribution to the architectural landscape of the nation's cities and towns" whilst "many schools and hospitals were founded by men and women who were strongly influenced by Christian motives".<ref name="Briton2001234" /> Throughout the United Kingdom, [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]], the "two most important events in the Christian calendar", are recognised as [[holiday|public holidays]].<ref name="Briton2001234" />

Christianity remains the major religion of the population of the United Kingdom in the 21st century, followed by [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and then [[Judaism]] in terms of numbers of adherents. The 2007 [[Tearfund]] Survey revealed 53% identified themselves as Christian, which was similar to the 2004 [[British Social Attitudes Survey]],<ref name="Tearfund_Survey">{{citation|url=http://www.tearfund.org/webdocs/Website/News/Final%20churchgoing%20report.pdf |title=Tearfund Survey 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2007 |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614005402/http://www.tearfund.org/webdocs/Website/News/Final%20churchgoing%20report.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}</ref><ref name="BSAS2004">{{Citation|publication-date=20 February 2006 |year=2004 |title=British Social Attitudes Survey |publisher=data-archive.ac.uk |author=National Centre for Social Research |url=http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5329 |accessdate=25 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112165559/http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5329 |archivedate=12 November 2007 }}</ref> and to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] in which 71.6% said that Christianity was their religion,<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=293 | title = UK Census 2001 | accessdate = 22 April 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312034628/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=293 <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 12 March 2007}}</ref> However, the Tearfund Survey showed only one in ten Britons attend church weekly.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.methodist.org.uk/downloads/pr-Tearfund-Prayer-in-the-UK-report_1.pdf | publisher = methodist.org.uk | title = Prayer in the UK | date = 11 November 2007 | accessdate = 19 May 2009 | author = Tearfund| author-link = Tearfund }}</ref> [[Secularism]] was advanced in Britain during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and modern British organisations such as the [[British Humanist Association]] and the [[National Secular Society]] offer the opportunity for their members to "debate and explore the moral and philosophical issues in a non-religious setting".<ref name="Briton2001234" />

The [[Treaty of Union]] that led to the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured that there would be a [[Protestant]] succession as well as a link between [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] that still remains. The [[Church of England]] ([[Anglican]]) is legally recognised as the [[established church]], and so retains representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] through the [[Lords Spiritual]], whilst the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] is a member of the church as well as its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]].<ref name="Briton2001235">{{Harvnb|Office for National Statistics|2000|p=235}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ | title = The History of the Church of England | author = Church of England | accessdate = 23 November 2008 | publisher = cofe.anglican.org}}</ref> The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] that can then be passed into law by Parliament.

The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as [[The Kirk]]), is recognised as the [[national church]] of Scotland and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the church upon his or her accession.

[[Sport]] is an important element of British culture, and is one of the most popular leisure activities of Britons. Within the United Kingdom, nearly half of all adults partake in one or more sporting activity each week.<ref name="Briton2001282">{{Harvnb|Office for National Statistics|2000|p=282}}</ref> Some of the major sports in the United Kingdom "were invented by the British",<ref name="Briton2001293">{{Harvnb|Office for National Statistics|2000|p=293}}</ref> including [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]] and [[cricket]], and "exported various other games" including [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[boxing]], [[golf]], [[snooker]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]].<ref name="Misc164">{{Harvnb|O'Meara|2007|pp=164–166}}.</ref>

In most sports, separate organisations, teams and clubs represent the individual [[countries of the United Kingdom]] at international level, though in some sports, like rugby union, an all-Ireland team represents both Northern Ireland and Ireland (Republic of), and the [[British and Irish Lions]] represent Ireland and Britain as a whole. The UK is represented by a single team at the [[Olympic Games]] and at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain team]] won 65 medals: 29 gold (the most since the [[1908 Summer Olympics]]), 17 silver and 19 bronze, ranking them 3rd.<ref>See the articles entitled [[All-time Olympic Games medal table]] and [[Great Britain at the Olympics]].</ref> In total, sportsmen and women from the UK "hold over 50 world titles in a variety of sports, such as professional boxing, rowing, snooker, squash and motorcycle sports".<ref name="Briton2001282" />

=== Visual art and architecture ===
{{Further|Architecture of the United Kingdom|Art of the United Kingdom}}
For centuries, artists and architects in Britain were overwhelmingly influenced by [[Western art history]].<ref name="Else78" /> Amongst the first visual artists credited for developing a distinctly British aesthetic and artistic style is [[William Hogarth]].<ref name="Else78">{{harvnb|Else et al. 2007|p=78}}.</ref> The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the [[British Empire]], led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom.<ref name="taste" /> Britons used their art "to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world", whilst the permanent settlers in British North America, Australasia, and South Africa "embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity".<ref name="taste" /> The empire has been "at the centre, rather than in the margins, of the history of British art", and imperial British visual arts have been fundamental to the construction, celebration and expression of Britishness.{{sfn|Barringer et al. 2007|p=3}}

British attitudes to [[modern art]] were "polarised" at the end of the 19th century.<ref name="Whittle5">{{harvnb|Whittle et al. 2005|p=5}}.</ref> Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; [[Impressionism]] was initially regarded by "many conservative critics" as a "subversive foreign influence", but became "fully assimilated" into British art during the early-20th century.<ref name="Whittle5" /> [[Representation (arts)|Representational art]] was described by [[Herbert Read]] during the [[interwar period]] as "necessarily... revolutionary", and was studied and produced to such an extent that by the 1950s, [[Classicism]] was effectively void in British visual art.<ref name="Whittle5" /> [[Postmodern art|Post-modern]], contemporary British art, particularly that of the [[Young British Artists]], has been pre-occupied with [[postcolonialism]], and "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture&nbsp;... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety".{{sfn|Barringer et al. 2007|p=17}}

[[Architecture of the United Kingdom]] is diverse; most influential developments have usually taken place in England, but Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have at various times played leading roles in architectural history.<ref name="BritEncart">{{citation|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=781533633 |title=British Architecture > page 1 |work=[[Encarta]] |publisher=MSN |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQNgfPK?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=781533633 |archivedate=31 October 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the British Isles, British architecture effectively begins with the first Anglo-Saxon Christian churches, built soon after [[Augustine of Canterbury]] arrived in Great Britain in 597.<ref name="BritEncart" /> [[Norman architecture]] was built on a vast scale from the 11th century onwards in the form of castles and churches to help impose Norman authority upon their dominion.<ref name="BritEncart" /> [[English Gothic architecture]], which flourished between 1180 until around 1520, was initially imported from France, but quickly developed its own unique qualities.<ref name="BritEncart" /> Secular [[medieval architecture]] throughout Britain has left a legacy of large stone [[castle]]s, with the "finest examples" being found lining both sides of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]], dating from the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] of the 14th century.<ref name="BritEncart2">{{citation|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=781533633&pn=2 |title=British Architecture > page 2 |work=[[Encarta]] |publisher=MSN |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQOJDjl?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=781533633&pn=2 |archivedate=31 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The invention of gunpowder and canons made castles redundant, and the [[English Renaissance]] which followed facilitiated the development of new artistic styles for domestic architecture: [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor style]], [[English Baroque]], [[Queen Anne Style architecture|The Queen Anne Style]] and [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]].<ref name="BritEncart2" /> [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]] advanced after the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

== Classification ==
{{See also|British nationality law|Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Census 2001 Ethnic Codes}}
According to the [[British Social Attitudes Survey]], there are broadly two interpretations of British identity, with ethnic and civic dimensions:

{{quote|The first group, which we term the ethnic dimension, contained the items about birthplace, ancestry, living in Britain, and sharing British customs and traditions. The second, or civic group, contained the items about feeling British, respecting laws and institutions, speaking English, and having British citizenship.<ref>{{harvnb|Park|2005|p=153}}.</ref>}}

Of the two perspectives of British identity, the civic definition has become "the dominant idea&nbsp;... by far",<ref name="Ichijo26" /> and in this capacity, Britishness is sometimes considered an institutional or overarching [[Sovereign state|state]] identity.<ref name="Langlands" /><ref name="Ichijo26" /><ref name="Brad34" /> This has been used to explain why first-, second- and third-generation immigrants are more likely to describe themselves as British, rather than English, because it is an "institutional, inclusive" identity, that can be acquired through [[naturalisation]] and [[British nationality law]];<ref name="Ichijo27">{{harvnb|Ichijo|Spohn|2005|p=27}}</ref> the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom who are from an ethnic minority feel British.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ethnic-minorities-feel-strong-sense-of-identity-with-britain-report-reveals-578503.html | work = [[The Independent]]| title = Ethnic minorities feel strong sense of identity with Britain, report reveals | first = Maxine | last = Frith | accessdate = 7 July 2009 | date = 8 January 2004 | location=London}}</ref>

However, this attitude is more common in England than in Scotland or Wales; "white English people perceived themselves as English first and as British second, and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds perceived themselves as British, but none identified as English, a label they associated exclusively with white people". Contrawise, in Scotland and Wales, [[White British]] and ethnic minority people both identified more strongly with Scotland and Wales than with Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Commission for Racial Equality|2005|p=35}}</ref>

Studies and surveys have "reported that the majority of the Scots and Welsh see themselves as both Scottish/Welsh and British though with some differences in emphasis".<ref name="Ichijo27" /> The [[Commission for Racial Equality]] found that with respect to notions of [[nationality]] in Britain, "the most basic, objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English, the Scots and the Welsh".<ref name="CRE22" /> However, "English participants tended to think of themselves as indistinguishably English or British, while both Scottish and Welsh participants identified themselves much more readily as Scottish or Welsh than as British".<ref name="CRE22" />

Some persons opted "to combine both identities" as "they felt Scottish or Welsh, but held a [[British passport]] and were therefore British", whereas others saw themselves as exclusively Scottish or exclusively Welsh and "felt quite divorced from the British, whom they saw as the English".<ref name="CRE22">{{harvnb|Commission for Racial Equality|2005|p=22}}</ref> Commentators have described this latter phenomenon as "[[nationalism]]", a rejection of British identity because some Scots and Welsh interpret it as "cultural imperialism imposed" upon the United Kingdom by "English ruling elites",<ref name="Ward2-3">{{Harvnb|Ward|2004|pp=2–3}}.</ref> or else a response to a historical misappropriation of equating the word "English" with "British",<ref>{{citation | url = http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/71887/sample/9780521771887ws.pdf| title = The Making of English National Identity | publisher = assets.cambridge.org | first = Krishan | last = Kumar | year = 2003 | accessdate = 5 June 2009}}</ref> which has "brought about a desire among Scots, Welsh and Irish to learn more about their heritage and distinguish themselves from the broader British identity".<ref>{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255337.stm | work = [[BBC News]]| date = 14 January 1999 | accessdate = 5 June 2009 | title = The English: Europe's lost tribe}}</ref>
