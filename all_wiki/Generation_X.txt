'''Generation X''' (or '''Gen X''' for short) is the [[demography|demographic]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the [[baby boomer]]s and preceding the [[millennials]]. Researchers and popular media typically use birth years around 1965 to 1980 to define Generation Xers, although some sources use birth years beginning as early as 1960 and ending somewhere from 1977 to 1985.<!-- This date range is based on the sources given in the text below; please seek talk page consensus before changing --> By this definition and [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data, there are 65.2 million Gen Xers<ref>{{cite web |title=Gen Xer |url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/gen_xer |website=Lexico |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> in the [[United States]] as of 2019.<ref name="2020Overtake">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/|title=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|last=Fry|first=Richard|date=April 28, 2020|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=April 28, 2020}}</ref> Most members of Generation X are the children of the [[Silent Generation]] and early boomers;<ref name="Strauss 2000 54">{{cite book|title=Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation|year=2000|publisher=Vintage Original|location=New York|isbn=978-0375707193|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To_Eu9HCNqIC |first1=William|last1=Strauss|first2=Neil|last2=Howe|others=Cartoons by R.J.

As children in the 1970s and 1980s, a time of shifting societal values, Gen Xers were sometimes called the "[[latchkey kid|latchkey]] generation", due to reduced adult supervision compared to previous generations. This was a result of increasing [[divorce]] rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home. As adolescents and young adults in the 1980s and 1990s, Xers were dubbed the "[[MTV Generation]]" (a reference to the [[MTV|music video channel]]), sometimes being characterized as [[slacker]]s, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], and disaffected. Some of the cultural influences on Gen X youth were the musical genres of [[grunge]] and [[hip hop music]], and [[independent film]]s. In midlife, research describes them as active, happy, and achieving a [[work–life balance]]. The cohort has been credited with [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] tendencies, and was the last generation in the United States for whom [[Issues in higher education in the United States#Financial value of degrees|post-secondary education was broadly financially remunerative]].
==Terminology and etymology==
[[File:Douglas Coupland Photo of Author.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Douglas Coupland]] popularized the term ''Generation X'' in his 1991 novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]''.]]
The term ''Generation X'' has been used at various times to describe alienated youth. In the early 1950s, Hungarian photographer [[Robert Capa]] first used ''Generation X'' as the title for a photo-essay about young men and women growing up immediately following [[World War II]]. The term first appeared in print in a December 1952 issue of ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'' magazine announcing their upcoming publication of Capa's photo-essay.<ref name=Ulrich>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v10ZUR_Ca3EC&pg=PA32|page= 5 |title= GenXegesis: Essays on Alternative Youth (Sub)culture |isbn= 9780879728625 |last1= Ulrich |first1= John Mcallister |last2= Harris |first2= Andrea L. |year= 2003 }}</ref> From 1976 to 1981, English musician [[Billy Idol]] used the moniker as the name for his [[Generation X (band)|punk rock band]].<ref name="Adweek"/> Idol had attributed the name of his band to the book ''[[Generation X (1965 book)|Generation X]]'', a 1965 book on British popular youth culture written by journalists Jane Deverson and Charles Hamblett<ref name="Gen X">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26339959|title=The original Generation X|date=1 March 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>'Punk Rock - An Oral History', by John Robb.

<blockquote>"The book's title came not from Billy Idol's band, as many supposed, but from the final chapter of a funny sociological book on American class structure titled ''[[Class: A Guide Through the American Status System|Class]]'', by [[Paul Fussell]]. In his final chapter, Fussell named an 'X' category of people who wanted to hop off the merry-go-round of status, money, and social climbing that so often frames modern existence."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Coupland |first1=Douglas |title=Generation X'd |url=http://coupland.tripod.com/details1.html |accessdate=24 March 2019 |work=Details Magazine |date=June 1995}}</ref><ref name=Genesis /></blockquote>

Author [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Strauss]] noted that around the time Coupland's 1991 novel was published the symbol "X" was prominent in popular culture, as the film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' was released in 1992, and that the name "Generation X" ended up sticking.

===Declining Western fertility rates===
[[File:Western Fertility Rates 1959-1983.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Western fertility rates, 1959–1983]]
Generation X is the demographic cohort following the [[post–World War II baby boom|post–World War II baby-boom]], representing a generational change from the [[baby boomers]]. Many researchers and demographers use dates which correspond to the fertility-patterns in the population. For Generation X, in the U.S. (and broadly, in the [[Western world]]), the period begins at a time when [[Total fertility rate|fertility rates]] started to <u>significantly</u> decrease, following the baby boom peak of the late 1950s, until an upswing in the late 1970s and eventual recovery at the start of the 1980s.

In the U.S., the [[Pew Research Center]], a non-partisan think-tank, delineates a Generation X period of 1965–1980 which has, albeit gradually, come to gain acceptance in academic circles.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schweikert (ed)|first=Christina|title=Changing Business Environment: Gamechangers, opportunities and Risks|publisher=Global Business Technology Association|year=2017|isbn=978-1-932917-13-0|location=New York|pages=48}}</ref>  Moreover, although fertility rates are preponderant in the definition of start and end dates, the center remarks: "Generations are analytical constructs, it takes time for popular and expert consensus to develop as to the precise boundaries that demarcate one generation from another."<ref>{{cite news|title=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Pew Research|date=25 April 2016}}</ref> Pew takes into account other factors, notably the labor market as well as attitudinal and behavioral trends of a group. Writing for [[The Pew Charitable Trusts|Pew]]'s ''Trend'' magazine in 2018, psychologist [[Jean Twenge]] observed that the "birth year boundaries of Gen X are debated but settle somewhere around 1965–1980".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean |title=How Are Generations Named? |url=https://trend.pewtrusts.org/en/archive/winter-2018/foreword-how-are-generations-named |website=Trend |publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=30 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830135027/http://trend.pewtrusts.org/en/archive/winter-2018/foreword-how-are-generations-named |archive-date=30 August 2018 |date=26 January 2018}}</ref> According to this definition, the oldest Gen Xer is 55 years old and the youngest is, or is turning, 40 years old in 2020.

===Other age range markers===
====Generational span====
On the basis of the time it takes for a generation to mature, U.S. authors [[William Strauss and Neil Howe]] define Generation X as those born between 1961 and 1981 in their 1991 book titled ''Generations''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bevan-Dye|first1=Ayesha L.|date=2017|title=Addressing the Ambiguity Surrounding Contemporary Generational Measurement Parameters|url=http://gbata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ReadingsBook-GBATA-2017-Final.pdf|journal=Changing Business Environment: Gamechangers, Opportunities and Risks|publisher=Global Business and Technology Association|pages=47–53}}</ref> [[Jeff Gordinier]], in his 2008 book ''X Saves the World'', also has a wider definition to include those born between 1961 and 1977 but possibly as late as 1980.<ref name="Gordinier">{{cite book|last1=Gordinier|first1=Jeff|url=https://archive.org/details/xsavesworldhowg00gord|title=X Saves the World: How Generation X Got the Shaft but Can Still Keep Everything from Sucking|date=27 March 2008|publisher=Viking Adult|isbn=978-0670018581}}</ref> George Masnick of the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies]] puts this generation in the time-frame of 1965 to 1984, in order to satisfy the premise that boomers, Xers, and [[millennials]] "cover equal 20-year age spans".<ref name="Masnick">{{cite web|url=https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/defining-the-generations-redux/|title=Defining the Generations|last=Masnick|first=George|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> In 2004, journalist J.

====External historical events====
Based on external events of historical importance, Schewe and Noble in 2002 argue that a cohort is formed against significant milestones and can be any length of time.

There are differences in Gen X population numbers depending on the date-range selected. In the U.S., using [[United States Census|Census]] population projections, the Pew Research Center found that the Gen X population born from 1965 to 1980 numbered 65.2&nbsp;million in 2019. The cohort is likely to overtake boomers in 2028.<ref name="2020Overtake"/> A 2010 Census report counted approximately 84&nbsp;million people living in the US who are defined by birth years ranging from the early 1960s to the early 1980s.<ref name="U.S. Census">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Age and Sex Composition: 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census|accessdate=2013-09-12|page=4|date=11 May 2011}}</ref>  In a 2012 article for the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies]] of [[Harvard University]], George Masnick wrote that the "Census counted 82.1&nbsp;million" Gen Xers in the U.S. Masnick concluded that immigration filled in any birth year deficits during low fertility years of the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name="Masnick" /> Jon Miller at the Longitudinal Study of American Youth at the [[University of Michigan]] wrote that "Generation X refers to adults born between 1961 and 1981" and it "includes 84 million people".<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Jon|title=The Generation X Report: Active, Balanced, and Happy: These Young Americans are not Bowling Alone|url=http://lsay.org/GenX_Rept_Iss1.pdf|publisher=Longitudinal Study of American Youth – University of Michigan|accessdate=29 May 2013|page=1|date=Fall 2011}}</ref> In their 1991 book ''Generations'', authors Howe and Strauss indicated that the total number of Gen X individuals in the U.S. was 88.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book|last=William Strauss|first=Neil Howe|title=Generations|year=1991|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-688-11912-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/generationshisto00stra_0/page/318 318]|url=https://archive.org/details/generationshisto00stra_0/page/318}}</ref>

The [[birth control pill]], introduced in 1960 by the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], was one contributing factor of declining birth rates. Initially, the pill spread rapidly amongst married women as an approved treatment for menstrual disturbance. However, it was also found to prevent pregnancy and was prescribed as a contraceptive in 1964. The pill, as it became commonly known, reached younger, unmarried college women in the late 1960s when state laws were amended and reduced the age of majority from 21 to ages 18–20.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Golding and Katz|first=Claudia & Lawrence|date=August 2002|title=The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women's Career and Marriage Decisions|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=110|issue=4|pages=730–770|doi=10.1086/340778|jstor=10.1086/340778|s2cid=221286686|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:2624453}}</ref> These policies are commonly referred to as the Early Legal Access (ELA) laws.

Another major factor was [[abortion]], only available in a few states until its legalization in a 1973 US Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]].'' This was replicated elsewhere, with [[Timeline of reproductive rights legislation|reproductive rights legislation]] passed, notably in the UK (1967), France (1975), West Germany (1976), New Zealand (1977), Italy (1978), and the Netherlands (1980). From 1973 to 1980, the abortion rate per 1,000 US women aged 15–44 increased exponentially from 16% to 29% with more than 9.6&nbsp;million terminations of pregnancy practiced. Between 1970 and 1980, on average, for every 10 American citizens born, 3 were aborted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stanley K|first=Henshaw|date=2008|title=Trends in the characteristics of women obtaining abortions, 1974 to 2004|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/report/trends-characteristics-women-obtaining-abortions-1974-2004-supplemental-tables|journal=Alan Guttmacher Institute}}</ref> However, increased immigration during the same period of time helped to partially offset declining birth-rates and contributed to making Generation X an ethnically and culturally diverse demographic cohort.<ref name="Adweek">{{cite magazine|last1=Klara|first1=Robert|title=5 Reasons Marketers Have Largely Overlooked Generation X|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/5-reasons-marketers-have-largely-overlooked-generation-x-170539|accessdate=19 June 2016|magazine=Adweek|date=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref name="Cohort confusion" />

Strauss and Howe, who wrote several books on generations, including one specifically on Generation X titled ''13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?''

The Gen X childhood coincided with the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s to 1980s, which Susan Gregory Thomas described in her book ''In Spite of Everything'' as confusing and frightening for children in cases where a parent would bring new sexual partners into their home.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=All Apologies: Thank You for the 'Sorry'|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-gregory-thomas/all-apologies-thank-you-f_b_931718.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=22 October 2011}}</ref> Thomas also discussed how divorce was different during the Gen X childhood, with the child having a limited or severed relationship with one parent following divorce, often the father, due to differing societal and legal expectations. In the 1970s, only nine U.S. states allowed for [[joint custody]] of children, which has since been adopted by all 50 states following a push for joint custody during the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=In Spite of Everything|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1400068821|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/inspiteofeveryth0000thom}}</ref> ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', a 1979 American legal drama based on [[Avery Corman]]'s best-selling novel, came to epitomize the struggle for child custody and the demise of the traditional nuclear family.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanson|first=Peter|title=The Cinema of Generation X: A Critical Study of Films and Directors|url=https://archive.org/details/cinemaofgenerati00hans|url-access=registration|publisher=McFarland & Co|year=2002|isbn=9780786413348|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cinemaofgenerati00hans/page/45 45]}}</ref>

The rapid influx of boomer women into the labor force that began in the 1970s was marked by the confidence of many in their ability to successfully pursue a career while meeting the needs of their children.

====Conservative and neoliberal turn====
Some older Gen Xers started high school in the waning years of the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] presidency, but much of the cohort became socially and politically conscious during the [[Reagan Era]].

Government expenditure shifted from domestic programs to defense. Remaining funding initiatives, moreover, tended to be diverted away from programs for children and often directed toward the elderly population, with cuts to [[Medicaid]] and programs for children and young families, and protection and expansion of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] for the elderly population. These programs for the elderly were not tied to economic need. Congressman [[David Durenberger]] criticized this political situation, stating that while programs for poor children and for young families were cut, the government provided "free health care to elderly millionaires".<ref name="Strauss" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Holtz|first1=Geoffrey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ay28CTKlgsC|title=Welcome to the Jungle: The Why Behind Generation X|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=1995|isbn=978-0312132101|pages=49–50|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>

====The crack epidemic and AIDS====
Gen Xers came of age or were children during the 1980s [[crack epidemic]], which disproportionately impacted urban areas as well as the [[African-American]] community in the U.S. Drug turf battles increased violent crime, and [[Crack cocaine|crack addiction]] impacted communities and families. Between 1984 and 1989, the homicide rate for black males aged 14 to 17 doubled in the U.S., and the homicide rate for black males aged 18 to 24 increased almost as much. The crack epidemic had a destabilizing impact on families with an increase in the number of children in [[foster care]]. In 1986, President Reagan signed the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] to enforce strict [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentencing]] for drug users and increased the federal budget for supply-reduction efforts.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fryer|first1=Roland|date=April 2006|title=Measuring Crack Cocaine and Its Impact|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/fhlm_crack_cocaine_0.pdf|journal=Harvard University Society of Fellows|pages=3, 66|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/yuppies-beware-here-comes-generation-x/article_ce19c561-c82d-51b0-a0f9-0f680bc50da9.html|title=Yuppies, Beware: Here Comes Generation X|date=9 July 1991|newspaper=Tulsa World|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>

Fear of the impending [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s loomed over the formative years of Generation X. The emergence of AIDS coincided with Gen X's adolescence, with the disease first clinically observed in the U.S. in 1981. By 1985, an estimated one-to-two million Americans were HIV-positive.

Gen Xers were the first children to have access to [[personal computers]] in their homes and at schools.<ref name="GenMap" /> Those born in the early cohort will have experienced the first analog machines whilst, at the late-end, will have been pioneers, at the forefront of the Internet revolution. In the early 1980s, the growth in the use of personal computers exploded with manufacturers such as [[Commodore International|Commodore]], [[Atari]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] responding to the demand via 8- and 16-bit machines.

====The post-civil rights generation====
In the U.S., Generation X was the first cohort to grow up post-integration after [[Jim Crow|the racist Jim Crow]] laws. They were described in a marketing report by ''Specialty Retail'' as the kids who "lived the [[civil rights movement]]". They were among the first children to be [[Desegregation busing|bused]] to attain [[Racial integration|integration]] in the public school system.

====Generation X internationally====
Although, globally, children and adolescents of Generation X will have been heavily influenced by U.S. cultural industries with shared global currents (e.g. rising divorce rates, the AIDS epidemic, advancements in [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]), there is not one U.S.-born raised concept but multiple perspectives and geographical outgrowths. Even within the period of analysis, inside national communities, commonalities will have differed on the basis of one's birth date. The generation, Christine Henseler also remarks, was shaped as much by real-world events, within national borders, determined by specific political, cultural, and historical incidents. She adds "In other words, it is in between both real, clearly bordered spaces and more fluid global currents that we can spot the spirit of Generation X."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henseler|first=Christine|title=Generation X Goes Global: Mapping a Youth Culture in Motion|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415699440|pages=15}}</ref>

In [[Russia]], for example, Generation Xers are referred to as "the last Soviet children", as the last children to come of age prior to the downfall of [[communism]] in their nation and prior to the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="McCrindle" /> Those that reached adulthood in the 1980s and grew up educated in the doctrines of Marxism and Leninism found themselves against a background of economic and social change with the advent of [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Mikhail Gorbatchev]] to power and [[Perestroika]]. However, even before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disbanding of the Communist Party, surveys demonstrated that Russian young people repudiated the key features of the Communist worldview that their party leaders, schoolteachers, and even parents had tried to instill in them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beam-inc.org/russias-generation-x-who-are-they/|title=Russia's "Generation X": Who Are They?|last=Bernbaum|first=John A|date=9 July 1996|website=beam-inc.org}}</ref> This generation, caught in the transition between Marxism–Leninism and an unknown future, and wooed by the new domestic political classes, remained largely apathetic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|date=6 June 1996|title=To Win Russia's 'Generation X', Yeltsin Is Pumping Up the Volume|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/06/world/to-win-russia-s-generation-x-yeltsin-is-pumping-up-the-volume.html|journal=The New York Times}}</ref>

In France, "Generation X" is not as widely known or used to define its members. Demographically, those born early during that period were sometimes referred to as 'Génération Bof' because of their tendency to use the word 'bof', which, translated into English, means 'whatever".<ref name="McCrindle" /> More closely associated is "Génération Mitterrand", pertaining to socialist [[François Mitterrand]] who served as President of France during two consecutive terms between 1981 and 1995. There is general agreement that, domestically, the event that is accepted in France as the separating point between baby boomer generation and Generation X are the [[May 68|French strikes and violent riots of May 1968]]. For those at the tail-end of the generation, educational and defense reforms, a new style ''baccalauréat général'' with three distinct streams in 1995 (the preceding programme, introduced in 1968) and the cessation of military conscription in 1997 (for those born after January 1979) are considered as new transition points to the next.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henseler|first=Christine|title=Generation X Goes Global: Mapping a Youth Culture in Motion|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415699440|location=London|pages=188}}</ref>

The United Kingdom's [[Economic and Social Research Council]] described Generation X as "Thatcher's children" because the cohort grew up while [[Margaret Thatcher]] was Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, "a time of social flux and transformation". Those born in the late 1960s and early 1970s grew up in a period of social unrest.  While unemployment was low in the early 1970s, industrial and social unrest escalated. Strike action culminated in the 'winter of discontent' in 1978–79, and the Troubles began to unfold in Northern Ireland. The turn to neoliberal policies introduced and maintained by consecutive conservative governments from 1979 to 1997 marked the end of the post-war consensus.  Educationally, the vast majority of the cohort attended [[secondary modern school]]s, relabelled [[comprehensive school]]s with compulsory education ending at the age of 16. The [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] and the liberalisation of higher education in the UK saw greater numbers gaining places, especially those born at the tail-end of the generation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-events-and-publications/news/news-items/thatcher-s-children-the-lives-of-generation-x/|title=Thatcher's children: the lives of Generation X|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher=Economic and Social Research Council}}</ref>

In Germany, "Generation X" is not widely used or applied. Instead, reference is made to "Generation Golf" in the previous West German republic, based on a novel by [[Florian Illies]] whilst, in the east, children of the "Mauerfall" or coming down of the wall. For former east Germans, there was adaptation but also a sense of loss of accustomed values and structures, sometimes turning into romantic narratives of their childhood. For those in the West, a period of discovery and exploration of what had been a forbidden land.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henseler|first=Christine|title=Generation X Goes Global: Mapping a Youth Culture in Motion|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415699440|pages=148}}</ref>

====Continued growth in college enrollments====
[[File:Total Fall Enrollment in US degree granting Institutions 1965-1998.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Total Fall Enrollment in US degree granting Institutions 1965–1998]]
In the U.S., compared to the boomer generation, Generation X was more educated than their parents with the share of young adults enrolling in college steadily increasing from 1983 before peaking in 1998. In 1965, as early boomers entered college, total enrollment of new undergraduates was just over 5.7&nbsp;million individuals across the public and private sectors. By 1983, the first year of Gen X college enrollments (as per Pew Research's definition), this figure had reached 12.2&nbsp;million, an increase of 53%, effectively a doubling in student intake. As the 1990s progressed, Gen X college enrollments continued to climb with increased loan borrowing as the cost of an education became substantially more expensive compared to their peers in the mid-1980s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=US Congress, Senate Committee on Finance Staff|title=Education Tax Proposals: Hearing Before the Committee on Finance|publisher=US Government Printing Office, 1999|year=1999|isbn=9780160581939|pages=99}}</ref> By 1998, the generation's last year of college enrollment, those entering the higher education sector totaled 14.3&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d00/dt174.asp|title=Total fall enrollment in degree-granting institutions, by control and type of institution: 1965 to 1998|date=July 2000|website=National Center for Education Statistics}}</ref> In addition, unlike Boomers and previous generations, women outpaced men in college completion rates.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bialik|first=Kristen|url=https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations/|title=Millennial life: How young adulthood today compares with prior generation|date=14 February 2019|work=Pew Research Center}}</ref>

====Adjusting to a new societal environment====
For early Gen Xer graduates entering the job market at the end of the 1980s, economic conditions were challenging and did not show signs of major improvements until the mid-1990s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ericksson|first=Tamara|title=What's Next, Gen X?: Keeping Up, Moving Ahead, and Getting the Career You Want|publisher=Harvard Business Review Press|year=2009|isbn=9781422120644}}</ref> In the U.S., restrictive monetary policy to curb rising inflation and the collapse of a large number of savings and loan associations (private banks that specialized in home mortgages) impacted the welfare of many American households and precipitated a large government bailout that placed further strain on the budget.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Carl E|date=1993|title=What caused the 1990-91 Recession?|journal=Economic Review: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|pages=33}}</ref> Furthermore, three decades of growth came to an end and the social contract between employers and employees, which had endured during the 1960s and 1970s and scheduled to last until retirement was no longer applicable with, by the late 1980s, large-scale layoffs of boomers, corporate downsizing, and accelerated offshoring of production.<ref>{{Cite book|last=.

On the political front, in the U.S. the generation became ambivalent if not outright disaffected with politics; they had been reared in the shadow of the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Watergate scandal]], and came to maturity under the Reagan and Bush presidencies, with first-hand experience of the impact of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies. Few had experienced a Democratic administration and even then, only, at an atmospheric level. For those on the left of the political spectrum, the disappointments with the previous boomer student mobilizations of the 1960s and the collapse of those movements towards a consumerist "greed is good" and "[[yuppie]]" culture during the 1980s felt, to a greater extent, hypocrisy if not outright betrayal.  Hence, the preoccupation on "authenticity" and not "selling-out".  The end of communism and the socialist utopia with the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], moreover, added to the disillusionment that any alternative to the [[capitalist model]] was possible.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Erickson|first=Tamara|title=What's Next, Gen X?: Keeping Up, Moving Ahead, and Getting the Career You Want|publisher=Harvard Business Press|year=2010|isbn=9781422156155}}</ref>

In 1990, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published an article titled "Living: Proceeding with Caution", which described those then in their 20s as aimless and unfocused. Media pundits and advertisers further struggled to define the cohort, typically portraying them as "unfocused [[Twentysomething (term)|twentysomething]]s". A [[MetLife]] report noted: "media would portray them as the ''[[Friends]]'' generation: rather self-involved and perhaps aimless...but fun".<ref name="MetLife">{{cite news|title=The MetLife Study of Gen X: The MTV Generation Moves into Mid-Life|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2013/mmi-gen-x.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=MetLife|date=April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021014452/https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2013/mmi-gen-x.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Time1">{{cite magazine|last1=Gross|first1=David|title=Living: Proceeding With Caution|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,970634-1,00.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|magazine=Time|date=16 July 1990}}</ref> Gen Xers were often portrayed as [[Apathy|apathetic]] or as "[[slackers]]", lacking bearings, a stereotype which was initially tied to [[Richard Linklater]]'s comedic and essentially plotless 1991 film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. After the film was released, "journalists and critics thought they put a finger on what was different about these young adults in that 'they were reluctant to grow up' and 'disdainful of earnest action'".<ref name="Time1" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=ScrIibner|first1=Sara|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/11/generation_x_gets_really_old_how_do_slackers_have_a_midlife_crisis/|title=Generation X gets really old: How do slackers have a midlife crisis?|date=11 August 2013|work=Salon|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> [[Ben Stiller]]'s 1994 film ''[[Reality Bites]]'' also sought to capture the [[zeitgeist]] of the generation with a portrayal of the attitudes and lifestyle choices of the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/reality-bites-captured-gen-x-25-years-later-helen-childress/583870/|title=Reality Bites Captured Gen X With Perfect Irony|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|date=March 2019|website=The Atlantic}}</ref>

Negative stereotypes of Gen X young adults continued, including that they were "bleak, cynical, and disaffected". In 1998, such stereotypes prompted sociological research at [[Stanford University]] to study the accuracy of the characterization of Gen X young adults as cynical and disaffected. Using the national [[General Social Survey]], the researchers compared answers to identical survey questions asked of 18–29-year-olds in three different time periods. Additionally, they compared how older adults answered the same survey questions over time. The surveys showed 18–29-year-old Gen Xers did exhibit higher levels of cynicism and disaffection than previous cohorts of 18–29-year-olds surveyed. However, they also found that cynicism and disaffection had increased among all age groups surveyed over time, not just young adults, making this a period effect, not a [[cohort effect]]. In other words, adults of all ages were more cynical and disaffected in the 1990s, not just Generation X.<ref>{{cite news|title=Generation X not so special: Malaise, cynicism on the rise for all age groups|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/98/980821genx.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Stanford University}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Oldsters Get The Gen X Feeling|url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19980729080415data_trunc_sys.shtml|accessdate=11 July 2016|publisher=SCI GOGO|date=29 August 1998}}</ref>

In 1997, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published an article titled "Generation X Reconsidered", which retracted the previously-reported negative stereotypes and reported positive accomplishments, citing Gen Xers' tendency to found technology start-ups and small businesses as well as their ambition, which research showed was higher among Gen X young adults than older generations.<ref name="Time1"/> Yet, the slacker moniker stuck.<ref name="Jury Expert">{{cite news|last1=Keene|first1=Douglas|title=Generation X members are "active, balanced and happy".

The Longitudinal Study of Youth is an [[NIH]]-[[National Institute on Aging|NIA]] funded study by the University of Michigan which has been studying Generation X since 1987. The study asked questions such as "Thinking about all aspects of your life, how happy are you? If zero means that you are very unhappy and 10 means that you are very happy, please rate your happiness." LSA reported that "[[mean]] level of happiness was 7.5 and the [[median]] (middle score) was 8.

Individualism is one of the defining traits of Generation X, and reflected in their entrepreneurial spirit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sirias|first=Danilo|date=September 2007|title=Comparing the levels of individualism/collectivism between baby boomers and generation X: Implications for teamwork|url=https://www.emerald.com/|journal=Management Research News|doi=10.1108/01409170710823467}}</ref> In the 2008 book ''X Saves the World: How Generation X Got the Shaft but Can Still Keep Everything from Sucking'', author [[Jeff Gordinier]] describes Generation X as a "[[dark horse]] demographic" which "doesn't seek the limelight". Gordiner cites examples of Gen Xers' contributions to society such as: [[Google]], [[Wikipedia]], [[Amazon.com]], and [[YouTube]], arguing that if boomers had created them, "we'd never hear the end of it". In the book, Gordinier contrasts Gen Xers to baby boomers, saying boomers tend to trumpet their accomplishments more than Gen Xers do, creating what he describes as "elaborate mythologies" around their achievements. Gordiner cites [[Steve Jobs]] as an example, while Gen Xers, he argues, are more likely to "just quietly do their thing".<ref name="Gordinier" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Stephey|first1=M.J.|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1731528,00.html|title=Gen-X: The Ignored Generation?|date=16 April 2008|work=Time|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>

In a 2007 article published in the [[Harvard Business Review]], authors Strauss and Howe wrote of Generation X: "They are already the greatest entrepreneurial generation in U.S. history; their high-tech savvy and marketplace resilience have helped America prosper in the era of globalization."<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=The next 20 years: How customer and workforce attitudes will evolve|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6196698|accessdate=19 June 2016|magazine=Harvard Business Review|date=June 2007}}</ref> According to authors Michael Hais and Morley Winograd:
<blockquote>Small businesses and the entrepreneurial spirit that Gen Xers embody have become one of the most popular institutions in America. There's been a recent shift in consumer behavior and Gen Xers will join the "idealist generation" in encouraging the celebration of individual effort and business risk-taking. As a result, Xers will spark a renaissance of [[entrepreneurship]] in economic life, even as overall confidence in economic institutions declines. Customers, and their needs and wants (including Millennials) will become the North Star for an entire new generation of entrepreneurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beinkandescent.com/articles/942/GenX|title=Why Generation X is Sparking a Renaissance in Entrepreneurship|last1=Winograd|first1=Morley|last2=Hais|first2=Michael|year=2012|accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref></blockquote>

A 2015 study by [[Sage Group]] reports Gen Xers "dominate the playing field" with respect to founding [[Startup company|startups]] in the United States and Canada, with Xers launching the majority (55%) of all new businesses in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sage.com/na/~/media/site/sagena/responsive/docs/startup/report|title=2015 State of the Startup|date=2015|accessdate=6 August 2016|publisher=sage}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Iudica|first1=David|url=https://advertising.yahoo.com/insights/overlooked-influence-gen-x|title=The overlooked influence of Gen X|date=12 September 2016|accessdate=2 October 2016|publisher=Yahoo Advertising}}</ref> In addition, in the UK, a 2016 study of over 2,500 office workers conducted by [[Workfront]] found that survey respondents of all ages selected those from Generation X as the hardest-working employees in today's workforce (chosen by 60%).<ref>https://www.workfront.com/sites/default/files/2019-04/uk-state-of-work-report-nonmarketing.pdf</ref> Gen X was also ranked highest among fellow workers for having the strongest work ethic (chosen by 59.5%), being the most helpful (55.4%), the most skilled (54.5%), and the best troubleshooters/problem-solvers (41.6%).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Leeming|first1=Robert|url=http://www.hrreview.co.uk/hr-news/strategy-news/generation-x-ers-are-found-to-be-the-best-workers-in-the-uk/61386|title=Generation X-ers found to be the best workers in the UK|date=19 February 2016|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=HR Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Frith|first1=Bek|url=http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/article-details/are-generation-x-the-uks-hardest-workers|title=Are generation X the UK's hardest workers?|date=23 February 2016|magazine=HR Magazine|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>

====Benefits of a college education====
Unlike [[millennials]], Generation X was the last generation in the U.S. for whom [[Issues in higher education in the United States#Financial value of degrees|higher education was broadly financially remunerative]]. In 2019, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] published research (using data from the 2016 ''[[Survey of Consumer Finances]]'') demonstrating that after controlling for race and age, cohort families with heads of household with post-secondary education and born before 1980 have seen wealth and income premiums, while, for those after 1980, the wealth premium has weakened to a point of [[statistical insignificance]] (in part because of the [[Cost and financing issues facing higher education in the United States|rising cost of college]]). The income premium, while remaining positive, has declined to historic lows, with more pronounced downward trajectories among heads of household with [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate degrees]].<ref name="Emmons Kent & Ricketts 2019">{{cite journal|last1=Emmons|first1=William R.|last2=Kent|first2=Ana H.|last3=Ricketts|first3=Lowell R.|year=2019|title=Is College Still Worth It?

====Parenting and volunteering====
In terms of advocating for their children in the educational setting, author Neil Howe describes Gen X parents as distinct from baby boomer parents. Howe argues that Gen Xers are not [[helicopter parents]], which Howe describes as a parenting style of boomer parents of millennials. Howe described Gen Xers instead as "stealth fighter parents", due to the tendency of Gen X parents to let minor issues go and to not hover over their children in the educational setting, but to intervene forcefully and swiftly in the event of more serious issues.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Meet Mr. and Mrs. Gen X: A New Parent Generation|url=http://www.aasa.org/SchoolAdministratorArticle.aspx?id=11122|accessdate=19 April 2016|publisher=AASA – The School Superintendents Association}}</ref> In 2012, the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]] ranked Gen X volunteer rates in the U.S. at "29.4% per year", the highest compared with other generations. The rankings were based on a three-year moving average between 2009 and 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Volunteering and Civic Life in America: Generation X Volunteer Rates|url=http://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/rankings/States/Generation-X-Volunteer-Rates/2011|publisher=Corporation for National and Community Service|accessdate=31 January 2013|date=27 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116084906/http://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/rankings/States/Generation-X-Volunteer-Rates/2011|archive-date=16 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Volunteering in the United States|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/volun.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics – U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=2013-04-20|page=1|date=22 February 2013}}</ref>

====Income differential with previous generations====
A report titled ''Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well?'' focused on the income of males 30–39 in 2004 (those born April 1964{{spaced ndash}}March 1974). The study was released on 25 May 2007 and emphasized that this generation's men made less (by 12%) than their fathers had at the same age in 1974, thus reversing a historical trend. It concluded that, per year increases in household income generated by fathers/sons slowed from an average of 0.9% to 0.3%, barely keeping pace with inflation. "Family incomes have risen though (over the period 1947 to 2005) because more women have gone to work",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300002|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women|date=1950–2018|website=FRED: Economic Data|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis}}</ref><ref name="Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis">{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Men|date=January 1948|website=FRED: Economic Data|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis|ref=1950 to 2018}}</ref><ref name="Isabel Sawhill, Ph.D 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/sawhill/200705.pdf|title=Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well?|author=Isabel Sawhill, PhD|last2=Morton|first2=John E.|year=2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529155632/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/sawhill/200705.pdf|archive-date=29 May 2013|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="Making less than dad did">{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=David|url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/05/25/pf/mobility_study/index.htm?cnn=yes|title=Making less than dad did|date=25 May 2007|work=CNN|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref> "supporting the incomes of men, by adding a second earner to the family.

====Punk rock====
{{main|Punk rock}}
[[File:Offspringlive.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[The Offspring]] performing in 2008 in Fortaleza, Brazil]]
From 1974 to 1976, a new generation of rock bands arose such as the [[Ramones]], [[Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers]], [[The Dictators]] in [[New York City]], the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]], and [[Buzzcocks]] in the [[UK]], and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in [[Brisbane]]. By late 1976, these acts were generally recognized as forming the vanguard of "punk rock", and as 1977 approached, punk rock became a major and highly controversial cultural phenomenon in the UK.<ref>Punk, AllMusic - https://www.allmusic.com/style/punk-ma0000002806 "in both the U.K. and the U.S. In America, punk remained an underground sensation, eventually spawning the hardcore and indie-rock scenes of the '80s, but in the UK, it was a full-scale phenomenon. In the U.K., the Sex Pistols were thought of as a serious threat to the well-being of the government and monarchy, but more importantly, they caused countless bands to form."</ref> It spawned a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, as well as bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]] that have since been associated with the form.<ref>Roderick,John; Punk Rock Is Bullshit: How a Toxic Social Movement Poisoned Our Culture, Seattle Weekly; Wednesday, 27 February 2013 5:54pm; http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/for-those-of-us-who-grew-up-in-the-shadow-of-the/ "For those of us who grew up in the shadow of the baby boom, force-fed the misremembered vainglory of Woodstock long after most hippies had become coked-out, craven yuppies on their way to becoming paranoid neo-cons, punk rock provided a corrective dose of hard truth. Punk was ugly and ugly was true, no matter how many new choruses the boomers added to their song of self-praise. It was this perceived honesty that we, the nascent Generation X, feared and worshipped. But over time punk swelled into a Stalinistic doctrine of self-denial that stunted us. The yuppies kept sucking, but by clinging to punk we started to suck too."</ref> By 1977 the influence of punk rock music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading throughout various countries worldwide.<ref>The History and Evolution of Punk Rock Music, Updated 10 April 2018, ThoughtCo https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-punk-rock-2803345 "By the late '70s, punk had finished its beginning and had emerged as a solid musical force. With its rise in popularity, punk began to split into numerous sub-genres. New musicians embraced the DIY movement and began to create their own individual scenes with specific sounds."</ref> It generally took root in local scenes that tended to reject affiliation with the [[mainstream]].<ref>Handbook of Texas Online, John H.

Published by the Texas State Historical Association.</ref> In the late 1970s punk experienced its second wave in which acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style.

While at first punk musicians were not Gen Xers themselves (many of them were late boomers, or [[Generation Jones]]),<ref name="Danton">DANTON, ERIC R.; THE CONFLICTED MUSICAL LEGACY OF GENERATION X, Hartford Courant, 6 November 2005; https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2005-11-06-0511040334-story.html "Punk was the first musical reaction to the classic-rock ethos of the Woodstock generation. The original punk rockers were late-period boomers eager to distance themselves from the supercilious upper end of their demographic, and their music, reflecting the dour economics of the late '70s, became a template for Generation X and the ensuing "post-punk" movement that eventually birthed grunge."</ref> the fanbase for punk became increasingly Gen X-oriented as the earliest Xers entered their adolescence, and it therefore made a significant imprint on the cohort.<ref>GUZMAN, RICHARD; Grunge, rap music movements of the early 1990s became Gen X’s soundtrack; | riguzman@scng.com | Press Telegram PUBLISHED: 28 December 2015 at 9:25 pm | UPDATED: 1 September 2017 at 1:04 am; [https://www.presstelegram.com/2015/12/28/grunge-rap-music-movements-of-the-early-1990s-became-gen-xs-soundtrack/] "The Gen X soundtrack was more of a mixtape that ranged from feel-good dance and pop music, to punk, glam rock, new wave, alternative and rap."</ref> By the 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]], [[NOFX]]) and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Subhumans (British band)|Subhumans]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk often later pursued other musical directions, resulting in a broad range of spinoffs, giving rise to genres such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]] and later [[indie pop]], [[alternative rock]], and [[noise rock]]. Gen Xers were no longer simply the consumers of punk but becoming the creators as well.<ref name="Danton"/> By the 1990s punk rock re-emerged into the mainstream, as punk rock and [[pop punk]] bands with Gen X members such as [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[The Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]] brought the genre widespread popularity.<ref>Punk, Encyclopædia Britannica, Jon Savage
LAST UPDATED: 14 November 2018 https://www.britannica.com/art/punk "Punk's full impact came only after the success of Nirvana in 1991, coinciding with the ascendance of Generation X—a new, disaffected generation born in the 1960s, many members of which identified with punk’s charged, often contradictory mix of intelligence, simplicity, anger, and powerlessness."</ref>

In addition to lyrical self-glorification, hip hop was also used as a form of social protest. Lyrical content from the era often drew attention to a variety of social issues including afrocentric living, drug use, crime and violence, religion, culture, the state of the American economy, and the modern man's struggle. [[Conscious hip hop|Conscious]] and [[political hip hop]] tracks of the time were a response to the effects of American capitalism and former President Reagan's conservative political economy. According to Rose Tricia, "In rap, relationships between black cultural practice, social and economic conditions, technology, sexual and racial politics, and the institution policing of the popular terrain are complex and in constant motion". Even though hip hop was used as a mechanism for different social issues it was still very complex with issues within the movement itself.<ref>Rose, Tricia. ''Black Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary American''. Hanover: Wesleyan U, 1994. Print.</ref> There was also often an emphasis on [[black nationalism]]. Hip hop artists often talked about urban poverty and the problems of alcohol, drugs, and gangs in their communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=The social significance of rap & hip-hop culture |url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/mediarace/socialsignificance.htm |accessdate=12 September 2019}}</ref> [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s most influential song, "[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]", came out at this time; the song speaks up to the government, proclaiming that people in the ghetto have freedom of speech and rights like every other American.<ref>{{cite web |title=Public Enemy – Fight the Power Lyrics |publisher=Genius Lyrics |url=https://genius.com/Public-enemy-fight-the-power-lyrics |accessdate=12 September 2019}}</ref>

===Literature===
The literature of early Gen Xers is often dark and introspective. In the U.S., authors such as [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]], [[David Foster Wallace]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], and [[Douglas Coupland]] captured the zeitgeist of this generation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Christine|first=Christine|title=Generation X Rocks: Contemporary Peninsular Fiction, Film, and Rock Culture|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780826515643|pages=21}}</ref> In France, [[Michel Houellebecq]] and [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] rank among major novelists whose work also reflect the dissatisfaction and melancholies of the cohort.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henseler|first=Christine|title=Generation X Goes Global: Mapping a Youth Culture in Motion|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415699440|pages=180}}</ref> In the UK, [[Alex Garland]], author of ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]'' (1996), further added to the genre.

==Health problems==
While previous research has indicated that the likelihood of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] was declining among Americans aged 35 to 74, a 2018 study published in the [[American Heart Association]]'s journal ''[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]'' revealed that this was not the case among younger people. By analyzing data from 28,000 patients from across the United States who were hospitalized for heart attacks between 1995 and 2014, they found that a growing number of such patients were between the ages of 35 to 54. In particular, the number of heart-attack patients in this age group at the end of the study was 32%, up from 27% at the start of the study. This increase is most pronounced among women, for whom the number jumped from 21% to 31%. A common theme among those who suffered from heart attacks is that they also had [[Hypertension|high-blood pressure]], [[diabetes]], and [[chronic kidney disease]]. As before, such trends were found to be more common among women than among men. Experts suggest a number of reasons for this. Conditions such as [[coronary artery disease]] are traditionally viewed as a man's problem, and as such female patients are not considered high-risk individuals. Many women are not only the primary caretakers of their families but also full-time employees, meaning they do not take care of themselves as much as they should.<ref>{{Cite news|last=American Heart Association News|date=November 12, 2018|title=Heart attacks are becoming more common in younger people, especially women|work=Heart.org|url=https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/11/12/heart-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-in-younger-people-especially-women|access-date=June 15, 2020}}</ref>
