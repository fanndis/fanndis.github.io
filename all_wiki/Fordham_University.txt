'''Fordham University''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔr|d|ə|m}}) is a [[Private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[New York City]]. Established in 1841 and named for the [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] neighborhood of the [[The Bronx|Bronx]] in which its original campus is located, Fordham is the oldest [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] university in the northeastern United States,{{Sfn|Kurian|Lamport|2015|p=510}} and the third-oldest university in [[New York (state)|New York State]].{{Sfn|Shelley|2016|p=20}}

Founded as '''St. John's College''' by [[John Hughes (archbishop)|John Hughes]], then a [[coadjutor bishop]] of New York, the college was placed in the care of the [[Society of Jesus]] shortly thereafter, and has since become a [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities|Jesuit-affiliated]] independent school under a [[laity|lay]] board of [[trustee]]s. The college's first president, [[John McCloskey]], was later the first Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archny.org/media/files-bicentennial-celebration/cardinals.swf|title=John Cardinal McCloskey (1864–1885)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613025550/http://www.archny.org/media/files-bicentennial-celebration/cardinals.swf|archive-date=June 13, 2012|url-status=}}</ref> While governed independently of the church since 1969, every [[List of Fordham University presidents|president]] of Fordham University since 1846 has been a Jesuit priest, and the curriculum remains influenced by Jesuit educational principles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.fordham.edu/archives/presidents.html|title=Fordham Presidents|work=Fordham University Libraries|access-date=November 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125032418/http://www.library.fordham.edu/archives/presidents.html|archive-date=January 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Fordham is the only Jesuit [[tertiary education|tertiary institution]] in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajcunet.edu/institutions/|title=Colleges and Universities|website=AJCU|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref>

Fordham was founded as '''St. John's College''' in 1841 by the Irish-born [[coadjutor bishop]] (later [[archbishop]]) of the Diocese of New York, [[John Hughes (archbishop)|John Hughes]].{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=5}} This makes it the third-oldest university in the state of New York,{{Sfn|Shelley|2016|p=20}} and the first Catholic institution of higher education in the northeastern United States.{{Sfn|Kurian|Lamport|2015|p=510}} In 1839, Hughes, then 42 years old, had purchased the 106-acre Rose Hill Manor farm in the village of [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham, New York]] for $29,750.<ref name="Kane">{{Cite web|url=http://fordham.libguides.com/c.php?g=451084&p=4031308|work=Research Guides @ Fordham: The Dodransbicentennial |title= 175 years of Fordham: First 50 Years of Fordham|last=Kane|first=Patrice|access-date=December 1, 2017}}</ref> His intent was to establish St. Joseph's Seminary following the model of [[Mount Saint Mary's University]], of which he was an alumnus.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=377}} "Rose Hill" was the name originally given to the site in 1787 by its owner, Robert Watts, a wealthy New York merchant, in honor of his family's ancestral home in [[Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Allan S.|last2=Wines|first2=Roger|title=Fordham: The Early Years: A Commemoration of the Jesuits' Arrival in 1846: Chapter VI: From Earliest to Latest Fordham: Background History and Ongoing Archaeology|url=https://cms.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/526/the_environmental_history_of_fordham_universitys_rose_hill_campus2_pdf|website=cms.fordham.edu|publisher=Something More Publications|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>

In 1840, St. Joseph's Seminary opened at Rose Hill.<ref name="Kane"/> The seminary was paired with St. John's College, which opened at Rose Hill with a student body of six on June 24, 1841, the feast day of [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]].{{NoteTag|According to Christian tradition, in the Gregorian calendar, June 24 is observed as the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]], and it is mentioned in the 1920 General Catalogue published by the university that the college's opening deliberately coincided with the feast day.<ref name=bul00>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLBIAQAAMAAJ |date=August 1920|title=General Catalogue of Fordham University|volume=XIII|number=5|ref={{SfnRef|General Catalogue|1920}}}} pp. 10–13. {{Open access}}</ref>}} The Reverend [[John McCloskey]] (later archbishop of New York and eventually the first American [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]) was the school's first president, and the [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] were [[Secular clergy|secular priests]] and [[Laity|lay]] instructors.  The college presidency went through a succession of four [[diocesan priest]]s in five years, including the [[James Roosevelt Bayley|Rev. James Roosevelt Bayley]], a distant cousin of [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and a nephew of [[Saint Elizabeth Seton|St. Elizabeth Ann Seton]].{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=10}} In 1845, the seminary church, Our Lady of Mercy, was built.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=24}} The same year, Bishop Hughes convinced several Jesuit priests from the [[St. Mary's College (Kentucky)|St. Mary's College]] in [[Kentucky]] to staff St. John's.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=22}}

The college received its [[charter]] from the [[New York Legislature|New York State Legislature]] in 1846, and the first Jesuits began to arrive about three months later.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=12}} In the same year Bishop Hughes sold St. John's College to the Jesuits for $40,000.<ref name="Kane"/> Hughes deeded the college over but retained title to the seminary property, which totaled about nine acres. In 1847, Fordham's first school in Manhattan opened. The school became the independently chartered [[Xavier High School (New York City)|College of St. Francis Xavier]] in 1861. It was also in 1847 that the American poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]] arrived in the village of Fordham and began a friendship with the college Jesuits that would last throughout his life. In 1849, he published his famed work [[The Bells (poem)|''The Bells'']]. Some traditions credit the college's church bells as the inspiration for this poem.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=24}} Poe also spent considerable time in the college's library, and even occasionally stayed overnight.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|pages=23–24}}

St. John's curriculum consisted of a junior division (i.e. the [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]), requiring four years of study in Latin, Greek, grammar, literature, history, geography, mathematics, and religion; and a senior division (i.e. the college), requiring three years study in "poetry" ([[humanities]]), rhetoric, and philosophy.{{sfn|Schroth|2008|p=30}} Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]], famed commander of the all-[[Black (race)|black]] [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] American Civil War regiment, attended the junior division.  An ''[[Artium Baccalaureus]]'' degree was earned for completion of both curricula, and an additional year of philosophy would earn a ''[[Master of Arts|Magister Artium]]'' degree. There was also a "commercial" track similar to a modern [[business school]], offered as an alternative to the [[Classical education movement|Classical]] curriculum and resulting in a certificate instead of a degree. In 1855, the first student stage production, ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'', was presented by the St. John's Dramatic Society.{{Sfn|Taaffe|2013|p=140}} The seminary was closed in 1859.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=27}}

The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was a significant time for the college; among its alumni were four generals, six colonels (including [[Robert Gould Shaw|Shaw]]), and five captains serving in the [[Union Army]]; twelve men from Fordham also served in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].<ref name="fordham.libguides.com">{{Cite web|url=http://fordham.libguides.com/c.php?g=279634&p=1863178|work=Research Guides @ Fordham|title=American Civil War and Fordham: Home|last=Kane|first=Patrice|access-date=December 1, 2017}}</ref> Three Jesuits from St. John's served as army chaplains.<ref name="fordham.libguides.com"/> [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's assassination]] deeply affected the student body, and even southern students attending the college mourned his loss. As Richard S. Treacy of the class of 1869 later recalled, "The morning we received the news of the death of President Lincoln gloom settled over the entire college, even the southern boys, who before had censored him, now felt that they had lost a valuable friend whose great qualities would be missed in the coming [[Reconstruction Era|reconstruction]]."<ref name="fordham.libguides.com"/>

[[File:Cadets with Lt. Squiers April 1886 Fordham.jpg|thumb|left|Lt. Herbert C. Squires with the Fordham cadet corps, April 1886]]
An [[Act of Congress]] created instruction in military science and tactics at the college level. As a result of the act, St. John's brought a cadet [[corps]] to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th U.S. Cavalry]]—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern [[ROTC]] unit at Fordham.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=97}}{{Sfn|Taaffe|2013|p=123}} The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, [[academic regalia]] for students at [[Graduation|commencement]] was first adopted.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=380}}

===1901–1950: Maturation===

On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York consented to allow the board of trustees to authorize the opening of a law school and a medical school.{{sfn|General Catalogue|1920|p=13}} St. John's College officially became '''Fordham University''' on March 7, 1907.{{Sfn|General Catalogue|1920|p=2}} The name ''Fordham'' refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of the [[Bronx River]] ("[[ford (crossing)|ford]] by the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]"). When Fordham and several other [[Westchester County]] towns were consolidated into [[The Bronx|Bronx County]] at the turn of the twentieth century, the village became the borough's [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] neighborhood. Still in existence today, it is just to the west of the Rose Hill campus.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=xii}}

In 1908, [[Fordham University Press]] was established.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=381}} In 1912, the university opened the College of Pharmacy, which offered a three-year program in [[pharmacy]], not requiring its students to obtain bachelor's degrees until the late 1930s. The college had a mainly Jewish student body, and in recognition of that, the students were exempted from Catholic theology instruction. In September 1912, the Swiss [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] delivered a series of lectures at Fordham; these lectures marked his historic break with the theories of his colleague, [[Sigmund Freud]].{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=126}}
[[File:Woolworth Building at night, New York City.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Woolworth Building 1913, site of City Hall campus]]

The College of St. Francis Xavier was closed in 1913, and various Fordham colleges were opened at the [[Woolworth Building]] in Manhattan to fill the void. Some divisions of the University including the law school were later moved to the City Hall Campus at "the [[Vincent Astor]] Building" at 302 Broadway.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=384}} This commenced an unbroken string of instruction in Manhattan that became what is now Fordham College at Lincoln Center, where all of Fordham's academic operations in Manhattan are centered today.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=111}}[[File:302entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the City Hall Division at the Vincent Astor Building c. 1965]]
[[File:Keating Hall 1936 commencement.jpg|thumb|right|First commencement ceremony before recently completed [[Keating Hall]], June 10, 1936{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=120}}]]
The university closed its medical school in 1919, citing a lack of endowment and reduced university funds overall due to the [[First World War]].{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=140}} The Gabelli School of Business began in 1920 in Manhattan as the School of Accounting.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=141}} According to a university catalogue from 1920, the annual cost for tuition, room and board at the college was $600 ({{Inflation|US|600|1920|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|General Catalogue|1920|p=9}}  In 1944, the School of Professional and Continuing Studies was established, largely bolstered by returning veterans taking advantage of the [[GI Bill]].{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=178}}

The 1940s bore witness to two official presidential visits at Fordham, the first by president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on October 28, 1940, during his campaign for a third term. The president was cheered by crowds lining the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] as he rode to campus, but received a "more measured welcome" from university president Robert Gannon, who was known for his "anti-Roosevelt views."<ref name="Fordham Newsroom">{{Cite news|url=https://news.fordham.edu/inside-fordham-category/fordham-hosts-serving-president-in-fdr/|title=Fordham Hosts Serving President in FDR|date=October 24, 2011|work=Fordham Newsroom|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> However, in his welcoming remarks, Gannon respectfully referred to Roosevelt as "a man whose imprint is forever fixed on our national history."<ref name="Fordham Newsroom"/>

The second visit was by president [[Harry S. Truman]] on May 11, 1946, on the occasion of the centennial of the granting of Fordham's charter. The president received an honorary degree and delivered a nationally broadcast address on the subject of veterans' education, the dangers of atomic warfare, and the importance of education to civilization. His address concluded with the words, "I am confident that this splendid institution, with its educational system rounded upon Christian principles, will play a full and noble part in the great adventure ahead of us. We can and we must make the atomic age an age of peace for the glory of God and the welfare of mankind."<ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu"/> During his visit, Truman also performed the first ringing of the Fordham "victory bell," originally the [[ship's bell]] of the Japanese aircraft carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō|Junyo]],'' which was presented to the university by Fleet Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]]. The bell currently stands outside the Rose Hill Gymnasium and peals after all Ram athletic victories and at the start of Commencement each year.<ref name="bulletin"/>

The football program was first established in 1882 and gained national renown in the early 20th century. Fordham football played on some of the largest stages in sports, including games in front of sellout crowds at the [[Polo Grounds]] and [[Yankee Stadium]], a [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] appearance and a [[Sugar Bowl]] victory.

=== 1951–2000: Clerical independence ===
In the late 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was gathering momentum in the U.S. when Fordham students and school officials expressed ambivalence about racial justice.{{Sfn|Shelley|2016|p=337}} In the late 1960s, Fordham became a center of political activism and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] activity. At the Rose Hill Campus, the Fordham branch of [[Students for a Democratic Society]] organized opposition to the existence of the ROTC and military recruiters.{{Sfn|Shelley|2016|p=392}} During this period, students routinely organized protests and class boycotts and used [[psychoactive drugs]] on campus open spaces.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|pages=287–289}}

On February 15, 1958, then senator John F. Kennedy received an honorary [[Doctor of Law]] degree from university president Laurence J. McGinley and delivered an address at the annual Fordham Law Alumni Association luncheon.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKSEN-0899-011.aspx|title=Fordham Law Alumni Association luncheon, New York City, 15 February 1958 |work=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Schroth|2008|p=358}} After humorously stating that he denied any "presidential aspirations—with respect to the Fordham Alumni Association," Kennedy said that, "It is to the eternal credit of Fordham that the teaching of law has here been accompanied by an inculcation of moral values. The graduate of this law school has acquired something more than the tools of his profession—he has learned, both by example and precept, the high obligations of trust which are his as an attorney."<ref name=":1" />

In 1961, the Lincoln Center campus opened as part of the [[Lincoln Square, New York|Lincoln Square]] Renewal Project. The [[Fordham Law School|School of Law]] was the first to occupy the new campus, but the academic programs at 302 Broadway were moved to the new location in 1969. The first women to attend Fordham came earlier in the century: the Law School began accepting female students in 1918. Women also had been earning Fordham degrees at the Graduate School of Social Service and the Undergraduate School of Education, at the City Hall Campus. Women in the School of Education had also been commuting to the Rose Hill campus to take their science lab courses alongside male students, where women had also been part of the School of Pharmacy's student body. However, in September 1964, the all-female [[Thomas More College (New York)|Thomas More College]] at the Rose Hill campus began instruction.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=261}}

In addition, on November 18, 1961, then [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] [[Robert F.

It is a mark of courage and resolution."<ref name=":2" /> On November 2, 1964, during his campaign for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], Robert F.

In response to internal demands for a more "liberalized" curriculum, the university created Bensalem College in 1967. An experimental college with no set requirements and no grades, it was studied by a wide array of educators and covered by journalists at such large-circulation publications of the day as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' and the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]''. The school closed in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fordham.libguides.com/c.php?g=279582&p=1863388|title=Research Guides @ Fordham: Fordham University History: Schools that Once Were|last=Kane|first=Patrice|website=fordham.libguides.com|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

"The Liberal Arts College" for undergraduates opened in 1968, later changing its name to "The College at Lincoln Center" and then in 1996 to "Fordham College at Lincoln Center."{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=xvii}} In 1993, a twenty-story [[residence hall]] for 850 students was added to the Lincoln Center campus.

In 1969, students organized a sit-in on the main road leading to Rose Hill in response to an announcement that [[President Richard Nixon]] would be speaking on campus. As a result of the sit-in, Nixon was forced to cancel his plans to speak.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|pages=281}} A year later, students stormed the main administration building, occupying it for several weeks, and set fire to the Rose Hill faculty lounge.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|pages=287–289}} It was during this period of activism that the university's African and African American Studies Department, one of the first [[Africana studies|black studies]] departments in the nation, as well as ''the paper'', the leftist student newspaper on campus, were founded.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=384 }}

The board of trustees was reorganized in 1969 to include a majority of nonclerical members, which officially made the university an independent institution.{{sfn|Shelley|2016|p=403}} While the Jesuit order thereby lost full control of Fordham, the board of trustees continues to maintain the institution as a "Jesuit, Catholic university."<ref name="jesuittradition"/> The College of Pharmacy closed in 1972 due to declining enrollment. Fordham College at Rose Hill became coeducational in 1974 when it merged with Thomas More College.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=257}}

[[Fordham Preparatory School]] is a four-year, [[Single-sex education|all-male]] [[university-preparatory school|college preparatory school]] that was once integrated with the university, sharing its 1841 founding. "Fordham Prep" became legally independent in 1972 when it moved to its own facilities on the northwest corner of the Rose Hill campus.

[[Marymount College, Tarrytown|Marymount College]] was an independent [[women's college]] that was founded in 1907 by the [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]]. The school was consolidated into Fordham in July 2002. Marymount had been steeped in financial hardship since the 1970s. Located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of Manhattan in Tarrytown, New York, the college remained open, and its campus received a branch of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies as well as extensions of the graduate schools for education, social service, and business administration.

In 2005, Fordham announced that its Marymount College campus would be phased out; Marymount awarded degrees to its final undergraduate class in May 2007.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=384}} University administrators indicated the campus would remain open for Fordham graduate programs in several disciplines.

In the autumn of 2007, the university announced its intention to seek buyers for the Marymount campus. Administrators stated the expenses required to support the programs at the campus far exceeded the demand. University officials estimated the revenue gained from the proposed sale would not be greater than the expenses incurred maintaining and improving the campus since the merger with Marymount. President McShane stated the university's decision was nonetheless a "painful" one. Fordham then indicated its intention to move the remaining programs from the Marymount campus to a new location in [[Harrison, New York]], by the autumn of 2008. On February 17, 2008, the university announced the sale of the campus for $27&nbsp;million to [[EF Education|EF Schools]], a chain of private language-instruction schools.<ref name="marymount">{{cite journal|author=Post a Job Vitae is your link to top academic talent. |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Fordham-U-Sells-Marymount/40481 |title=Fordham U.

In addition, it maintains and utilizes various academic, extracurricular, and residential facilities throughout New York City and New York State and around the world.<ref name="fordhamfacts"/> In addition to its three main campuses, the university also operates the [[Louis Calder Center]], a biological field station {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} north of New York City in [[Armonk, New York]]. It consists of {{convert|114|acre|km2}} forested with a {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} lake and 19 buildings.  The structures house laboratories and classrooms, offices for faculty and administrators, a library, and residences.<ref name="calder"/>

Outside the United States, the university maintains a small campus in [[London]], known as the '''London Centre'''. In addition, Fordham operates field offices in [[Granada]], Spain, and [[Pretoria]], South Africa; these house undergraduate study abroad programs.<ref name="isap"/> Finally, the university provides faculty for the [[Beijing International MBA at Peking University]] at [[Peking University]] in China. The program, established in 1998, has been ranked No. 1 in China by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''Forbes'' Magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.bimba.edu.cn/index/NewsVoices/2015/1214/25086.html |work=Beijing International MBA at Peking (BiMBA) |title=BiMBA 2016 MBA Admissions Seminar |archivedate=March 9, 2016 |date=December 14, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309015212/http://en.bimba.edu.cn/index/NewsVoices/2015/1214/25086.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1954, New York City's [[Robert Moses]] wrote to Fordham administrators proposing Fordham might "be interested in an alternative [to renting space in the [[New York Coliseum]]] involving a new building in a part of the area to the north of [[Columbus Circle]] to be redeveloped under Title One of the Federal Housing Law.&nbsp;... If this idea appeals to you I will ask Mr. Lebwohl to see you and explain it in greater detail."{{Sfn|Gannon|1967|p=297}} In March 1958, Mayor [[Robert F.

Fordham College at Rose Hill has a long history of college theater,{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|pages=124, 185}} and the entire university maintains a number of theater groups at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill (e.g. the Mimes and Mummers, Fordham Experimental Theater, the Theatrical Outreach Group, Splinter Group). There are also choirs (University Choir, Schola Cantorum, Gloria Dei Choir) and [[a cappella]] groups spanning both campuses (Fordham Ramblers, Satin Dolls, b-Sides, Hot Notes, F-sharps). The Mimes and Mummers, the oldest entirely student-run club at Fordham University and among the oldest college theater groups in the United States, was founded in 1855 as the Saint John's Dramatic Society.<ref name="themimesandmummers.com">{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Tim|title=The History of The Mimes and Mummers|url=http://www.themimesandmummers.com/history-of-the-mimes.html|website=The Mimes and Mummers|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref> The Mimes put on two musicals, a drama, and a comedy each year – all non-student-written shows – as well as workshops designed to help students at Fordham learn about theater. The club receives from the school a budget which allows the hiring of professional directors, music directors, and choreographers but the shows are student produced, with all elements of technical design run by the club's executive board.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mimes and Mummers|url=http://www.themimesandmummers.com/|website=The Mimes and Mummers|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>

In 1905, with the construction of Collins Hall, Fordham University became the first place on the East Coast of the United States to have a theater in the round. The Penthouse Theatre, on the fourth floor of Collins Hall, served both for debuts of professional shows and home for theater groups like the Mimes and Mummers. The Penthouse Theatre was turned into office space in 1966.<ref name="themimesandmummers.com"/>

In 1991, the Alumni House, constructed in 1842 by William Rodrigue, was turned into Rodrigues Coffee House. Rodrigues, more commonly referred to as "Rod's" is an entirely student run coffee house and event space. Notable bands such as [[Matt and Kim]], and [[Japanese Breakfast]] have performed at Rod's.

The purpose of Campus Ministry at Fordham is to provide "opportunities and resources for spiritual growth to members of [the university] community." It offers programming for more than 15 faith traditions in such areas as worship, music ministry, and social ministry. One of its most popular initiatives is its retreats, which are held at the university's McGrath House of Prayer in [[Goshen, New York]], and other retreat houses in the New York City metropolitan area.<ref name="campmin">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/mission/mission_and_ministry/campus_ministry/index.asp |title=Campus Ministry |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> In addition to its Jesuit traditions, the university also has organizations devoted to Judaism, Islam, and other religions.<ref name=spaces>{{cite web|url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/26119/interfaith_ministry/111/campus_worship_spaces|publisher=Fordham University|title=Campus Worship Spaces|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>

==Traditions and symbols==
'''Traditions'''<br />
Since its founding in 1841, the university has developed many traditions. Some of them are described below:

*'''President's Ball:''' The President's Ball takes place every autumn on the eve of the [[Homecoming]] football game. It is a [[informal attire|business formal]] event held in the Vince Lombardi Field House. It is hosted by the Office of the President, from which the name is derived.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fordhamram.com/2014/09/17/presidents-ball-a-night-to-remember/|work=The Fordham Ram|title=President's Ball: A Night to Remember|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2017|author=Bhatti, Amina}}</ref>
[[File:Fordham University 10.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Archbishop Hughes gifted in 1891, Rose Hill campus{{Sfn|Taaffe|2013|p=137}}]]
*'''Winter Ball:''' The Winter Ball is a [[business casual]] event staged each winter by the United Student Government and the Activities Board of Lincoln Center, at venues in New York City including the [[Rainbow Room]], the [[Russian Tea Room]], and the [[Mandarin Oriental, New York|Mandarin Oriental]] Hotel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/25214/winter_ball|title=Fordham online information {{!}} Student Life {{!}} Student Involvement {{!}} Office for Student Involvement at Lincoln Center {{!}} Winter Ball|publisher=Fordham University|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref>
*'''Under the Tent:''' The "Under the Tent" Dance is a [[smart casual]] event held the weekend before final exams. Sponsored by the university's [[Residence Halls Association]], it takes place underneath a tent on Martyrs' Lawn, Fordham's second-largest quadrangle, and has a different theme each year. The dance is part of the Spring Weekend Festival, which also includes two concerts, a barbecue, a race around the Rose Hill campus, and a comedy show.<ref name="sprwknd">{{cite web|author=Arts and Culture Film Literature Museum Music Theater |url=http://www.fordhamobserver.com/spring-weekend-a-success-despite-low-expectations/ |title=Spring Weekend a Success Despite Low Expectations |publisher=Fordhamobserver.com |date=May 2, 2015 |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> The dance was previously held at the Lincoln Center campus as well, but was replaced in 2015 by an end-of-the-year event called "The Bash".
*'''The Festival of Lessons and Carols:''' The Fordham University Concert Choir presents a series of [[Nine Lessons and Carols]] every year during the Christmas season. An afternoon concert is performed at the University Church on the Rose Hill campus, and an evening concert is performed at the [[St. Paul the Apostle Church (Manhattan)|St. Paul the Apostle Church]] adjacent to the Lincoln Center campus.<ref name="lessons">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/Campus_Resources/eNewsroom/topstories_2001.asp |title=The Christmas Festival of Lessons and Carols |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>
*'''Midnight Breakfast:''' Each semester, the official beginning of the final exam period is marked by a "midnight breakfast," in which Fordham administration and professors cook students their favorite breakfast items so as to prepare them for the long night of studying ahead of them.<ref name="midbkfst">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/inside_fordham/may_19_2007/in_brief_25907.asp#bkfst |title=Students Line Up for Midnight Breakfast|series=In Brief|publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> The name comes from "burning the midnight oil" with studies, not from the time of the breakfast.
*'''The Liberty Cup:''' The [[Liberty Cup]] was awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia universities. The tradition began in 2002, a year after the Fordham-Columbia game was postponed due to September 11 attacks.<ref name="libcup">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_969.asp |title=Football Team Beats Columbia, Reclaims Liberty Cup |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> {{as of|2016}}, the series was ended by Columbia.
*'''Rams-Crusader Trophy:''' This was first awarded in 1951 to commemorate a great coach of both Fordham and Holy Cross: [[Frank Cavanaugh (American football)|Frank "Iron Major" Cavanaugh]].{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=395}}
*'''Encaenia:''' Fordham College at Rose Hill hosts an [[Encaenia]] each year in early May. Faculty, administrators, and students process in [[academic regalia]], and candidates for degrees at the current year's Commencement receive various awards and honors. The ceremony includes a sentimental speech by the year's [[valedictorian]], as well as a generally more humorous, yet equally endearing, speech by the honorary Lord or Lady of the Manor.<ref name="encaenia">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1254.asp |title=FCRH Accomplishments Honored at Encaenia Ceremony |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>

'''Symbols'''<br />
In addition to its traditions, Fordham is associated with a number of symbols, some of which are discussed below:
[[File:Ram statue, Fordham Rose Hill.png|thumb|right|200px|Statue of the Ram, the university mascot, Rose Hill]]
*'''Maroon:''' The university's official color used to be [[magenta]], one which was shared by [[Harvard University]]. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled through a series of baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.<ref name="bulletin"/>
*'''The Ram:''' The ram became the university's mascot as a result of a slightly vulgar cheer Fordham fans sang during an 1893 football game against the [[United States Military Academy]]. The fans began cheering, "One-damn, two-damn, three-damn, Fordham!" which was an instant hit. Later, "damn" was sanitized to "ram" so the song would conform to the university's image.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=107}}
*'''The Victory Bell:''' Presented to Fordham by Fleet Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] ('44) of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], the Victory Bell was the [[ship's bell]] of the Japanese aircraft carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō|Junyo]]''. First rung on campus by President Harry S. Truman on May 11, 1946, it currently stands in front of the Rose Hill Gymnasium and peals following all Ram athletic victories and at the start of Commencement each year.<ref name="bulletin"/>

[[File:Seal of Fordham University.svg.png|thumb|left|University seal]]
*'''The Great Seal:''' The design of the Great Seal of Fordham University acknowledges the Society of Jesus presence on campus, hence elements of the order's seal in the center on a blue shield, without the [[sunburst]] background. The borrowed elements include the IHS monogram used by the Jesuits as an abbreviation for the name of Jesus in Greek: IHSOUS, in this case with the [[Christian cross|Cross]] resting on the center of the H, and the three nails of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] beneath the [[epigraphy|epigraph]]. These elements dressed in gold lay in a field framed in maroon, the color of the university, with silver [[fleur-de-lis]] at the edge. The fleur-de-lis symbolize the French origin of the Jesuits who arrived at Fordham in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the [[laurel crown]] in green on a light blue background, enclosing the university's original pedagogical disciplines in white capital letters listed above each other in the following order: ARTS, SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, LAW. Below the shield is a light blue scroll with the university's motto in black capital letters, ''SAPENTIA ET DOCTRINA''. Both the shield and the scroll rest on a gold field emblematic of learning (''doctrina''), upon which surrounds them with 14 fiery tongues of the [[Holy Spirit]], evenly distributed, a symbol of wisdom (''sapientia''). Finally, surrounding the entire seal is an heraldic belt, which is employed as a stylistic decoration. It forms a circular maroon loop embroidered with green beads on its inner and outer edge, with a gold buckle and end tip. The belt is emblazoned with Fordham's official Latin title in gold capital letters: ''UNIVERSITAS FORDHAMENSIS''; between the last two punch holes where the buckle is fastened and the end looped inside to wrap around, is in gold the date of the university's founding: ''1841''. The University of Oxford, the only other [[higher education|tertiary institution]] in the world that uses a belt in its seal, maintains that without its belt, their seal is not official.<ref name="bulletin"/>
*'''The mace:''' The [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] of Fordham is traditionally carried at Commencement by the president of the Faculty Senate, who serves as the grand marshal of the main academic procession. The device, four feet in length, bears a regal [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]] at the summit to denote the sole power of the [[State of New York]] to grant academic degrees in its territory. Above the crown is a cross composed of four windmill sails, which signify the Catholic faith and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] founders of New York City, respectively. The center of the cross displays a heraldic [[rose]], which symbolizes Rose Hill. Immediately beneath the crown is a support, on which the university's seal is emblazoned. The upper node of the mace's staff is decorated with three heraldic roses, the Fordham seal, a ram's head, and a silhouette of the original Lincoln Center campus skyline. The titles of the university's constituent colleges are engraved above the node, and the names of the school's presidents from 1841 to 1966 are inscribed below it. The mace was a gift to the university from the Fordham University Alumni Federation.<ref name="bulletin"/>
*'''The Terrace of the presidents:''' Robert Gannon, president of Fordham from 1936 to 1949, initiated the custom of engraving the granite steps leading up to Keating Hall with the names of heads of state who visit the university. Among the names engraved are George Washington, who visited the Rose Hill Manor before it was succeeded by St. John's College in 1841; Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Harry S. Truman; Richard Nixon; and the names of various other heads of state from around the world.<ref name="bulletin"/>

*'''School songs:''' Fordham's official school song is "Alma Mater Fordham," and its [[fight song]] is "Fordham Ram" by J. Ignatius Coveney.{{Sfn|Schroth|2008|p=107}} In December 2013 the lyrics to "Fordham Ram" were changed from "Hail Men of Fordham, hail" to "Hail Rams of Fordham, hail" to be inclusive of the school's female majority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/Campus_Resources/eNewsroom/topstories_3046.asp|title=And Now, Hail Rams of Fordham|website=Legacy.fordham.edu|accessdate= July 14, 2015}}</ref> "The Marching Song" is typically played during parades and after athletic games, especially after a Ram victory.<ref name="songs">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/audience/sheetmusic.shtml |title="The Ram" Sheet Music |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=December 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215214736/http://www.fordham.edu/audience/sheetmusic.shtml |archivedate=December 15, 2013 }}</ref>
