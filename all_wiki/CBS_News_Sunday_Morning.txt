'''''CBS News Sunday Morning''''' (also simply titled '''''Sunday Morning''''') is an [[United States|American]] [[news magazine]] [[television program]] that has aired on [[CBS]] since January 28, 1979. Created by Robert Northshield and original host [[Charles Kuralt]], the 90-minute program currently airs Sundays from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 10:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]], and from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 7:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]].  Since October 9, 2016, the show has been hosted by [[Jane Pauley]], who also hosts news segments, after the retirement of [[Charles Osgood]]. Osgood was the host for twenty-two years (and is the program's longest-serving host), taking over from Kuralt on April 10, 1994.

==History==
The program was originally conceived to be a broadcast version of a [[Sunday magazine|Sunday newspaper magazine supplement]], most typified by the Sunday ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]''. The format was conceived as the Sunday equivalent of the ''[[The Early Show#Before The Early Show|CBS Morning News]]'', which following ''Sunday Morning''{{'}}s debut was retitled to reflect each day of the week (such as ''Monday Morning'', ''Tuesday Morning'', etc.).

The weekday broadcasts, which emphasized [[hard news]] as opposed to ''Sunday Morning''{{'}}s focus on [[Feature story|feature stories]], were originally anchored by [[Bob Schieffer]]<ref name="b-weekdayversion">{{cite magazine|title=CBS rebuilding morning news show|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1978/1978-12-04-BC.pdf|pages=49–52|accessdate=7 June 2020|magazine=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]|date=December 4, 1978}}</ref> (Kuralt eventually took over the daily role, and was for a short time joined by [[Diane Sawyer]] as co-host). However, the weekday program's then-limited 7:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern air time (the long-running ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' was entrenched in the 8:00&nbsp;a.m. hour) hampered its ability to compete with [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s rival two-hour morning shows ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'', though it expanded to 90 minutes (from 7:30 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) in 1981 and was renamed simply ''Morning''.

In 1982, the weekday version was extended to a full two hours and restored its previous ''CBS Morning News'' title, later to be replaced by short-lived ''[[The Morning Program]]'' in 1987. The Sunday version, however, survived, and retains its original format. Long after the daily editions ended, the Sunday edition's opening sequence continued to display all seven days of the week until the early 2000s. On January 25, 2004, ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' celebrated its 25th anniversary with clips and highlights from the show's first quarter-century on the air. Host Charles Osgood showed clips from former host Charles Kuralt.

The February 1, 2009 broadcast celebrated ''Sunday Morning''{{'}}s 30th anniversary. Segments examined how the world has changed in the three decades since the program began, the history of Sundays in America and – as a tie-in to the show's logo – the physics of the sun. An artist was commissioned to create new sun logos for the program, which debuted on that edition and were used in future broadcasts. CBS News correspondent Steve Hartman periodically revisits some of Charles Kuralt's memorable personal profiles. On May 17, 2009, ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' began broadcasting in [[high-definition television|high-definition]]. In 2014, rebroadcasts of the program began airing on sister cable network [[Smithsonian Channel]] (owned by CBS's parent company [[ViacomCBS]]), but has since been pulled from that channel's programming.

==Format==
Each edition begins with a short summary of national and international news headlines, sports and a national weather forecast – which unlike most morning news programs, does not cue to [[network affiliate|affiliates]] to run a local weather insert (some local stations will still override the national forecast with a local forecast from their own weather department).{{Update inline|reason=The headline news no longer makes an appearance since sometime in July/August 2020. No obvious reason why it got dropped, but it left a significant hole in the program.|date=August 2020}}
 
It then follows a story [[totem pole]] in the center of the CBS [[soundstage]], with previews of featured stories set to air during the broadcast (the first four of which feature clips from the story packages with preview narration by the respective correspondent) being shown prior to the news summary. Each story covered in a given episode has a glass plate with its headline on this pole (digitally inserted on the pole as a prepared graphic since the late 2000s), which the camera follows after Pauley's introductions. Music in the show is usually limited to the opening and closing title theme. Pauley introduces each story with a short [[monologue]], then sends the show out to the taped segment. The show usually ends with a preview of the guests and topics to air on that week's ''[[Face the Nation]]'' (which follows the program on most CBS stations), followed by a preview of next week's ''Sunday Morning'' broadcast. After the commercial break, there is a 60-second tranquil nature scene.

Notably, ''Sunday Morning'' includes significant coverage of the [[fine arts|fine]] and [[performing arts]], including coverage of topics usually not covered in network news, such as [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[ballet]], [[opera]] and [[European classical music|classical music]], though increasingly more popular forms of music have been included as well. The program's correspondents tend to ask nontraditional questions of guests (for instance, actor [[Brad Pitt]] was asked about his love of architecture, and [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]] about his painting collection). Television essays similar to the kinds delivered on [[PBS]] also appear, and the program generally has a stable of equally positive and negative news stories to fill up the program when there is no [[breaking news]] of note. Story lengths are longer (lasting up to twelve minutes at a time) and the pace of the program is considerably quieter and more relaxed than the Monday through Saturday ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' program. Commentators [[Ben Stein]] and [[Nancy Giles]] appear in recurring segments, delivering their opinion, and correspondent [[Bill Geist]] also contributes human interest stories.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Sunday Morning sticks to tradition|url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2005/Mar/20050324Go!012.asp|author=David Bauder|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=Columbia Daily News|date=March 24, 2005|accessdate=March 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224104716/http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2005/Mar/20050324Go!012.asp|archive-date=2015-12-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=That Old Feeing:Sunday Morning going strong|url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,590986,00.html|author=Richard Corliss|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 13, 2004|accessdate=March 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114111510/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,590986,00.html|archive-date=2009-01-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> The program ends with a nature scene, not given a formal title for most of the program's history, but since entitled "Moment of Nature" as it is now a sponsored element.

On one occasion, the entire program served as a showcase for [[classical music]]; this took place in April 1986, when a live broadcast of [[Vladimir Horowitz]]'s historic [[Moscow]] piano recital was aired. For that presentation only, the program departed from its usual newsmagazine format and devoted the entire 90 minutes to a complete presentation of the recital. Because the recital was given at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Moscow time, CBS was able to broadcast it at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. The presentation was such a critical and popular success that it was repeated two months later, and was subsequently released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]].

==Production==
The program is marked by its distinctive "Sun" logo, which is prominent in the program's [[title sequence]]. In addition, in between some segments, images of the sun in various forms also appear. The show's theme is the [[trumpet]] fanfare "[[Abblasen]]", attributed to [[Gottfried Reiche]]. A recording of the piece on a [[baroque trumpet]] by [[Don Smithers]] was used as the show's theme for many years, until producers decided to replace the [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] recording with a [[digital recording|digital]] of a piccolo trumpet by [[Doc Severinsen]]; the current version is played by [[Wynton Marsalis]].<ref name=cbs>{{cite news|title=About CBS News Sunday Morning |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/09/sunday/main13558.shtml|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=March 15, 2009|date=July 9, 1998}}</ref>

==Controversy==

Neurologist [[Steven Novella]] and paranormal investigator [[Joe Nickell]] wrote in separate ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' articles about [[Erin Moriarty (journalist)|Erin Moriarty]]'s lack of skepticism and "complete journalistic fail" over her segment on CBS ''Sunday Morning'' in March 2018. In her segment she showed clips of spoon-bender [[Uri Geller]] from the 1980s performing "'psychic parlor tricks'" but instead of explaining to her audience that Geller had been debunked many times she instead said he was "'unreliable'", no mention of the work of [[James Randi]]. Novella states of Moriarty "She is (most likely) just an old-school journalist who thinks of paranormal pieces as '"fluff"' pieces that don't require journalistic rigor". And that this segment could have run "thirty years ago with no change".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Novella |first1=Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella |title=Gullible Reporting about ESP on CBS |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=15–16 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquirer}}</ref> In another segment Moriarty interviewed psychic Angela Dellafiora Ford, who claims that she "psychically tracked down fugitive drug smuggler Charlie Jordan in 1989". Nickell writes that Moriarty "simply takes Ford at her word" and "gushes" over her. Nickell states that Ford's claims are an example of '"retrofitting"' and incorrect.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell |title=CBS Sunday Morning Seers Don't See So Well |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |page=17 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquirer}}</ref> [[Center for Inquiry]] editor [[Kendrick Frazier]] wrote of his disappointment that the station of Murrow and Cronkite would air a pro-paranormal segment with Geller and a psychic detective. They also featured parapsychologist [[Dean Radin]] calling him a scientist which he is not. In a tweet the next day in response to criticism, Moriarty wrote '"We reported on government experiments with the paranormal – supported by declassified Govt documents. We gave time to both those involved and scientists."' Frazier responded that "Just because some part of the government initiated a bizarre little research program at some point in the past, that is not itself a validation of the claims it was studying." Further research by CFI timed the segment and "found it more than 97 percent pro-paranormal and only 3 percent skeptical".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=CBS Drops Skepticism in Sunday Morning Paranormal Segment CSI Issues Critical Statement |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=5–7 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}</ref> In a press release, CFI called the CBS ''Sunday Morning'' segment a "regrettable lapse ... in the ... usually objective and reliable coverage". They called on the show to "take steps to correct the record" and to "provide a more truthful and scientifically rigorous view of this topic".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fildago |first1=Paul |title=CBS Condemned by Committee for Skeptical Inquiry for ‘Sunday Morning’ Segment on the Paranormal |url=http://www.csicop.org/news/press_releases/show/cbs_esp_paranormal |website=CSICOP |publisher=Center for Inquiry |accessdate=4 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704050751/http://www.csicop.org/news/press_releases/show/cbs_esp_paranormal |archivedate=4 July 2018}}</ref>
