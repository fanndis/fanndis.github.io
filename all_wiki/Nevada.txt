Nevada is officially known as the "Silver State" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the "Battle Born State" because it achieved statehood during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (the words "Battle Born" also appear on the [[Flag of Nevada|state flag]]); as the "Sagebrush State", for the native [[sagebrush|plant of the same name]]; and as the "[[Sage grouse|Sage-hen]] State".<ref>{{Cite Americana|wstitle= Sage-brush State}}</ref>  The name means "snow-covered" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], referring to Nevada's small overlap with the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range; however, the rest of Nevada is largely [[desert]] and semi-arid, much of it within the [[Great Basin]]. Areas south of the Great Basin are within the [[Mojave Desert]], while [[Lake Tahoe]] and the Sierra Nevada lie on the western edge. About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], both civilian and military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nv.blm.gov/landsales/LandFedAcresAgency.pdf |title=Federal Land Acres in Nevada | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930112237/http://www.nv.blm.gov/landsales/LandFedAcresAgency.pdf | archive-date=September 30, 2006|access-date=May 7, 2009 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management}}</ref>

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] of the [[Paiute]], [[Shoshone]], and [[Washoe people|Washoe]] tribes inhabited what is now Nevada. The first Europeans to explore the region were Spanish. They called the region ''Nevada'' (snowy) because of the snow which covered the mountains in winter similar to the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] in Spain. The area formed part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], and became part of Mexico when it gained independence in 1821. The United States annexed the area in 1848 after its victory in the [[Mexican–American War]], and it was incorporated as part of [[Utah Territory]] in 1850. The discovery of silver at the [[Comstock Lode]] in 1859 led to a population boom that became an impetus to the creation of [[Nevada Territory]] out of western Utah Territory in 1861. Nevada became the 36th state on October 31, 1864, as the second of two states added to the Union during the Civil War (the first being [[West Virginia]]).<ref>Rocha, Guy [http://nsla.nevadaculture.org//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=674&Itemid=418 "Myth No.{{nbs}}12{{snd}}Why Did Nevada Become a State?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024003357/http://nsla.nevadaculture.org//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=674&Itemid=418 |date=October 24, 2013 }}, Nevada State Library and Archives, accessed January 9, 2011</ref>

Nevada has a reputation for its [[libertarian]] laws.

==Etymology and pronunciation==

The name "Nevada" comes from the Spanish ''nevada'' {{IPA-es|neˈβaða|}}, meaning "snow-covered".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=nevada|title=Nevada|access-date=February 24, 2007|publisher=Wordreference.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225103913/http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=nevada|archive-date=December 25, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nevadans pronounce the second syllable with the "a" as in "trap" ({{IPAc-en|n|ᵻ|ˈ|v|æ|d|ə}}) while some people from outside of the state can pronounce it with the "a" as in "palm" ({{IPAc-en|n|ᵻ|ˈ|v|ɑː|d|ə}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unlv.edu/news/article/you-say-nevada-i-say-nevada |title=You Say Nevada, I Say Nevada… |author=Francis McCabe |access-date=November 26, 2019 |date=October 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801193302/https://www.unlv.edu/news/article/you-say-nevada-i-say-nevada |archive-date=August 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although the latter pronunciation is closer{{Clarify|date=November 2020}}{{Definition needed|date=November 2020}} to the Spanish pronunciation, it is not the pronunciation used by Nevadans. State Assemblyman [[Harry Mortenson]] proposed a bill to recognize the alternate (quasi-Spanish) pronunciation of Nevada,<ref>{{cite news|first=Guy |last=Clifton |url=http://www.rgj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20108220380|title=You heard it right: Bill would let them say Ne-VAH-da|date=August 22, 2010|newspaper=[[Reno Gazette-Journal]]}}</ref> though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote. The Nevadan pronunciation is the one used by the state legislature. At one time, the state's official tourism organization, TravelNevada, stylized the name of the state as "Nevăda", with a [[breve]] over the ''a'' indicating the locally preferred pronunciation,<ref>Archive.org "Wayback Machine" view from December 29, 2013: {{cite web|url=http://travelnevada.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229064306/http://travelnevada.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 29, 2013 |title=Nevada: A World Within.

==Geography==

[[File:Digital-elevation-map-nevada.gif|thumb|A topographic map of Nevada]]

Nevada is almost entirely within the [[Basin and Range Province]] and is broken up by many north–south mountain ranges. Most of these ranges have [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] valleys between them, which belies the image portrayed by the term [[Great Basin]].

Much of the northern part of the state is within the Great Basin, a mild desert that experiences hot temperatures in the summer and cold temperatures in the winter. Occasionally, moisture from the [[Arizona Monsoon]] will cause summer thunderstorms; Pacific storms may blanket the area with snow. The state's highest recorded temperature was {{convert|125|°F|°C|0}} in [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]] (elevation of {{convert|605|ft|disp=or|sp=us}}) on June 29, 1994.<ref name="ReferenceA">National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, N.C., and Storm Phillips, Stormfax, Inc.</ref> The coldest recorded temperature was {{convert|-52|°F|°C|0|lk=on}} set in San Jacinto in 1972, in the northeastern portion of the state.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The [[Humboldt River]] crosses the state from east to west across the northern part of the state, draining into the [[Humboldt Sink]] near [[Lovelock, Nevada|Lovelock]]. Several rivers drain from the Sierra Nevada eastward, including the [[Walker River (Nevada)|Walker]], [[Truckee River|Truckee]], and [[Carson River|Carson]] rivers. All of these rivers are [[endorheic basin]]s, ending in [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]], [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], and the [[Carson Sink]], respectively. However, not all of Nevada is within the Great Basin. Tributaries of the [[Snake River]] drain the far north, while the [[Colorado River]], which also forms much of the boundary with [[Arizona]], drains much of southern Nevada.

The mountain ranges, some of which have peaks above {{convert|13000|ft}}, harbor lush forests high above desert plains, creating [[sky island]]s for endemic species. The valleys are often no lower in elevation than {{convert|3000|ft}}, while some in central Nevada are above {{convert|6000|ft}}.
[[File:Charge! Little Finland, NV.jpg|thumb|[[Little Finland]] rock formation in Nevada]]

The southern third of the state, where the Las Vegas area is situated, is within the [[Mojave Desert]]. The area receives less rain in the winter but is closer to the Arizona Monsoon in the summer. The terrain is also lower, mostly below {{convert|4000|ft}}, creating conditions for hot summer days and cool to chilly winter nights.

Nevada and California have by far the longest diagonal [[Line (geometry)|line]] (in respect to the cardinal directions) as a state [[Border|boundary]] at just over {{convert|400|mi}}. This line begins in [[Lake Tahoe]] nearly {{convert|4|mi}} offshore (in the direction of the boundary), and continues to the [[Colorado River]] where the Nevada, California, and Arizona boundaries merge {{convert|12|mi}} southwest of the Laughlin Bridge.

The largest mountain range in the southern portion of the state is the [[Spring Mountains|Spring Mountain Range]], just west of Las Vegas. The state's lowest point is along the Colorado River, south of Laughlin.

Nevada has 172 mountain summits with {{convert|2000|ft}} of prominence. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Nevada is the most mountainous state in the contiguous United States.<ref>[https://peakvisor.com/adm/nevada.html Nevada]. PeakVisor. Retrieved 2020-06-23</ref>

===Climate===

[[File:NV_koppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in Nevada]]

While winters in northern Nevada are long and fairly cold, the winter season in the southern part of the state tends to be of short duration and mild. Most parts of Nevada receive scarce precipitation during the year. The most rain that falls in the state falls on the lee side (east and northeast slopes) of the [[Sierra Nevada]].

The average annual rainfall per year is about {{convert|7|in|mm}}; the wettest parts get around {{convert|40|in|mm}}. Nevada's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|125|F|C}} at [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]] on June 29, 1994 and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-50|F|C}} at [[San Jacinto, Nevada|San Jacinto]] on January 8, 1937. Nevada's {{convert|125|F|C}} reading is the third highest statewide record high temperature of a U.S. state, just behind Arizona's {{convert|128|F|C}} reading and California's {{convert|134|F|C}} reading.

Nevada is divided into political jurisdictions designated as ''[[County (United States)|counties]]''. Carson City is officially a consolidated municipality; however, for many purposes under state law, it is considered to be a county. As of 1919, there were 17 counties in the state, ranging from {{convert|146|to|18159|sqmi}}.

[[Lake County, Nevada|Lake County]], one of the original nine counties formed in 1861, was renamed [[Roop County, Nevada|Roop County]] in 1862.

In 1969, Ormsby County was dissolved and the [[Consolidated Municipality of Carson City]] was created by the Legislature in its place coterminous with the old boundaries of Ormsby County.

[[Bullfrog County, Nevada|Bullfrog County]] was formed in 1987 from part of Nye County. After the creation was declared unconstitutional, the county was abolished in 1989.<ref name="library" />

Humboldt county was designated as a county in 1856 by [[Utah Territorial Legislature]] and again in 1861 by the new Nevada Legislature.

Clark County is the most populous county in Nevada, accounting for nearly three-quarters of its residents. Las Vegas, Nevada's most populous city, has been the [[county seat]] since the county was created in 1909 from a portion of [[Lincoln County, Nevada]].

Administratively, the area of Nevada was part of the [[Provincias Internas|Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas]] in the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. Nevada became a part of [[Alta California]] (''Upper California'') province in 1804 when [[the Californias]] were split. With the [[Mexican War of Independence]] won in 1821, the province of Alta California became a territory (state) of Mexico, with a small population. [[Jedediah Smith]] entered the [[Las Vegas Valley]] in 1827, and [[Peter Skene Ogden]] traveled the [[Humboldt River]] in 1828. When the Mormons created the [[State of Deseret]] in 1847, they laid claim to all of Nevada within the Great Basin and the Colorado watershed. They also founded the first white settlement in what is now Nevada, [[Genoa, Nevada|Mormon Station]] (modern-day Genoa), in 1851. In June 1855, William Bringhurst and 29 fellow Mormon missionaries from Utah arrived at a site just northeast of downtown Las Vegas and built a 150-foot square adobe fort, the first permanent structure erected in the valley, which remained under the control of Salt Lake City until the winter of 1858–1859.

As a result of the [[Mexican–American War]] and the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]] permanently lost Alta California in 1848. The new areas acquired by the United States continued to be administered as territories. As part of the [[Mexican Cession]] (1848) and the subsequent [[California Gold Rush]] that used [[Emigrant Trail]]s through the area, the [[Territorial evolution of Nevada|state's area evolved]] first as part of the [[Utah Territory]], then the [[Nevada Territory]] (March 2, 1861; named for the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Nevada&searchmode=none |access-date=May 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102953/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Nevada&searchmode=none |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Separation from Utah Territory===

{{Main|Utah Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Nevada Territory|Nevada in the American Civil War}}

On March 2, 1861, the Nevada Territory separated from the Utah Territory and adopted its current name, shortened from ''The Sierra Nevada'' (Spanish for "snow-covered mountain range"). The 1861 southern boundary is commemorated by [[Nevada Historical Markers]] 57 and 58 in Lincoln and Nye counties.

===Statehood (1864)===

{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|Nevada in the American Civil War|Constitution of Nevada}}

Eight days before the [[1864 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1864]], Nevada became the 36th state in the union, despite lacking the minimum requisite 60,000 residents in order to become a state.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Nevada-state/History History of Nevada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608163919/https://www.britannica.com/place/Nevada-state/History |date=June 8, 2019 }}. Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved 2019-06-09.</ref> (At the time Nevada's population was little more than 10,000.) Rather than sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27<ref name=NationalArchives>{{cite web |title=National Archives Celebrates the 145th Anniversary of Nevada Statehood |url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2009/nr09-127.html |publisher=National Archives of the United States |access-date=November 4, 2011 |date=September 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>The National Archives press release states that the cost was $4,313.27, but the amount $4,303.27 is actually written on the document.</ref>{{snd}}the most costly telegraph on file at the time for a single dispatch. Finally, the response from Washington came on October 31, 1864: "the pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day was admitted into the Union". Statehood was rushed to the date of October 31 to help ensure [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s reelection on November{{nbs}}8 and post-Civil War [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] dominance in Congress,<ref>Rocha Guy, [http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/nsla/archives/myth/myth12.htm ''Historical Myth a Month: Why Did Nevada Become A State?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113222250/http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/nsla/archives/myth/myth12.htm |date=January 13, 2008 }}</ref> as Nevada's mining-based economy tied it to the more industrialized [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the election handily and did not need Nevada's help.

Nevada is one of only two states to significantly expand its borders after admission to the Union. (The other is Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the [[Platte Purchase]].)

In 1866 another part of the western Utah Territory was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state, setting the current eastern boundary.

Nevada achieved its current southern boundaries on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the portion of [[Pah-Ute County, Arizona|Pah-Ute County]] in the [[Arizona Territory]] west of the Colorado River, essentially all of present-day Nevada south of the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]]. The transfer was prompted by the discovery of gold in the area, and officials thought Nevada would be better able to oversee the expected population boom. This area includes most of what is now [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] and the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

Mining shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see ''[[Silver mining in Nevada]]''). When [[Mark Twain]] lived in Nevada during the period described in ''[[Roughing It]]'', mining had led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth. However, both mining and population declined in the late 19th century. However, the rich silver strike at [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]] in 1900, followed by strikes in [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]] and [[Rhyolite, Nevada|Rhyolite]], again put Nevada's population on an upward trend.

====Gambling and labor====

[[File:Welcome to fabulous las vegas sign.jpg|thumb|right|Gambling erupted once more following a recession in the early 20th century, helping to build the city of Las Vegas.]]

Unregulated [[gambling]] was commonplace in the early Nevada mining towns but was outlawed in 1909 as part of a nationwide anti-gambling crusade. Because of subsequent declines in mining output and the decline of the agricultural sector during the [[Great Depression]], Nevada again legalized gambling on March 19, 1931, with approval from the legislature. Governor [[Fred B. Balzar]]'s signature enacted the most liberal divorce laws in the country and open gambling. The reforms came just eight days after the federal government presented the $49{{nbs}}million construction contract for [[Boulder Dam]] (now [[Hoover Dam]]).<ref>Moe, Al W. ''Nevada's Golden Age of Gambling'', [https://www.amazon.com/Nevadas-Golden-Gambling-Revised-Expanded/dp/0971501904/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1322275959&sr=1-1 Puget Sound Books], 2002, p. 18</ref>

====Nuclear testing====

The [[Nevada Test Site]], {{convert|65|mi}} northwest of the city of Las Vegas, was founded on January 11, 1951, for the testing of [[nuclear weapons]]. The site consists of about {{convert|1350|sqmi}} of the desert and mountainous terrain. [[Nuclear test]]ing at the Nevada Test Site began with a {{convert|1|ktonTNT|sp=us}} bomb dropped on [[Frenchman Flat]] on January 27, 1951. The last atmospheric test was conducted on July 17, 1962, and the underground testing of weapons continued until September 23, 1992. The location is known for having the highest concentration of nuclear-detonated weapons in the U.S.

Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. The primary reason for this is [[Homestead Acts|homesteads]] were not permitted in large enough sizes to be viable in the arid conditions that prevail throughout desert Nevada. Instead, early settlers would homestead land surrounding a water source, and then graze livestock on the adjacent public land, which is useless for agriculture without access to water (this pattern of [[ranching]] still prevails).

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], 6.9% of the state's population were reported as under 5, 24.6% were under 18, and 12.0% were 65 or older. Females made up about 49.5% of the population.

Since the 2010 census, the population of Nevada had a natural increase of 87,581 (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths); and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 (of which 104,032 was due to domestic and 42,594 was due to international migration).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2016/state/totals/nst-est2016-04.xlsx|format=xlsx|title=Cumulative Estimates of the Components of Resident Population Change for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016 (NST-EST2016-04)|date=December 20, 2016|publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]]|access-date=December 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224233011/http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2016/state/totals/nst-est2016-04.xlsx|archive-date=December 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the U.S. percentage-wise. Between 1990 and 2000, Nevada's population increased by 66%, while the nation's population increased by 13%. More than two-thirds of the population live in [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], which is coextensive with the [[Las Vegas–Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas metropolitan area]]. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation.

[[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] and [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]] are among the top 20 fastest-growing U.S. cities with populations over 100,000. The rural community of [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]] {{convert|65|mi|km}} northeast of Las Vegas was an example of micropolitan growth in the 1990s and 2000s. Other desert towns like [[Indian Springs, Nevada|Indian Springs]] and [[Searchlight, Nevada|Searchlight]] on the outskirts of Las Vegas have seen some growth as well.

In [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas]], [[Mineral County, Nevada|Mineral]], and [[Pershing County, Nevada|Pershing]] counties, a plurality of residents are of [[Mexican American|Mexican]] ancestry. In [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]] and [[Humboldt County, Nevada|Humboldt County]], residents are mostly of [[German American|German]] ancestry; [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] has many [[Irish Americans]].

Asian Americans lived in the state since the California Gold Rush of the 1850s brought thousands of Chinese miners to Washoe county. They were followed by a few hundred [[Japanese American|Japanese]] farmworkers in the late 19th century. By the late 20th century, many immigrants from [[China]], [[Japan]], Korea, the [[Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]], India, and [[Vietnam]] came to the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The city now has one of America's most prolific Asian American communities, with a mostly Chinese and [[Taiwanese American|Taiwanese]] area known as "Chinatown" west of I-15 on Spring Mountain Road. [[Filipino American]]s form the largest Asian American group in the state, with a population of more than 113,000.

A small percentage of Nevada's population lives in rural areas. The culture of these places differs significantly from major metropolitan areas. People in these rural counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state. The rural population is also less diverse in terms of race and ethnicity. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2012/10/1-3-billion-for-288-jobs-the-failure-of-government-subsidized-renewable-energy-another-reason-why-government-shouldnt-pick-winners-and-losers-in-the-economy/2419/ |title=$1.3 billion for 288 jobs: The failure of government-subsidized renewable energy |publisher=Nevadabusiness.com |date=October 1, 2012 |access-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095113/http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2012/10/1-3-billion-for-288-jobs-the-failure-of-government-subsidized-renewable-energy-another-reason-why-government-shouldnt-pick-winners-and-losers-in-the-economy/2419/ |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/nevada-150/mining-and-gambling-ranching-shaped-nevada-s-culture|title=Before mining and gambling, ranching shaped Nevada's culture|first=Jennifer|last=Robison|journal=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 3, 2014|access-date=November 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107052112/http://www.reviewjournal.com/nevada-150/mining-and-gambling-ranching-shaped-nevada-s-culture|archive-date=November 7, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The economy of Nevada has long been tied to [[vice]] industries. "[Nevada was] founded on mining and refounded on sin{{snd}}beginning with prizefighting and easy divorce a century ago and later extending to gaming and prostitution", said the August 21, 2010 issue of ''The Economist''.<ref>''The Economist'', August 21, 2010, p. 35</ref>

===Mining===

In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. By value, gold is by far the most important mineral mined. In 2004, {{convert|6800000|oz}} of gold worth $2.84{{nbs}}billion were mined in Nevada, and the state accounted for 8.7% of world gold production (see ''[[Gold mining in Nevada]]''). Silver is a distant second, with {{convert|10300000|oz}} worth $69{{nbs}}million mined in 2004 (see ''[[Silver mining in Nevada]]'').<ref>Nevada Mining Association, [http://www.nevadamining.org/economics/reports/2004/2004_economic_overview.pdf ''Economic Overview of the Nevada Mining Industry 2004''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528062838/http://www.nevadamining.org/economics/reports/2004/2004_economic_overview.pdf |date=May 28, 2006 }}</ref> Other minerals mined in Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite and lithium. Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high, and output is very sensitive to world commodity prices.

===Cattle ranching===

Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada. Nevada's agricultural outputs are cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions, and potatoes. As of January 1, 2006, there were an estimated 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada.<ref>United States Department of Agriculture [http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Ag_Overview/AgOverview_NV.pdf Nevada State Agriculture Overview{{snd}}2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523232325/http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Ag_Overview/AgOverview_NV.pdf |date=May 23, 2006 }}</ref> Most of these animals forage on [[rangeland]] in the summer, with supplemental feed in the winter. Calves are generally shipped to out-of-state [[feedlot]]s in the fall to be fattened for the market. Over 90% of Nevada's {{convert|484000|acre}} of cropland is used to grow [[hay]], mostly alfalfa, for livestock feed.

===Largest employers===

The largest employers in the state, as of the first fiscal quarter of 2011, are the following, according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation:<ref>"[http://www.nevadaworkforce.com/admin/uploadedPublications/2545_State_of_Nevada.xls Nevada's Largest Employers{{snd}}Statewide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425071124/http://www.nevadaworkforce.com/admin/uploadedPublications/2545_State_of_Nevada.xls |date=April 25, 2012 }}."

[[Amtrak]]'s ''[[California Zephyr]]'' train uses the Union Pacific's original [[transcontinental railroad]] line in daily service from Chicago to [[Emeryville, California]], serving [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]], [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]], and Reno. Las Vegas has had no passenger train service since Amtrak's [[Desert Wind]] was discontinued in 1997. [[Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach]]es provide connecting service from Las Vegas to trains at [[Needles, California]], Los Angeles, and [[Bakersfield, California]]; and from [[Stateline, Nevada]], to [[Sacramento, California]]. There have been a number of proposals to re-introduce service to either [[Los Angeles]] or [[Southern California]].

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] has some railroads in the north and south of Nevada. [[Greyhound Lines]] provide some bus service to the state.

[[Interstate 15 in Nevada|Interstate 15]] (I-15) passes through the southern tip of the state, serving Las Vegas and other communities. [[Interstate 215 (Nevada)|I-215]] and [[Interstate 515|I-515]] also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area. [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|I-80]] crosses through the northern part of Nevada, roughly following the path of the Humboldt River from Utah in the east and the Truckee River westward through Reno into California. It has a spur route, [[Interstate 580 (Nevada)|I-580]]. Nevada also is served by several U.S. highways: [[U.S. Route 6 in Nevada|US{{nbs}}6]], [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|US{{nbs}}50]], [[U.S. Route 93 in Nevada|US{{nbs}}93]], [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|US{{nbs}}95]] and [[U.S. Route 395 in Nevada|US{{nbs}}395]]. There are also 189 [[List of state routes in Nevada|Nevada state routes]]. Many of Nevada's counties have a system of county routes as well, though many are not signed or paved in rural areas. Nevada is one of a few states in the U.S. that do not have a continuous [[interstate highway]] linking its two major population centers{{snd}}the road connection between the Las Vegas and Reno areas is a combination of several different Interstate and U.S. highways. The [[Interstate&nbsp;11]] proposed routing may eventually remedy this.

The state is one of just a few in the country to allow [[semi-trailer truck]]s with three trailers{{snd}}what might be called a "[[road train]]" in Australia. But American versions are usually smaller, in part because they must ascend and descend some fairly steep mountain passes.

[[RTC Transit]] is the public transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a network of bus service across the [[Las Vegas Valley]], including the use of [[The Deuce (transit bus service)|The Deuce]], [[double-decker bus]]es, on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and several outlying routes. RTC RIDE operates a system of local transit bus service throughout the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area. Other transit systems in the state include Carson City's JAC. Most other counties in the state do not have public transportation at all.

Additionally, a {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} [[monorail]] system provides public transportation in the Las Vegas area. The [[Las Vegas Monorail]] line services several casino properties and the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]] on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip, running near Paradise Road, with a possible future extension to [[McCarran International Airport]]. Several hotels also run their own monorail lines between each other, which are typically several blocks in length.

McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is the busiest airport serving Nevada. The [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]] (formerly known as the Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the state.

===Energy===

Nevada has had a thriving solar energy sector. An independent study in 2013 concluded that solar users created a $36{{nbs}million net benefit. However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission let the state's only power company, NV Energy, charge higher rates and fees to solar panel users, leading to an immediate collapse of rooftop solar panel use <ref>Hernandez, Dan.

==Law and government==
===Government===

{{Main|Government of Nevada}}
[[File:Rotary-clock.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Nevada State Legislative Building]] in Carson City]]

Under the [[Constitution of the State of Nevada]], the powers of the [[Nevada government]] are divided among three [[separation of powers|separate departments]]: the [[executive branch|executive]] consisting of the [[governor of Nevada]] and their cabinet along with the other elected constitutional officers; the [[List of U.S. state legislatures|legislative]] consisting of the [[Nevada Legislature]], which includes the [[Nevada Assembly|Assembly]] and the [[Nevada Senate|Senate]]; and the [[judicial branch|judicial]] consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Nevada]] and lower courts.

The governor is the [[chief magistrate]] of Nevada,<ref name="nvc-5-1">NV Const. art. V, § 1.</ref> the head of the executive department of the state's government,<ref name="nvc-5-1" /> and the commander-in-chief of the [[U.S. state|state]]'s [[Nevada National Guard|military forces]].<ref>NV Const. art. V, § 5.</ref> The current governor is [[Steve Sisolak]], a Democrat.

The Nevada Legislature is a [[bicameral]] body divided into an Assembly and Senate. Members of the Assembly serve two years, and members of the Senate serve four years. Both houses of the Nevada Legislature will be impacted by term limits starting in 2010, as senators and assemblymen/women will be limited to a maximum of twelve years in each house (by appointment or election which is a lifetime limit){{snd}}a provision of the constitution which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court of Nevada in a unanimous decision. Each session of the legislature meets for a constitutionally mandated 120 days in every odd-numbered year, or longer if the governor calls a special session.

On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a female majority in its legislature. Women hold nine of the 21 seats in the Nevada Senate, and 23 of the 42 seats in the Nevada Assembly.<ref>{{cite news |last=Price |first=Michelle L. |url=https://www.apnews.com/8bebc3041f564d449365feff713bf7a4 |title=Click to copyhttps://apnews.com/8bebc3041f564d449365feff713bf7a4 |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=2018-12-18 |access-date=2018-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220145235/https://apnews.com/8bebc3041f564d449365feff713bf7a4 |archive-date=December 20, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Supreme Court of Nevada is the [[state supreme court]] and the head of the [[Nevada Judiciary]]. Original jurisdiction is divided between the [[Nevada District Courts|district courts]] (with general jurisdiction), and justice courts and municipal courts (both of limited jurisdiction). Appeals from District Courts are made directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which under a deflective model of jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the [[Nevada Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] for final resolution.<ref name=NevadaJudiciary_CourtOfAppeals>{{cite web |url=http://nvcourts.gov/Supreme/Court_Information/Court_of_Appeals/ |title=Court of Appeals |website=Nevada Judiciary |access-date=August 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812211936/http://nvcourts.gov/Supreme/Court_Information/Court_of_Appeals/ |archive-date=August 12, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Incorporated town]]s in Nevada, known as cities, are given the authority to legislate anything not prohibited by law. A recent movement has begun to permit [[home rule]] to incorporate Nevada cities to give them more flexibility and fewer restrictions from the Legislature. Town Boards for [[Unincorporated towns in Nevada|unincorporated towns]] are limited local governments created by either the local county commission, or by referendum, and form a purely advisory role and in no way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them.

===Law===

[[File:Supreme Court of Nevada in Carson City.jpg|thumb|right|The courthouse of the [[Supreme Court of Nevada]]]]

In 1900, Nevada's population was the smallest of all states and was shrinking, as the difficulties of living in a "barren desert" began to outweigh the lure of silver for many early settlers. Historian [[Lawrence Friedman]] has explained what happened next:
{{blockquote|Nevada, in a burst of ingenuity, built an economy by exploiting its sovereignty. Its strategy was to legalize all sorts of things that were illegal in California{{nbs}}... after the easy divorce came easy marriage and [[casino]] gaming. Even prostitution is legal in Nevada, in any county that decides to allow it. Quite a few of them do.<ref>Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the Twentieth Century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), pp. 596–597.</ref>}}

With the advent of [[air conditioning]] for summertime use and Southern Nevada's mild winters, the fortunes of the state began to turn around, as it did for [[Arizona]], making these two states the fastest growing in the Union.

====Prostitution====

{{See also|Prostitution in Nevada}}

Nevada is the only state where [[prostitution]] is legal{{snd}}in a licensed [[brothel]] in a county which has specifically voted to permit it. It is illegal in larger jurisdictions such as [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] (which contains Las Vegas), [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] (which contains Reno), and the independent city of [[Carson City]].

====Divorce====

Nevada's early reputation as a "divorce haven" arose from the fact that before the [[no-fault divorce]] revolution in the 1970s, divorces were difficult to obtain in the United States. Already having legalized gambling and prostitution, Nevada continued the trend of boosting its profile by adopting one of the most liberal divorce statutes in the nation. This resulted in ''[[Williams v. North Carolina (1942)]]'', {{ussc|317|287|1942}}, in which the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled [[North Carolina]] had to give "[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]" to a Nevada divorce. The Court modified its decision in ''Williams v. North Carolina'' (1945), {{ussc|325|226|1945}}, by holding a state need not recognize a Nevada divorce unless one of the parties was domiciled there at the time the divorce was granted and the forum state was entitled to make its own determination.

As of 2009, Nevada's divorce rate was above the national average.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-and-west/nevadas-divorce-rate-exceeds-national-average |title=Nevada's divorce rate exceeds national average – News – ReviewJournal.com |publisher=Lvrj.com |date=August 25, 2011 |access-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524184556/http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-and-west/nevadas-divorce-rate-exceeds-national-average |archive-date=May 24, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Taxes====

Nevada's tax laws are intended to draw new residents and businesses to the state. Nevada has no [[personal income tax]] or [[corporate income tax]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/nevada|title=The Tax Foundation – Tax Research Areas > Nevada|website=Tax Foundation|access-date=September 15, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622225631/http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/nevada|archive-date=June 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Since Nevada does not collect income data it cannot share such information with the federal government, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].<ref>Nicholas Shaxson: ''Treasure Islands, Tax Havens and the Men Who Stole the World''; The Bodley Head, London, 2011</ref>

The state [[sales tax]] (similar to VAT or GST) in Nevada is variable depending upon the county. The statewide tax rate is 6.85%, with five counties (Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, and Mineral) charging this amount. Counties may impose additional rates via voter approval or through approval of the state legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax varies by county from 6.85% to 8.375% (Clark County). Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county [[option tax]]es in addition to the statewide rate: 0.25% for flood control, 0.50% for mass transit, 0.25% for infrastructure, and 0.25% for more cops. In Washoe County, which includes Reno, the sales tax rate is 7.725%, due to county option rates for flood control, the ReTRAC train trench project, and mass transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tax.state.nv.us/documents/Sales_Tax_Map.pdf |title=Sales Tax Map |access-date=May 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129083550/http://www.tax.state.nv.us/documents/Sales_Tax_Map.pdf |archive-date=January 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The minimum Nevada sales tax rate changed on July 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tax.state.nv.us/pubs.htm#Sales |title=Taxation Publications |publisher=Tax.state.nv.us |access-date=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813171855/http://tax.state.nv.us/pubs.htm#Sales |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The lodging tax rate in unincorporated Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas Strip, is 12%. Within the boundaries of the cities of Las Vegas and Henderson, the lodging tax rate is 13%.

====Gay rights====

{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Nevada}}

In 2009, the [[Nevada Legislature]] passed a bill creating a domestic partnership registry which enables gay couples to enjoy the same rights as married couples. In June 2015, gay marriage became legal in Nevada.

====Incorporation====

Nevada provides a friendly environment for the formation of corporations, and many (especially California) businesses have incorporated in Nevada to take advantage of the benefits of the Nevada statute. [[Nevada corporation]]s offer great flexibility to the Board of Directors and simplify or avoid many of the rules that are cumbersome to business managers in some other states. In addition, Nevada has no [[franchise tax]], although it does require businesses to have a license for which the business has to pay the state.

====Financial institutions====

Similarly, many U.S. states have [[usury]] laws limiting the amount of [[interest]] a lender can charge, but federal law allows corporations to 'import' these laws from their home state.

====Alcohol and other drugs====

{{See also|Alcohol laws of Nevada|Cannabis in Nevada}}

Nevada has very liberal [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] laws. Bars are permitted to remain open 24{{nbs}}hours, with no "[[Last call (bar term)|last call]]". [[Liquor store]]s, [[convenience store]]s and supermarkets may also sell alcohol 24{{nbs}}hours per day and may sell beer, wine and spirits.

In 2016, Nevada voters approved [[Nevada Question 2 (2016)|Question{{nbs}}2]], which legalized the possession, transportation and cultivation of personal use amounts of [[marijuana]] for adults age 21 years and older, and authorized the creation of a regulated market for the sale of marijuana to adults age 21 years and older through state-licensed retail outlets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Initiative to Regulate and Tax Marijuana |publisher=Nevada Secretary of State |date=April 23, 2014 |url=http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=3294 |access-date=May 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817223403/http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=3294 |archive-date=August 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nevada voters had previously approved [[medical marijuana]] in 2000, but rejected marijuana legalization in a similar referendum in 2006. Marijuana in all forms remains illegal under federal law.

Aside from cannabis legalization, non-alcohol drug laws are a notable exception to Nevada's otherwise libertarian principles. It is notable for having the harshest penalties for drug offenders in the country. Nevada remains the only state to still use [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentencing]] guidelines for possession of drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shouselaw.com/nevada/drug-possession.html|title=Las Vegas, Nevada "Possession of a Controlled Substance (Drug)" Laws|website=www.shouselaw.com|language=en|access-date=November 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127064613/https://www.shouselaw.com/nevada/drug-possession.html|archive-date=November 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Smoking====

Nevada voters enacted a smoking ban ("The Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act") in November 2006 which became effective on December 8, 2006. It outlaws smoking in most workplaces and public places. Smoking is permitted in bars, but only if the bar serves no food, or the bar is inside a larger casino. Smoking is also permitted in casinos, certain hotel rooms, tobacco shops, and brothels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20071006/NEWS/110060112 |title=State smoking ban sparks zone-change request for Gardnerville parcel Nevada Appeal serving Carson City, Nevada |publisher=Nevadaappeal.com |date=October 6, 2007 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211081512/http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20071006/NEWS/110060112 |archive-date=December 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, some businesses do not obey this law and the government tends not to enforce it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kvbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6466938 |title=Have Nevada bars given up the smoking habit? |publisher=Kvbc.com |access-date=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004116/http://www.kvbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6466938 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2011, smoking restrictions in Nevada were relaxed for certain places which allow only people 21 or older inside.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blacklobellolaw.com/tag/smoking-ban-loosened/ |title=Black & LoBello smoking ban loosened Archives " Black & LoBello |publisher=Blacklobellolaw.com |date=June 17, 2011 |access-date=July 27, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129065835/http://blacklobellolaw.com/tag/smoking-ban-loosened/ |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Crime====

In 2006, the [[crime rate]] in Nevada was about 24% higher than the national average rate, though crime has since decreased. [[Property crimes]] accounted for about 85% of the total crime rate in Nevada, which was 21% higher than the national rate. The remaining 20.3% were [[violent crime]]s.<ref name="NICIC">{{cite news|url=http://www.nicic.org/Features/StateStats/?State=NV |title=Overview of Nevada's CorrectionalSystem |date=January 4, 2009 |publisher=NICIC |access-date=January 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216065149/http://www.nicic.org/Features/StateStats/?State=NV |archive-date=February 16, 2008 }}</ref> A complete listing of crime data in the state for 2013 can be found here:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nvrepository.state.nv.us/UCR/2013CrimeInNVannualReport.pdf |title=2013 Crime In Nevada Annual Report |publisher=NV Repository |date=2013 |access-date=November 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129070517/http://nvrepository.state.nv.us/UCR/2013CrimeInNVannualReport.pdf |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. The north sees the high population south becoming more influential and perhaps commanding majority rule. The south sees the north as the "old guard" trying to rule as an [[oligarchy]]. This has fostered some resentment, however, due to a term limit amendment passed by Nevada voters in 1994, and again in 1996, some of the north's hold over key positions will soon be forfeited to the south, leaving northern Nevada with less power.

Historically, northern Nevada has been very [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. The more rural counties of the north are among the most conservative regions of the country. Carson City, the state's capital, is a Republican-leaning swing city/county. Washoe County, home to Reno, has historically been strongly Republican, but now has become more of a Democratic-leaning swing county. Clark County, home to Las Vegas, has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party since it was founded in 1909, having voted Republican only six times and once for a third-party candidate. Clark and Washoe counties have long dominated the state's politics. Between them, they cast 87 percent of Nevada's vote, and elect a substantial majority of the state legislature. The last Republican to carry Clark County was [[George H.W. Bush]] in 1988, and the last Republican to carry Washoe County was George W. Bush in 2004. The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno.

===National politics===

{{See also|United States presidential elections in Nevada}}

Nevada has voted for the winner in nearly every presidential election from 1912 to 2020, the only exceptions being [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] when it voted for [[Gerald Ford]] over [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] when the state was carried by [[Hillary Clinton]] over [[Donald Trump]]. This includes Nevada supporting Democrats John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960 and 1964, respectively. Republican Richard Nixon in 1968 and in 1972, Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980 and in 1984, Republican George H.W. Bush in 1988, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Republican [[George W. Bush]] in [[2000 US Presidential Election|2000]] and [[2004 US Presidential Election|2004]], and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] winning the state in both [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], as well as [[Joe Biden]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] election. This gives the state status as a political [[bellwether]]. From 1912 to 2020, Nevada has been carried by the presidential victor the most out of any state (27 of 29 elections). In 2016, Nevada lost its bellwether status briefly when it narrowly cast its votes for [[Hillary Clinton]]. Nevada regained it when Biden won in 2020. Nevada has been carried by the winner of every presidential election since its first in 1864, only being carried by the defeated candidate eight times since statehood. It was one of only three states won by [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[Western United States|the American West]] in the election of [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], albeit narrowly.<ref>{{cite web |author=southdem |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/09/1159666/-2012-vs-1960 |title=2012 vs 1960 |publisher=Daily Kos |date=November 9, 2012 |access-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309051908/http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/09/1159666/-2012-vs-1960 |archive-date=March 9, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>  

Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Trump in Nevada in [[2016 United States Presidential Election|2016]], winning 47.92% of votes to Trump's 45.5%.<ref>http://silverstateelection.com/USPresidential/</ref> 

The state's U.S. Senators are Democrats [[Catherine Cortez Masto]] and [[Jacky Rosen]]. The Governorship is held by [[Steve Sisolak]], a Democrat.

===Elections===

{{Main|Elections in Nevada}}

Nevada is the only U.S. state to have a [[none of the above]] option available on its ballots. Officially called [[None of These Candidates]], the option was first added to the ballot in 1975 and is used in all statewide elections, including president, US Senate and all state constitutional positions. In the event "None of These Candidates" receives a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in the election, the candidate with the next-highest total is elected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/not-fan-candidate-nevada-can-vote-none-candidates|title=Not a fan of any candidate?

==Education==

Education in Nevada is achieved through public and private [[elementary school|elementary]], [[middle school|middle]], and [[High school (North America)|high schools]], as well as colleges and universities.

A May 2015 educational reform law expanded school choice options to 450,000 Nevada students who are at up to 185% of the [[federal poverty level]]. Education savings accounts (ESAs) are enabled by the new law to help pay the tuition for private schools. Alternatively, families "can use funds in these accounts to also pay for textbooks and tutoring".<ref name=ibd20150601>{{cite news |title=School Choice: Full Education Competition Comes To Nevada |url=http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/060115-755174-nevada-leads-nation-in-educational-choice-students-benefit.htm |access-date=June 2, 2015 |work=Investors Business Daily |date=June 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715002536/http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/060115-755174-nevada-leads-nation-in-educational-choice-students-benefit.htm |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nevada – Education Savings Accounts|url=http://www.edchoice.org/School-Choice/Programs/Nevada---Education-Savings-Accounts.aspx|access-date=June 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707125934/http://www.edchoice.org/School-Choice/Programs/Nevada---Education-Savings-Accounts.aspx|archive-date=July 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Culture==
===Entertainment and tourism===

Resort areas like Las Vegas, Reno, [[Lake Tahoe]], and [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]] attract visitors from around the nation and world. In FY08 their 266 casinos (not counting ones with annual revenue under a million dollars) brought in $12{{nbs}}''billion'' in gaming revenue and another $13{{nbs}}billion in non-gaming revenue. A review of gaming statistics can be found at [[Nevada gaming area]].

Nevada has by far the most hotel rooms per capita in the United States. According to the American Hotel and Lodging Association, there were 187,301 rooms in 584 hotels (of 15 or more rooms). The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations. Nevada has one hotel room for every 14 residents, far above the national average of one hotel room per 67 residents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahla.com/content.aspx?id=27642 |title=State-by-State Fact Sheets on Lodging Industry |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502124829/http://www.ahla.com/content.aspx?id=27642 |archive-date=May 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

[[Prostitution in Nevada|Prostitution is legal in parts of Nevada]] in licensed brothels, but only counties with populations under 400,000 have the option to legalize it. Although prostitution is not a major part of the Nevada economy, employing roughly 300 women as independent contractors, it is a very visible endeavor. Of the 14 counties permitted to legalize prostitution under state law, eight have chosen to legalize brothels. State law prohibits prostitution in Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), and [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] (which contains Reno). However, prostitution is legal in Storey County, which is part of the [[Reno–Sparks metropolitan area]].

===Sports===

{{See also|Las Vegas#Sports|Sports in the Las Vegas metropolitan area|Reno, Nevada#Sports|Henderson, Nevada#Sports}}

The Las Vegas Valley is home to the [[Vegas Golden Knights]] of the [[National Hockey League]] who began to play in the [[2017–18 NHL season]] at [[T-Mobile Arena]] on the Las Vegas Strip in [[Paradise, Nevada]], the [[Las Vegas Raiders]] of the [[National Football League]] who began play at [[Allegiant Stadium]] in Las Vegas in 2020 after [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|moving from Oakland, California]], and the [[Las Vegas Aces]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] who began playing in 2018 at [[Mandalay Bay Events Center]]. The team moved from [[San Antonio]]. 

Nevada takes pride in college sports, most notably its college football. College teams in the state include the [[Nevada Wolf Pack]] (representing the University of Nevada, Reno) and the [[UNLV Rebels]] (representing the University of Nevada, Las Vegas), both in the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW).

UNLV is most remembered for [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|its men's basketball program]], which experienced its height of supremacy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Coached by [[Jerry Tarkanian]], the Runnin' Rebels became one of the most elite programs in the country. In 1990, [[1989–90 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]] won the Men's Division{{nbs}}I Championship by defeating [[1989–90 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] 103–73, which set tournament records for most points scored by a team and largest margin of victory in the national title game.

In [[1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|1991]], UNLV finished the regular season undefeated, a feat that would not be matched in Division{{nbs}}I men's basketball for [[2013–14 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|more than 20 years]]. Forward [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] won several awards, including the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith Award]]. UNLV reached the Final Four yet again, but lost their national semifinal against [[1990–91 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] 79–77. The Runnin' Rebels were the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] pre-season No.{{nbs}}1 back to back (1989–90, 1990–91). [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] is the only other team to accomplish that (2007–08, 2008–09).

The state's involvement in major-college sports is not limited to its local schools. In the 21st century, the Las Vegas area has become a significant regional center for college basketball conference tournaments. The MW, [[West Coast Conference]], and [[Western Athletic Conference]] all hold their men's and women's tournaments in the area, and the Pac-12 holds its men's tournament there as well. The [[Big Sky Conference]], after decades of holding its men's and women's conference tournaments at campus sites, began holding both tournaments in Reno in 2016.

Las Vegas has hosted several [[professional boxing]] matches, most recently at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] with bouts such as [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield]], [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II]], [[Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather]] and [[Oscar De La Hoya vs. Manny Pacquiao]] and at the newer [[T-Mobile Arena]] with [[Canelo Álvarez vs. Amir Khan]].

Along with significant rises in popularity in [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA), a number of fight leagues such as the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] have taken interest in Las Vegas as a primary event location due to the number of suitable host venues. The [[Mandalay Bay Events Center]] and [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] are among some of the more popular venues for fighting events such as MMA and have hosted several UFC and other MMA title fights. The city has held the most UFC events with 86 events.

The state is also home to the [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]], which hosts [[NASCAR]]'s [[Pennzoil 400 (Las Vegas)|Pennzoil 400]] and [[South Point 400]]. Two venues in the immediate Las Vegas area host major annual events in [[rodeo]]. The [[Thomas & Mack Center]], built for UNLV men's basketball, hosts the [[National Finals Rodeo]]. The PBR World Finals, operated by the bull riding-only [[Professional Bull Riders]], was also held at the Thomas & Mack Center before moving to T-Mobile Arena in 2016.

The state is also home to one of the most famous tennis players of all time, [[Andre Agassi]], and current baseball superstar [[Bryce Harper]].

==Military==

Several [[United States Navy]] ships have been named [[USS Nevada|USS ''Nevada'']] in honor of the state. They include:
* [[Neshaminy (screw frigate)|''Nevada'' (1865 screw frigate)]] 
* [[USS Nevada (BM-8)|USS ''Nevada'' (BM-8)]]
* [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|USS ''Nevada'' (BB-36)]]
* [[USS Nevada (SSBN-733)|USS ''Nevada'' (SSBN-733)]]

[[Area 51]] is near [[Groom Lake]], a dry salt lake bed. The much smaller [[Creech Air Force Base]] is in [[Indian Springs, Nevada]]; [[Hawthorne Army Depot]] in [[Hawthorne, Nevada|Hawthorne]]; the [[Tonopah Test Range]] near [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]]; and [[Nellis AFB]] in the northeast part of the [[Las Vegas Valley]]. [[Naval Air Station Fallon]] in [[Fallon, Nevada|Fallon]]; NSAWC, (pronounced "EN-SOCK") in western Nevada. NSAWC consolidated three Command Centers into a single Command Structure under a flag officer on July 11, 1996. The Naval Strike Warfare Center (STRIKE "U") based at NAS Fallon since 1984, was joined with the Navy Fighter Weapons School ([[TOPGUN]]) and the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapons School (TOPDOME) which both moved from NAS Miramar as a result of a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision in 1993 which transferred that installation back to the Marine Corps as MCAS Miramar. The Seahawk Weapon School was added in 1998 to provide tactical training for Navy helicopters.

These bases host a number of activities including the [[Joint Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence]], the [[Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center]], [[Nevada Test and Training Range]], [[Red Flag (USAF)|Red Flag]], the [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds]], the [[United States Air Force Warfare Center]], the [[United States Air Force Weapons School]], and the [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School]].
