In 2013, he was recalled to the Department of Asian Affairs. From 2015 to August 2019, he served as counsellor and minister counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in [[Islamabad]]. During his tenure there, he used the name “Muhammad Lijian Zhao” on his official Twitter account, but dropped “Muhammad” in 2017 after there were reports that China banned several Islamic names in Xinjiang.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taylor|first=Adam|date=July 15, 2019|title=A Chinese diplomat had a fight about race in D.C. with Susan Rice on Twitter.

Zhao became well known for his frequent use of [[Twitter]] to criticize the United States, including on topics such as race relations and the [[United States foreign policy in the Middle East]].<ref name="zhao-us">{{cite news |title=Meet The Chinese Diplomat Who Got Promoted For Trolling The US On Twitter |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bensmith/zhao-lijian-china-twitter |work=BuzzFeed News |date=2 December 2019|first=Ben|last=Smith|location=Beijing}}</ref> In July 2019, he engaged in a contentious dispute with [[Susan Rice]], a former national security advisor to President [[Barack Obama]], regarding China's [[Xinjiang re-education camps|mass internment of Uighurs]] in [[Xinjiang]].

In November 2020, [[Pope Francis]] named China's [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] minority among a list of the world's persecuted peoples. Zhao said that the Pope's words had "no factual basis".<ref>{{cite news |title=China dismisses Pope Francis's comments about persecution of Uighurs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/25/china-dismisses-pope-franciss-comments-about-persecution-of-uighurs |work=The Guardian |date=25 November 2020}}</ref>

==Statements on COVID-19==
At a March 2020 press conference, Zhao said "no conclusion has been reached yet on the origin of the virus, as relevant tracing work is still underway."<ref>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus conspiracy theory that Covid-19 originated in US spreading in China |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-start-originate-conspiracy-china-us-wuhan-cdc-robert-redfield-a9398711.html |work=The Independent |date=12 March 2020 |language=en|last=Hall|first=Louise}}</ref> On Twitter, Zhao condemned [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] for using the term "Wuhan virus", and retweeted Americans who were accusing [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] of racism and xenophobia.<ref name="Buzzfeed">{{cite news|date=13 March 2020|title=Chinese Diplomats Are Pushing Conspiracy Theories That The Coronavirus Didn't Originate In China|work=BuzzFeed News|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/chinese-diplomats-are-pushing-conspiracy-theories-that-the}}</ref>

Later in March, Zhao promoted a [[conspiracy theory]] that the United States military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China.<ref name="CNNMarch14"/> On March 12, Zhao tweeted, first in English and separately in Chinese: 
<blockquote>When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!<ref name="reuters">{{cite news |last1=Yew |first1=Lun Tian |last2=Lee |first2=Se Young |last3=Crossley |first3=Gabriel |title=China sidesteps spokesman's claim of U.S. role in coronavirus outbreak |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-usa/china-sidesteps-spokesmans-claim-of-us-role-in-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN21012U |work=Reuters |date=13 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="nytimes">{{cite news |last1=Myers |first1=Steven Lee |title=China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 March 2020}}</ref></blockquote> 

Zhao accompanied his post with a video of [[Robert R. Redfield|Robert Redfield]], director of the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], addressing a US Congressional committee on March 11.<ref name="CNNMarch14"/> Redfield had said some Americans who had seemingly died from influenza later tested positive for the new coronavirus.<ref name="reuters"/> Redfield did not say when those people had died or over what time period.<ref name="CNNMarch14"/> 

On 5 March 2020, in response to the American Fox News host's recent announcement that the Chinese should "formally apologize" for the novel coronavirus pandemic, Zhao said: The announcement is absurd and ridiculous, which fully exposes his arrogance, prejudice and ignorance of China. The statement that "China should apologize" is groundless and unreasonable. He said that the [[H1N1]] flu that broke out in the United States in 2009 spread to 214 countries and regions and caused at least 18,449 deaths that year. Has anyone asked the United States to apologize?<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1= Zhoulun |title= Official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "China's apology theory" is groundless and unreasonable|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-03/05/c_1125668486.htm |access-date=11 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812052235/http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-03/05/c_1125668486.htm| archive-date=12 August 2020}}</ref>

There’s a saying ‘black in & white out’.” to which [[Susan Rice]], National Security Adviser to Barack Obama, responded: “You are a racist disgrace.
