Her performances paid tribute to the culture of [[historically black colleges and universities]], featuring a full marching band and [[majorette]] dancers, while incorporating various aspects of [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|black Greek]] life, such as a [[step show]] along with strolling by pledges. The performances were also influenced by black feminism, sampling black authors and featuring on-stage appearances by fellow [[Destiny's Child]] members [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], her husband [[Jay-Z]], and her sister [[Solange Knowles]].

The performances were recorded and released as a [[Netflix]]-original concert film, ''[[Homecoming (2019 film)|Homecoming]]'', on April 17, 2019, accompanied by a [[Homecoming: The Live Album|live album]].<ref name="cnet">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/beyonce-just-dropped-homecoming-the-live-album-b7-timed-with-netflix-coachella-film/|title=Beyoncé just dropped ''Homecoming: The Live Album''|website=[[CNET]]}}</ref> ''Homecoming'' likewise received widespread critical acclaim and has been named as one of the greatest concert films of all time.

Playing her rescheduled dates in 2018, Beyoncé became the first black woman ever to headline the festival. In its nearly twenty years of existence, the festival has only had two other women solo headliners, [[Lady Gaga]] (who replaced Beyoncé in 2017) and [[Björk]] (2002 and 2007).<ref name="LA Times" />

Even prior to Beyoncé's performance, the nickname "Beychella" emerged for the 2018 festival.<ref name="LA Times" /> Tina Knowles-Lawson, mother of Beyoncé and [[Solange Knowles]], later said that prior to the show, she had expressed reservations about the performance Beyoncé had planned, worried that the largely white audience at Coachella might not understand  a show so steeped in black culture, particularly black college culture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/tina-knowles-lawson-beyonce-coachella|title=Tina Knowles-Lawson Was Worried the Coachella Audience Wouldn't 'Get' Beyoncé's Performance|last=Rosa|first=Christopher|date=April 17, 2018|work=Glamour|access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref> Knowles-Lawson recounted that Beyoncé replied saying that given the platform she had achieved in her career, she felt "a responsibility to do what's best for the world and not what is most popular."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/04/16/tina-lawson-beyonce-coachella-instagram|title=Tina Knowles-Lawson thought white people would be "confused" by Beyoncé's Coachella performance|last=Puckett|first=Lily|date=April 16, 2018|work=The Fader|access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

The performance received broad and overwhelming critical acclaim.
