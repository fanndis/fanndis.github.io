The '''University of Plymouth''' is a [[public university]] based predominantly in [[Plymouth]], England where the main campus is located, but the university has campuses and affiliated colleges across [[South West England]]. With {{HESA student population|INSTID=0073}} students, it is the [[List of universities in the United Kingdom by enrollment|{{HESA student population rank|INSTID=0073}} largest]] in the United Kingdom by total number of students (including the [[Open University]]). It has 2,915 staff.<ref name="HESA" />

==History==
The university was originally founded as the Plymouth School of Navigation in 1862,<ref name="University of Plymouth">{{cite web | url = http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=26069 | title = History of Higher Education in Plymouth | publisher = University of Plymouth | access-date = 17 April 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120512071915/http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=26069 | archive-date = 12 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Alston Kennerley 2001">{{cite book | isbn = 1841020699 | title = The Making of the University of Plymouth | author = Alston Kennerley | chapter = Ch. 4 Plymouth School of Navigation | year = 2001 }}</ref> before becoming a University College in 1920 and a [[polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic Institute]] in 1970,<ref name="University of Plymouth">{{cite web | url = http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=26069 | title = History of Higher Education in Plymouth | publisher = University of Plymouth | access-date = 17 April 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120512071915/http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=26069 | archive-date = 12 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> with its constituent bodies being''' '''Plymouth Polytechnic, [[Rolle College]] in [[Exmouth]], the [[Exeter College of Art and Design]] (which were, before April 1989, run by [[Devon County Council]]) and [[Seale-Hayne College]] (which before April 1989 was an independent charity). It was renamed Polytechnic South West in 1989, a move that was unpopular with students as the name lacked identity. It was the only polytechnic to be renamed and remained as 'PSW' until gaining university status in 1992 along with the other polytechnics. The new university absorbed the Plymouth School of Maritime Studies.

In 2006 part of the remains of the World War II Portland Square [[air-raid shelter]] were rediscovered on the Plymouth campus.<ref name="CyberHeritage">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberheritage.com/portland_square_air_raid_shelter/|title=Portland Square Air Raid Shelter at Plymouth|access-date=6 November 2007|publisher=CyberHeritage.com|date=8 July 2007|author=Tony Rees, Gerry Cullum and Steve & Karen Johnson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107070401/http://www.cyberheritage.com/portland_square_air_raid_shelter/|archive-date=7 November 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On the night of 22 April 1941, during [[Plymouth Blitz|the Blitz]], a bomb fell here killing over 70 civilians, including a mother and her six children.<ref name="CyberHeritage" /> The bomb blast was so violent that human remains were found in the tops of trees. Only three people escaped alive, all children.

The university's first Vice-Chancellor was John Bull. He was succeeded by [[Roland Levinsky]] until his death on 1 January 2007, when he walked into live electrical cables brought down during a storm.<ref name="RolandTragicDeath">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6224059.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Power cable kills university boss|date=2 January 2007}}</ref> He was temporarily replaced by [[Mark Cleary (professor)|Mark Cleary]] (now VC of the [[University of Bradford]]),<ref name="actingvc">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6231803.stm|publisher=BBC|title=University boss successor named|date=4 January 2007}}</ref> and then by Steve Newstead. Wendy Purcell became VC on 1 December 2007.

[[Judith Petts]], CBE, was appointed the University of Plymouth’s Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive in February 2016. She joined Plymouth from the [[University of Southampton]] where she had been Pro-Vice-Chancellor Research and Enterprise and previously the inaugural Dean of the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences (2010&ndash;13).

The university was selected by the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in October 2008 to be the home of its Centre for Statistical Education.<ref name="RSScentre">{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=24369|title=Plymouth chosen for Prestigious Centre|access-date=21 October 2008|publisher=University of Plymouth|date=17 October 2008}}</ref> It also runs courses in maritime business, marine engineering, marine biology,<ref name="PlymouthMarineBiology">{{cite web|title = Degree courses in Marine Biology|url = http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=22344|publisher = University of Plymouth|access-date = 24 June 2009}}</ref> and Earth, ocean & environmental sciences.

==Campus==
When university status was gained in 1992, the university was based in various locations. Under Vice-Chancellor Levinsky the university began a policy of centralising its campus activities in Plymouth.

The Exmouth campus – [[Rolle College]] – housed the Faculty of Education and relocated to the new Rolle Building in August 2008. The decision was unpopular with students and the town of [[Exmouth]] itself. There were several protest marches and a campaign to keep the campus open.<ref name="exmouth">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4429228.stm|work=BBC News|title=Teaching college closure agreed|date=11 November 2005}}</ref>

Completed developments include Portland Square, a library extension, refurbished and new laboratory and teaching facilities in many of the campus buildings, halls of residence near the Business School and a new £16&nbsp;million [[Peninsula Medical School]] headquarters at Derriford, in the north of the city.<ref name="medicalschool">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news/012002/06/medical_school.shtml|publisher=BBC Devon|title=Medical school plans new headquarters|date=6 January 2002}}</ref> A Marine Building has been constructed behind the Babbage Building to house [[civil engineering]], [[coastal engineering]] and [[marine science]]s.

An exception to the trend of centralising activities are the university's extensive activities in education for the health professions. In addition many of its students are taught at Further Education Colleges throughout Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, such as [[South Devon College]]. A building which opened in 2008 is shared between the Peninsula Medical School and the Faculty of Health and Human Sciences.

[[Image:Roland Levinsky building.jpg|thumb|upright|The Roland Levinsky Building]]

===Roland Levinsky building===
The Roland Levinsky Building, designed by architects [[Henning Larsen]] with [[Building Design Partnership]], is [[copper clad|clad with copper sheets]] in a seamed-cladding technique, is nine storeys high and has {{convert|13000|m2|sqft}} of floor space.<ref name="scott">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottwilson.com/projects/property/arts__media/the_roland_levinsky_building,.aspx|title=The Roland Levinsky Building, Plymouth University|work=[[Scott Wilson Group|Scott Wilson]] website|access-date=29 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421160611/http://www.scottwilson.com/projects/property/arts__media/the_roland_levinsky_building,.aspx|archive-date=21 April 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Faculty of Arts, previously based in Exmouth and Exeter moved here in August 2007. The building contains two large lecture theatres, the Jill Craigie Cinema, used by the film students to display their films and for showing of films to the public; three performance rehearsal studios; digital media suites; and a public art gallery which displays work by local artists groups, students and famous artists.

===Student accommodation===
University-managed or approved accommodation in the first year of study is guaranteed for all applicants who choose Plymouth as their first choice institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/accommodation|title=Accommodation: residence life|work=Plymouth University|access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref> The university provides an approved accommodation database, which is available to all continuing students. There are six university-managed halls: Francis Drake, Gilwell, Mary Newman, Pilgrim, Radnor and Robbins. Special accommodation arrangements can be made for students with disabilities or medical conditions.

==Organisation and administration==
Plymouth is a modern university that has undergone a great deal of development, including several new buildings.

===Faculties===
There are three faculties which each contain a number of schools.
*Arts, Humanities and Business
*Health 
*Science and Engineering

===Coat of arms===
The Arms, Crest, Badge and Supporters forming the university’s [[Coat of Arms]] were granted on 10 April 2008, in Grant 173/189, by the [[College of Arms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Newsletter/018.htm|title=FAQs: heraldry - College of Arms|access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref>

The books represent the university’s focus on learning and scholarship. The scattering of small stars, represent [[Celestial navigation|navigation]], which has played a key role in the history of the city and the university. The scallop shells in gold, represents pilgrimage, a sign of the importance of the departure of the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim Fathers]] from a site near the [[Mayflower Steps]] in the [[Barbican, Plymouth|Plymouth Barbican]] aboard the ''[[Mayflower]]'' in 1620. A Pelican and a [[Golden Hind]] support the shield and reflect both the original and later, better known, name of [[Sir Francis Drake]]’s ship. The crest contains the Latin motto, "Indagate Fingite Invenite" which translates as "Explore Dream Discover" and is a quote from [[Mark Twain]], reflecting the university's ambitions for its students and Plymouth's history of great seafarers.

The [[Letters Patent]] granting Arms to the University of Plymouth were presented by [[Eric Dancer]], [[Lord Lieutenant]] of Devon, in a ceremony on 27 November 2008, in the presence of [[Henry Paston-Bedingfeld]], [[York Herald]] of the [[College of Arms]], the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Plymouth, Judge William Taylor, the Recorder of Plymouth, and [[Judith Wilcox, Baroness Wilcox|Baroness Judith Wilcox]].<ref>http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=24787</ref>

The Coat of Arms are rarely seen in use, other than at graduation. The university uses the 'with Plymouth University' brand on stationery and signs and  keeps the Coat of Arms exclusive. The use of the arms is therefore restricted to graduations and other formal ceremonies, degree certificates and associated materials and the exclusive use by the Office of the Vice-Chancellor.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Academic profile==
[[Image:UoP PSQ.jpg|thumb|right|The Portland Square Building]]

A wide variety of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes are taught at the main city campus in Plymouth. The university scores well in law, psychology, geographical sciences, computing (including digital media) and computer science, fine art and art history.<ref name="subjectscores">{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=1060|title=University of Plymouth – an introduction|access-date=21 October 2008|publisher=University of Plymouth}}</ref> Key developments include: the creation of a new Business School; bringing together complementary subjects in a new combined faculty of Science and Engineering; and creating the largest Marine Science and Engineering School in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Faculty of Arts and Humanities===
This faculty is host to the School of Art, Design and Architecture, the School of Humanities and Performing Arts, and the Plymouth Institute of Education. Arts subjects are usually taught in the Roland Levinsky building and the Scott building, a 19th-century building located next to Roland Levinsky which was modernised externally in 2008 to keep to the university's current design. The faculty offers degrees in Architecture, English, History, Art History, 3D Design, Fine Art, Music, Photography, Media Arts, Theatre & Performance and Dance Theatre. Postgraduate research degree supervision is available across the disciplines in all three Schools, with specific expertise in artistic research.

===Faculty of Health===
Home to the Schools of Psychology, Social Science and Social Work, Health Professions, and Nursing and Midwifery. As well as [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] programmes, the Faculty offers degrees Adult Nursing, Child Health Nursing, Mental Health Nursing, Midwifery, Dietetics, Optometry, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy and Paramedicine.

===Faculty of Science and Engineering===
This faculty is home to the School of Biological and Marine Sciences, the School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics, the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Studies, and the School of  Engineering.

The university provides professional diving qualifications on a number of its courses, the only university in the country to do so. The university's diving centre is located within its Marine Station teaching and research facility based next to Queen Anne's Battery Marina, and has a full-time team of instructors and dedicated boats and equipment.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In October 2005, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper voted the university as having the most bizarre degree course in the country, the BSc (Hons) in Surf Science & Technology. Commonly known as "[[surfing]]", this course is actually centred on coastal/ocean sciences, surfing equipment/clothing design and surfing-related business, which has its popularity increased by the geographical location of the university.

===Faculty of Business===
The faculty is home to the Plymouth Business School, the School of Law, Criminology and Government, the Plymouth Graduate School of Management and the School of Tourism and Hospitality. Plymouth's Business School has most notably been very successful in national rankings by subject, where subjects like economics have ranked 16th, according to The Guardian.<ref name="GuardianEconomicsTable2013">{{cite news|title = University guide 2013: league table for economics|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2012/may/22/university-guide-economics|newspaper = The Guardian|access-date = 11 March 2018}}</ref> Plymouth Graduate School of Management also offers [[Maritime Studies]] through the B.Sc. (Hons) Maritime Business and Maritime Law and the M.Sc. in International Shipping.

The university has strong links with the cruising industry, offering courses in the Maritime and Cruising sector. The school offers BSc (Hons) in Cruise Management, where students can opt to take a year out to work with [[P&O Cruises|P&O]] or [[Princess Cruises]] for a period of two, four-month periods.<ref name="PlymouthCruiseManagement">{{cite web|title = BSc (Hons) Cruise Management|url = http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/course.asp?id=3697|publisher = University of Plymouth|access-date = 24 June 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry===
Medicine and Dentistry were first established as part of the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry in 2000, which operated as a partnership between Plymouth University and the [[University of Exeter]].<ref name="PMSAbout">{{cite web|title = Peninsula College of Medicine & Dentistry|url = http://www.pms.ac.uk/pms/|publisher = Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry|access-date = 24 June 2009|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://archive.is/20050312010438/http://www.pms.ac.uk/pms/|archive-date = 12 March 2005|df = dmy-all}}</ref> In January 2012 the two founding members of the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry (PCMD) the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, outlined their plans to expand independently and grow the success of the now nationally recognised professional health education provider. These changes came into effect from the start of the 2013 academic year. PUPSMD consists of the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, and the School of Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences.

===Academic Partnerships===
The Academic Partnerships network is a collaboration between the university and local colleges across the South West and South of the country, from Penzance to Jersey. There are hundreds of higher education courses available providing opportunities for progression to other qualifications. For example, someone who has spent two years studying for a foundation degree at their local college – and who has successfully passed their exams – can move on to the final year of a full honours degree at the university.

==Governance Issues==
In 2014 a clash of personalities at the top of the University led to the then vice-chancellor Wendy Purcell being suspended. 
Part of the dispute was over the commissioning of ceremonial chairs at a cost of £95,000 without the board's approval.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2020-07-06|title=Wendy Purcell ‘did not seek board approval’ for chairs|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/wendy-purcell-did-not-seek-board-approval-for-chairs/2015861.article|date=22 September 2014|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref> A linked case saw the chair of the board of governors, which had suspended Purcell, [[William Taylor (judge)|William Taylor]] investigated of sexual harassment of female staff.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2020-07-06|title=Concerns about Plymouth University chairman predate current crisis|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/concerns-about-plymouth-university-chairman-predate-current-crisis/2015437.article|date=28 August 2014|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref> Purcell was later appointed to a newly created role of president with compensation of £125,000 for loss of office and maintaining her salary of £250,000.<ref>{{cite news|access-date=2020-07-06|title=University boss given £125k pay-off|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-35505076|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 February 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=2020-07-06|title=Wendy Purcell is still paid top salary|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/wendy-purcell-is-still-paid-top-salary/2019425.article|date=2 April 2015|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref>
