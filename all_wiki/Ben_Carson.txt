In the summers following his high school graduation until his second year in medical school, Carson worked at a variety of jobs: as a clerk in the payroll office of [[Ford Motor Company]], supervisor of a six-person crew picking up trash along the highway under a federal jobs program for inner-city students, a clerk in the mailroom of [[Young & Rubicam|Young & Rubicam Advertising]], assembling fender parts and inspecting back window louvers on the assembly line at [[Chrysler]], a crane operator at Sennett Steel, and finally a radiology technician taking X-rays.<ref name="Carson 1990, 2011 pp82–90, 104–107">{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Ben|last2=Murphey|first2=Cecil|year=2011|origyear=1990|title=Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, 20th Anniversary edition|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|publisher=Zondervan|pages=[https://archive.org/details/giftedhands00benj/page/82 82–90, 104–07]|isbn=978-0-310-54650-4|url=https://archive.org/details/giftedhands00benj/page/82}}</ref> At Yale, Carson had a part-time job on campus as a student police aide.<ref name="Carson 2016 pp21–22">{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Candy|year=2016|title=A Doctor in the House: My Life with Ben Carson|location=New York|publisher=Sentinel|pages=21–22|isbn=978-1-59523-124-6}}</ref>

In his autobiography, ''Gifted Hands'', Carson recounted that exams for a Yale psychology course he took his junior year, "Perceptions 301", were inexplicably burned, forcing students to retake the exam. Carson said other students walked out in protest when they discovered the retest was significantly harder than the original examination, but he alone finished the test. On doing so, Carson said he was congratulated by the course instructor who told him the retest was a hoax intended to find "the most honest student in the class". Carson said the professor awarded him $10 and that a photographer for the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' was present to take his picture, which appeared in the student newspaper with a story about the experiment. Doubts were raised about this story in 2015 during Carson's presidential campaign. ''The Wall Street Journal'' attempted to verify Carson's account, reporting that Yale undergraduate courses were identified with only two digits in the early 1970s, that Yale had offered no course called "Perceptions 301" at the time, and that Carson's photo had never appeared in the ''Yale Daily News''.<ref name="WSJ deeper questions" /> Carson, while acknowledging the class number was not correct, said: "You know, when you write a book with a co-writer and you say that there was a class, a lot of [the] time they'll put a number or something just to give it more meat. You know, obviously, decades later, I'm not going to remember the course number."<ref name="abcn_'Thi">{{Cite news | title = 'This Week' Transcript: Ben Carson and Donald Trump | publisher = ABC News | date = November 8, 2015 | accessdate = November 9, 2015 | url = https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-ben-carson/story?id=35044135 }}</ref>

=== Medical school ===
Carson entered the [[University of Michigan Health System|University of Michigan Medical School]] in 1973, and at first he struggled academically, doing so poorly on his first set of comprehensive exams that his faculty adviser recommended he drop out of medical school or take a reduced academic load and take longer to finish.<ref name="Carson 2008 p94">{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Ben|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregg|date=2008|title=Take the Risk: Learning to Identify, Choose, and Live with Acceptable Risk|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|publisher=Zondervan|page=[https://archive.org/details/takerisklearning00cars/page/94 94]|isbn=978-0-310-25973-2|url=https://archive.org/details/takerisklearning00cars/page/94}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Benjamin S.

In 2014, some [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] (who later formed the House [[Freedom Caucus]]) approached Carson about the possibility of his standing for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in the event that the incumbent Speaker, [[John Boehner]], had to step down due to intra-party disunion.

=== Background and increasing political visibility ===
Carson, who had been registered as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], changed his registration to [[Independent politician|independent]] in the 1990s after watching Republicans [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeach President Clinton]] for perjury regarding an [[Lewinsky scandal|extramarital affair]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]]. "I just saw so much hypocrisy in both parties," he said.<ref name="Switches">{{cite web|last1=Solomon|first1=John|title=Ben Carson officially switches political parties, rejoins GOP|url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/4/ben-carson-officially-switches-parties-returns-gop/ |website=The Washington Times|date=November 4, 2014 |accessdate= November 5, 2014}}</ref> In February 2013, Carson said he was not a member of any [[political party]].<ref name=NR>{{cite news |url= http://www.nationalreview.com/article/340769/dr-carsons-prescription-john-fund |last=Fund|first=John|title= Dr. Carson's Prescription|work=National Review|date=February 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref>

In his book ''America the Beautiful'' (2013), he wrote: "I believe it is a very good idea for physicians, scientists, engineers, and others trained to make decisions based on facts and empirical data to get involved in the political arena."<ref>{{cite book |title= America the Beautiful|url= https://archive.org/details/americabeautiful0000cars|url-access= registration|publisher=Zondervan|page=[https://archive.org/details/americabeautiful0000cars/page/34 34]|first1=Benjamin |last1=Carson, M.D.|first2=Candy |last2= Carson |isbn=978-0-310-33091-2|date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=America the Beautiful |url=https://archive.org/details/americabeautiful0000cars |url-access=registration |publisher= Zondervan |page= [https://archive.org/details/americabeautiful0000cars/page/35 35]|first1=Benjamin |last1=Carson, M.D.|first2=Candy |last2=Carson|isbn= 978-0-310-33091-2|date= 2013}}</ref>

Carson was the keynote speaker at the [[National Prayer Breakfast]] on February 7, 2013.<ref>{{cite news |title=Zondervan Author Ben Carson Gives Keynote at 2013 National Prayer Breakfast|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zondervan-author-ben-carson-gives-keynote-at-2013-national-prayer-breakfast-190221831.html| agency= PR Newswire|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> The speech garnered Carson considerable attention because the event is normally apolitical in nature, and the speech was critical of the philosophy and policies of President [[Barack Obama]], who was sitting 10 feet away.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lindsay|first1=James|title=Ben Carson: All You Need to Know|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ben-carson-all-you-need-know-328547|accessdate=June 17, 2015|work=Newsweek|date=May 5, 2015}}</ref> About the speech, Carson said: "I don't think it was particularly political{{nbsp}}...

Carson's sudden popularity among conservatives led to his being invited as a featured speaker at the 2013 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC). He tied for seventh place in the ''[[The Washington Times|Washington Times]]''/CPAC 2013 [[Straw Poll]] with 4% of the 3,000 ballots cast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2013/feb/27/yes-ben-carson-will-speak-cpac/ |title=Dr. Ben Carson will speak at CPAC after stealing spotlight from President Obama | last=Harper|first=Jennifer|work =The Washington Times |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kilar |first=Steve |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-carson-at-cpac-20130316,0,7951595.story |title=Dr. Ben Carson announces his retirement, hints at political future |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=March 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref> In the 2014 CPAC straw poll, he was in third place with 9% of the vote, behind [[United States Senate|senators]] [[Ted Cruz]] of [[Texas]] (with 11%) and [[Rand Paul]] of [[Kentucky]] (31%).<ref>{{cite news |title=Rand Paul wins 2014 CPAC straw poll |first=Stephen |last=Dinan |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/8/rand-paul-wins-2014-cpac-straw-poll-ted-cruz-finis/ | work =The Washington Times |date=March 8, 2014 |accessdate= March 8, 2014}}</ref> In the presidential straw poll at the 2013 [[Values Voter Summit]], he and [[Rick Santorum]] polled 13%, with winner Ted Cruz polling 42%, and in 2014 he polled 20% to Cruz's winning 25%.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/12/cruz-wins-religious-conservatives-2016-straw-poll |title= Cruz wins Values Voter Summit's 2016 straw poll| publisher=Fox News Channel|date=October 12, 2013| accessdate= January 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/219099-cruz-wins-value-voters-straw-poll |title =Cruz clinches straw poll gold again| first=Julian|last= Hattem | work=The Hill|date=September 27, 2014|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>

In January 2015, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' reported that the Draft Carson Committee had raised $13 million by the end of 2014, shortly after Carson performed well in a [[CNN]]/ORC poll of potential candidates in December 2014, coming second in two different versions.

=== Surge in polls ===
[[File:Ben Carson by Gage Skidmore 9.jpg|thumb|Carson at a rally in August 2015]]

In October 2015, the [[Super PAC]] supporting Carson, The 2016 Committee (formerly the Draft Carson Committee), announced it had received donations in mostly $100 increments from more than 200 small businesses around the country over the course of one week. ''[[Fox Business]]'' reported that "Carson's outsider status is growing his small business support base." Ben Walters, a fundraiser for The 2016 Committee, expressed optimism about Carson's small business support base: "It's unbelievable the diversity of businesses that we are bringing on. We are seeing everything from doctors' offices and folks in the healthcare profession to motorcycle repair shops and bed and breakfasts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2015/10/19/small-business-donations-bulls-eye-for-ben-carson-super-pac.html|publisher=Fox Business|title=Small Business Donations a Bull's-Eye for Ben Carson Super PAC|date=October 2015}}</ref>

In October, it was noted that Carson's "improbable" political career had surged in polls and fundraising, while he continued to participate in [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2016|nationally televised Republican debates]].<ref>{{cite news|authors=Lightman, David & Clark, Lesley|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/gop-race-gets-jolt-of-diversity-with-ben-carson-carly-fiorina/ |title=GOP race gets jolt of diversity with Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=May 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Lightman, David|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article41225289.html |title=Ben Carson soaring as GOP heads into new debates|work=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]]|date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

The campaign brought considerable attention to Carson's past. [[CBS News]] described Carson's narrative of "overcoming impossible odds as a child growing up in an impoverished, single-parent household to reach international prominence as a pediatric neurosurgeon" as "a key part of his presidential campaign".<ref>{{cite web|title=New questions emerge over Carson's personal history|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ben-carson-new-questions-personal-history/|publisher=CBS news|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said the narrative came under "the harsh scrutiny of presidential politics, where rivals and media hunt for embellishments and omissions that can hobble a campaign".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ben Carson's Past Faces Deeper Questions|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ben-carsons-past-faces-deeper-questions-1446861864|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> CNN characterized the core narrative as "acts of violence as an angry young man", followed by a spiritual epiphany that transformed Carson into the "composed figure" he now portrays.<ref name="tale of two" /> Media challenges to a number of Carson's statements included allegations of discrepancies between documented facts and certain assertions in his autobiography ''Gifted Hands''—allegations dismissed by Carson as a media "witch hunt".<ref name="witch hunt">{{cite web| title =Carson says West Point story, others about his past are bias, and amount to a 'witch hunt.'| publisher =[[Fox News Channel]]| date =November 7, 2015| url =http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/07/carson-defends-west-point-claim-and-criticizes-media-attention-on-issue/| accessdate =November 7, 2015| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151107140551/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/07/carson-defends-west-point-claim-and-criticizes-media-attention-on-issue/| archive-date =November 7, 2015| url-status =dead| df =mdy-all}}</ref> In November 2015, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' republished an article from 1988 "to try to bring some clarity to the claims currently being brought into question".<ref name="88freepress">{{cite web| title =88 Free Press article helps clarify Ben Carson claims| work =[[Detroit Free Press]]| date =November 11, 2015| url =http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/11/88-free-press-article-helps-clarify-ben-carson-claims/75584922/ | accessdate =November 12, 2015}}</ref>

In November 2015, Carson's campaign aired a 60-second TV advertisement in which excerpts from Carson's stump speech were intercut with a rap by an artist named Aspiring Mogul.<ref name=RapAd>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben-carson-rap-ad-215550|publisher=Politico.com|title=Ben Carson's Rap Ad|date=November 2015}}</ref> They spent $150,000 on the ads, which were aired in Atlanta, Detroit and Miami.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/05/ben-carson-releases-rap-ad-on-the-radio/|title=Ben Carson Releases Rap Ad on the Radio|last=Parker|first=Ashley|date=November 5, 2015|website=The New York Times – First Draft|access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Carson defended the ad, saying "Well, there are people in the campaign who felt that was a good way to do things{{nbsp}}...

Statements that Carson made regarding foreign policy called into doubt his familiarity with the domain. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2015, "Carson has acknowledged being something of a novice on foreign affairs." Regarding the [[Ukrainian crisis]], Carson would send arms to Ukraine to aid it in its fight against pro-Russian rebels. He also believes the [[Baltic states]] should "get involved in NATO" (apparently unaware they are NATO members).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mullany|first1=Gerry|title=Ben Carson on the Issues|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/us/politics/ben-carson-on-the-issues.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>

In a November 2015 Republican debate, Carson declared his intentions to make [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] "look like losers" as he would "destroy their caliphate". Carson also advocated capturing a "big energy field" outside of [[Anbar (town)|Anbar]], [[Iraq]], which he said could be accomplished "fairly easily". Regarding the [[Middle East]], he also claimed that "the Chinese are there", while in contrast, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that "there are no known members of the Chinese armed forces currently engaged in any conflict in the Middle East."<ref name=ISlosers>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ben|title=Ben Carson: I will make Isis 'look like losers' if elected president|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/ben-carson-republican-debate-isis-losers|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>

Carson said he is not opposed to a [[Palestinian state]], but he questioned why it needs "to be within the confines of Israeli territory [...] Is that necessary, or can you sort of slip that area down into Egypt?"<ref name="BG.greatest-hits">{{cite web|title=Ben Carson's greatest hits|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/11/10/ben-carson-greatest-hits/SaqH3vxmJpxPpxNuk38SaI/story.html|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref>

On March 6, his first day as secretary, while addressing Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employees, Carson saluted the work ethic of immigrants, and during his comments, he likened [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] to involuntary immigrants.

In keeping with his Seventh-day Adventist faith, Carson announced in 2014 his belief "that the United States will play a big role" in the coming apocalypse.

Carson has stated that he does not believe in hell as understood by some Christians: "You know, I see God as a very loving individual. And why would he torment somebody forever who only had a life of 60 or 70 or 80 years? Even if they were evil. Even if they were only evil for 80 years?"
