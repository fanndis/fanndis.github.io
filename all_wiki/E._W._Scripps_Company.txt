The '''E. W. Scripps Company''' is an American [[broadcasting]] company founded in 1878 as a chain of daily newspapers by [[E. W. Scripps|Edward Willis "E. W." Scripps]]. It was also formerly a media conglomerate. The company is headquartered inside the [[Scripps Center]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SSP:US/profile |title=SSP Profile & Executives – EW Scripps Co – Bloomberg|work=bloomberg.com|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> Its corporate motto is "Give light and the people will find their own way", which is symbolized by the media empire's longtime lighthouse logo.<ref name="CityBeat Osborne">{{cite news|url=http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-2261-cover-story-the-light-dims.html|title=Cover Story: The Light Dims|last=Osborne|first=Kevin|date=February 21, 2007|work=[[Cincinnati CityBeat]]|accessdate=2011-08-28|publisher=Lightborne Publishing|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|quote=The corporate motto for Cincinnati-based media chain E.W.

In terms of market reach, Scripps is the second largest operator of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] by way of its [[Walt Disney Television]] subsidiary) affiliates, behind the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], and ahead of [[Hearst Television]] and [[Tegna Inc.|Tegna]].

==History==
=== 19th century ===
The E. W. Scripps Company was a newspaper company founded on November 2, 1878, when [[E. W. Scripps|Edward Willis Scripps]] published the first issue of the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] ''[[Cleveland Press|Penny Press]]''.<ref name="official">{{cite web|title=History - Scripps|publisher=E.W. Scripps Company|url=https://scripps.com/company/history/|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>

In 1894, Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the '''Scripps-McRae League''' to reflect the leadership of ''[[The Cincinnati Post|Cincinnati Post]]'' general manager [[Milton A. McRae]], a longtime partner.{{sfn|McRae|1924|p=119}}{{sfn|Scripps|1926|p=190}} The company expanded during the decade to publish newspapers in California, Denver, Chicago, Dallas and Nashville and elsewhere.<ref name="official"/>

=== 20th century ===

In early November 1922, the Scripps-McRae League was renamed '''Scripps-Howard Newspapers''' to recognize company executive [[Roy W. Howard]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Syndicate Changes Name|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 4, 1922|page=28|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13484985/}}</ref> On November 23, the '''E. W. Scripps Company''' was incorporated and placed in trust for Scripps' children and grandchildren.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web|title=Scripps Timeline|publisher=E. W. Scripps Company|date=November 29, 1921|accessdate=December 30, 2014|url=http://www.scripps.com/scripps-timeline|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218090142/http://www.scripps.com/scripps-timeline|archive-date=December 18, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. (A number of media companies, including the [[New York Times Company]] and the [[Graham Holdings|Washington Post]] organization, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.<ref name="Trust" />) [[E. W. Scripps]] died in 1926.

On June 2, 1902, Scripps founded the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA), based in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], as a news report service for different Scripps-owned newspapers. It started selling content to non-Scripps owned newspapers in 1907, and by 1909, it became a more general [[Print syndication|syndicate]], offering comics, pictures and features as well. It moved from Cleveland to Chicago in 1915, with an office in San Francisco. NEA rapidly grew and delivered content to 400 newspapers in 1920 and about 700 in 1930.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Monmonier |first1=Mark S. |title=Maps with the news: the development of American journalistic cartography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx8XR_6IMeAC&q=%22Newspaper+Enterprise+Association%22&pg=PA82 |accessdate=August 28, 2009 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-53411-4 |pages=80–83}}</ref> Today, it is oldest syndicate still in operation.

Scripps created the [[United Press]] [[news agency]] in 1907 by uniting three smaller syndicates and controlled it until a 1958 merger with [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s smaller competing agency, INS, to form United Press International. With the [[Hearst Corporation]] as a minority partner, UPI continued under Scripps management until it was sold off in 1982.<ref name="deadline">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/deadlineeverymin013289mbp | title = Deadline Every Minute The Story of the United Press - ARCHIVE.ORG ONLINE VERSION | year = 1957|author= Joe Alex Morris | publisher = Doubleday & Company }}</ref><ref name="scrippshoward">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=334|work=Ohio History Central|title=Scripps-Howard| publisher=ohiohistory.com }}</ref><ref name="100years">{{cite web|url=http://100years.upi.com/sta_1907-07-15.html|title=UPI History | agency=United Press International }}</ref><ref name="in sorrow">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/24/books/upi-look-back-in-sorrow.html|title=U.P.I.: Look Back in Sorrow (book review of ''Down to the Wire: UPI's Fight for Survival'' By Gregory Gordon and Ronald E.

[[United Feature Syndicate]] was formed in 1919 as a division of UP to distribute editorial columns, features and comic strips, and became a dominant player in the syndication market in the fall of 1931 thanks to Scripps' acquisition of the ''[[New York World]]'', which controlled the [[Joseph Pulitzer|Pulitzer]] company's syndication arms, [[Press Publishing Co.]] and [[World Feature Service]].<ref name=Booker>Booker, M.

The company expanded its newspaper holdings throughout the pre-World War II period, acquiring many titles and merging them, including the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' and ''[[Knoxville News-Sentinel]]''. A trickle of closures and sales occurred over the next few decades. In 1966, Scripps' ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' was merged into the ''[[New York World Journal Tribune]]'', which closed in 1967. Papers in Indianapolis, Washington, Houston and Fort Worth were closed in the 1960s and 1970s, and the former flagship ''Cleveland Press'' was sold in 1980. Scripps also closed properties in Memphis, Columbus, Thousand Oaks and El Paso throughout the 1980s and 1990s, while selling the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' in 1992. 

In 1997, Scripps bought daily newspapers in the Texas cities of [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], [[Wichita Falls]], [[San Angelo]] and [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], plus the paper in [[Anderson, S.C.]] from [[Harte Hanks|Harte-Hanks Communications]], along with 25 non-daily newspapers and [[San Antonio]]-based [[KENS|KENS-TV]] and [[KRDY|KENS-AM]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-20/business/fi-60697_1_e-w-scripps |title=Scripps to Acquire Harte-Hanks Outlets – Los Angeles Times |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]] |date=May 20, 1997 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kenneth N.

Scripps made its first foray into broadcasting in 1935, forming a company called '''Continental Radio''' and buying radio stations [[WDBZ|WCPO]] in Cincinnati and [[WNML (AM)|WNOX]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. After the war, In 1947, Scripps opened its first [[television station]], Cleveland-based [[WEWS-TV]], with Memphis-based [[WMC-TV]] and Cincinnati-based [[WCPO-TV]] in subsequent years.<ref name="official"/>  It now owns dozens of TV and radio stations. In the 1980s and 1990s, Scripps became a [[cable television]] provider and also developed programming for cable, notably [[regional sports network|regional sports programming]] like the SportSouth Network in 1990, [[Food Network]] in 1993 and [[HGTV]] in 1994. (Scripps spun off its cable properties into [[Scripps Network Interactive]] in 2008.)

=== 21st century ===
In October 2007, Scripps announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and [[Scripps Networks Interactive]] ([[HGTV]], [[Food Network]], [[DIY Network]], [[Cooking Channel]] (formerly known as [[Fine Living Network|Fine Living]]), [[Travel Channel]] and [[Great American Country]]). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.

After a test launch at [[WFTS-TV]] in 2009, Scripps television stations launched [[YouTube]] channels in 2010. These are similar to YouTube channels operated by [[Hearst Television]] and [[LIN Media|LIN Television]].

On February 24, 2011, United Media struck a distribution deal with Universal Uclick (now known as [[Andrews McMeel Syndication]]) for syndication of the company's 150 comic strip and news features, which became effective on June 1 of that year.<ref name=PRNewswire>{{cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-uclick-to-provide-syndicate-services-for-united-media-116811443.html|title=Universal Uclick to Provide Syndicate Services for United Media|publisher=PR Newswire|author=The E.W.

On September 12, 2011, Scripps partnered with [[Cox Media Group]] and [[Raycom Media]] to launch ''[[Right This Minute]]'', a viral video program. On the same day, Scripps launched ''The List'', a news magazine. Both were part of an approach for "homegrown" programming—programming created by Scripps. Raycom also launched ''[[America Now]]'' on the same day. The creator of ''RTM'' and ''The List'' applied this "homegrown" programming approach to Tegna in 2015, with the launch of ''[[T.D. Jakes]]''. Scripps launched ''[[Let's Ask America]]'' in 2013 (now cancelled), partnering with [[Telepictures]] to do so, and ''Pickler and Ben'' in 2017.

===Syndicates===
* [[United Media]] (1978–2011), composed of:
** [[United Feature Syndicate]] (est. 1919) – syndicated many notable [[comic strips]], including ''[[Peanuts (comic strip)|Peanuts]]'', ''[[Garfield]]'', ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', ''[[Dilbert]]'', ''[[Nancy (comic strip)|Nancy]]'' and ''[[Marmaduke]]''
** [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (est. 1902) – originally a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate; best known for syndicating ''[[Alley Oop]]'', ''[[Freckles and His Friends]]'', ''[[The Born Loser]]'' and ''[[Frank and Ernest (comic strip)|Frank and Ernest]]'', in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2007/12/santas-secrets-day-5.html|title=Stripper's Guide: Santa's Secrets, Day 5|website=Strippersguide.blogspot.com |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media were outsourced to [[Universal Uclick]] in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.<ref name="PRNewswire" /><ref name="EditorandPublisher" />

Scripps also operated [[United Press International]] ('''United Press''' from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]]'s [[International News Service]]) until selling it off in 1982.

==Broadcasting==
Scripps' broadcast television stations division—also commonly known as '''Scripps Media''' or '''Scripps Howard Broadcasting''', currently owns or operates 62 television stations in forty-three markets, with full-power and low-power stations as well as rebroadcaster, translator, repeater and satellite stations included. Among them, nineteen [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliates, twelve [[CBS]] affiliates, eleven [[NBC]] affiliates, six [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates, five [[The CW|CW]] affiliates, two [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliates, and one station independent of any network affiliation. Its portfolio is the most diverse in the industry—in terms of market sizes, from [[New York City]] to [[Helena, Montana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/2019-20-dma-ranker.pdf|title=2019-2020 LOCAL TELEVISION MARKET UNIVERSE ESTIMATES|website=Nielsen|date=September 28, 2019|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref>

Scripps also previously owned the [[Shop at Home Network]] from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.

In October 1995, [[Comcast]] announced the purchase of Scripps' cable provider operation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/30/business/comcast-to-buy-cable-division-from-scripps.html|title=Comcast to Buy Cable Division From Scripps|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|first=Geraldine|last=Fabrikant|date=October 30, 1995|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}</ref>

From 1990 to 1995, Scripps was a partner in the [[regional sports network]] SportSouth, along with [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]] and [[Tele-Communications, Inc.]]; in 1996 the network was sold to News Corporation and became [[Fox Sports South]].

Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors [[QVC]] and [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]]. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.<ref>{{cite press release |title       = Scripps ceasing Shop at Home operations |publisher   = E.

On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its [[Shop at Home]] TV stations to New York City-based [[Multicultural Broadcasting|Multicultural Television]] for $170 million.<ref>{{cite press release |title       = Scripps sells Shop at Home TV stations |publisher   = E.

On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by [[S&P Global|The McGraw-Hill Companies]] for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/10/03/54440/mcgrawhill-sells-tv-group-to-scripps|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121210175847/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/10/03/54440/mcgrawhill-sells-tv-group-to-scripps|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 10, 2012|title=McGraw-Hill Sells TV Group To Scripps|website=TVNewsCheck|date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> This deal was approved by the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] on October 31<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/475979-FTC_OK_With_Scripps_McGraw_Hill.php|title=FTC OK With Scripps/McGraw-Hill|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}</ref> and the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] on November 29.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/11/29/55706/scripps-purchase-of-mcgrawhill-tvs-okd|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205045133/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/11/29/55706/scripps-purchase-of-mcgrawhill-tvs-okd|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 5, 2013|title=Scripps Purchase of McGraw-Hill TVs OK'd|website=TVNewsCheck|date=November 29, 2011}}</ref> The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.<ref name=tvnc-mghbuycomplete>{{cite news|title=Scripps completes McGraw-Hill Stations Buy|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/12/30/56389/scripps-completes-mcgrawhill-stations-buy|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913093625/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/12/30/56389/scripps-completes-mcgrawhill-stations-buy|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 13, 2012|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=December 30, 2011}}</ref>

On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] ABC affiliate [[WKBW-TV]] and Detroit [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WMYD]] for $110 million.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/73998/scripps-buying-granite-tvs-in-buffalo-detroit Scripps Buying Granite TVs in Buffalo, Detroit], ''TVNewsCheck'', Retrieved February 10, 2014</ref> The sale was approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate [[WXYZ-TV]].

On January 25, 2018, it was announced that Scripps had placed its radio station unit for sale. The divestiture of these stations – which were acquired through the company's 2015 acquisition of Journal Communications – would result in the separation of Scripps's television stations in Tulsa, Omaha, Milwaukee, Boise and Tucson from their co-owned radio clusters (in the case of Tulsa, [[KJRH-TV]] would be separated from [[KFAQ]] for the second time; the two stations, then using the shared KVOO callsign, were first split up in 1970, when Central Plains Enterprises sold the then-KVOO-TV to Scripps).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/173462/scripps-to-sell-its-radio-stations|title=Scripps To Sell Its Radio Stations|work=All Access|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}</ref> In June 2018, [[Griffin Communications]] reached a deal to buy the Scripps Tulsa radio cluster. The sale was completed on July 28, 2018. In July 2018, [[Good Karma Brands]] reached a deal to buy the Scripps Milwaukee radio cluster. The sale was completed on November 1, 2018.

On August 20, 2018, Scripps agreed to purchase ABC affiliates [[KXXV]] in [[Waco, Texas]] and satellite station KRHD-CD in [[Bryan, Texas]] and [[WTXL-TV]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], which are being spun off from the [[Gray Television]]-[[Raycom Media]] merger in order to alleviate ownership conflicts involving Gray's ownership of CBS affiliate [[KWTX-TV]] and its semi-satellite [[KBTX-TV]] in the Waco market and CBS affiliate [[WCTV]] and [[Retro Television Network]] affiliate [[WFXU]] in the Tallahassee market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tegna, Scripps in Deals to Buy Network Affiliates|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/tegna-scripps-in-deals-to-buy-network-affiliates|author=Jon Lafayette|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=August 20, 2018|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gray Spins Land With Lockwood, TEGNA, Scripps|url=https://www.rbr.com/gray-spins-land-with-lockwood-tegna-scripps/|author=Adam Jacobson|website=Radio-Television Business Report|publisher=Streamline-RBR, Inc.|date=August 20, 2018|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref>

On October 29, 2018, [[Cordillera Communications]] announced that it would sell all but one of its television stations to Scripps. [[KVOA]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] is not included in the deal as Scripps already owns [[KGUN-TV]] and [[KWBA]] in that market, and Cordillera will concurrently sell KVOA to [[Quincy Media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quincymediacareers.com/quincy-media-news/2018/10/29/quincy-media-inc-to-acquire-kvoa-tv/|title=Quincy Media, Inc. to acquire KVOA-TV|date=October 29, 2018|publisher=[[Quincy Media]]|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> The FCC approved the sale on April 5, 2019,<ref>[https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fcc-oks-scripps-purchase-of-cordillera-stations FCC OKs Scripps Purchase of Cordillera Stations], [[Broadcasting & Cable]], 5 April 2019, Retrieved 5 April 2019.</ref> and the sale was completed on May 1.<ref>[http://www.scripps.com/press-releases/1243-scripps-closes-its-acquisition-of-15-television-stations-from-cordillera-communications "Scripps Closes Its Acquision of 15 Television Stations from Cordillera Communications"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501191117/http://www.scripps.com/press-releases/1243-scripps-closes-its-acquisition-of-15-television-stations-from-cordillera-communications |date=May 1, 2019 }}, E.

The Tribune stations include [[CBS]] affiliates [[WTKR]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[WTVR-TV]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]—both in Virginia, along with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates [[KSTU]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and [[WXMI]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] and [[The CW|CW]] affiliates [[WPIX]] in [[New York City]], [[WGNT]] in Norfolk, Virginia and [[WSFL-TV]] in [[Miami, Florida]]. The only Nexstar station being acquired is CW affiliate [[KASW]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]—which would create a duopoly with longtime Scripps-owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KNXV-TV]].

| quote       = Turns out, not so much – quite the opposite, really. The Washington Post seems fine, but recently, in just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers – Gannett, Tribune Company and E. W. Scripps, companies built on print franchises that expanded into television – dumped those properties like yesterday's news in a series of spinoffs.
