'''Bed rest''', also referred to as the '''rest-cure''', is a [[medicine|medical]] treatment in which a person lies in bed for most of the time to try to cure an illness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Medical Terms|last=Collin|publisher=A&C Black|year=2008|via=Credo Reference}}</ref> Bed rest refers to voluntarily lying in bed as a treatment and not being confined to bed because of a health impairment which physically prevents leaving bed. The practice is still used although a 1999 [[systematic review]] found no benefits for any of the 17 conditions studied and no proven benefit for any conditions at all, beyond that imposed by symptoms.<ref name=Lancet1999>{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=C|last2=Glasziou|first2=P|last3=Del Mar|first3=C|title=Bed rest: a potentially harmful treatment needing more careful evaluation.|journal=Lancet|date=9 October 1999|volume=354|issue=9186|pages=1229–33|pmid=10520630|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(98)10063-6}}</ref>

==Medical uses==

Extended bed rest has been proven to be a potentially harmful treatment needing more careful evaluation.<ref name=Lancet1999/>

===Pregnancy===
Women who are pregnant and are experiencing early labor, vaginal bleeding, and cervix complications have been prescribed bed rest. This practice in 2013 was strongly discouraged due to no evidence of benefit and evidence of potential harm.<ref name=Mc2013>{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=CA|last2=Grimes|first2=DA|last3=Lyerly|first3=AD|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=June 2013|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1305–8|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f}}</ref>

Evidence is unclear if it affects the risk of [[preterm birth]] and due to potential side effects the practice is not routinely recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sosa|first1=CG|last2=Althabe|first2=F|last3=Belizán|first3=JM|last4=Bergel|first4=E|title=Bed rest in singleton pregnancies for preventing preterm birth.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=30 March 2015|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD003581|pmid=25821121|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003581.pub3|hdl=11336/51713|hdl-access=free}}</ref> It is also not recommended for routine use in [[pregnant women with high blood pressure]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meher|first1=Shireen|last2=Abalos|first2=Edgardo |last3=Carroli |first3=Guillermo |last4=Meher |first4=Shireen |title=Bed rest with or without hospitalisation for hypertension during pregnancy|year=2005|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003514.pub2 |pmid=16235323|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD003514}}</ref> or to prevent [[miscarriage]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aleman |first1=Alicia |last2=Althabe|first2=Fernando |last3=Belizán|first3=José M |last4=Bergel |first4=Eduardo|last5=Althabe|first5=Fernando|title=Bed rest during pregnancy for preventing miscarriage|year=2005|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003576.pub2 |pmid=15846669 |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=2 |pages=CD003576 }}</ref>

Women pregnant with [[twins]] or higher-order multiples are at higher risk for pregnancy complications. Routine bed rest in twin pregnancies (bed rest in the absence of complications) does not improve outcomes.<ref name="CrowtherHan2010"/> Bed rest is therefore not recommended routinely in those with a multiple pregnancy.<ref name="CrowtherHan2010">{{cite journal|last1=Crowther|first1=Caroline A|last2=Han|first2=Shanshan|last3=Crowther|first3=Caroline A|title=Hospitalisation and bed rest for multiple pregnancy|year=2010|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000110.pub2|pmid=20614420|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD000110|pmc=7051031}}</ref>

Use in combination with [[assisted reproductive technology]] such as [[embryo transfer]] is also not recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Küçük|first1=M|title=Bed rest after embryo transfer: Is it harmful?|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology|date=April 2013|volume=167|issue=2|pages=123–6|pmid=23274041|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2012.11.017}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
{{Further|Lying (position)#Long-term risks}}
Prolonged bed rest has long been known to have deleterious physiological effects, such as [[muscle atrophy]] and other forms of [[deconditioning]] such as [[artery|arterial]] constriction.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bleeker MW, De Groot PC, Rongen GA |title=Vascular adaptation to deconditioning and the effect of an exercise countermeasure: results of the Berlin Bed Rest study |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=1293–300 |date=October 2005 |pmid=15932956 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00118.2005|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Besides lack of [[physical exercise]] it was shown that another important factor is that the [[hydrostatic pressure]] (caused by [[gravity]]) acts anomalously, resulting in altered distribution of [[body fluids]]. In other words, when getting up, this can cause an [[orthostatic hypertension]], potentially inducing a [[vasovagal response]].

Additionally, prolonged bed rest can lead to the formation of skin pressure ulcers.<ref>{{cite book|title="Ulcer." The Columbia Encyclopedia, Columbia University, and Paul Lagasse, Columbia University Press, 2016. Credo Reference|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/columency/ulcer/0}}</ref> Even physical exercise in bed fails to address certain adverse effects.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Woods, Susan L. |title=Cardiac nursing |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon |year=2005 |page=921 |isbn=978-0-7817-4718-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vWmbeuYRN8C&pg=RA1-PA921&dq=%22bed+rest+is%22}}</ref>

[[Phlebothrombosis]] is marked by the formation of a clot in a vein without prior inflammation of the wall of the vein. It is associated with prolonged bed rest, surgery, pregnancy, and other conditions in which blood flow becomes sluggish or the blood coagulates more readily than normal. The affected area, usually the leg, may become swollen and tender. The danger is that the clot may become dislodged and travel to the lungs (a [[pulmonary embolism]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Rothenberg|first2=Mikel|last3=Chapman|first3=Charles F.|title=Dictionary of Medical Terms|date=November 1, 2012|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=New York|isbn=978-0764147586|edition=6th|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/barronsm/phlebothrombosis/0|access-date=5 September 2016|url-access=registration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510093827/http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/barronsm/phlebothrombosis/0|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
As a treatment, bed rest is mentioned in the earliest medical writings. The rest cure, or bed rest cure, was a 19th-century treatment for many [[mental disorder]]s, particularly [[hysteria]]. "Taking to bed" and becoming an "invalid" for an indefinite period was a culturally accepted response to some of the adversities of life.

In addition to bed rest, patients were secluded from all family contact to reduce dependence on others. The only person who bed rest patients were allowed to see was the nurse who massaged, bathed, and clothed them. Not only were patients to be isolated in bed for an extended time, they were advised to avoid other activities that may mentally exhaust them such as writing or drawing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women of the Asylum: Voices from Behind the Walls 1840-1945|last = Geller|first = Jeffery L.|publisher = Anchor Books|year = 1994|location = New York|pages = 161–168}}</ref>

In some extreme cases [[electrotherapy]] was prescribed. The food the patient was served usually consisted of fatty dairy products to revitalize the body. This cure as well as its name were created by doctor [[Silas Weir Mitchell (physician)|Silas Weir Mitchell]], and it was almost always prescribed to women, many of whom were suffering from depression, especially [[postpartum depression]]. It was not effective and caused many to go insane, suffer complications of prostration, or die.

Before the advent of effective antihypertension medications, bed rest was a standard treatment for markedly [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. It is still used in cases of carditis secondary to [[rheumatic fever]]. Its popularity and perceived efficacy have varied greatly over the centuries.

In 1892, feminist writer [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] published "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]", a horror short story based on her experience when placed under the rest cure from Dr. Silas W. Mitchell himself. She wasn't allowed to write in a journal, paint a picture, or release her imagination in any way, though she was artistically inclined. If she ever felt ill, she was simply told to return to bed. Her specific instructions from Dr. Mitchell were to "Live as domestic a life as possible. Have your child with you all the time... Lie down an hour after each meal. Have but two hours' intellectual life a day. And never touch pen, brush or pencil as long as you live."<ref>Gilman, Charlotte Perkins. "The Yellow Wallpaper". ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''. New York: Gale, 1996. 230‐37. Print.</ref> Gilman abided by Mitchell's instructions for several months before practically losing control of her sanity.

Eventually, Gilman divorced her husband on as good of terms as can be expected and pursued a life as a writer and women's rights activist. She later explained in her biography ''The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman'' that she could not be restrained to the domestic lifestyle without losing her sanity, and that "it was not a choice between going and staying, but between going, sane, and staying, insane."<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women of the Asylum: Voices from Behind the Walls 1840-1945|last = Geller|first = Jeffery L.|publisher = Anchor Books|year = 1994|location = New York|pages = 161–167}}</ref>

The narrator in "The Yellow Wallpaper" reflected her own authentic account. The narrator was advised by her husband to perform the rest cure and avoid creative activities while struggling with fits of depression. After becoming obsessed with the yellow wallpaper in her room, the narrator suffers a mental breakdown and frees a "woman behind the wall," metaphorically resembling Gilman's own mental break and release from female expectations. Gilman sent her short story to Dr. Mitchell, hoping that he might change his treatment of women with mental health and help save people from her own experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.charlotteperkinsgilman.com/2008/04/why-i-wrote-yellow-wallpaper-charlotte.html|title = "Why I Wrote "The Yellow Wallpaper"|last = Gilman|first = Charlotte|website = Charlotte Perkins Gilman}}</ref> The story became a symbol of feminism in the 1970s at the time of its rediscovery.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.lonestar.edu/yellow-wallpaper.htm | title=Feminist Gothic in "The Yellow Wallpaper"}}</ref>

The author [[Virginia Woolf]] was prescribed the rest cure, which she parodied in her novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925) with the description "you invoke proportion; order rest in bed; rest in solitude; silence and rest; rest without friends, without books, without messages; six months rest; until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Hermione|title=Virginia Woolf|date=1996|publisher=Chatto & Windus|location=London|isbn=9780701165079|edition=1. publ. in Great Britain}}</ref>

Some negative effects of bed rest were historically attributed to drugs taken in bed rest.<ref name="Dock1944">{{cite journal|last1=Dock|first1=William|title=The evil sequelae of complete bed rest|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=125|issue=16|year=1944|pages=1083|issn=0002-9955|doi=10.1001/jama.1944.02850340009004}}</ref>
