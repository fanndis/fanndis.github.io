==Early career==

===Democratic politics===
After graduating from [[Catholic University]], Donilon began working in the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter White House]] as a staffer in the Congressional Relations Office in 1977. At age 24, Donilon managed the [[1980 Democratic National Convention|1980 Democratic Convention]], at which [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] challenged President Carter for the nomination. A profile from 1980 described him as, "one of those Wunderkinder who spring out of nowhere to become driving forces in politics." <ref name=WaPo1980profile>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/08/12/the-don-of-the-delegates/1020aa17-e41f-40c7-9d1b-567e0eb51053/?utm_term=.35e27c6aa4b2 |title=The Don of the Delegates |website=Washington Post |date=August 12, 1980}}</ref> Carter successfully defeated Kennedy's challenge for the nomination but lost the general election.

In 1983, Donilon took a leave of absence from law school to work on [[Walter Mondale 1984 presidential campaign|Walter Mondale's presidential campaign]], as the national campaign coordinator and [[1984 Democratic National Convention|convention]] director.<ref name=WaPo1980profile/> Donilon helped prepared Mondale for his presidential debates. <ref>{{cite web |title=5 Things You May Not Know About Tom Donilon |url=https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog.../5-things-you-may-not-know-about-tom-don |website=[[The Aspen Institute]] |accessdate=February 25, 2020}}</ref> Donilon met his wife, Catherine Russell, on the Mondale campaign.<ref name="WashPo">{{cite web |title=Tom Donilon: Political wunderkind to policy trailblazer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/20/AR2010122005033_5.html?sid=ST2010100900243 |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 25, 2020}}</ref> Both Russell and Donilon then worked on Joe Biden's 1988 presidential campaign. After Michael Dukakis won the Democratic nomination, Donilon prepared him for his debates.

During the first Bush administration, Donilon was recruited to the law firm [[O'Melveny & Myers]] by Warren Christopher, the firm's senior partner. 

In 1992 Donilon led Bill Clinton's general election debate preparations and served as counsel to the transition directors.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McGrory|first=Mary|date=1992-10-20|title='No Surprises' School of Debate|language=en-US|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/10/20/no-surprises-school-of-debate/55e07e79-f693-43ea-9e51-9624ccaaa393/|access-date=2020-09-17|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> 

=== State Department Chief of Staff and Assistant for Public Affairs ===
When [[Warren Christopher]] became [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]], Donilon worked as his chief of staff and as [[Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs]], from 1993 to 1996. In those posts, he traveled to more than 50 countries.<ref name="auto"/> According to the Washington Post, in the Clinton administration, Donilon was "intimately involved in many major foreign policy issues, including negotiating the [[Dayton Agreement|Bosnian peace agreement]] and the [[expansion of NATO]]."<ref name="whorunsgov.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Thomas_Donilon |title=Post Politics: Breaking Politics News, Political Analysis & More – The Washington Post |publisher=Whorunsgov.com |accessdate=April 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104164920/http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Thomas_Donilon |archive-date=November 4, 2011 }}</ref> During the [[Srebrenica massacre]], Donilon advocated intervention and lobbied members of Congress and worked with allies to approve [[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina|intervention]].<ref name="WashPo"/>

===Private sector===
Donilon worked as Executive Vice President for Law and Policy at [[Fannie Mae]], the federally chartered mortgage finance company, as a registered [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbyist]] from 1999 through 2005.<ref name="whorunsgov.com"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Duo Heading State Transition Seasoned Vets|publisher=USA Today|date=November 12, 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-11-12-2032079804_x.htm|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref>

Before his appointment to the Obama Administration, Donilon was a partner in the Washington office of the law firm [[O'Melveny & Myers]], where he advised companies and their boards on a range of "sensitive governance, policy, legal and regulatory matters."<ref name="Omm.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.omm.com/thomasdonilon/|title=O'Melveny & Myers LLP &#124; Professionals|publisher=[[O'Melveny & Myers]]|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref> In addition, he "led the firm's successful effort to revitalize its pro bono commitment." <ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas Donilon - O'Melveny|url=https://www.omm.com/professionals/thomas-e-donilon/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=www.omm.com|language=en}}</ref>

Out of government, Donilon continued to participate in foreign policy, including as a member of the House and Senate Majority's National Security Advisory Group, under Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-03-28|title=Pelosi, Reid, Former Defense Secretary Perry Announce New Review of Post-9/11 National Security Record|url=https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/pelosi-reid-former-defense-secretary-perry-announce-new-review-post-911-national-security-record|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Speaker Nancy Pelosi|language=en}}</ref>

==Obama administration==

In 2008, David Axelrod recruited Donilon to head Obama's presidential debate preparation team. After the election, Obama's pick for chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, recommended that James Jones, Obama's pick for National Security Advisor, hire Donilon as his deputy. <ref name="WashPo"/> In October 2010, Donilon replaced Jones as National Security Advisor. According to The New Yorker, he took inspiration for the NSC process from former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. <ref name="NYer">{{cite web |last1=Lizza |first1=Ryan |title=The Consequentialist |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/02/the-consequentialist |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=February 25, 2020}}</ref>

=== National Security Advisor (2010–2013) ===
As National Security Advisor, Donilon "oversaw the U.S. National Security Council staff, chaired the cabinet level National Security Principals Committee, provided the president's daily national security briefing, and was responsible for the coordination and integration of the administration's foreign policy, intelligence, and military efforts." Donilon also "oversaw the White House's international economics, cybersecurity, and international energy efforts" and "served as the President's personal emissary to a number of world leaders, including President Hu Jintao and President Xi Jinping, President Vladimir Putin, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and Prime Minister Netanyahu."<ref name="bio"/>

A profile in ''Foreign Policy'', according to the ''New York Times'', characterized Donilon as "a sharp-elbowed infighter.<ref name="ricetoreplace"/> Another profile, by Jason Horowitz in ''The Washington Post'', defined the "Donilon Doctrine" as one that "envisions a re-balancing of resources and interests away from Afghanistan, the Middle East and Europe and toward Asia, where he sees America building bigger, better relationships with China and India."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Horowitz|first=Jason|date=2010-12-21|title=Is the Donilon Doctrine the new New World Order?|language=en-US|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/20/AR2010122005712.html|access-date=2020-09-17|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> 

In June 2013, when Donilon announced he was leaving the White House, Obama said, "Tom's that rare combination of the strategic and the tactical. He has a strategic sense of where we need to go, and he has a tactical sense of how to get there."<ref name="ricetoreplace"/> Joe Biden said in a statement, "I've worked with eight different administrations and even more national security advisers, and I've never met anyone with more talent and with greater strategic judgment."<ref name="ricetoreplace"/>

David Rothkopf wrote of Donilon's legacy: 
<blockquote>"Donilon's greatest contribution was his strategic mindset, leading to a conscious shift away from the issues that preoccupied the NSC under George W. Bush in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the broader post-9/11 "Global War on Terror" to one that centered on next generation issues: China, cyber issues, the strategic consequences of America's energy revolution, introducing new economic initiatives in the Atlantic and Pacific that have broad geopolitical consequences, moving to a next generation Mideast strategy focused on regional stability, along with new partnerships with regional and global players and addressing emerging threats in places like Africa."<ref name="FP">{{cite web |last1=Rothkopf |first1=David |title=Donilon's Legacy |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/05/donilons-legacy/ |website=Foreign Policy}}</ref></blockquote>

===Asia===

Donilon was a prominent advocate of the Obama administration's "pivot" or rebalance to Asia.<ref name="FP2">{{cite web |last1=Rogin |first1=Josh |title=Donilon defends the Asia 'pivot' |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/11/donilon-defends-the-asia-pivot/ |website=[[Foreign Policy]]}}</ref> Donilon described the policy in a speech at the Asia Society in 2013: "The United States is implementing a comprehensive, multidimensional strategy: strengthening alliances; deepening partnerships with emerging powers; building a stable, productive, and constructive relationship with China; empowering regional institutions; and helping to build a regional economic architecture that can sustain shared prosperity."<ref name="Asia Society">Remarks By Tom Donilon, National Security Advisor to the President: "The United States and the Asia-Pacific in 2013" - The Asia Society</ref>

In July 2012, Donilon met with then Chinese President Hu Jintao and Dai Bingguo. The next year he traveled to China again and met with Xi Jinping; during his visit, Donilon called for a "healthy, stable, and reliable military-to-military relationship" between the United States and China.<ref>{{Cite web|title=US national security adviser Tom Donilon promotes military ties in Beijing|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1248153/white-house-security-adviser-tom-donilon-calls-deeper-china-military-ties|access-date=2020-09-17|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref> 

Donilon was also critical of China at times. He was the first American official to publicly admonish China for its cyber espionage.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Landler|first1=Mark|last2=Sanger|first2=David E.|date=2013-03-11|title=U.S. Demands China Block Cyberattacks and Agree to Rules|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/asia/us-demands-that-china-end-hacking-and-set-cyber-rules.html|access-date=2020-09-17|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 2013, in a speech to the Asia Society, Donilon said "Increasingly, U.S. businesses are speaking out about their serious concerns about sophisticated, targeted theft of confidential business information and proprietary technologies through cyber-intrusions on an unprecedented scale." Donilon said China must recognize the risk such activities pose to the reputation of Chinese industry, to bilateral relations, and to international trade. Beijing, he said, must also "take serious steps to investigate" allegations of hacking.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-publicly-calls-on-china-to-stop-commercial-cyber-espionage-theft-of-trade-secrets/2013/03/11/28b21d12-8a82-11e2-a051-6810d606108d_story.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Ellen |last=Nakashima |title=U.S. publicly calls on China to stop commercial cyber-espionage, theft of trade secrets|date=March 12, 2013}}</ref>

Before leaving the Obama Administration, Donilon coordinated a two-day informal summit between President Xi Jinping and Obama held in Sunnylands, California, in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rucker |first1=Philip |title=At U.S.-china shirt-sleeves summit, formalities and suspicions abound |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-us-china-shirt-sleeves-summit-formalities-and-suspicions-abound/2013/06/09/2ab97c06-d125-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 25, 2020}}</ref>

===International economics===
[[File:Csisdonilon.jpg|thumbnail|left|Thomas Donilon, U.S. National Security Advisor, speaking at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] in Washington, D.C. in November 2012]]

Donilon supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he called "the most important trade negotiation under way in the world today and the economic centerpiece of the rebalance" to Asia.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|last=Donilon|first=Tom|date=2013-04-15|title=The President's Free-Trade Path to Prosperity|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323741004578420843565131294|access-date=2020-09-17|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> At the same time, he advocated the importance of building trade ties between trans-Atlantic allies, through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP).<ref name="auto1"/>

=== Human rights ===
Ahead of President Obama's trip to Myanmar, Donilon called on the Philippines and Myanmar to uphold human rights amid their democratic transitions.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Center for Strategy and International Studies|title=President Obama's Asia Policy and Upcoming Trip to the Region—Transcript of Conversation with Thomas Donilon|url=https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/attachments/121511_Donilon_Statesmens_Forum_TS.pdf|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=CSIS}}</ref>

Obama charged Donilon with setting up the interagency standing Atrocities Prevention Board, which would define mass atrocity prevention as a "core national security interest and a core moral responsibility in the United States of America."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Obama Praised for Action Plan to Prevent Mass Atrocities, Genocide|url=https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/press-release/obama-praised-action-plan-prevent-mass-atrocities-genocide|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Human Rights First|language=en}}</ref>

===Middle East===
Donilon developed a strong relationship with the Israeli government, traveling for a five-hour meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2012 without visiting any other countries in the region—a first for a national security adviser, according to Dennis Ross. As Ross wrote of Donilon's tenure, "It was not that [Donilon] agreed with everything he heard or in any way held back in conveying what was important to President Obama—quite the contrary. Rather, he gave Netanyahu the sense that Israel got a 'fair hearing' and his views were taken into account when U.S. actions were considered."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Dennis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vu49DwAAQBAJ&q=donilon|title=Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.-Israel Relationship from Truman to Obama|date=2016-10-04|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-53644-2|language=en}}</ref> Robert D. Blackwill and Philip H. Gordon echoed the sentiment in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations, writing that the U.S.-Israel Consultative Group, a channel for national security dialogue between the two countries, "functioned effectively at times during the Obama administration, particularly from 2010 to 2013 under national security advisers Thomas Donilon in the United States and Yaakov Amidror in Israel."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Repairing the U.S.-Israel Relationship|url=https://www.cfr.org/report/repairing-us-israel-relationship|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en}}</ref> 

In preparation to advise the president on Afghanistan and Pakistan, Donilon commissioned evaluations of the decision-making processes underpinning both the Vietnam War and the Iraq War, which showed, according to Newsweek, "an astonishing historical truth: neither the Vietnam War nor the Iraq War featured any key meetings where all the issues and assumptions were discussed by policymakers. In both cases the United States was sucked into war inch by inch."<ref>{{Cite web|last=EDT|first=Jonathan Alter On 5/14/10 at 8:00 PM|date=2010-05-14|title=Jonathan Alter: Obama, Year One, The Promise|url=https://www.newsweek.com/jonathan-alter-obama-year-one-promise-72479|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Newsweek|language=en}}</ref> Donilon was opposed to further intervention in Afghanistan. He worked with Biden to manage the withdrawal of troops from Iraq by the end of 2011.

During debates within the Obama administration over military intervention in Libya in 2011, Donilon "urge[d] caution in Libya", according to former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates' memoir, alongside Joe Biden, Bill Daley, Michael Mullen, Dennis McDonough, and John Brennan, while Samantha Power, Susan Rice and Ben Rhodes advocated action. Donilon recommended Obama conduct the Osama Bin Laden raid in May 2011, and was part of a small group planning the raid in the preceding months.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gates|first=Robert|title=Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War|year=2015|pages=511}}</ref>

In 2011, Donilon gave a speech to the Brookings Institution about the Obama administration's pressure campaign in response to Iran's nuclear program. "If Tehran does not change course, the pressure will continue to grow," Donilon said. That pressure, he said, would include increasing sanctions and shoring up defense of Iran's neighbors. "Iranians," he said, "deserve a government that puts their daily ambitions ahead of its nuclear ambitions."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Donilon|first=Tom|date=November 22, 2011|title=Keynote Speech - Iran and Multilateral Pressure: An Assessment of Multilateral Effort to Impede Iran's Nuclear Program|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/20111122_iran_nuclear_program_keynote.pdf|access-date=September 17, 2020}}</ref> Donilon headed the White House team that worked with State Department officials—Hillary Clinton, secretary of state; Bill Burns, deputy secretary of state; and Jake Sullivan, director of policy planning—to negotiate a backchannel, through Oman, with Iran on its nuclear project.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|title=Hard Choices|year=2014|isbn=978-1442367067}}</ref> 

==Post-Obama administration==
After leaving government in 2013, Donilon joined the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] as a distinguished [[fellow]]. At the Council on Foreign Relations, Donilon co-chaired, along with Mitch Daniels, former Governor of Indiana, the organization's first task force on global health. The task force issued its report, "The Emerging Global Health Crisis Noncommunicable Diseases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries," in December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Emerging Global Health Crisis|url=https://www.cfr.org/report/emerging-global-health-crisis|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en}}</ref> The same year, Donilon delivered the Landon Lecture at Kansas State University, in which he rejected the notion of American decline. In it, he argued, "No nation can match our comprehensive, multidimensional set of enduring strengths: bountiful resources—both human and material, our global network of alliances, our unmatched military strength, our entrepreneurship and innovation, our liberal political and economic traditions, and our remarkable capacity for self-assessment and rejuvenation." Donilon also outlined challenges for the United States and recommended that the government reduce the budget deficit, improve infrastructure, invest in science research, pass immigration reform that gives a path to citizenship, and invest in primary and secondary education. 

Donilon returned to O'Melveny & Myers in  2014 as Vice Chair of the firm and a member of the firm's Global Policy Committee. Since April 2017, Donilon has been Chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute, the firm's internal think tank. 

In April 2016, Obama appointed Donilon as Chair of the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.The Commission's report, which was released in December of that year, made recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity in the United States. Donilon presented the findings to Obama, who called them "thoughtful and pragmatic" and asked for them to be presented to the Trump transition team.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-12-02|title=Statement by the President on the Report of the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/02/statement-president-report-commission-enhancing-national-cybersecurity|access-date=2020-09-17|website=whitehouse.gov|language=en}}</ref> Ahead of the 2016 election, after the hacking of the Democratic National Convention, Donilon called for FBI investigation of the attack and public condemnation against the perpetrators, saying that Russia's claims that it does not interfere in political processes in cyberspace were "just wrong."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nelson|first=Louis|title=Former Obama security adviser: U.S. should confront Russia with evidence of DNC hack|url=https://politi.co/2TTMxdI|access-date=2020-09-17|website=POLITICO|language=en}}</ref> In 2017, Donilon wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post in which he provided recommendations for "hack-proofing" future elections from foreign meddling.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Donilon|first1=Thomas|title=Russia will be back.

During Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Donilon was co-chair of the Clinton-Kaine Transition Project, as its foreign-policy lead. <ref name=":0" /> If Clinton had won, Donilon was widely considered a candidate to be Secretary of State<ref>{{cite web|last1=Viebeck|first1=Elise|title=Is Tom Donilon the front-runner to lead Clinton's State Department?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/10/25/is-tom-donilon-the-frontrunner-for-clintons-state-department/|accessdate=February 25, 2020|website=The Washington Post}}</ref> or CIA Director.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Mike|title=Axios QM: Ghosts in the Cabinet|url=http://link.axios.com/view/58718b5d1e5603b30e8b466f53nzw.k01/3ce9d4a1|accessdate=February 25, 2020|website=Axios}}</ref>

Donilon has continued to comment on foreign policy and has been publicly critical of the Trump administration. In January 2017, after Trump signed the "Muslim ban," Donilon joined an amicus brief which argued there was "no meaningful evidentiary support for the claimed national security imperative underlying" Trump's executive order.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS|url=https://www.hoganlovells.com/~/media/hogan-lovells/pdf/hawaii/16_1436_and_16_1540bsacformernationalsecurityofficials.pdf}}</ref> In 2018, he condemned Trump's decision to pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as "the worst mistake the United States has made in the Middle East since the Iraq War."<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Jennifer Hansler|title=Obama national security adviser slams Trump's foreign policy moves|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/tom-donilon-axe-files/index.html|access-date=2020-09-17|website=CNN}}</ref> And in 2019, in an article for ''Foreign Affairs'', he criticized the Trump administration's trade war with China, and instead called for a broader strategy rooted in reinvesting in American science, education, infrastructure, alliances, and talent, including through welcoming immigration.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Donilon|first=Tom|date=2019-06-27|title=Trump's Trade War Is the Wrong Way to Compete With China|journal=Foreign Affairs : America and the World|language=en-US|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-06-25/trumps-trade-war-wrong-way-compete-china|access-date=2020-09-17|issn=0015-7120}}</ref>
