The [[Tunbao]] and [[Chuanqing people]] are other Han Chinese subgroups that migrated from possibly somewhere in Central or Eastern China to Southwestern China while maintaining their ancestral traditions which differentiated them from the native Chinese people.

The Hakka people have had significant influence on the course of modern Chinese and [[overseas Chinese]] history; in particular, they have been a source of many government and military leaders—in 1984, over half of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]] of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] were ethnically Hakka.<ref name=Erbaugh937>{{cite journal|last1=Erbaugh|first1=Mary S.|title=The Secret History of the Hakkas: The Chinese Revolution as a Hakka Enterprise|journal=The China Quarterly|issue=132|date=December 1992|volume=132|pages=937–968|doi= 10.1017/S0305741000045495|jstor=654189}}</ref>

==Origins, migrations and group identification==
[[File:Idioma hakka.png|thumb|Hakka distribution within the [[Greater China|Greater Chinese Region]].]]

===Migrations===
Migrants were referred to as Hakka and no specific people were referred to as Hakka at first. Northern China's Yellow River area was the homeland of the Hakka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/lang/hakka/english/a/a.htm |title=The Hakka People |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=全球華文網路教育中心 |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

Since the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC), the ancestors of the Hakka people have migrated southwards several times because of social unrest, upheaval and invasions from the northern provinces (e.g. Gansu, Henan)<ref name=ocac/> Subsequent migrations also occurred at the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] in the 10th century and during the end of the Northern [[Song dynasty]] in the 1120s, the last of which saw a massive flood of refugees fleeing southward when the [[Jurchens]] captured the northern Song capital of [[Kaifeng|Bianliang]] (modern-day Kaifeng) in the [[Jingkang Incident]] of the [[Jin–Song Wars]]. The precise movements of the Hakka people remain unclear during the 14th century when the [[Ming dynasty]] overthrew the [[Yuan dynasty]] and subsequently fell to the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s who formed the [[Qing dynasty]] in the 17th century.

During the 16th century, in response to an economic boom, the Hakka moved into hilly areas to mine for [[zinc]] and [[lead]] and also moved into the coastal plains to cultivate cash crops. After an economic downturn, many of these ventures failed and many people had to turn to pillaging to make ends meet.<ref>{{cite book|title=Networks beyond Empires: Chinese Business and Nationalism in the Hong Kong …|first= Huei-Ying |last=Kuo}}</ref>

During the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1661–1722) in the Qing dynasty, the [[Great Clearance|coastal regions were evacuated]] by imperial edict for almost a decade, due to the dangers posed by the remnants of the Ming court who had fled to the island of [[Taiwan]]. When the threat was eliminated, Kangxi Emperor issued an edict to re-populate the coastal regions. To aid the move, each family was given monetary incentives to begin their new lives; newcomers were registered as "Guest Households" ({{zh|t=客戶 |p=kèhù}}).

===Identity===
Although different in some social customs and culture (e.g. [[Hakka Chinese|linguistic differences]]) from the surrounding population, they belong to the Han Chinese majority. Historical sources shown in census statistics relate only to the general population, irrespective of particular districts, provinces, or regions. These census counts were made during imperial times. They did not distinguish what [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese variety]] the population spoke. Therefore, they do not directly document Hakka migrations. The study by [[Lo Hsiang-lin]], ''K'o-chia Yen-chiu Tao-Liu / An Introduction to the Study of the Hakkas'' (Hsin-Ning & Singapore, 1933) used genealogical sources of family clans from various southern counties.

According to the 2009 studies published in the ''[[American Journal of Human Genetics]]'',  Hakka genes are slightly {{clarify span|tilted|date=January 2015}} towards northern Han people compared with other southern Han people.<ref name=Chen>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jieming|author2=Zheng, Houfeng|author3=Bei, Jin-Xin|author4=Sun, Liangdan|author5=Jia, Wei-hua|author6=Li, Tao|author7=Zhang, Furen|author8=Seielstad, Mark|author9=Zeng, Yi-Xin|author10=Zhang, Xuejun|author11=Liu, Jianjun|title=Genetic Structure of the Han Chinese Population Revealed by Genome-wide SNP Variation|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=1 December 2009|volume=85|issue=6|pages=775–785|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.10.016|pmid=19944401|pmc=2790583}}</ref> Nevertheless, the study has also shown a strong common genetic relationship between all Han Chinese with only a small difference of 0.32%.<ref name=Chen/> 
[[Lingnan]] Hakka place names indicate a long history of the Hakka being culturally Han Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|title=China's march toward the tropics: a discussion of the southward penetration of China's culture, peoples, and political control in relation to the non-Han-Chinese peoples of south China and in the perspective of historical and cultural geography|volume=|author=Herold Jacob Wiens|editor=|edition=|publisher=Shoe String Press|year=1954|location=|page=270|isbn=|chapter=Chapter VIII: Ethnic Distribution
|oclc=576470153|lccn=54013401|quote=taste which alone are sufficient to demonstrate that the ancestors of the Hakka had long been in the ranks of the Han-Chinese civilization. In the Hakka region more than elsewhere in Ling-nan are such excellent old names as Fu-yung-chang (Hibiscus Range), Chin-p'ing Shan (Brocade-screen Mountains), Sung-yuan-ch'i (Pine-springs)|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001257219}}</ref>

Unlike other Han Chinese groups, the Hakkas are not named after a geographical region, e.g. a province, county or city. The Hakka people have a distinct identity from the [[Cantonese people]]. As 60% of the Hakkas in China reside in Guangdong province, and 95% of overseas Hakkas ancestral homes are in Guangdong. Hakkas from [[Chaozhou]], [[Hainan]] and [[Fujian]] are also mistaken to be Chaoshanese, Hainanese and Hokkiens.

Strangers who find  out that the other party is a Hakka will affectionately acknowledge each other as "''chhit-kâ-ngìn''" ({{lang|zh|[[wikt:自家人|自家人]]}}) meaning "(one)self’s family".

===Origins===

It is commonly held that the Hakkas are a subgroup of the [[Han Chinese]] that originated in [[Northern China]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Constable|first1=Nicole|title=Guest People : Hakka Identity in China and Abroad|date=2005|publisher=Univ. of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295984872|page=9}}</ref><ref name=hu-sp/> To trace their origins, three accepted theories so far have been brought forth among anthropologists, linguists, and historians:<ref name=wang/>

# The Hakkas are Han Chinese originating solely from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] in China (present [[Shanxi]] and [[Henan]] provinces);<ref name=wang/> 
# The Hakkas are Han Chinese from the Central Plain, with some inflow of those already in the south;<ref name=wang/> 
# The majority of the Hakkas are Han Chinese from the south, with portions coming from those in the north.<ref name=wang/>

The latter two theories are the most likely and are together supported by multiple scientific studies.<ref name=hu-sp>{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=SP|author2=Luan, JA|author3=Li, B|author4=Chen, JX|author5=Cai, KL|author6=Huang, LQ|author7=Xu, XY|title=Genetic link between Chaoshan and other Chinese Han populations: Evidence from HLA-A and HLA-B allele frequency distribution|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=January 2007|volume=132|issue=1|pages=140–50|pmid=16883565|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20460}}</ref><ref name=wang>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=WZ|author2=Wang, CY|author3=Cheng, YT|author4=Xu, AL|author5=Zhu, CL|author6=Wu, SF|author7=Kong, QP|author8=Zhang, YP|title=Tracing the origins of Hakka and Chaoshanese by mitochondrial DNA analysis|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=January 2010|volume=141|issue=1|pages=124–30|pmid=19591216|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21124}}</ref><ref name=Chen /> Clyde Kiang stated that the Hakkas' origins may also be linked with the Han's ancient neighbors, the [[Dongyi]] and [[Xiongnu]] people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwandocuments.org/language.htm|title=Related Topics: Non-legal Considerations: Language|publisher=Taiwandocuments.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> However, this is disputed by many scholars and Kiang's theories are considered to be controversial.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cheung|first=Sidney C.H.|title=On the south China track: Perspectives on anthropological research and teaching|year=1998|publisher=Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, Chinese University of Hong Kong|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-441-540-7|page=160}}</ref>

Hakka–Chinese scientist and researcher Dr. Siu-Leung Lee stated in the book by Chung Yoon-Ngan, ''The Hakka Chinese: Their Origin, Folk Songs And Nursery Rhymes'', that the potential Hakka origins from the northern Han and [[Xiongnu]], and that of the indigenous southern [[She people|She]] ({{lang|zh|畬族}}) and [[Baiyue|Yue]] ({{lang|zh|越族}}) tribes, "are all correct, yet none alone explain the origin of the Hakka", pointing out that the problem with "[[DNA profiling|DNA typing]]" on limited numbers of people within population pools cannot correctly ascertain who are really the southern Chinese, because many southern Chinese are also from northern Asia; Hakka or non-Hakka.<ref>{{cite book|last=Choon|first=Yoon Ngan|title=The Hakka Chinese: Their Origin, Folk Songs And Nursery Rhymes|year=2005|publisher=Poseidon Books|location=BURLEIGH MDC QLD. 4220, AUSTRALIA|isbn=978-1-921005-50-3}}</ref> It is known that the earliest major waves of Hakka migration began due to the attacks of the two afore-mentioned tribes during the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]].<ref name="Pioneers">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Khoon Choy|title=Pioneers of modern China : understanding the inscrutable Chinese|year=2006|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|location=River Edge, New Jersey|page=62|isbn=9789812566188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jlOQc8BumIC&q=peru+20%2C000+Britain+15%2C200%2C+Vietnam+15.000&pg=PA65}}</ref>

==Discrimination and hatred of Hakkas==
The Hakkas have been frequently subjected to hatred and discrimination by other Chinese ethnic groups which they have interacted with throughout history. The expressions of such prejudices by other ethnic groups have ranged from hurling minor verbal insults to committing [[genocide]]s against the Hakkas.

===By Qing Dynasty===
In retaliation for establishing the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], the Qing Dynasty military massacred the [[Hakkas]], killing 30,000 of the Hakkas daily during the height of the anti-Hakka mass-killing operation.<ref>''The Hakka Odyssey & their Taiwan homeland''.  p. 120, Clyde Kiang. 1992</ref>

The  Qing dynasty mobilized officers and men to kill the Hakkas, regained the [[Guanghai]] villages which was occupied by the Hakkas, and massacred the Hakkas' old and weak. The number of Hakkas killed was tens of thousands in the Dalongdong area of Guanghai alone.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |url= https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27161098| quote=清朝调集官兵对客勇进行剿杀，收复了被客勇占领的广海城，土勇并乘胜追杀客家老弱，在大隆洞地方被杀死的客家人数以万计|title=清末的村长械斗——死亡百万纵横七省，定中国命运}}</ref>

In retaliation for killing three Hunanese officers, the Hunanese exterminated the entire Hakka population of Wukeng and Chixi during [[Xiang Army]] military counter-attacks on the Hakkas in the year 1888.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27161098| quote=五坑和赤溪半岛的客家流民也被清军逐一肃清|title=清末的村长械斗——死亡百万纵横七省，定中国命运}}</ref> The Xiang army also massacred tens of thousands of other Hakkas in Guanghai too.

===By the Cantonese===
====Mass killings of Hakkas in 19th century====
The Cantonese [[Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856)|Red Turban]] rebels carried out a genocidal campaign against the Hakkas during a revolt against the Qing Dynasty. The Cantonese Red Turbans killed 13 Hakka village chiefs and 7,630 other Hakkas while on their way to Heshan where they killed another 1,320 Hakkas after conquering it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zadzs.com/novel-4364-read-100.html|title=这个天国不太平(校对)第100部分在线阅读，作者：三江口水-早安电子书|website=www.zadzs.com}}</ref>

The bloody [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]], which eventually killed some 500,000 Hakkas (or quite possibly even more), saw large-scale massacres against the Hakkas by Cantonese forces.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://m.sohu.com/a/249493968_665283/?pvid=000115_3w_a|title=20万人！佛山历史上最大规模打群架，土客械斗终结一战！_手机搜狐网|website=m.sohu.com}}</ref> After Hakka masacres against them, the Cantonese peasants butchered 500 Hakkas in a village located in the rural Enping county forcing the Hakkas to flee but they were later all murdered as well when they were caught and massacred by Cantonese peasants, who spared neither women and children Hakka, killing 4,000 of those Hakkas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27161098|title=清末的村长械斗——死亡百万纵横七省，定中国命运！|website=知乎专栏}}</ref> 2,000 people which comprised half of the Hakka inhabitants of a village were exterminated in another Cantonese attack.<ref name="auto"/> Large numbers of Hakkas were killed in other places as well by the Cantonese, with the assistance of Xiang army.

The number of Hakkas killed was tens of thousands in the Dalongdong area of Guanghai alone.<ref name="auto1"/>

====Cantonese overseas====
The Cantonese murdered more than 70 Hakka fellow provincials in Shanghai under the justification of a Hakka conspiracy that the [[Jiaying]] group was surrendering the city to foreign control.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOSDktQ4q0IC&pg=PA80|title=Native Place, City, and Nation: Regional Networks and Identities in Shanghai, 1853–1937|page=80|isbn=9780520915459|last1=Goodman|first1=Bryna|date=20 October 1995}}</ref> In the year of 1925, August 27  villages in a county belonged to the Hakka minority were attacked, Chiang's Punti (Cantonese) men and soldiers did not hesitate to rape their women and pillage their homes.<ref>The Broken Wave: The Chinese Communist Peasant Movement, 1922–1928, Volume 90 By Roy Hofheinz [https://archive.org/details/brokenwavechines0000hofh/page/220 <!-- quote=punti rape hakka rape. -->]</ref>

Resurfaced feelings of ethnic hatred and friction the Hakkas and Cantonese have for each other caused the [[Larut War]] overseas in Malaysia.

Upon arriving to Madagascar, the Cantonese colluded to prevent any Hakka migration to Madagascar.<ref>{{harvnb|Yap|Leong Man|1996|p=37}}</ref>

===By Guangxi people===
More than 100,000 Hakkas were slaughtered by the Punti people again in Guangxi province during another clan war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bbs.tianya.cn/m/post-333-356214-1.shtml|title=转贴「 浅谈清末两广土客大械斗 」(转载)|quote=超过10万多客家人几乎被广西本地土人杀光}}</ref> In October 1850, the Cantonese and Hakkas were hacking and killing each other for over 40 days in [[Guigang]].

==Culture==
{{main|Hakka culture}}
Hakka culture have been largely shaped by the new environment which they had to alter many aspects their culture to adapt, which helped influence their architecture and cuisine.  When the Hakka expanded into areas with pre-existing populations in the South, there was often little agricultural land left for them to farm. As a result, many Hakka men turned towards careers in the military or in public service. Consequently, the Hakka culturally emphasized education, however this is by no means unique to the Hakkas as most of the other Han Chinese also culturally emphasized education.

===Language===
{{main|Hakka Chinese}}
Hakka Chinese is the native [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese variety]] of the Hakka people. In Taiwan, the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] named "Taiwanese Hakka Chinese" as one of the [[languages of Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=不僅只有台灣閩南語，台灣客家語也是「台語」！|url=http://www.hakka.gov.tw/content.asp?cuItem=124497&mp=2013|author=黃玉振|publisher=行政院客家委員會|date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2012-04-17|quote=只要是共同生長於台灣這塊土地上的所有族群的成員，他們不僅都是台灣人，而且他們所操持的族群語言也都是「台灣話」（或「台語」）！|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032303/http://www.hakka.gov.tw/content.asp?cuItem=124497&mp=2013|archive-date=2013-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[Image:Snail pit tulou.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Tianluokeng Tulou cluster]]. [[Hukeng, Fujian|Hukeng]] Town, [[Yongding County]], Fujian.]]
{{main|Hakka architecture}}
Hakka people built several types of [[tulou]] and peasant [[Hakka walled village|fortified villages]] in the mountainous rural parts of far western Fujian and adjacent southern Jiangxi and northern Guangdong regions. A representative sample of [[Fujian Tulou]] (consisting of 10 buildings or building groups) in Fujian were inscribed in 2008 as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1113|title=Fujian ''Tulou'' |author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=Whc.unesco.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

Another very popular architecture in northern east Guangdong, such as Xingning and Meixian, is Wrapped Dragon Village ({{zh|t=圍龍屋 |p=wéilóngwū |links=no}}).

===Arts===
====Hakka hill song====
{{main|Hakka hill song}}

Hakka hill songs are traditionally used by hillside farmers in parts of Taiwan and China, mainly for entertainment in the farming fields and courting practices. They are characterized by the strong, resonating melody and voice, which would echo around hills and can be heard for up to a mile around the area. Hill songs can be considered a form of [[communication]], as its participants often use it to communicate love songs or news.

====Hakkapop====
Hakkapop is a genre of Hakka pop music made primarily in Taiwan, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.

===Media===
The mainland station [[China National Radio]]'s [[Sound of the Divine Land]] ({{lang|zh-hans|神州之声}}) has a Hakka Chinese radio break. In Taiwan, there are seven Hakka Chinese radio channels.

[[Hakka TV]] was the first Hakka Chinese TV channel in the world. [[:zh:梅州电视台客家公共频道|Meizhou TV-2]] was the first Hakka Chinese TV channel in China.

===Food culture===
{{main|Hakka cuisine}}
Hakka cuisine is known for the use of preserved meats and [[tofu]] as well as stewed and [[braised]] dishes. A popular dish known as ''[[Yong Tau Foo]]'' is a Hakka Chinese food consisting primarily of tofu that has been filled with either a ground meat mixture or fish paste (surimi).

===Foot binding===
Historically, Hakka women did not [[Foot binding|bind their feet]] when the practice was commonplace in China.<ref name=Davis>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Edward L.|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415241298|page=333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rLBvrlKI7QC&pg=PA333}}</ref>

The religious practices of Hakka people are largely similar to those of other Han Chinese. [[Ancestor veneration in China|Ancestor veneration]] is the primary form of religious expression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lozada|first=Eriberto|editor1-last=Ember|editor1-first=Carol R.|editor2-last=Ember|editor2-first=Melvin|editor3-last=Skoggard|editor3-first=Ian|title=Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World|volume=2|date=2005|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|location=Dordrecht, Netherlands|isbn=9780306483219|pages=92–103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&pg=PA92}}</ref> One distinctively Hakka religious practice involves the worship of dragon deities.<ref>[http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/web-life/taiwan/9802/9802-12.html 客家夥房的土地龍神]</ref>

==In mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan==
[[Image:meizhou map2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Meizhou Prefecture]] (in yellow) in Guangdong Province, where [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]] and [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]] are located.]]
Hakka populations are found in 13 out of the 27 [[Provinces of China|provinces]] and [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] of mainland China.

===Guangdong===
[[File:At home with the Hakkas in South China (1921) (14775083364).jpg|thumb|right|Christian missionaries with Hakka students of a girls' school in [[Waichow]], [[Guangdong]], 1921.]]
Hakkas who live in Guangdong comprise about 60% of the total Hakka population. Worldwide, over 95% of the overseas-descended Hakkas came from this Guangdong region, usually from [[Meizhou]] and [[Heyuan]] as well as other towns such as [[Shenzhen]], [[Jieyang]], [[Dongguan]] and [[Huizhou]]. Hakkas live mostly in the northeast part of the province, particularly in the so-called Xing-Mei ([[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]]–[[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]]) area. Unlike their kin in Fujian, Hakka in the Xingning and Meixian area developed a non-fortress-like unique architectural style, most notably the weilongwu ({{zh|t=圍龍屋 |p=wéilóngwū |links=no}} or Hakka: Wui Lung Wuk) and sijiaolou ({{zh|t=四角樓 |p=sìjǐaolóu |links=no |labels=no}} or Hakka: Si Kok Liu).

===Fujian===

[[File:Gun for defense.JPG|thumb|right| A firearm for defence against enemies in a Hakka [[Fujian Tulou]].]]

Tradition states that the early Hakka ancestors traveling from north China entered Fujian first, then by way of the [[Ting River]] they traveled to Guangdong and other parts of China, as well as overseas. Thus, the Tingjiang River is also regarded as the Hakka Mother River.

The Hakkas who settled in the mountainous region of south-western Fujian province developed a unique form of architecture known as the ''[[tulou]]'' ({{lang|zh|土樓}}), literally meaning ''earthen structures''. The ''tulou'' are round or square and were designed as a combined large fortress and multi-apartment building complex. The structures typically had only one entrance-way, with no windows at ground level. Each floor served a different function: the first floor contained a well and livestock, the second food storage, and the third and higher floors living spaces. ''Tulou'' were built to withstand attack from bandits and marauders.

Today, western Fujian is inhabited by 3 million Hakkas, scattered around villages in 10 counties (county-level 'cities' and districts) in Longyan and Sanming prefectures, 98% of whom are Hakkas living in Changting, Liancheng, Shanghang, Wuping, Yongding, Ninghua, Qingliu and Mingxi counties.<ref name="en.people.cn">{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/200011/21/eng20001121_55741.html|title=Townsmen Sentiment Always Serves as a Link|website=en.people.cn}}</ref>

===Jiangxi===
Jiangxi contains the second largest Hakka community. Nearly all of southern Jiangxi province is Hakka, especially in [[Ganzhou]]. In the Song dynasty, a large number of Han Chinese migrated to the delta area as the Court moved southward because invasion of northern minority. They lived in Jiangxi and intermixed with the She and Yao minorities. Ganzhou was the place that the Hakka have settled before migrating to western Fujian and eastern Guangdong. During the early Qing dynasty, there was a massive depopulation in Gannan due to the ravage of pestilence and war. However, western Fujian and eastern Guangdong suffered population explosion at the same time. Some edicts were issued to block the coastal areas, ordering coastal residents to move to the inland. The population pressure and the sharp contradiction of the land redistribution drove some residents to leave. Some of them moved back to Gannan, integrating with other Hakka people who lived there already for generations. Thus, the modern Gannan Hakka community was finally formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gndaily.com/english/2009-01/03/content_100656.htm|title=Ganzhou.China|publisher=Gndaily.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

===Sichuan===
The Kangxi Emperor (r. 1662–1722), after a tour of the land, decided the province of Sichuan had to be repopulated after the devastation caused by [[Zhang Xianzhong]]. Seeing the Hakka were living in poverty in the coastal regions in Guangdong province, the emperor encouraged the Hakkas in the south to migrate to Sichuan province. He offered financial assistance to those willing to resettle in Sichuan: eight ounces of silver per man and four ounces per woman or child.

Sichuan was originally the origin of the Deng lineage until one of them was hired as an official in Guangdong during the Ming dynasty but during the Qing plan to increase the population in 1671 they came to Sichuan again. [[Deng Xiaoping]] was born in Sichuan.<ref name="Dai2009">{{cite book|author=Yingcong Dai|title=The Sichuan Frontier and Tibet: Imperial Strategy in the Early Qing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&pg=PA25|year=2009|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98952-5|pages=25–}}</ref>

===Hunan===
Hakka people are mainly concentrated in the eastern part of [[Hunan]].

===Henan===
As with those in Sichuan, many Hakka emigrated to [[Xinyang]] prefecture (in southern Henan province), where [[Li Zicheng]] carried out a massacre in Guangzhou (now in [[Huangchuan]]) on Jan. 17th, 1636.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zh.wikisource.org/zh/|title=维基文库，自由的图书馆|publisher=Zh.wikisource.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

===Hong Kong{{anchor|In_Hong_Kong}}===
During the late [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, [[Hong Kong]] was in the imperial district of [[Bao'an County|Xin'an]] (now [[Shenzhen]]) County.<ref>''New Peace County, A Chinese Gazetteer of the Hong Kong Region'' Peter Y.L. Ng, Hong Kong University Press, 1983. {{ISBN|962-209-043-5}}.</ref> The [[Gazetteer of Xin'an County|1819 gazetteer]] lists 570 [[Punti]] and 270 Hakka contemporary settlements in the whole district.<ref>Ng (1983), p. 84.</ref> However, the area covered by Xin'an county is greater than what was to become the British imperial enclave of Hong Kong [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory|by 1898]]. Although there had been settlers originating from the mainland proper even before the Tang dynasty, historical records of those people are non-extant, only evidence of settlement from archaeological sources can be found.<ref>See p.12, 圖片 香港今昔 by 高添強 (Gao TianQiang), 三聯書店. (1997 2nd Ed.) {{ISBN|962-04-1180-3}}</ref> The [[New Territories]] lowland areas had been settled originally by several clan lineages in [[Kam Tin]], [[Sheung Shui]], [[Fanling]], [[Yuen Long]], [[Lin Ma Hang]] and [[Tai Po]], and hence termed the Punti before the arrival of the Hakka, and fishing families of the [[Tanka people|Tanka]] and [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] groups to the area.<ref>Gao 1997, p.16.</ref> Since the prime farming land had already been farmed, the Hakka land dwellers settled in the less accessible and more hilly areas. Hakka settlements can be found widely distributed around the Punti areas, but in smaller communities. Many are found on coastal areas in inlets and bays surrounded by hills.

Hakka-speaking communities are thought to have arrived in the Hong Kong area after the rescinding of the [[Great Clearance|coastal evacuation]] order in 1688,<ref name="Hase">{{cite book|last1=Hase|first1=Patrick|editor1-last=Faure|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Siu|editor2-first=Helen|title=Down to Earth : The Territorial Bond in South China|date=1995|publisher=Stanford Univ.

As the strong Punti lineages dominated most of the north western New Territories, Hakka communities began to organise local alliances of lineage communities such as the [[Sha Tau Kok]] ''Alliance of Ten'' or ''Shap Yeuk'' as [[Patrick Hase]] writes.<ref name=Hase /> Hakka villages from Wo Hang to the west and [[Yantian District|Yantian]] to the east of Sha Tau Kok came to use it as a local market town and it became the center of Hakka dominance. Further, the Shap Yeuk's [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|land reclamation]] project transforming marshland to arable farmland with the creation of dykes and levees to prevent storm flooding during the early 19th century shows an example of how local cooperation and the growing affluence of the landed lineages in the Alliance of Ten provided the strong cultural, socioeconomic Hakka influence on the area.

Farming and cultivation has been the traditional occupations of Hakka families from imperial times up until the 1970s. Farming was mostly done by Hakka women while their menfolk sought labouring jobs in the towns and cities. Many men entered indentured labour abroad as was common from the end of the 19th century to the Second World War. Post war, males took the opportunity to seek work in Britain and other countries later to send for their families to join them once they sent enough money back to cover travel costs.

As post war education became available to all children in Hong Kong, a new educated class of Hakka became more mobile in their careers. Many moved to the [[New towns of Hong Kong|government planned new towns]] which sprung up from the 1960s. The rural Hakka population began to decline as people moved abroad, and away to work in the urban areas. By the end of the 1970s, agriculture was firmly in the decline in Hakka villages.<ref>Gao, (1997)</ref> Today, there are still Hakka villages around Hong Kong, but being remote, many of their inhabitants have moved to the post war new towns like [[Sheung Shui]], [[Tai Po]], [[Sha Tin]] and further afield.

The Aboriginals used their matchlock muskets to defeat the Americans in the [[Formosa Expedition]]. During the [[Sino-French War]] the Hakka and Aboriginals used their matchlock muskets against the French in the [[Keelung Campaign]] and [[Battle of Tamsui]].

Liu Mingchuan took measures to reinforce Tamsui, in the river nine torpedo mines were planted and the entrance was blocked with ballast boats filled with stone which were sunk on September 3, matchlock armed "Hakka hill people" were used to reinforce the mainland Chinese battalion, and around the British Consulate and Customs House at the Red Fort hilltop, Shanghai Arsenal manufactured Krupp guns were used to form an additional battery.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abMMAQAAMAAJ&q=taiwan+matchlocks+stones|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West|first=Shih-shan Henry|last=Tsai|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=M.E.

The Hakka used their matchlock muskets to resist the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)]] and Han Taiwanese and Aboriginals conducted an insurgency against Japanese rule. The Hakka rose up against the Japanese in the [[Beipu uprising]].

Taiwan's Hakka population concentrates in [[Hsinchu]] and [[Hsinchu County]], [[Miaoli County]], and around [[Zhongli District]] in [[Taoyuan City]], and [[Meinong District]] in [[Kaohsiung]], and in [[Pingtung County]], with smaller presences in [[Hualien County]] and [[Taitung County]]. In recent decades,{{when|date=May 2011}} many Hakka have moved to the largest metropolitan areas, including [[Taipei]] and [[Taichung]].

On 28 December 1988, 14,000 Hakka protestors took to the streets in Taipei to demand the Nationalist government to "return our mother tongue", carrying portraits of "Sun Yat-sen". The movement was later termed "1228 Return Our Mother Tongue Movement".

Hakka-related affairs in Taiwan is regulated by the [[Hakka Affairs Council]]. Hakka-related tourist attractions in Taiwan are [[Dongshih Hakka Cultural Park]], [[Hakka Round House]], [[Kaohsiung Hakka Cultural Museum]], [[Meinong Hakka Culture Museum]], [[New Taipei City Hakka Museum]], [[Taipei Hakka Culture Hall]] and [[Taoyuan Hakka Culture Hall]].

==Hakkas elsewhere==
There is a Hakka saying, "{{lang|zh-hant|有陽光的地方就有華人, 有華人的地方就有客家人}}", which literally means "Wherever there is sunshine, there are Chinese; wherever there are Chinese, there are Hakka."<ref>{{cite web |author1=源流 |title=有阳光的地方就有华人，有华人的地方就有客家人 |url=https://www.hakka.com/article-2905-1.html |website=客家网 |date=20 July 2015}}</ref>

The Hakka have emigrated to many regions worldwide, notably [[Suriname]], India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Vietnam]] (known as [[Ngái people]]), [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Burma]].

Hakka people also emigrated to many countries in Europe, including Great Britain, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden and Netherlands. They also are found in [[South Africa]] and [[Mauritius]], on the islands of the Caribbean ([[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]), in the Americas, particularly in the United States, Canada, [[Panama]], [[Argentina]] and Brazil, as well as in Australia. Most expatriate Hakkas in Great Britain have ties to Hong Kong as many migrated there when Hong Kong still was a British colony during a period coinciding with the [[Cultural Revolution]] of China and a minor economic depression in Hong Kong.

===Southeast Asia===
====Vietnam====
There are two groups of Hakka in Vietnam. One is known as [[Ngái people]] and lives along the border with China in northern Vietnam. Another group are Chinese immigrants to southern Vietnam, known as '''Người Hẹ''' and is located around [[Sài Gòn]] and [[Vũng Tàu]].

====Cambodia====
About 65% of the [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] trace their roots back to [[Meizhou]] and [[Heyuan]] prefectures in Guangdong province. About 70% of the Hakkas are found in Phnom Penh where they dominate professions in the field of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], and shoemaking. Hakkas are also found in [[Takéo Province]], [[Stung Treng]] and [[Rattanakiri]] who consist of vegetable growers and rubber plantation workers. Hakka communities in the provinces migrated to Cambodia through Tonkin and Cochinchina in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>Willmott (1967), p. 23-4</ref>

====Thailand====
There are no records as to when Hakka descendants arrived in Thailand. In 1901, Yu Cipeng, a Hakka member of The League Society of China came to visit Thailand and found that the establishment of many varied organizations among the Hakka was not good for unity. He tried to bring the two parties together and persuaded them to dissolve the associations in order to set up a new united one. In 1909 The Hakka Society of Siam was established, and Chao Phraya Yommarat, then Interior Minister, was invited to preside over the opening ceremony for the establishment of the society's nameplate, located in front of the Chinese shrine "Lee Tee Biao". Yang Liqing was its first President.<ref>[http://www.hakkathailand.com/home/default_English.php?lang=English]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202073935/http://www.hakkathailand.com/home/default_English.php?lang=English |date=February 2, 2011 }}</ref>

Hakka people form the second largest subgroup of the ethnic [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] population of [[Malaysia]], particularly in [[Peninsular Malaysia|the peninsula]], with several prominent Hakka figures emerging during [[British Malaya|colonial British rule]].  There are 1,729,000 people of Hakka ancestry in Malaysia as of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/countries/MY|title=People Groups|author=Joshua Project|website=joshuaproject.net}}</ref> [[Chung Keng Quee]], "Captain China" of [[Perak]] and [[Penang]], was the founder of the mining town of [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]], the leader of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]], a millionaire philanthropist, and an innovator in the [[Tin mining|mining of tin]], having been respected by both Chinese and European communities in the early colonial settlement. Another notable Hakka was [[Yap Ah Loy]], who founded [[Kuala Lumpur]]  and was a [[Kapitan Cina]] of the settlement from 1868 to 1885, bringing significant economic contributions, and was also an influential figure among the ethnic Chinese.

In the district of [[Jelebu]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], Hakka people make up more than 90% of the Chinese subgroup with dialect itself acting as a [[lingua franca]] there. This has contributed greatly to the fact that the place is commonly known among Hakka Chinese as "Hakka Village". The greatest concentration of Hakkas in northern peninsular Malaysia is in [[Ipoh]], [[Perak]] and in Kuala Lumpur and its satellite cities in [[Selangor]]. Concentrations of Hakka people in Ipoh and surrounding areas are particularly high. The Hakkas in the [[Kinta Valley]] came mainly from the [[Meizhou|Jiaying Prefecture]] or [[Meixian District|Meixian]], while those in Kuala Lumpur are mainly of [[Huizhou]] origin.<ref name="leo">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaCXCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA87 |title=Global Hakka: Hakka Identity in the Remaking|author= Jessieca Leo|page=87|publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004300279 |date=2015-09-03}}</ref>

A large number of Hakka people are also found in [[Sarawak]], particularly in the city of Kuching and [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], where there is a notable population of Hakka people who speak the "[[Ho Poh]]"{{clarify|date=July 2017}} variant of Hakka.

=====Sabah=====
In [[Sabah]], most of the ethnic Chinese are of Hakka descent. In the 1990s, the Hakkas formed around 57% of the total ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] population in Sabah.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Hakkas of Sabah : a survey of their impact on the modernization of the Bornean Malaysian State|author=Chong, Tet Loi|publisher=Sabah Theological Seminary|date= 2002|pages=32–33 }}</ref>  Hakka is the lingua franca among the Chinese in Sabah to such an extent that Chinese of other subgroups who migrate to Sabah from other states in Malaysia and elsewhere usually learn the Hakka dialect, with varying degrees of fluency.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaCXCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75 |title=Global Hakka: Hakka Identity in the Remaking|author= Jessieca Leo|pages=75–76|publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004300279 |date=2015-09-03}}</ref>

In 1882 the [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] opted to bring in Hakka labourers from [[Longchuan County, Guangdong]]. The first batch of 96 Hakkas brought to Sabah landed in [[Kudat]] on April 4, 1883 under the leadership of Luo Daifeng (Hakka: Lo Tai Fung). In the following decades Hakka immigrants settled throughout the state, with their main population centres in [[Kota Kinabalu]] (then known as Jesselton) and its surroundings (in the districts of [[Tuaran]], [[Penampang]], [[Ranau, Malaysia|Ranau]], [[Papar, Malaysia|Papar]], [[Kota Belud]] as well as a lesser extent to [[Kota Marudu]]), with a significant miniority residing in [[Sandakan]] (mainly ex-[[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping revolutionists]]), and other large populations in other towns and districts, most notably in [[Tawau]], [[Tenom]], [[Kuala Penyu]], [[Tambunan]], [[Lahad Datu]], [[Semporna]], [[Sipitang]], [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]], [[Keningau]] and [[Kudat]]. The British felt the development of North Borneo was too slow and in 1920 they decided to encourage Hakka immigration into Sabah. In 1901, the total Chinese population in Sabah was 13897; by 1911, it had risen 100% to 27801.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chong|first1=Tet Loi|title=The Hakkas of Sabah: A Survey on Their Impact on the Modernization of the Bornean Malaysian State|date=2002|publisher=Sabah Theological Seminary|location=Kota Kinabalu|isbn=978-983-40840-0-4|oclc=51876445|page=28}}</ref> Hakka immigration began to taper off during World War 2 and declined to a negligible level in the late 1940s.

Migration of Hakka people to Indonesia happened in several waves. The first wave landed in [[Riau Islands]] such as in [[Bangka Island]] and Belitung as tin miners in the 18th century. The second group of colonies were established along the [[Kapuas River]] in [[Borneo]] in the 19th century, predecessor to early Singapore residents. In the early 20th century, new arrivals joined their compatriots as traders, merchants and labourers in major cities such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, etc.

In Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, Hakka people are sometimes known as ''Khek'', from the [[Hokkien]] (Southern Min) pronunciation ''kheh'' of 客 (Hakka: ''hak''). However, the use of the word 'Khek' is limited mainly to areas where the local Chinese population is mainly of Hokkien origin. In places where other Chinese subgroups predominate, the term 'Hakka' is still the more commonly used.

=====Bangka=====
Hakka also live in Indonesia's largest [[tin]] producer islands of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] province. They are the second majority ethnic group after [[Indonesian Malays|Malays]]. The Hakka population in the province is also the second largest in Indonesia after [[West Kalimantan]]'s and one of the highest percentages of Chinese living in Indonesia.

The first group of Hakka in Bangka and Belitung reached the islands in the 18th century from Guangdong. Many of them worked as tin mining labourers. Since then, they have remained on the island along with the native Malay. Their situation was much different from those of Chinese and native populations of other regions, where legal cultural conflicts were prevalent since the 1960s until 1999, by which [[Indonesian Chinese]] had finally regained their cultural freedoms. Here they lived together peacefully and still practiced their customs and cultural festivals, while in other regions they were strictly banned by government legislation prior to 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0608/23/humaniora/2898211.htm|publisher=KOMPAS|title=Kebersamaan Tanpa Prasangka |date= August 23, 2006|accessdate=September 10, 2007}}</ref> Hakka on the island of Bangka spoke Hopo dialect mixed with Malay, especially in younger generations. Hakka spoken in Belinyu area in Bangka is considered to be standard.

=====West Kalimantan=====
Hakka people in [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] live alongside [[Teochew people|Teochew]] speaking Chinese. While the Teochews are dominant in the centre of Pontianak, the Hakka are more dominant in small towns along the [[Kapuas River]] in the regencies of Sanggau, Sekadau and Sintang. Their Hakka dialect is originally Hopo which influenced by Teochew dialect and also has vocabulary from the local Malay and [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes. The Hakka were instrumental in the [[Lanfang Republic]].

The Hakka in this region are descendants of gold prospectors who migrated from China in the late 19th century.

The Hakka in [[Singkawang]] and the surrounding regencies of [[Sambas Regency|Sambas]], [[Bengkayang]], [[Ketapang]] and Landak speak a different standard of Hakka dialect to the Hakkas along the Kapuas River. Originally West Borneo has diverse Hakka origin but during the 19th century, a large people came from Jiexi so more Hakkas in the region speak Hopo mixed with Wuhua and Huilai accents that eventually formed the dialect of Singkawang Hakka.<ref name="singkawang">{{cite web|url=http://www.singkawang.us/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=337|title=United Singkawang – Bahasa Hakka di Singkawang|publisher=Singkawang.us|accessdate=15 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508092128/http://www.singkawang.us/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=337|archivedate=8 May 2015}}</ref>

=====Jakarta=====
Hakka people in Jakarta mainly have roots from [[Meizhou]], who came in the 19th century. Secondary migration of the Hakkas from other provinces like Bangka Belitung Islands and West Borneo came later. Mostly Hakka people in Jakarta resided along [[Kelapa Gading]], [[Pluit]], [[Penjaringan]] and surrounding areas, while other Chinese in [[Glodok]], [[Taman Sari (Jakarta)|Taman Sari]] are Hokkien speakers.

====East Timor====
{{main|Chinese people in East Timor}}
[[File:East Timor hakka wedding.jpg|thumb|right|A mixed wedding of East Timorese and Hakka in [[East Timor]], where the four [[flower girl]]s and the mother of the bride on the far right are of Hakka descent.]]
There was already a relatively large and vibrant Hakka community in East Timor before the 1975 [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian invasion]]. According to an estimate by the local Chinese Timorese association, the Hakka population of [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1975 was estimated to be around 25,000 (including a small minority of other Chinese ethnicities from [[Macau]], which like East Timor was a Portuguese colony). According to a book source, an estimated 700 Hakka were killed within the first week of invasion in [[Dili]] alone. No clear numbers had been recorded since many Hakka had already escaped to neighbouring Australia. The recent re-establishment of Hakka associations in the country registered approximately 2,400 Hakka remaining, organised into some 400 families, including part-Timorese ones.

The Timorese Hakka diaspora can currently be found in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Brisbane]], [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] in Australia; in Portugal; in Macau; and in other parts of the world in smaller numbers. They often are highly educated, and many continue their education in either Taiwan or the People's Republic of China, while a majority of the younger generation prefer to study in Australia. The Australian government took some years to assess their claims to be genuine [[refugee]]s and not illegal immigrants, as partially related to the political situation in East Timor at the time. As Asian countries were neither willing to accept them as residents nor grant them political asylum to the Timorese in general, they were forced to live as [[statelessness|stateless person]]s for some time. Despite this condition, many Hakka had become successful, establishing restaurant chains, shops, supermarkets, and import operations in Australia. Since [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|the independence of East Timor]] in 2000, some Hakka families had returned and invested in businesses in the newborn nation.

====India====
{{main|Chinese people in India}}
There used to be sizable Hakka communities at [[Tangra, Calcutta|Tangra]] in [[Kolkata]], the capital of [[West Bengal]], and [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as Bombay). However, from the 1960s, when the [[Vietnam War]] broke out, there has been a steady migration to other countries, which accelerated in the succeeding decades. The majority moved to Canada, while others went to the United States, Australia, Taiwan, Austria and Sweden. The predominant dialect of Hakka in these communities is Meixian.

During the time he held office in Kolkata until the late 2000s, Yap Kon Chung, the hakka ambassador for The Republic of China (Taiwan), protected and helped the Chinese residents in India. Specifically, during the Indo-Chinese war of 1962, oppression of Sino-Indian residents was escalated. Yap then made appeals to Prime Minister Nehru to bridge a bond between the Indian and Chinese people. During his office, he was also the principal at a highly regarded school as well as a political facilitator who helped many families migrate to other countries such as Canada, the United States and parts of Europe until he himself migrated to Toronto, Canada to join his family. Yap died surrounded by family on April 18, 2014, at the age of 97.

===Africa===
====South Africa====
{{further|Chinese South Africans}}
Some Hakka people, notably from Taiwan, migrated to South Africa.

====Mauritius====
The vast majority of Mauritian Chinese are Hakkas. Most of the Mauritian Hakkas emigrated to Mauritius in the mid-1940s came from northeastern Guangdong, especially from the Meizhou or Meixian region.

As of 2008, the total population of [[Sino-Mauritian]], consisting of Hakka and Cantonese, is around 35,000.

====Réunion====

===Americas===
====United States====
Hakka from all over the world have also migrated to the USA. One group is the New England Hakka Association, which reminds its members not to forget their roots. One example is a blog by Ying Han Brach called "Searching for My Hakka Roots".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myhakkaroots.blogspot.com/2013/01/thinking-about-past.html|title=Searching For My Hakka Roots|author=Ying Han Brach|publisher=Myhakka|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> Another group is the Hakka Association of New York, which aims to promote Hakka culture across the five boroughs of New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hakkany.com/home.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801133818/http://www.hakkany.com/|url-status=dead|title=Home|archivedate=August 1, 2015|website=Hakka Association of NY}}</ref> In the mid 1970s, the Hakka Benevolent Association in San Francisco was founded by Tu Chung. The association has strong ties with the San Francisco community and offers scholarships to their young members. There are significant Hakka communities in San Francisco, [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Seattle]] and Los Angeles.

There are around 20,000 Taiwanese Hakkas in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|first=Him Mark |last=Lai|title=Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|page=245}}</ref>

====Canada====
There are several Hakka communities across Canada. One group that embraces on Hakka culture in this diverse country is the Hakka Heritage Alliance.

====Jamaica====
Most [[Chinese Jamaicans]] are Hakka; they have a long history in [[Jamaica]]. Between 1845 and 1884, nearly 5000 Hakkas arrived in Jamaica in three major voyages. The Hakkas seized the opportunity to venture into a new land, embracing the local language, customs and culture. During the 1960s and 1970s, substantial migration of Jamaican Hakkas to the US and Canada have occurred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinesejamaican.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512200323/http://www.chinesejamaican.com/history.html|url-status=dead|title=We are Chinese Jamaicans Worldwide|archivedate=May 12, 2013|website=We are Chinese Jamaicans Worldwide}}</ref>  The Hakkas in Jamaica came mainly from [[Dongguan]], [[Huiyang]] and [[Bao'an County|Bao'an]] counties of Guangdong Province.<ref name="leo"/>

====Suriname====
The Chinese in [[Suriname]] are homogeneous as a group and the great majority can trace their roots to Huidong'an ({{lang|zh-hans|惠东安}}) in [[Guangdong]].<ref name="leo"/>

==Population==
At a 1994 seminar of the World Hakka Association held in [[Meixian District|Meixian]], statistics showed that there were 6,562,429 Hakkas living abroad.<ref name="Pioneers"/>

In 2000, the worldwide population of Hakka was estimated at 36,059,500 and in 2010 it was estimated at 40,745,200.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Another estimate is that approximately 36 million Hakka people are scattered throughout the world. More than 31 million lives in over 200 cities and counties spread throughout five provinces of China (Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan) as well as Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hattaway|first1=Paul|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary|date=2004|publisher=Piquant|location=Carlisle|isbn=9780878083619|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzEOKNPsv2EC&q=An+additional+two+million+Hakka+live+in+Taiwan%2C+1.4+million+in&pg=PA72}}</ref>

==Hakkaology==
Hakkaology ({{lang|zh|客家學}}) is the academic study of the Hakka people and their culture. It encompasses their origins, identity, language, traits, architecture, customs, food, literature, history, politics, economics, diaspora and genealogical records.

The study of the Hakka people first drew attention to Chinese and foreign scholars, missionaries, travellers and writers during the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] era in the middle of the nineteen century. Many wanted to know more about the Hakka people who had started the [[Taiping Rebellion]] which almost overthrew the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Ernest John Eitel]], a prominent German missionary, was one of those who took a great interest in this area.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Colonial Hong Kong and Modern China: Interaction and Reintegration | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vcg3cN4NbdsC&q=hakkalogy&pg=PA144| isbn=9789622097209| last1=Lee| first1=Pui-tak| date=2005-09-01}}</ref> [[Theodore Hamberg]], who also wrote an early English-language account of the Taiping Rebellion, is also considered a forefather of Hakka studies in the West.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Many foreign scholars were full of admiration of the Hakka people. According to prominent [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Victor Purcell]], the Hakkas "have a stubbornness of disposition that distinguishes them from their fellow Chinese".

==Revolutionary, political and military leadership==
{{see also|List of notable Hakkas}}
The Hakkas have had a significant influence, disproportionate to their smaller total numbers, on the course of modern Chinese and [[overseas Chinese]] history, particularly as a source of revolutionary, political and military leaders.<ref name=Davis/>

Hakkas started and formed the backbone of the [[Taiping Rebellion]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spence|first1=Jonathan D.|title=God's Chinese son : the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan|date=1997|publisher=W.W.

The uprising, also known as [[Jintian Uprising]], originated at the Hakka village of Jintian in Guiping, Guangxi province. It was led by the failed Qing scholar, [[Hong Xiuquan]], who was influenced by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries. Hong's charisma tapped into a consciousness of national dissent which identified with his personal interpretations of the Christian message. His following, who were initially Hakka peasants from Guangxi, grew across the southern provinces.

The hugely disciplined Taiping army, which included women in their ranks, captured stoutly defended towns and cities from the Qing defenders. Four of the six top Taiping leaders are Hakkas: Hong Xiuquan, [[Feng Yunshan]], [[Yang Xiuqing]] and [[Shi Dakai]]. In 1851, less than a year after the uprising, the [[Taias established. It had, at one stage, occupied one-third of China and almost toppled the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Hong Rengan]], the Premier of the Kingdom, was the first person in China to advocate modern-style government and opening up reforms. The kingdom lasted for thirteen years, from 1851 to 1864.

Hakkas continued to play leading roles during the [[Xinhai Revolution]] that overthrew the Qing dynasty and the republican years of China. When [[Sun Yat-sen]] was small, together with other children in his village, he used to listen to an old Taiping soldier telling them stories about the heroics of the Taipings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4KR6_Dr_Sun_Yat_sen_Chinese_Cultural_Plaza_Honolulu_HI|title=Dr. Sun Yat-sen – Chinese Cultural Plaza – Honolulu, HI – Statues of Historic Figures on Waymarking.com|publisher=Waymarking.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> This influenced Sun and he proclaimed that he shall be the second Hong Xiuquan.

When it was overrun in 1934 by the Nationalist army in the [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|Fifth]] of its [[Encirclement Campaigns]], the Communists began their famous [[Long March]] with 86,000 soldiers, of which more than 70% were Hakkas. The Fifth Encirclement Campaign was led by Nationalist Hakka general, Xue Yue. During the retreat, the Communists managed to strike a deal with the Hakka warlord controlling Guangdong province, Chen Jitang, to let them pass through Guangdong without a fight. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] had its rank structure from 1955 to 1964, the highest number of generals, totalling 54, came from the small Hakka county of [[Xingguo County|Xingguo]] in Jiangxi province. The county had also previously produced 27 Nationalist generals.

During the same period, there were 132 Hakkas out of 325 generals in Jiangxi, 63 Hakkas out of 83 generals in Fujian, and 8 Hakkas out of 12 generals in Guangdong respectively, not mentioning those from Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. The number could have been significantly higher if the majority of the personnel who started the Long March had not perished before reaching its destination.

Prominent Hakka communist leaders include: Marshal [[Zhu De]], the founder of the Red Army, later known as the People's Liberation Army; [[Ye Ting]], Commander-in-chief, [[New Fourth Army]], one of the two main Chinese communist forces fighting the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (the other main communist force, [[Eighth Route Army]], was commanded by Zhu De); Marshal [[Ye Jianying]], who led the overthrow of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976, which marked the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]; and [[Hu Yaobang]], where the memorial service for his death sparked off a pro-democracy movement which led to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] in 1989. In Guangdong, China's most prosperous province, the "Hakka clique" ({{lang|zh-hans|客家帮}}) has consistently dominated the provincial government. Guangdong's Hakka governors include Ye Jianying, [[Ding Sheng (general)|Ding Sheng]], [[Ye Xuanping]] and [[Huang Huahua]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suizhou.org/?viewthread-39809.html |title=֮_̳__˵ |author=Discuz!

Besides playing leading roles in all the three major revolutions of China, Hakkas had also been prominently involved in many of the wars against foreign intrusion of China. During the [[First Opium War]], [[Lai Enjue]] led the Qing navy against the British at the [[Battle of Kowloon]] in 1839 and [[Yan Botao]] commanded the coastal defence at the [[Battle of Amoy]] in 1841. [[Feng Zicai]] and [[Liu Yongfu]] were instrumental in the defeat of the French at the [[Battle of Bang Bo]] which led to the French [[Retreat from Lạng Sơn]] and the conclusion of the war in 1885. During the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|Japanese invasion of Taiwan]] in 1895, the Taiwanese militia forces led by [[Qiu Fengjia]] and formed mainly by Hakkas, were able to put up a stiff resistance to the Japanese when the Qing army could not. During the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the heroism of [[Xie Jinyuan]] and his troops, known as the "Eight Hundred Warriors" ({{lang|zh-hant|八百壯士}}) in Chinese history, gained international attention and lifted flagging Chinese morale in their successful [[Defence of Sihang Warehouse]] against the more superior Japanese Imperial Army. However, in the ensuing [[Battle of Nanjing]], seventeen Nationalist generals were killed in action, of which six were Hakkas.<ref>{{cite web | title = 在南京保卫战中17位殉国的将军有6位是客家人 | url=http://www.hakkaonline.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=54797&extra=page%3D4}}</ref>

During the war against the Japanese, both the commander-in-chiefs of the two main Chinese communist forces, Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, are Hakkas: Zhu De and Ye Ting. On the Nationalist side, Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui were commander-in-chiefs for the 9th and 4th War Zones respectively. Called the "[[Patton]] of Asia" by the West and the "God of War" ({{lang|zh-hant|戰神}}) by the Chinese, Xue was China most outstanding general during the war, having won several major battles which killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops. [[Luo Zhuoying]] was the commander-in-chief for the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force (Burma)|1st Route Expeditionary Forces, Burma]] (China's first participation of a war overseas), 1942.

During the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] from 1941–1945, the Dong River Column guerrilla force ({{lang|zh-hant|東江縱隊}}) was a constant harassment to the Japanese troops. The force, whose members were mostly Hakkas and led by its legendary commander, Zeng Sheng, was highly successful due to its strong Hakka network. Noteworthy accomplishments of the guerrilla force included the aiding of British and Commonwealth prisoners of war to escape successfully from Japanese internment camps and the rescuing of twenty American pilots who parachuted into Hong Kong when they were shot down.<ref>{{Cite book | title = East River Column | jstor=j.ctt1xwfs6| last1=Sui-Jeung| first1=Chan| year=2009| publisher=Hong Kong University Press| isbn=9789622098503}}</ref> Since the Xinhai Revolution, [[Meizhou]] alone which consisted of 7 Hakka counties has produced 474 generals (there are more than 200 Hakka or partial-Hakka counties i

Overseas Hakkas have also been prominent politically in the countries they had migrated to, many of which are leading political figures of the countries or the Chinese communities there. Since the 20th century, there have been twenty Hakkas who had become [[heads of state]] or [[heads of government]] in different countries.<ref>{{cite web|title = Hakka Chinese Political Leadership in East and Southeast Asia, and South America|url = https://liamchingliu.wordpress.com/2014/09/20/hakka-chinese-political-leadership-in-east-and-southeast-asia-and-south-america/}}</ref>

==Quotes on the Hakka==

* "''The Hakka are able to mould outstanding military men, their hardworking conduct having  been developed through years of arduous livelihood in the mountainous regions. Praises of the Guangdong spirit by the Japanese actually refer to the Hakka spirit.
