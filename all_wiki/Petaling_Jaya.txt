'''Petaling Jaya''' ({{IPA-may|pətalɪŋ dʒaja|ms}}), commonly called "'''PJ'''" by the locals, is a city in [[Petaling District]], in the state of [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]]. Originally developed as a satellite township for [[Kuala Lumpur]], the capital of Malaysia, it is part of the [[Greater Kuala Lumpur]] area. Petaling Jaya was granted city status on 20 June 2006. It has an area of approximately {{convert|97.2|km²|1|abbr=out}}.

Petaling Jaya is surrounded by Kuala Lumpur to the east, [[Sungai Buloh]] to the north, [[Shah Alam]], the capital of Selangor, and [[Subang Jaya]] to the west and [[Bandar Kinrara]] ([[Puchong]]) to the south.

== History==
The city was developed during post-war [[British Malaya]] on a piece of {{convert|1200|acres|0|abbr=on}} rubber estate, the ''Effingham Estate'', around Old Klang Road to address the overpopulation of the capital [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive Summary|url=http://www.mbpj.gov.my/web/guest/ringkasan-eksekutif|website=Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya (MBPJ)|accessdate=2 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418182252/http://www.mbpj.gov.my/web/guest/ringkasan-eksekutif|archive-date=18 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since 1952, PJ witnessed a dramatic growth in terms of population size and geographical importance. The development of Petaling Jaya commenced in 1952 with the construction of 800 houses centred on the area known as "Old Town" today.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Lieutenant-General Sir [[Gerald Templer]] (then the British High Commissioner of Malaya and Petaling District council chairman) planned for Petaling Jaya to be a satellite town to prevent people from assisting the communists; the earlier housing areas were fenced off from the surrounding area. The first two main roads built in Petaling Jaya were simply called "Jalan 1" or Road 1 and "Jalan 2" or Road 2. Road 1 was later named [[Jalan Templer]] while Road 2 was named Jalan Othman after Othman Mohamad, former Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Selangor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Until the end of 1953, the town was administered by the [[Kuala Lumpur City Hall|Kuala Lumpur district officer]]. The Petaling Jaya Town Authority headed by N.A.J. Kennedy commenced administrating Petaling Jaya in 1954. On 24 August 1959, Encik Abdul Aziz bin Haji Mohd Ali became the first Malayan to head the PJ Authority. Administratively and historically, it was considered part of Kuala Lumpur. However, Petaling Jaya ceased to be part of Kuala Lumpur when the latter became a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. It then became a township in its own right within the state of [[Selangor]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Southern Petaling Jaya, from Section 8 to PJ Old Town, had the first settlements that were established around 1953. As development progressed, Northern Petaling Jaya, on the other side of the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]] was developed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The first shopping complex in Petaling Jaya was [[Jaya Supermarket|Jaya Shopping Centre]] (better known as Jaya Supermarket). Built in 1974, it is located in Section 14.

On 1 January 1977, following the passing of the [[Local Government Act 1976|Local Government Act the previous year]], the Petaling Jaya Town Authority was reorganised to become Petaling Jaya [[Municipal]] Council or Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya (MPPJ). Petaling Jaya progressed rapidly due to the massive rural-urban [[Immigration|migration]]. As more people from rural areas immigrated, Sungai Way and Subang districts along with areas such as [[Subang Jaya]], Seksyen 52 (New Town or colloquially known as "State", the name of the first, former cinema in the area) developed in areas under the jurisdiction of the municipality.

[[File:PJ SA Evolution.svg|600px|thumb|left|Evolution of Petaling Jaya's borders since 1977]]

Following a boundary realignment exercise in January 1997, parts of Petaling Jaya including [[Subang Jaya]], [[UEP Subang Jaya|USJ]], [[Putra Heights]], and [[Bandar Sunway]] were ceded to the newly formed [[Subang Jaya City Council|Subang Jaya Municipal Council]] or MPSJ at the time. In exchange, the MPPJ annexed [[Bandar Utama]], [[Sungai Buloh]], [[Bukit Lanjan]] and [[Kota Damansara]] from the Petaling District Council (''Majlis Daerah Petaling'', MDP), which disestablished itself after the cession.

Due to the proximity of the city to the capital of Malaysia, Petaling Jaya had and have been the headquarters of many federal government departments such as the Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara (National Registration Department, 1958-2004),<ref>{{cite web|title=National Registration Department|url=http://www.jpn.gov.my/en/maklumatkorporat/pengenalan/|accessdate=21 Aug 2015}}</ref> the Jabatan Arkib Negara Malaysia (Malaysian National Archive Department, 1961-1982),<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkib Negara Malaysia|url=http://www.arkib.gov.my/web/guest/sejarah|accessdate=21 Aug 2015}}</ref> and the Jabatan Kimia Malaysia (Malaysian Chemistry Department, 1957-).<ref>{{cite web|title=Jabatan Kimia Malaysia|url=http://www.kimia.gov.my/bm/profil/sejarah.html|accessdate=21 Aug 2015}}</ref>

===Covid-19 pandemic===

In 2020, the city was part of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, or the movement control order (MCO), where residents were confined to their homes and only allowed out for essential purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Star|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/16/malaysia-announces-restricted-movement-measure-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref>

On April 27, the market in the city's oldest quarter, [[Old Town, Petaling Jaya|Old Town]], was shut down <ref>{{cite web|title=The Edge Markets|url=https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/covid19-pj-oldtown-placed-under-lockdown-about-2900-residents-affected|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref> down after a seafood trader there tested positive for the virus, prompting health authorities to call for customers to get themselves screened.

Less than two weeks later, large parts of Old Town came under a full government lockdown on May 10 after the discovery of 26 COVID-19 cases from the market area. Over 2,900 people in the quarter were fenced in and prevented from leaving the area, as authorities cordoned off 40ha of the area with barb wire from the rest of the city. Scheduled to last until May 23, the lockdown was eventually lifted on May 21.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Star|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/05/21/enhanced-mco-in-parts-of-pj-old-town-lifted-barbed-wire-fences-removed|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref>

After a lull in cases thanks to a nationwide lifting of restrictions, the city began to see a rise in cases in October following a spike in virus infections after infections rose in the eastern state of Sabah, where elections were held in September.

Over 800 people working at the Tropicana Golf and Country Resort were barred from leaving their hostel, as authorities put the compound under a total lockdown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Covid-19: Enhanced MCO for Tropicana Resort workers' hostel|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/10/10/covid-19-enhanced-mco-for-tropicana-resort-workers-hostel-from-1201am-monday-oct-12|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Enhanced MCO on resort workers' dorms in Petaling Jaya|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/546011|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref> Five people there tested positive for the virus, including two who had just returned from the eastern state of Sabah.<ref>{{cite web|title=Covid-19: Close contacts of Tropicana Resort employees who tested positive undergoing mandatory 14-day quarantine

In the first two weeks of the month, at least four malls in the city reported COVID-19 infections.<ref>{{cite web|title=12 Malls in KL and PJ that have recently released statements about Covid-19 cases|url=https://www.buro247.my/lifestyle/news/malls-kl-pj-statements-about-covid-19-cases.html|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=3 Damansara security personnel positive for Covid-19|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/10/631432/3-damansara-security-personnel-positive-covid-19|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref> This included the 1Utama shopping mall, which was ordered to close for seven days from October 12.<ref>{{cite web|title=1Utama shut down over Covid-19 outbreaks|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/10/631135/1utama-tropicana-golf-club-shut-down-over-covid-outbreaks|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref>

Meanwhile, a teacher at the Taman Sea secondary school also tested positive for the virus on October 7, leading students and staff members there to self-quarantine.<ref>{{cite web|title=SMK Taman Sea teacher tests positive for Covid-19|url=https://www.thesundaily.my/local/smk-taman-sea-teacher-tests-positive-for-covid-19-BF4474344|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref> A few days later, education authorities in the country ordered 298 schools <ref>{{cite web|title=298 schools in PJ, Shah Alam, Subang Jaya to close as Covid-19 worsens|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/546116|accessdate=12 Oct 2020}}</ref> in Selangor state's Petaling district, which include Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam and Subang Jaya, to shut down from Oct 12 to Oct 25 as COVID-19 cases in the country rose.

== Climate ==
Petaling Jaya is one of the wettest cities in Malaysia. It is warm with an average maximum of 30 degrees Celsius and receives heavy rainfall all year round, roughly more than {{convert|3300|mm|in|abbr=on}} of average rainfall annually. The city has no particular true dry season, but June and July are the driest months. Mostly each month average rainfall receives more than {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Thunderstorms and extreme rainstorms are common, and it is one of the highest lightning strike areas in the world. But due to normal global temperature variations, Petaling Jaya is experiencing severe drought with frequent water rationing among neighbourhoods.

On 20 June 2006, Petaling Jaya was granted a city status and Dato' Ahmad Termizi Puteh, a former Yang di-Pertua MPPJ, automatically became the first mayor (''Datuk Bandar'') of Petaling Jaya. Petaling Jaya's local council changed its name to [[Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya]] (MBPJ) or Petaling Jaya City Council following the granting of city status. On 15 August, Dato' Ahmad Termizi Puteh retired from the post of mayor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/17/central/15161671&sec=central |title=Archives &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=17 August 2006 |accessdate=9 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224222114/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F8%2F17%2Fcentral%2F15161671&sec=central |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He was later replaced by Dato' Hj. Mohamad Roslan Sakiman.

The residents of Petaling Jaya are served by four [[Members of Parliament]] from [[Pakatan Harapan]], which is DAP's [[Tony Pua]] in {{pseat|Damansara}}, PKR's [[Maria Chin Abdullah]] in {{pseat|Petaling Jaya}}, PKR's [[Sivarasa Rasiah]] in {{pseat|Sungai Buloh}} and PKR's [[Wong Chen]] in {{pseat|Subang}}.

==City sections==
[[File:Petaling Jaya City Sections.svg|230px|thumb|right|Petaling Jaya city sections]]
{{See also|List of Petaling Jaya city sections}}
Petaling Jaya is divided into several sections. Some are subdivided into smaller neighbourhoods (''kejiranan''), for example SS5D. Some sections have their own names (SS1 as Kampung Tunku), while other sections are grouped together (SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6 and SS7 as part of Kelana Jaya). Besides that, Petaling Jaya also comprises the affluent township of [[Damansara, Kuala Lumpur|Damansara]]. Note that SS is not the same as Seksyen but as the short acronym for Subang-Sungai Way instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Demographics==
{{As of|2014}}, Petaling Jaya claimed 613,977 residents living in the area of {{convert|51.4|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=off}}. The actual population by 2015 would have been a little over 550,000 residents without taking into account the total population of the Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya conurbation which would have resulted in a total population of 1.5 million.<ref>http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/malaysia-population/cities/</ref>

==Landmarks==
[[File:Kota Darul Ehsan.jpg|thumb|The Kota Darul Ehsan arch over the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]], marking the entrance to Petaling Jaya from Kuala Lumpur.]]
A prominent landmark in PJ is the [[Kota Darul Ehsan]] arch which symbolically marks the boundary between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Petaling Jaya. This arch straddled the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway (Lebuhraya Persekutuan)]] which was originally the only highway link between Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur. However, many links now exist as alternatives to the congested Federal Highway.

Close to the Kelana Jaya Line's [[Taman Jaya LRT station|Taman Jaya station]] are the [[Petaling Jaya Museum]], as well as the Thai [[Wat Chetawan]] temple. This ornate building is very popular amongst the Buddhist community. A short drive ahead is PJ State, the nickname for the Central Business District of Petaling Jaya with the landmark Menara MBPJ as a focal point. PJ State is more formally referred to as PJ New Town.

[[Damansara, Selangor|Damansara]] is the main shopping hub of Petaling Jaya with many of the city's shopping malls being located there. Some of the notable shopping malls in the city include The Curve, Ikea, [[IPC Shopping Centre]], One Utama, The Starling, 3 Damansara (formerly Tropicana City Mall), Jaya One, Empire Damansara, Sunway Pyramid and Paradigm Mall. SS2 Mall had a brief existence between 2011 and 2015.

==Economy==
[[File:Amcorp Mall & Business Centre, Petaling Jaya.jpg|thumb|The Amcorp Mall &amp; Business Centre as seen from the [[Taman Jaya LRT station]].]]

The 1980s saw the establishment of shopping malls like The Atria in [[Damansara Jaya]] and [[Subang Parade]] in the nearby suburb or satellite town of [[Subang Jaya]]. The Atria provided the opportunity for residents to patronise either the Japanese Kimisawa or the French [[Printemps]] department stores, as well as a [[Burger King]] restaurant.

In 1995, [[1 Utama]] commenced operations at Bandar Utama. [[JUSCO|Jaya Jusco]], a Japanese department store which had operated since 1984 at Taman Tun Dr Ismail later relocated as one of the anchor tenants of 1 Utama.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[Tesco]] supermarket commenced operations in [[Mutiara Damansara]] in 2003. This was quickly followed by the Ikano Power Centre in 2004 and [[The Curve (shopping mall)|The Curve]] in 2005. The Ikano Power Centre (now renamed as [[IPC Shopping Centre]] since 2011) houses Southeast Asia's largest [[IKEA]] Swedish furniture store. At about the same time, the 1 Utama new wing had commenced operations, which then became the largest shopping mall in Malaysia (or currently number 11 largest shopping mall in the world).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Dataran Sunway.jpg|thumb|The Dataran Sunway commercial hub in Kota Damansara, Petaling Jaya]]

In 2004, Giant Hypermarket commenced operations in [[Kelana Jaya]]. This complex houses the [[Giant Hypermarket]] and some shops to create a more shopping centre style. It is easily accessed off the Damansara–Puchong Expressway. Located right opposite across the LDP is Paradigm Mall, which opened in mid-2012. Paradigm Mall was developed by WCT on the former Kelana Jaya garbage landfill.

==Properties in Petaling Jaya==
Active property developers in Petaling Jaya are PKNS, (which are the main pioneer of development for PJ), Sunway Bhd, Tropicana Bhd, AmCorp, Mah Sing Group and Guocoland as well as many others. Due to the size of Petaling Jaya township, properties development in the area also includes small to medium-sized developers such as Sri Aman Development and Nusmetro.

Before the rapid development and commercialisation of Petaling Jaya, there were only a handful of residential developments which comprises mostly low to medium-cost apartments as well as terrace houses. By 2005, luxurious condominiums, semi detached houses and bungalows are a common sight within the area. These high end properties are mostly located at Bukit Gasing, Section 16 & 17, SS7 Kelana Jaya, and more recent ones such as Tropicana, and Ara Damansara.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Transport==
[[File:Kelana Jaya station (Kelana Jaya Line), Petaling Jaya, Selangor.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Kelana Jaya LRT station]] on the [[Kelana Jaya Line]]]]
Transportation facilities and infrastructure are well developed in Petaling Jaya. Bus services were initially provided by Sri Jaya between the early 1950s until the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Some SEA Park residents may recall the old Sri Jaya [[British Leyland|Leyland]] [[Albion Motors|Albion]] buses on the No. 241 service struggling to climb the relatively steep Jalan 21/1.

The introduction of the IntraKota bus system by [[DRB-HICOM|DRB-Hicom]] saw the replacement of Sri Jaya and the mini-buses by the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} At the same time, some of the Petaling Jaya-Kuala Lumpur bus routes were serviced by Metrobus. The PJ City Bus operated by [[Petaling Jaya City Council]] has the same concept with CAT Penang (and Selangor Smart Bus in other region), which now provide 6 routes around [[Bandar Utama]], [[Damansara Damai]] and PJ Old Town.

The introduction of the [[Kelana Jaya Line|PUTRA LRT]] service in 1998 saw the addition of the Putraline feeder bus services. The combination of Putraline and Putra LRT brought a relief to many Petaling Jaya residents especially those who had to rely on public transportation.

In 2006, [[RapidKL]] took over the operations of IntraKota, STAR and PUTRA LRT. Today, public transportation is provided by RapidKL in the form of buses as well as the KL Light Rapid Transit System - [[Kelana Jaya Line]]. The line has seven (previously five) stations within Petaling Jaya.

More recently, since 2017, the newly constructed MRT [[Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line]], part of the [[Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit|KVMRT]] project, runs through the northern part of Petaling Jaya's municipal area, including Mutiara Damansara, Kota Damansara and Bandar Utama.

Petaling Jaya has three access points to the national highway system: [[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]] via [[Kota Damansara]], [[Damansara, Selangor|Damansara]], and [[Subang, Selangor|Subang]]. Internally, highways such as the [[Damansara–Puchong Expressway]], [[Sprint Expressway]] and the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]] exist.

Petaling Jaya is also served by the [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Subang Airport]] which is located immediately to the west of Petaling Jaya.

This was a training centre under the auspices of RIDA or the Rural and Industrial Development Authority.  Essentially it was also the inspiration of Dato' [[Onn Jaafar]], the founder and former president of UMNO or the [[United Malays National Organisation]]. This UiTM facility can be regarded as Petaling Jaya's oldest college.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
