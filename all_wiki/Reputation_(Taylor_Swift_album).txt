'''''Reputation''''' (stylized in all lowercase) is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released on November 10, 2017, by [[Big Machine Records]]. Following the commercial success of her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), Swift was involved in disputes with several high-profile celebrities, which became a subject of widespread [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] scrutiny. She hence secluded herself from the press and social media, where she had maintained an active presence with a large following. During this period, Swift wrote ''Reputation'' with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], as an effort to revamp her state of mind.

Swift wrote the songs inspired by her publicized personal life, categorizing the album's content into two themes: one is vengeance influenced by fame and the excessive media gossip, and the other is peace and love amidst the tumultuous affairs. Some commentators found the album an intimate record in which Swift expresses her innermost vulnerability to an ideal lover and discovers her true self. The album's music builds on [[electropop]] with a dark, heavy [[electronic music|electronic]] production accompanied by surging [[synthesizers]], pulsing programmed [[drum machine|drums]], and manipulated vocals. It also incorporates elements of [[electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[urban music|urban]] styles such as [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Unlike her previous albums, Swift did not promote ''Reputation'' through press interviews. Seven singles supported ''Reputation'', including the US number one "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]", top-five hit "[[...Ready For It?]]", and [[Mainstream Top 40|US airplay]] number one "[[Delicate (Taylor Swift song)|Delicate]]".

The album was Swift's fourth consecutive album to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of over one million copies, and also reached number one on charts in countries including Australia, Canada, and the UK. The best-selling album by a female artist of 2017, ''Reputation'' sold 4.5&nbsp;million copies and was supported by a [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|world tour]], which ran from May to November 2018 and became the highest-grossing North American tour of all time. Critical reaction to ''Reputation'' was generally positive: the brash electronic production polarized reviewers, but Swift's songwriting received mostly favorable responses. It received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2019, and featured on ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'s}} list of the best albums of the 2010s decade.

==Production==
[[File:Antonoff in Tucson (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jack Antonoff]] produced six songs on ''Reputation''. His recording sessions with Swift took place mostly at his home studio.|alt=Antonoff playing a guitar]]
During her seclusion from social media, Swift worked on her sixth studio album with two production teams: one with [[pop rock]] producer [[Jack Antonoff]], and the other with Swedish producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. She had previously worked with all three producers on ''1989''. By choosing a smaller production team compared to that of ''1989'', Swift envisioned that the album would be more coherent but still "versatile enough to kill ''1989''."<ref name="iheartradio"/> She wrote the songs as a "defense mechanism" against the tumultuous media gossip targeting her during the time, and as a means to revamp her state of mind. Elaborating on the songwriting, Swift told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in a 2019 interview that she followed the songwriting for her 2014 single "Blank Space", on which she satirized her perceived image. She said, "I took that template of, OK, this is what you're all saying about me. Let me just write from this character for a second."<ref name="RS">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-moments-that-couldnt-fit-in-our-cover-story-890700/|title=9 Taylor Swift Moments That Didn't Fit in Our Cover Story|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|date=2019-09-30|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=2019-12-09|archive-date=2019-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001144210/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-moments-that-couldnt-fit-in-our-cover-story-890700/|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to the media commotion, love and friendship are major inspirations on the album, which corroborates Swift's trademark autobiographical storytelling through her songs.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|first=Alex|last=Suskind|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2019-05-09|archive-date=2019-08-12|access-date=2020-10-13|url-status=live}}</ref>

<blockquote>She is great at remembering the heart and soul of the process. Some people forget it — sometimes something works and everyone starts to rewire it. But she's really great at knowing what it's about: talking about what the hell is going on in your life and somehow finding a way to take that exact emotion and make a song out of it. That was the theme of those sessions: "Let’s just tell this story, whatever that story is, because that's the whole point."<ref name="EWint"/></blockquote>

As Swift wanted to record the album in secrecy, he kept his studio computer offline to prevent a possible [[internet leak]], and deleted the recording trials once the [[audio mixing|mixing]] and [[audio mastering|mastering]] finalized.<ref name="SoS">{{cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/jack-antonoff|title=Jack Antonoff|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|first=Tom|last=Doyle|date=January 2018|access-date=2020-10-14}}</ref> The tracks produced by Antonoff feature a 1980s-styled sound equipped with pulsing [[synthesizers]] and upbeat [[chorus (song)|chorus]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2017/11/30/16720386/jack-antonoff-dr-luke-taylor-swift-kesha-pink-pop-music|title=The Cure for Dr. Luke?|first=Lindsay|last=Zoladz|work=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]|date=2017-11-30|access-date=2020-10-13}}</ref> For instance, Antonoff produced the song "[[Call It What You Want (Taylor Swift song)|Call It What You Want]]" using an [[Akai MPC]] and a [[Yamaha DX7]] synthesizer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ7QGp3jbik&list=PL1V61Z1u2aj2T8CQYl2dk03cEnflM3oJB&index=2928|title=Jack Antonoff Tweets About Making Taylor Swift's 'Call It What You Want'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|via=[[YouTube]]|date=2017-11-06|access-date=2020-10-14}}</ref> He cited that the song "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]", which would be the album's lead single, "came from nowhere ...

Swift also highlighted out that she played an [[alter ego]] in ''Reputation'', explaining "it was just so fun to play with on [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|tour]] — the darkness and the bombast and the bitterness and the love and the ups and the downs of an emotional-turmoil record".<ref>{{cite web|title=Taylor Swift's 'Lover' Certified Platinum After Just 4 Weeks|url=https://etcanada.com/news/514258/taylor-swifts-lover-certified-platinum-after-just-4-weeks/|last=Furdyk|first=Brent|date=September 27, 2019|website=[[ET Canada]]|access-date=April 10, 2020|archive-date=April 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200424231342/https://etcanada.com/news/514258/taylor-swifts-lover-certified-platinum-after-just-4-weeks/|url-status=live}}</ref> The album's title alludes to many of its lyrical themes, such as handling fame and media scrutiny of celebrities. The cover artwork, which portrays Swift over a background of a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] publication, reinforces these themes. The title also is derived from lyrics on the songs "[[End Game (song)|End Game]]" ("Big reputation, big reputation, ooh, you and me we got big reputations") and "[[Delicate (Taylor Swift song)|Delicate]]" ("My reputation's never been worse").<ref>{{cite web|title=reputation by Taylor Swift|url=https://genius.com/albums/Taylor-swift/Reputation|website=Genius|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920195750/https://genius.com/albums/Taylor-swift/Reputation|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=Songwriters need to communicate, and part of communicating correctly is when you put out a message that is understood the way you meant it. ''Reputation'' was interesting because I'd never before had an album that wasn't fully understood until it was seen live. When it first came out everyone thought it was just going to be angry; upon listening to the whole thing they realized it's actually about love and friendship, and finding out what your priorities are.

Swift explained to [[iHeartRadio]] that the idea for the production of the song came to her in a dream. Swift described the concept to producer [[Max Martin]], who used Swift's voice and pitched it down to create the desired effect in the post-chorus.<ref name="iheartradio" /> The song's lyrics were inspired by events taking place in the [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|season 7]] [[The Dragon and the Wolf|finale episode]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and four of the series' central female characters: [[Sansa Stark]], [[Arya Stark]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]], and [[Cersei Lannister]].<ref name="GoT" /> "Don't Blame Me" is a moody, atmospheric, "thunderous" electropop song with a dark, "thick" production of slick [[synthesizer]]s, echoes and self-[[harmonization]], building into a [[Gospel music|gospel]]-backed [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] anthem. The song is noted for Swift's "fierce" vocal performance, and the [[Goth subculture|gothic]] "love-as-a-drug" imagery.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":6" /> "[[Delicate (Taylor Swift song)|Delicate]]" is a melodic "[[Electro (music)|electro]]-[[ballad]]" and [[love song]], with tropical house and [[dance-pop]] inflections, and a notable [[Resonance|resonant]] [[refrain]].<ref name=":6" /><ref name="Delicate radio" /> Swift's goal for the song was to use a [[vocoder]] to create an "emotional" and "vulnerable" sound for the track. The song is about "what happens when you meet somebody that you really want in your life and then you start worrying about what they've heard before they met you".<ref name="iheartradio" />

|description="[[Look What You Made Me Do]]" combines [[dance-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[electroclash]]. The chorus is largely [[a capella]] with percussions, sampling the melody of the song "[[I'm Too Sexy]]" by [[Right Said Fred]].}}

The sixth track, "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]", started out as a poem and is "about realizing that you couldn't trust certain people, but realizing you appreciate the people you can trust."<ref name="iheartradio"/> It interpolates the song "[[I'm Too Sexy]]" by the British dance-pop group [[Right Said Fred]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/hear-taylor-swifts-new-song-look-what-you-made-me-do.html|title=Hear Taylor Swift's Fiery, Vengeful New Song 'Look What You Made Me Do'|last=Lockett|first=Dee|date=August 25, 2017|work=Vulture|access-date=November 11, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825102107/http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/hear-taylor-swifts-new-song-look-what-you-made-me-do.html|archive-date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> Another ''Game of Thrones''-inspired track, the line "I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined" acts as a reference to [[Arya Stark]]'s kill list in the show.<ref name="GoT" /> "So It Goes..." opens with a murky segment and advances into a trap-lite chorus. Lyrically, it sees Swift "getting caught up in the moment" and "reflecting on just how a new love interest might help her out of her fixations", using a [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] imagery.<ref name=":6" /> "[[Gorgeous (Taylor Swift song)|Gorgeous]]" has been described as a "fizzy" and "delightful", [[Music radio|radio]]-friendly [[Pop music|pop]] song,<ref name=":42">{{Cite news|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=October 20, 2017|title=Taylor Swift Plays Nice on Romantic New Song 'Gorgeous'|work=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-plays-nice-on-romantic-new-song-gorgeous-w509741|url-status=live|access-date=July 13, 2020|archive-date=October 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020071630/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-plays-nice-on-romantic-new-song-gorgeous-w509741}}</ref> that depicts "the pursuit of a maddening love interest", whom Swift describes as "gorgeous".<ref name=":03">{{cite web|last=Brandle|first=Lars|date=October 20, 2017|title=Taylor Swift's 'Gorgeous' New Single Has Arrived: Listen|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8006719/taylor-swift-gorgeous-single-release|access-date=October 20, 2017|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-date=October 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020094302/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8006719/taylor-swift-gorgeous-single-release|url-status=live}}</ref> The song has an [[electropop]] production that employs an [[808 drum]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|date=2017-10-20|title='Gorgeous' Doubles Down on Taylor Swift's New Attitude|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/gorgeous-taylor-swift-review-hip-hop/543525/|access-date=2020-10-10|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}}</ref> over a bubbling, [[Chime (bell instrument)|chime]]-like beat.

The eleventh track, "Dancing With Our Hands Tied", begins as a melancholic [[downtempo]] song that discusses Swift's "will-we-won’t-we tale" of [[star-crossed lovers]], "separated by an unkind fate",<ref name=":6" /> and also sees her singing about how "her every action is under the microscope".<ref>{{cite web|last=Michaels|first=Wendy|title=Taylor Swift's "Dancing With Our Hands Tied" Is Making Fans Feel So Sad|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/the-meaning-of-dancing-with-our-hands-tied-by-taylor-swift-is-making-fans-feel-so-sad-3266561|access-date=2020-07-13|website=Elite Daily|language=en|archive-date=July 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717081753/https://www.elitedaily.com/p/the-meaning-of-dancing-with-our-hands-tied-by-taylor-swift-is-making-fans-feel-so-sad-3266561|url-status=live}}</ref> The sultry "Dress" contains Swift's breathy vocals,<ref name=":6" /> with lyrics that she "came up with like a year before".<ref name="iheartradio" /> It has been described as Swift's "most overtly sexual work yet"<ref name=":6" /> and "sexiest song to-date",<ref name=":4">{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8031203/taylor-swift-dress-reputation-best-song|title=Yes, the Best Song on Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' Is the Slow Jam: Critic's Take|last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|date=November 10, 2017|work=Billboard|access-date=November 11, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111011951/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8031203/taylor-swift-dress-reputation-best-song|archive-date=November 11, 2017}}</ref> bringing out "her sensual side at last".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swifts-reputation-finally-drops-13-surprises-w511436|title=Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' Finally Drops: 13 Surprises|last=Johnston|first=Maura|date=November 10, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=November 11, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111024539/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swifts-reputation-finally-drops-13-surprises-w511436|archive-date=November 11, 2017}}</ref> Opening with a [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] sound, "This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things" heavily references Swift's highly publicized feud with American rapper [[Kanye West]] and television personality [[Kim Kardashian]].

{{Quote|quote=At the very beginning of the album I was pretty proud of coining the term: 'There will be no explanation. There will just be ''Reputation''{{'}}, and so that was what I decided was going to be the album, and I stuck with it. I didn't go back on it. I didn't try to explain the album because I didn't feel that I owed that to anyone. There was a lot that happened over a couple of years that made me feel really, really terrible. And I didn't feel like expressing that to them. I didn't feel like talking about it. I just felt like making music, then going out on the road and doing a [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|stadium tour]] and doing everything I could for my fans.

''Reputation'' received generally positive reviews from music critics. Most reviewers praised Swift's mature artistry, while some denounced the themes of fame and gossip.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/11/10/taylor-swift-reputation-heres-what-critics-saying/851566001/|title=Taylor Swift 'Reputation': Here's what critics are saying|first=Maeve|last=McDermott|date=2017-10-11|access-date=2020-10-15|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received a weighted average score of 71 based on 28 reviews.<ref name="metacritic" />

''[[The Guardian]]'' writer [[Alexis Petridis]] opined ''Reputation'', "may be mired in bitterness and gossip, but the pop star's songwriting smarts and lyrical prowess are impossible to deny on her sixth album", noting the songs see "Swift cutting her last ties with her Nashville roots in favour of the blare and honk of EDM-influenced pop".<ref name="guardianrev" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Rob Sheffield]] writes ''Reputation'', "shows the darker, deeper side of the pop mastermind". Sheffield also remarked, "As one of the all-time great pop masterminds, she's trying something new, as she always does."<ref name="rsreview" /> Roisin O'Connor of ''[[The Independent]]'' says "Call It What You Want" is "arguably, the best song Swift has ever made", also praising [[Jack Antonoff]]'s production, calling it "essential" to the album; "[Antonoff's] love of Eighties synth-pop is the perfect counterbalance to Max Martin and Shellback's dance and electronic touch".<ref name="independentrev">{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Roisin|title=Taylor Swift, 'reputation', album review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/taylor-swift-reputation-review-album-jack-antonoff-max-martin-kanye-west-kim-future-ed-sheeran-a8047141.html|website=The Independent|access-date=November 10, 2017|date=November 10, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110051740/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/taylor-swift-reputation-review-album-jack-antonoff-max-martin-kanye-west-kim-future-ed-sheeran-a8047141.html|archive-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref> [[Neil McCormick]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' states, "''Reputation'' is a big, brash, all-guns-blazing blast of weaponised pop that grapples with the vulnerability of the human heart as it is pummelled by 21st-century fame." McCormick continued, "This is an album with blockbuster event status, preceded by a satirical hit ("Look What You Made Me Do") in which she provocatively ditched her "girl-next-door" image for something more glamorously sophisticated."<ref name="telegraphrev" /> Troy Smith from ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' said the album served as a reminder of Swift's songwriting talent, labeling "New Year's Day", "End Game", "Delicate" and "Dress" as standouts of the album.<ref name="reception2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/11/taylor_swifts_reputation_remai.html|title=Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' remains stellar on new album|last=Smith|first=Troy|date=November 10, 2017|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|access-date=November 10, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110114839/http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/11/taylor_swifts_reputation_remai.html|archive-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name="The Times">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pop-review-taylor-swift-reputation-stk8w7b7n|title=Pop review: Taylor Swift: Reputation|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=November 10, 2017|first=Will|last=Hodgkinson|access-date=November 12, 2017|archive-date=November 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111051506/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pop-review-taylor-swift-reputation-stk8w7b7n|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a negative review, Geoff Nelson of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' gave the album a D+ rating writing, "Swift's sixth studio album, is a bloated, moving disaster." Nelson continued, "''Reputation'' doesn't improve past its initial singles, even if the chorus of "...Ready for It?" is one of the few vestiges of ''1989'' Taylor on the album. Elsewhere, Swift finds trouble: She raps, she adopts [[African-American Vernacular English]], and she bizarrely collaborates with Future." Nelson called "Gorgeous", "Delicate", and "Call It What You Want" the "strongest moments on the album".<ref name="cosrev">{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Geoff|title=Album Review: Taylor Swift – Reputation|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/album-review-taylor-swift-reputation/|website=Consequence of Sound|access-date=November 10, 2017|date=November 10, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110232003/https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/album-review-taylor-swift-reputation/|archive-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>
