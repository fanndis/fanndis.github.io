{{:List of Scandal episodes}}

=== Season 1 ===
{{main|Scandal (season 1)}}
The first season of Scandal introduced Olivia Pope ([[Kerry Washington]]) and the various members at her firm. In addition, it introduced the President of the United States, Fitzgerald Grant III ([[Tony Goldwyn]]) and his [[White House Chief of Staff|chief of staff]] Cyrus Beene ([[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]]). The season focuses on the lives of the team members, the relationship between Olivia and the President (her former employer), and the mystery surrounding Amanda Tanner's ([[Liza Weil]]) involvement with the [[White House]], among other cases the team had solved.

=== Season 2 ===
{{main|Scandal (season 2)}}
An assassination attempt is made on Fitz's life, which almost kills him. As a result, Sally Langston ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]) takes over as President, much to Cyrus' dismay. After surviving, Fitz decides to get a divorce, which Mellie ([[Bellamy Young]]) tries to avoid by somehow convincing her OB/GYN to induce her labor four weeks early. Huck ([[Guillermo Díaz (actor)|Guillermo Díaz]]) is arrested for the attempted assassination after being framed by his girlfriend Becky (Susan Pourfar). After David ([[Joshua Malina]]) helps Huck go free, Huck, Olivia and her team trick Becky to show up at the hospital where she is arrested. Fitz finds out that Verna ([[Debra Mooney]]) was behind the assassination and kills her. At the funeral, he reveals to Olivia that he does not want a divorce as he is devastated after learning about the rigging from Verna.

The second arc focuses on finding the mole who is leaking classified information from the White House. Olivia and the team investigate the case after figuring out that the CIA Director's suicide was actually a murder. Olivia gets to know Captain Jake Ballard ([[Scott Foley]]), who works with the leader of B613, Rowan ([[Joe Morton]]), who orders Jake to get close to Olivia. At the end of the season, Mellie gives Fitz an ultimatum: either he becomes loyal to her, or she goes on national television and reveals Fitz's affair with Olivia. Fitz chooses Olivia, which makes Mellie reveal the affair. Fitz announces his re-election campaign. As Olivia and the team continue to investigate who the mole is, Huck manages to capture Charlie ([[George Newbern]]), who reveals the mole's identity: Billy Chambers ([[Matt Letscher]]). They figure out that Billy is working with David, who steals the Cytron card, but frames Billy and gives Cyrus the card in exchange for being reinstated as US Attorney. At the end, Olivia's name is leaked to the press as being Fitz's mistress, and it is revealed that Rowan is Olivia's father.

=== Season 3 ===
{{main|Scandal (season 3)}}
After Olivia's name is leaked to the press as Fitz's mistress, Olivia Pope & Associates faces financial troubles when all their clients fire them. The firm accepts "new" clients in order to pay the bills. Rowan becomes more involved with Olivia's life, which begins to affect her, and leads Huck and Jake to investigate B613. They discover during a military action code named "Operation Remington", Fitz shot down a civilian aircraft over Iceland and Olivia's mother was one of over 300 casualties. Determined to find out the truth about Operation Remington, the firm investigates Rowan and learns that a passenger was removed from the flight by a Federal Marshal just prior to take off. Quinn ([[Katie Lowes]]) starts to hang out with Charlie, who sets her up to kill a security guard who was an eye-witness to the Federal Marshal's removal of the passenger. As a result of Quinn's inadvertent murder, Huck tortures her and she leaves the firm.

Meanwhile, Fitz faces problems when Congresswoman Josephine "Josie" Marcus ([[Lisa Kudrow]]) is in the running to win the Democratic Party primary against Senator Samuel Reston ([[Tom Amandes]]) and become the first female president of the United States. Cyrus tries his best to find dirt on Marcus in order to ruin her campaign, but fails. After Olivia finds out that Fitz shot down the plane which killed her mother, she declines the offer of being the campaign manager for Fitz's re-election and becomes the manager for Josephine Marcus'. After an incident with Marcus' sister, Josephine backs out of her campaign. The second part of the season focuses more on the re-election campaign as Olivia has taken over as the campaign manager. At the same time, Sally announces that she is running for President by being an Independent. As a result, Fitz chooses the Governor of California, Andrew Nichols ([[Jon Tenney]]), as his new Vice Presidential running-mate. Nichols develops a relationship with the First Lady, Mellie. The campaign faces problems when Sally, stricken with guilt over murdering Daniel ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]), almost reveals the truth at a debate. Cyrus asks Jake to help protect the secret, which he does by killing James ([[Dan Bucatinsky]]) to prevent exposing Cyrus's involvement in the cover up. The president's eldest children, Jerry ([[Dylan Minnette]]) and Karen Grant ([[Madeline Carroll]]), come to the White House for an interview, but Olivia soon figures out that they aren't pleased with their parents.

=== Season 4 ===
{{main|Scandal (season 4)}}
After the passing of a close friend, Olivia returns to D.C. and is shocked by the state of OPA. The first half of the season focuses on Jake's arrest for the death of Jerry Grant after Rowan forces Tom ([[Brian Letscher]]) to name Jake as the operator. Rowan continues to try to make everyone believe Jake is guilty, which inspires Olivia to find out the truth for herself. After forcing Tom to reveal Rowan as his operator, Fitz, Jake, and Olivia make a plan to arrest Rowan. Unfortunately, the plan fails, causing Rowan to shut down B613 and start eliminating B613 agents. Olivia tries to kill Rowan when she confronts him, but he manages to flee. Abby ([[Darby Stanchfield]]) is now the White House Press Secretary, and is struggling with gaining the respect of Cyrus and Fitz, because they choose to demean her by calling her "Red" instead of Abby. Later in the season, Abby finds herself stressed even more by the presence of her abusive ex-husband, who has been nominated for Virginia State Senator, and she enlists Leo Bergen ([[Paul Adelstein]]) to help ruin his campaign. Quinn has stayed in contact with both Abby and Huck, in addition to trying to find Olivia.

Mellie struggles with the death of her son, Jerry. She finally comes to terms with her loss after finding out that Jerry was murdered due to being deliberately exposed to bacterial meningitis rather than contracting the disease naturally, and she chooses to form an alliance with Elizabeth North ([[Portia de Rossi]]). Later, after having an affair with him, Mellie discovers the true nature of Nichols, who threatens to tell the press about their affair. In the season finale, members of a grand jury gathered by David for the B613 case were killed after the initial hearing. OPA and David begin investigating the scene, and realized that Rowan was responsible. He also blackmailed Mellie into giving the names of the members, causing her to feel responsible. Cyrus later finds out the truth, but decides not to tell Fitz. After seeking advice from Maya ([[Khandi Alexander]]), Olivia and Jake decides to reveal B613 to the CIA, but it backfires. They later came up with a plan to frame Rowan for embezzlement of the funds at the museum he is working at, having him imprisoned. Later, Fitz finds out the truth about what Mellie and Cyrus had done; he orders them to leave the White House. Elizabeth then takes Cyrus' place as the chief of staff. In the last scene, he reunites with Olivia.

=== Season 5 ===
{{main|Scandal (season 5)}}
Olivia and Fitz now embrace being a couple, going public with their relationship, thus leading to Olivia taking on many more of the First Lady-established roles in the White House. She continues managing Olivia Pope & Associates, which Marcus Walker ([[Cornelius Smith Jr.]]) becomes a part of, even using it to spin her image once the world looks down on her due to her new relationship with the President. However, by the midpoint of the season she feels too suffocated in this new life, and so she leaves Fitz, the White House, and secretly has an abortion. Olivia returns to her old life, dealing with the aftermath of her and Fitz's break up, and Rowan gets out of jail and reclaims Jake as his lapdog, while Fitz starts sleeping around and is put in his place by Abby. Meanwhile, Cyrus and Mellie are forced to move on with their lives now that Fitz has kicked them out, Cyrus struggling to figure out what he wishes to do next, and Mellie running for and being elected as a senator, being her next step in making a run for the presidency, which is the main focal point of the second half of the season.

Mellie makes a run for the presidency and takes Olivia on as her campaign manager, having to go against the likes of current Vice President Susan Ross ([[Artemis Pebdani]]), Hollis Doyle ([[Gregg Henry]]), and Pennsylvania Governor Francisco Vargas ([[Ricardo Antonio Chavira|Ricardo Chavira]]), the latter of which has his campaign managed by Cyrus. David and Elizabeth push for Susan's presidential run, and David begins to fall for her while also entering into a sexual relationship with Liz, ending in heartbreak for two of the three parties involved. Quinn and Charlie begin seeing each other, and Cyrus also has marital problems with Michael ([[Matthew Del Negro]]). Jake marries Vanessa Moss ([[Joelle Carter]]) as per Rowan's arrangement, and also kills her father, also upon Rowan's request. Olivia brutally murders former Vice President Nichols when he starts to recover from his paralysis and threatens to expose a great number of secrets, Fitz learns of her secret abortion, and the season concludes with Mellie and Frankie named as the respective Republican and Democratic nominees, with Jake and Cyrus selected as their respective VPs.

The final season follows the first year of Mellie's presidency and how she adjusts to being the leader of the free world after everything she's been through previously. Olivia finds herself struggling to balance both sides of being the most powerful person in the world: the white hat life as Mellie's Chief of Staff, and the black hat life of Command of B613, and her dip towards the latter strains her relationships with her friends and family, particularly after she orchestrates the murder of Bashranian President Rashad and his niece and nearly allows Quinn to be killed. Cyrus, now Vice-President after Olivia and Jake forced Luna Vargas to commit suicide at the previous season's end, finds himself on the cusp of finally achieving the position he has desired for so long. Fitz adjusts to his post-presidency life and his desire to establish his legacy. With Olivia having departed for the White House, Olivia Pope & Associates, now renamed Quinn Perkins & Associates (QPA) goes through a reboot, as Quinn and the remaining gladiators must now rebuild the firm's reputation from the bottom up. Soon, however, everyone is caught up in one last scandal stirred up by Cyrus that threatens to expose all of their various crimes over the past seven seasons to the public and land them all in prison or worse.

In an interview with showrunner Shonda Rhimes, she revealed that the fourth season would highlight [[Darby Stanchfield]]'s character, Abby Whelan. She said "Season 4 is Abby's season.

[[File:Kerry Washington LF.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The series focuses on the story of [[Olivia Pope]], portrayed by [[Kerry Washington]].]]
Shonda Rhimes stated that the fourth season would focus more on the core characters, as opposed to the third season where more characters were introduced. Rhimes explained why: "[[Kerry Washington]] couldn't work 14 hours a day, so we had to tell our story in a different way, and that necessitated other people both picking up the slack in beautiful ways".<ref name="rhimes" />

[[Shonda Rhimes]] said in an interview that the fifth season would begin only a few days after the events in the fourth-season finale. She stated that the fifth season would see Olivia and Fitz the only people standing in a single piece, as she said "The world had been fairly blown apart for everybody except Olivia and Fitz. Everybody else was in a fairly blown apart place ... We pick up right there in that environment and we see what happens next." Rhimes continued talking about Cyrus and Mellie and their situation of not being in the White House anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/scandal-news-update-executive-producer-shonda-rhimes-talks-about-season-5-plot-142374/|title='Scandal' News, Update: Executive Producer Shonda Rhimes Talks About Season 5 Plot|work=[[The Christian Post]]|last=Donguines|first=Arvin|date=August 5, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034003/http://www.christianpost.com/news/scandal-news-update-executive-producer-shonda-rhimes-talks-about-season-5-plot-142374/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Rhimes also confirmed that "the reconstitution" of Team OPA would happen in the fifth season, as Rhimes revealed in an interview with ''[[TVLine]]'', as she explained that the Gladiator conceit was sidelined a bit in the fourth season to instead "healing" Olivia.

When talking about the presidential campaign storyline in the show, showrunner [[Shonda Rhimes]] talked to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' about the character Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III not being president anymore. She said, "I can't tell you any of that — but there is a plan. Tony is not going anywhere; where would he go?!" Other cast members shared their opinions about Grant's next arc without the presidency. [[Tony Goldwyn]], the actor playing Fitz, commented, "He'll be much happier as the post-president than as the president." [[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]], playing Cyrus Beene, said, "I'd love our show to invent a great role for a president after he's out [of] office that would reverberate back to the real world." Executive producer [[Betsy Beers]] voiced her excitement about the character doing "anything he wanted". Other cast members compared Fitz's next move with former U.S. presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/scandal-what-should-fitz-do-879169|title='Scandal': What Should Fitz Do When He's Out of Office?|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|date=April 7, 2016|accessdate=April 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507092221/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/scandal-what-should-fitz-do-879169|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The show has been met with generally favorable reviews, with a collective score of 64/100 based on 28 critics from [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/scandal|title=Scandal – Season 1|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 6, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69wwqmDmG?url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/scandal|archive-date=August 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Based on advanced [[screener (promotional)|screener]]s sent before the show's premiere, [[Alan Sepinwall]] of ''[[HitFix]]'' stated:
<blockquote>To be perfectly honest, after watching four episodes of ''Scandal'', I'm not 100 percent clear on what it is that Olivia and her team (most of them fellow lawyers who don't practice law) do, nor on exactly what the show is. I'm also not entirely sure that it matters. ''Scandal'' is a good example of what a show is about being far less important than how it's about it.<ref name="AlanSepinwall" /></blockquote>

[[IndieWire]], a daily news site reviewed the first season of ''Scandal'', comparing it to the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] show ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]''. Stating that the premise was similar and that ''Damages'' is a hell of a show, and worthy of all the accolades; but it's what ''Scandal'' could be, if the envelope was pushed a bit more, and if the show took more risks."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/b2aed7b0-ab28-11e1-bcc4-123138165f92|title=Kerry Washington To Test Primetime Emmy History With 'Scandal' (A Drought For Black Actresses)|first=Tambay A.|last=Obenson|date=May 31, 2012|work=IndieWire|access-date=May 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623232057/http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/b2aed7b0-ab28-11e1-bcc4-123138165f92|archive-date=June 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[Newsday]]''{{'}}s Verne Gay called the series "fun", but added:
<blockquote>All the tropes, cliches and (especially) soap conventions series creator [[Shonda Rhimes]] has poured so generously into ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'' over the years have been poured right back into this [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Beltway]] [[potboiler]]. The hairpin plot twists. The whiplash character reveals. The bumptious moralizing. The Strong Woman/Wronged Woman character type, and its direct corollary, Weak, Middle-Aged, Married Man Who Secretly Likes Hookers. It's all here!<ref name="Premiere" /></blockquote>

The show however received many more positive reviews during its second season. ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Ryan McGee compared to the show to ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', stating:
<blockquote>''Scandal'' has quite a bit to say about how people in general operate. By extension, it also has a lot to say about the type of television people respond to in this ever-splintered viewing environment. In a year in which almost all ratings are down, ''Scandal'' has gone up. Its insane storytelling really isn't insane at all. Many want to dub ''House of Cards'' the future of television as a whole. In terms of distribution, this may be true. But by giving audiences what they want, and then giving them so much more than they ever expected, ''Scandal'' is the show those looking toward the future of television should be aiming to actually produce, regardless of the medium in which it is viewed.<ref name="McGee" /></blockquote>

[[Alan Sepinwall]] of ''[[HitFix]]'' also changed his stance:
<blockquote>When ''Scandal'' debuted last spring, I wasn't sure what to make of it, beyond recognizing that Kerry Washington had the goods to carry a series and Shonda Rhimes had fashioned an excellent role for her.
This season, though, Rhimes has kicked the show up to another level by ditching the Crisis of the Week procedural format in favor of reinventing ''Scandal'' as a gonzo hybrid of conspiracy thriller and high-stakes soap opera, involving election rigging, a presidential assassination attempt, a failed internal White House coup, and all sorts of other crazy shenanigans. It's ludicrous on virtually every level; it's also an enormous amount of fun, thanks to the writing and the performances.<ref name="Performances" /></blockquote>
