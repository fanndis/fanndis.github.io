In 2013, Arkansas Children's Hospital successfully treated 12-year-old Kali Hardig for primary amoebic [[meningoencephalitis]]. Her case became national news because she is one of only two known survivors of this disease, which she contracted after swimming in a warm-water lake park. Physicians at Arkansas Children's Hospital credit Kali's mother Traci with acting swiftly to get her child to the Emergency Department, saving her life. A team of laboratory staff, infectious disease physicians, critical care specialists and rehabilitation medicine experts worked with Kali for weeks to help her overcome the devastating illness. Anti-fungal medications and antibiotics were used. Physicians also contacted the CDC to get permission to use an experimental anti-amoeba drug that had to be shipped from the Atlanta headquarters. Arkansas Department of Health officials said 99 percent of people who contract the [[naegleria fowleri]] parasite die. Kali spent 22 days in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at ACH, followed by several weeks on the hospital's rehabilitation floor before going home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/12/health/arkansas-amoeba-survivor/|title=Brain-eating amoeba survivor to begin school|author=Elizabeth Cohen|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>

In 2007 ACH treated the case of 20-month-old Jacob Esses, which spurred the recall of the [[Aqua Dots]] toy.

ACH has been profiled a number of times on the [[Discovery Health Channel]]. In the fall of 2007, the program “Surgery Saved My Life” examined how three physicians in the Arkansas Children's Hospital Vascular Anomalies Center of Excellence handled patients’ potentially fatal vascular tumors. Featured in the documentary were James Suen, M.D., a head and neck surgeon at ACH and the [[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]] (UAMS); Lisa Buckmiller, M.D., medical director of the ACH Vascular Anomalies Center; and Rick Jackson, M.D., a surgeon at the hospital and associate professor of Surgery in the UAMS College of Medicine. One patient featured in the profile was a 12-year-old girl who was born in Shanghai with what is believed to be the largest vascular tumor ever seen; Chinese surgeons had been reluctant to operate on the tumor.<ref name="DHC2007">{{cite web|url=https://secure.archildrens.org/press_room/viewPressRelease_Story.asp?PRID=5806|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121228010635/https://secure.archildrens.org/press_room/viewPressRelease_Story.asp?PRID=5806|url-status=dead|title=Archived Press Releases - Press Room - Arkansas Children's Hospital|date=28 December 2012|archivedate=28 December 2012|website=archive.fo}}</ref>
