'''''Billboard''''' (stylized in [[all lowercase]]), is an American entertainment media brand owned by the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, a division of [[MRC (company)|MRC]] Media & Info. It publishes pieces involving news, video, opinion, reviews, events, and style, and is also known for its [[Billboard charts|music charts]], including the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Billboard Global 200|Global 200]], tracking the most popular songs and albums in different genres. It also hosts events, owns a publishing firm, and operates several TV shows.

''Billboard'' was founded in 1894 by William Donaldson and James Hennegan as a trade publication for bill posters. Donaldson later acquired Hennegan's interest in 1900 for $500. In the early years of the 20th century, it covered the entertainment industry, such as circuses, fairs, and [[burlesque]] shows, and also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. ''Billboard'' began focusing more on the [[music industry]] as the [[jukebox]], [[phonograph]], and [[radio]] became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including ''Amusement Business'' in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, ''Billboard'' was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Billboard, November 1, 1894 first issue.png|thumb|left|upright|First issue of ''Billboard'' (1894)]]
The first issue of ''Billboard'' was published in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]] by William Donaldson and James Hennegan on November 1, 1894.<ref name="LampelLant"/><ref name="Broven 2009 p. 187">{{cite book |last=Broven | first=J. |title=Record Makers and Breakers: Voices of the Independent Rock 'n' Roll Pioneers |publisher=University of Illinois Press |series=Music in American life |year=2009 | isbn=978-0-252-03290-5 | url=https://archive.org/details/recordmakersbrea0000brov |url-access=registration | access-date=November 5, 2015 | page=[https://archive.org/details/recordmakersbrea0000brov/page/187 187]}}</ref> Initially, it covered the advertising and [[Flyposting|bill posting]] industry, and was known as ''Billboard Advertising''.<ref name="Gussow. 2015">{{cite book|last=Gussow.|first=Don|title=The New Business of Journalism: An Insider's Look at the Workings of America's Business Press|date=1984|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0-15-165202-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newbusinessjourn0000guss/page/32 32–33]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newbusinessjourn0000guss/page/32}}</ref><ref name="godfrey"/>{{efn|Some sources say it was called ''The Billboard Advertiser''<ref name="LampelLant"/>}} At the time, billboards, posters, and paper advertisements placed in public spaces were the primary means of advertising.<ref name="godfrey"/> Donaldson handled editorial and advertising, while Hennegan, who owned Hennegan Printing Co., managed magazine production.

After a brief departure over editorial differences, Donaldson purchased Hennegan's interest in the business in 1900 for $500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500|1900|r=-2}}}} today) to save it from bankruptcy.<ref name="HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared 1994"/><ref name="Hoffmann 2004 p. 212"/> That May, Donaldson changed it from a monthly to a weekly paper with  a greater emphasis on breaking news. He improved editorial quality and opened new offices in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, London, and Paris,<ref name="booksdirectory"/><ref name="Hoffmann 2004 p. 212"/> and also re-focused the magazine on outdoor entertainment such as fairs, carnivals, circuses, [[vaudeville]], and burlesque shows.<ref name="LampelLant"/><ref name="booksdirectory"/> A section devoted to circuses was introduced in 1900, followed by more prominent coverage of outdoor events in 1901.<ref name="on Project 1943 p. 184"/> ''Billboard'' also covered topics including regulation, a lack of professionalism, economics, and new shows. It had a "stage gossip" column covering the private lives of entertainers, a "tent show" section covering traveling shows, and a sub-section called "Freaks to order".<ref name="LampelLant"/> According to ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', Donaldson also published news articles "attacking censorship, praising productions exhibiting 'good taste' and fighting [[yellow journalism]]".<ref name="Radel 1994"/>

As railroads became more developed, ''Billboard'' set up a mail forwarding system for traveling entertainers. The location of an entertainer was tracked in the paper's Routes Ahead column, then ''Billboard'' would receive mail on the star's behalf  and publish a notice in its "Letter-Box" column that it has mail for them.<ref name="LampelLant"/> This service was first introduced in 1904, and became one of ''Billboard''{{'}}s largest sources of profit<ref name="Radel 1994"/> and celebrity connections.<ref name="LampelLant"/> By 1914, there were 42,000 people using the service.<ref name="HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared 1994"/> It was also used as the official address of traveling entertainers for draft letters during [[World War I]].<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news|newspaper=Newsweek|date=April 4, 1949|title=New Boss for Billboard|pages=57–58}}</ref> In the 1960s, when it was discontinued, ''Billboard'' was still processing 1,500 letters per week.<ref name="Radel 1994"/>

In 1920, Donaldson made a controversial move by hiring African-American journalist James Albert Jackson to write a weekly column devoted to African-American performers.<ref name="LampelLant"/> According to ''The Business of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media'', the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers.<ref name="LampelLant"/> Jackson was the first black critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race.<ref name="Radel 1994"/> Donaldson died in 1925.<ref name="LampelLant"/>

===Focus on music===
''Billboard''{{'}}s editorial changed focus as technology in recording and playback developed, covering "marvels of modern technology" such as the [[phonograph]], [[record player]]s, and wireless radios.<ref name="LampelLant"/> It began covering coin-operated entertainment machines in 1899, and created a dedicated section for them called "Amusement Machines" in March 1932.<ref name="Hoffmann 2004 p. 212"/> ''Billboard'' began covering the motion picture industry in 1907,<ref name="on Project 1943 p. 184"/> but ended up focusing on music due to competition from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name="Bloom 2013 p. 83">{{cite book | last=Bloom | first=K. | title=Broadway: An Encyclopedia | publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-135-95020-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib2awFyFUKoC&pg=PT83 | access-date=November 6, 2015 | page=83}}</ref> It created a radio broadcasting station in the 1920s.<ref name="booksdirectory"/>

The jukebox industry continued to grow through the [[Great Depression]], and was advertised heavily in ''Billboard'',<ref name="booksdirectory"/>{{rp|262}} which led to even more editorial focus on music.<ref name="booksdirectory"/> The proliferation of the phonograph and radio also contributed to its growing music emphasis.<ref name="booksdirectory"/> ''Billboard'' published the first [[Billboard charts|music hit parade]] on January 4, 1936,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sixty-years-of-hits-from-sinatra-to-sinatra-1322429.html | title=Sixty years of hits, from Sinatra to ...

It had eight charts by 1987, covering different genres and formats,<ref name="Hoffmann 2004 p. 212"/> and 28 charts by 1994.<ref name="Radel 1994"/>

By 1943, ''Billboard'' had about 100 employees.<ref name="on Project 1943 p. 184">{{cite book | author=Writers' Program of the Works Projects Administration in the State of Ohio| title=Cincinnati, a Guide to the Queen City and Its Neighbors | publisher=Best Books | year=1943 | isbn=978-1-62376-051-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dW-52BWC4LoC&pg=PA184 | access-date=November 7, 2015 | page=184}}</ref> The magazine's offices moved to Brighton, Ohio in 1946, then to New York City in 1948.<ref name="Radel 1994"/> A five-column tabloid format was adopted in November 1950 and coated paper was first used in ''Billboard''{{'}}s print issues in January 1963, allowing for photojournalism.<ref name="Hoffmann 2004 p. 212"/> Billboard Publications Inc. acquired a monthly trade magazine for candy and cigarette machine vendors called ''Vend'', and, in the 1950s, acquired an advertising trade publication called ''Tide''.<ref name="booksdirectory"/> By 1969, Billboard Publications Inc. owned eleven trade and consumer publications, a publisher called [[Watson-Guptill]] Publications, a set of self-study cassette tapes, and four television franchises. It also acquired ''Photo Weekly'' that year.<ref name="booksdirectory"/>

Over time, subjects that ''Billboard'' still covered outside of music were spun-off into separate publications: ''Funspot'' magazine was created in 1957 to cover amusement parks, and ''Amusement Business'' was created in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment. In January 1961, ''Billboard'' was renamed as ''Billboard Music Week''<ref name="godfrey"/><ref name="booksdirectory"/> to emphasize its new exclusive interest in music.<ref name="Bloom 2013 p. 83"/> Two years later, it was renamed to just ''Billboard''.<ref name="booksdirectory"/><ref name="Hoffmann 2004 p. 212"/> According to ''The New Business Journalism'', by 1984, Billboard Publications was a "prosperous" conglomerate of trade magazines, and ''Billboard'' had become the "undisputed leader" in music industry news.<ref name="Gussow. 2015"/> In the early 1990s, ''Billboard'' introduced ''Billboard Airplay Monitors'', a publication for disc jockeys and music programmers.<ref name="godfrey"/> By the end of the 1990s, ''Billboard'' dubbed itself the "bible" of the recording industry.<ref name="godfrey">{{Cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of American Radio |first1=Donald G. |last1=Godfrey |first2=Frederic A. |last2=Leigh |year=1998 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |isbn=978-0-313-29636-9|page=45}}</ref>

===Changes in ownership===
''Billboard'' struggled after its founder William Donaldson died in 1925, and, within three years, was once again heading towards [[bankruptcy]].<ref name="booksdirectory"/> Donaldson's son-in-law Roger Littleford took over in 1928 and "nursed the publication back to health".<ref name="booksdirectory"/><ref name="newsweek"/> His sons Bill and Roger became co-publishers in 1946<ref name="newsweek"/> and inherited the publication in the late 1970s after Roger Littleford's death.<ref name="booksdirectory"/> They sold it to private investors in 1985 for an estimated $40&nbsp;million.<ref name="Jackson Keller Flood 2010 p. 638"/> The investors cut costs and acquired a trade publication for the Broadway theatre industry called ''Backstage''.<ref name="booksdirectory"/>

In 1987, ''Billboard'' was sold again to Affiliated Publications for $100&nbsp;million.<ref name="Jackson Keller Flood 2010 p. 638">{{cite book | last=Jackson | first=K.T. | last2=Keller | first2=L. | last3=Flood | first3=N. | title=The Encyclopedia of New York City: Second Edition | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-300-18257-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI5ERUmHf3YC&pg=PT638 | access-date=November 5, 2015 | page=638}}</ref> Billboard Publications Inc. became a subsidiary of Affiliated Publications called BPI Communications.<ref name="booksdirectory"/> As BPI Communications, it acquired ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[Adweek]]'', ''[[Marketing Week]]'', and ''[[Mediaweek]]'', and also purchased [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|Broadcast Data Systems]], a high-tech firm for tracking music airtime.<ref name="booksdirectory"/> Private investors from Boston Ventures and BPI executives re-purchased a two-thirds interest in Billboard Publications for $100&nbsp;million, and more acquisitions followed. In 1993, it created a division known as Billboard Music Group for music-related publications.<ref name="booksdirectory"/>

By the time CEO Gerald Hobbs retired in 2003, VNU had grown substantially larger, but had a large amount of debt from the acquisitions. An attempted $7&nbsp;billion acquisition of [[IMS Health]] in 2005 prompted protests from shareholders that halted the deal; it eventually agreed to an $11&nbsp;billion takeover bid from investors in 2006.<ref name="booksdirectory"/>
