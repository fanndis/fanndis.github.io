==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of Bengal}}

The exact origin of the word ''Bangla'' is unknown, though it is believed to come from "Vanga", an ancient kingdom and geopolitical division on the Ganges delta in the Indian subcontinent. It was located in southern Bengal, with the core region including present-day southern West Bengal (India) and southwestern Bangladesh. In Islamic tradition, it is said to come from "Bung/Bang", a son of Hind (the son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Hām]], who was a son of [[Noah in Islam|Noah]]) who colonised the area for the first time.<ref name="riaj" /> The suffix ''"al"'' came to be added to it from the fact that the ancient [[raja]]s of this land raised mounds of earth 10 feet high and 20 in breadth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called "al".

During the 18th century, the [[Nawabs of Bengal]] became the region's ''de facto'' rulers. The title of the ruler is popularly known as the ''Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa'', given that the Bengali Nawab's realm encompassed much of the eastern subcontinent. The Nawabs forged alliances with European colonial companies, which made the region relatively prosperous early in the century. Bengal accounted for 50% of the gross domestic product of the empire. The Bengali economy relied on [[textile manufacturing]], shipbuilding, [[saltpetre]] production, craftsmanship and agricultural produce. Bengal was a major hub for international trade – silk and cotton textiles from Bengal were worn in Europe, Japan, Indonesia and Central Asia.<ref>John F. Richards (1995), The Mughal Empire, p. 202, Cambridge University Press</ref><ref name="google5"/> Annual Bengali shipbuilding output was 223,250 tons, compared to an output of 23,061 tons in the nineteen colonies of North America.

Two decades after [[Vasco Da Gama]]'s landing in [[Calicut]], the Bengal Sultanate gave permission for the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] settlement in Chittagong to be established in 1528. It became the first European colonial enclave in Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate lost control of Chittagong in 1531 after Arakan declared independence and the established Kingdom of Mrauk U.

Portuguese ships from Goa and [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] began frequenting the port city in the 16th century. The ''[[cartaz]]'' system was introduced and required all ships in the area to purchase naval trading licenses from the Portuguese settlement. [[Slave trade]] and piracy flourished. The nearby island of [[Sandwip]] was conquered in 1602. In 1615, the [[Portuguese Navy]] defeated a joint [[Dutch East India Company]] and Arakanese fleet near the coast of Chittagong.

Supported by the Muslim aristocracy, the British government created the province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in 1905; the new province received increased investment in education, transport and industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/e/eastern_bengal_and_assam.html |title=Eastern Bengal and Assam – Encyclopedia |publisher=Theodora.com |access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref> However, the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition of Bengal]] created an uproar in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and the [[Indian National Congress]].

The Raj was slow to allow self-rule in the colonial subcontinent. It established the [[Bengal Legislative Council]] in 1862, and the council's native Bengali representation increased during the early 20th century. The [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]] was formed in 1913 to advocate [[civil rights]] for Bengali Muslims within a constitutional framework. During the 1920s, the league was divided into factions supporting the [[Khilafat movement]] and favouring co-operation with the British to achieve self-rule.

Pakistan adopted its first constitution in 1956. Three Bengalis were its Prime Minister until 1957: Nazimuddin, [[Mohammad Ali of Bogra]] and Suhrawardy. None of the three completed their terms, and resigned from office.

During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Bengali nationalists declared independence and formed the [[Mukti Bahini]] (the Bangladeshi National Liberation Army). The [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] was established on 17 April 1971, converting the 469 elected members of the Pakistani national assembly and East Pakistani provincial assembly into the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]]. The provisional government issued a [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence|proclamation]] that became the country's interim constitution and declared "equality, human dignity and social justice" as its fundamental principles. Due to Mujib's detention, [[Syed Nazrul Islam]] took over the role of Acting President, while [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] was named Bangladesh's first Prime Minister. The Mukti Bahini and other Bengali guerrilla forces formed the [[Bangladesh Forces]] which became the military wing of the provisional government. Led by General [[M. A. G. Osmani]] and eleven [[List of sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|sector commanders]], the forces held the countryside during the war and conducted wide-ranging guerrilla operations against Pakistani forces. As a result, almost the entire country except the capital Dacca was liberated by [[Bangladesh Forces]] by late November.[[File:Joy of Independence.jpg|thumb|[[National Martyrs’ Memorial]] set up in the memory of those who died in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971]]This led the Pakistan Army to attack neighbouring India's western front on 2 December 1971. India retaliated in both the western and eastern fronts. With a joint ground advance by Bangladeshi and Indian forces, coupled with air strikes by both India and the small Bangladeshi air contingent, the capital Dacca was liberated from Pakistani occupation in mid-December. During the last phase of the war, both the Soviet Union and the United States dispatched naval forces to the Bay of Bengal in a Cold War standoff.

In January 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman introduced [[One-party state|one-party socialist rule]] under [[Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League|BAKSAL]]. Rahman banned all newspapers except four state-owned publications, and amended the constitution to increase his power.

After the 1991 general election, the twelfth amendment to the constitution restored the parliamentary republic and [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] became Bangladesh's first female prime minister. Zia, a former first lady, led a BNP government from 1990 to 1996. In 1991 her finance minister, [[Saifur Rahman (Bangladeshi politician)|Saifur Rahman]], began a major program to liberalise the Bangladeshi economy.<ref name="Lewis2011"/>

In February 1996, [[February 1996 Bangladeshi general election|a general election]] was held which was boycotted by all opposition parties giving a 300 (of 300) seat victory for BNP. This election was deemed illegitimate, so a system of a [[caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]] was introduced to oversee the transfer of power and a new election was held in June 1996, overseen by Justice [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]], the first [[Chief Adviser of Bangladesh]]. The [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] won the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|seventh general election]], marking its leader [[Sheikh Hasina|Sheikh Hasina's]] first term as Prime Minister. Hasina's first term was highlighted by the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] and a [[Ganges]] water-sharing treaty with India. The second caretaker government, led by Chief Adviser Justice [[Latifur Rahman]], oversaw the [[2001 Bangladeshi general election]] which returned Begum Zia and the BNP to power.

The second Zia administration saw improved economic growth, but political turmoil gripped the country between 2004 and 2006. A radical Islamist militant group, the [[Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh|JMB]], carried out a series of terror attacks. The evidence of staging these attacks by these extremist groups have been found in the investigation, and hundreds of suspected members were detained in numerous security operations in 2006, including the two chiefs of the JMB, [[Shaykh Abdur Rahman]] and [[Bangla Bhai]], who were executed with other top leaders in March 2007, bringing the militant group to an end.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/03/31/d7033101011.htm | title=The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 1007 | access-date=10 November 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915190630/http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/03/31/d7033101011.htm | archive-date=15 September 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2006, at the end of the term of the BNP administration, there was widespread political unrest related to the handover of power to a caretaker government.  As such, the Bangladeshi military urged President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] to impose a [[state of emergency]] and a caretaker government, led by technocrat [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]], was installed.<ref name="Lewis2011"/> Emergency rule lasted for two years, during which time investigations into members of both Awami League and BNP were conducted, including their leaders [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/former-bangladeshi-pm-arrested-reports/2503992|title=Former Bangladeshi PM arrested: reports|date=16 July 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922235154/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/former-bangladeshi-pm-arrested-reports/2503992|archive-date=22 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/02/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Ex-Prime-Minister.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212031648/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/02/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Ex-Prime-Minister.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 February 2009|title=Ex-PM sued on corruption charges in Bangladesh |work= International Herald Tribune|date=12 February 2009|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref> In 2008 the [[2008 Bangladeshi general election|ninth general election]] saw a return to power for [[Sheikh Hasina]] and the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] led [[Grand Alliance (Bangladesh)|Grand Alliance]] in a landslide victory. In 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]] ruled martial law illegal and affirmed [[Secularism|secular]] principles in the constitution. The following year, the Awami League abolished the caretaker-government system.

Citing the lack of caretaker government the [[2014 Bangladeshi general election|2014 general election]] was boycotted by the BNP and other opposition parties, giving the Awami League a decisive victory. The election was controversial with reports of violence and an alleged crackdown on the opposition in the run-up to the election and 153 seats (of 300) went uncontested in the election. Despite the controversy Hasina went on to form a government which saw her return for a third term as Prime Minister. Due to strong domestic demand, Bangladesh emerged as one of the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing economies in the world]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/02/economic-reforms-can-make-bangladesh-grow-faster |title=Economic Reforms Can Make Bangladesh Grow Faster |access-date=9 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411084103/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/02/economic-reforms-can-make-bangladesh-grow-faster |archive-date=11 April 2019 |url-status=live  }}</ref> However, [[human rights abuses]] increased under the Hasina administration, particularly [[Forced disappearance in Bangladesh|enforced disappearances]].

[[File:Brahmaputra-verlaufsgebiet.jpg|thumb|A satellite image showing the topography of Bangladesh]]
The geography of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile [[Ganges-Brahmaputra delta]], which is the largest river delta in the world.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Seth Mydans |title=Life in Bangladesh Delta: On the Edge of Disaster |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/world/life-in-bangladesh-delta-on-the-edge-of-disaster.html |work=The New York Times |date=21 June 1987 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104181307/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/world/life-in-bangladesh-delta-on-the-edge-of-disaster.html |archive-date=4 November 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ganges River Basin |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/ganges-river-basin/ |website=National Geographic Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309132403/https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/ganges-river-basin/ |archive-date=9 March 2020 |language=en |date=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Aditi Rajagopal |title=How the World's Largest Delta Might Slowly Go Under Water |url=https://www.discovery.com/nature/largest-delta-underwater |website=Discovery |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208052815/http://www.discovery.com/nature/largest-delta-underwater |archive-date=8 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the [[Madhupur tract|Madhupur]] and the [[Barind Tract|Barind]] plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to [[evergreen]] hill ranges.

The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making the resolution of water issues politically complicated, in most cases, as the country is a lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.<ref>{{cite book | last = Suvedī | first = Sūryaprasāda | title = International watercourses law for the 21st century | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = 154–66 | isbn = 978-0-7546-4527-6}}</ref>

Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ali">{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=A. |year=1996 |title=Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges |doi = 10.1007/BF00175563|journal=Water, Air, & Soil Pollution |volume=92 |issue=1–2 |pages=171–79|doi-broken-date=28 September 2020|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00175563}}</ref> 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country's [[haor]] wetlands are of significance to global environmental science.

In southeastern Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. Construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt, creating new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has become a multi-agency endeavour, building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change|title="Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change", by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times|publisher=Pulitzercenter.org|access-date=3 July 2010|date=18 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724121204/http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change|archive-date=24 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Years of collaboration with donors and global experts in water resources management has enabled Bangladesh to formulate strategies to combat the impacts of climate change.

With an elevation of {{convert|1064|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Saka Haphong]] (also known as Mowdok Mual) near the border with [[Myanmar]], is claimed to be the highest peak of Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=1100 |title=World Country High Points |website=peakbagger.com |publisher=peakbagger.com}}</ref> However, it is not yet widely recognized as the highest point of the country, and most sources give the honor to [[Keokradong]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html |title=Bangladesh |website=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA}}</ref>

There is evidence that [[earthquake]]s pose a threat to the country and that [[plate tectonics]] have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically. It has been shown that rainy-season flooding in Bangladesh, on the world's largest river delta, can push the underlying crust down by as much as 6&nbsp;centimetres, and possibly perturb faults.<ref>[http://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/watch/337 Beneath Bangladesh: The Next Great Earthquake?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811070413/http://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/watch/337 |date=11 August 2011 }}. earth.columbia.edu (12 July 2011)</ref>

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''[[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]]'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''.

There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.<ref>''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997</ref>

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of embankment, 1,000&nbsp;people were killed and 30&nbsp;million more were made homeless; 135,000 cattle were killed; {{convert|50|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of land were destroyed; and {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads were damaged or destroyed.

Bangladesh is home to much of the [[Sundarbans]], the world's largest [[mangrove forest]], covering an area of 6,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries–the [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|South]], [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|East]] and [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|West]] zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, which is a unique ecosystem. It also includes [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]], a [[freshwater swamp forest]] and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong region]] covers evergreen and semi evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along the districts of Gazipur, [[Tangail]] and [[Mymensingh]]. [[St. Martin's Island]] is the only [[coral reef]] in the country.

Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one horned and two horned [[rhinoceros]] and common [[peafowl]]. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, hence limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. Although many areas are protected under law, a large portion of Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. Furthermore, access to [[biocapacity]] in Bangladesh is low. In 2016, Bangladesh had 0.4 global hectares<ref name=GFN>{{cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=16&type=BCpc,EFCpc|title=Country Trends|publisher=Global Footprint Network|access-date= 9 October 2019}}</ref> of biocapacity per person within its territory, or about one fourth of the world average. In contrast, in 2016, they used 0.84 global hectares of biocapacity – their [[ecological footprint]] of consumption. As a result, Bangladesh is running a biocapacity deficit.<ref name=GFN/>

The [[Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act]] was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as [[Ecologically Critical Area]]s, including wetlands, forests and rivers. The [[Sundarbans tiger project]] and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.<ref name="bearprojectbd.weebly.com"/>

Bangladesh is a ''[[de jure]]'' [[representative democracy]] under its [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitution]], with a [[Westminster system|Westminster]]-style [[unitary authority|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] that has [[universal suffrage]]. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is invited to form a government every five years by the President. The President invites the leader of the largest party in parliament to become Prime Minister of the world's fifth largest democracy.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Is Bangladesh becoming an autocracy? |url=https://www.dw.com/en/is-bangladesh-becoming-an-autocracy/a-43151970 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=27 March 2018 |access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> Bangladesh experienced a [[two party system]] between 1990 and 2014, when the [[Awami League]] and the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) alternated in power. During this period, elections were managed by a neutral [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]]. But the caretaker government was abolished by the Awami League government in 2011. The BNP boycotted the next election in 2014, arguing that it would not be fair without a caretaker government. The BNP-led [[Jatiya Oikya Front]] participated in the 2018 election and lost. The election saw many allegations of irregularities. Bangladesh has a prominent [[civil society]] since the colonial period. There are various special interest groups, including [[non-governmental organisations]], human rights organisations, professional associations, [[chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]], employers' associations and [[trade unions]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-reports/detail/itc/BGD/|title=Detail|website=bti-project.org|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>

One of the key aspects of Bangladeshi politics is the "spirit of the liberation war" which refers to the ideals of the liberation movement during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/spirit-of-liberation-war-17307|title=Spirit of Liberation War|date=26 March 2014|website=The Daily Star|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> The Proclamation of Independence enunciated the values of "equality, human dignity and social justice". In 1972, the constitution included a [[bill of rights]] and declared "nationalism, socialism, democracy and [[secularity]]" as the principles of government policy. Socialism was later de-emphasised and neglected by successive governments. Bangladesh has a market-based economy. To many Bangladeshis, especially in the younger generation, the spirit of the liberation war is a vision for a society based on civil liberties, human rights, the rule of law and good governance.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sobhan|first=Rehman|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-216327|title=The Spirit of the Liberation War|date=31 December 2011|website=The Daily Star|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>

===Executive branch===
The [[Government of Bangladesh]] is overseen by a [[Cabinet of Bangladesh|cabinet]] headed by the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]]. The tenure of a parliamentary government is five years. The [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] assists the cabinet in running the government. Recruitment for the civil service is based on a public examination. In theory, the civil service should be a meritocracy. But a disputed quota system coupled with politicisation and preference for seniority have allegedly affected the civil service's meritocracy.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://thediplomat.com/2013/08/no-meritocracy-bangladeshs-civil-service/|last=Kabir|first=A.|title=No Meritocracy: Bangladesh's Civil Service|publisher=The Diplomat|date=12 August 2013|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref> The [[President of Bangladesh]] is the ceremonial head of state<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors-bangladesh/government/president/|title=President|publisher=The Nexus Commonwealth Network|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref> whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament into law. The President is elected by the parliament and has a five-year term. Under the constitution, the president acts on the advice of the prime minister. The President is the Supreme Commander of the Bangladesh Armed Forces and the chancellor of all universities.

===Legislative branch===
[[File:National Assembly of Bangladesh (06).jpg|thumb|[[Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban|The National Assembly of Bangladesh]]]]
The [[Jatiya Sangshad]] (National Assembly) is the [[unicameral]] parliament. It has 350 [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), including 300 MPs elected on the [[first past the post]] system and 50 MPs appointed to reserved seats for [[women's empowerment]]. [[Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh]] forbids MPs from voting against their party. However, several laws proposed independently by MPs have been transformed into legislation, including the anti-torture law.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.net/article/32228/amendment-to-anti-torture-law-to-hinder-hr-protection-says-ask|title=Amendment to anti-torture law to hinder HR protection, says ASK |work=New Age |access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> The parliament is presided over by the [[Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad]], who is second in line to the president as per the constitution. There is also a Deputy Speaker. When a president is incapable of performing duties (i.e. due to illness), the Speaker steps in as [[Acting President]] and the Deputy Speaker becomes Acting Speaker. A recurring proposal suggests that the Deputy Speaker should be a member of the opposition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shahid|first=S.

===Legal system===
{{Main|Laws in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Supreme Court of Bangladesh 12.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Long, white, domed building|[[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]]]]
The [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] is the highest court of the land followed by the [[High Court Division|High Court]] and Appellate Divisions. The head of the judiciary is the [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh]], who sits on the Supreme Court. The courts have wide latitude in [[judicial review in Bangladesh|judicial review]] and judicial [[precedent]] is supported by the Article 111 of the constitution. The [[Judiciary of Bangladesh|judiciary]] includes district and metropolitan courts, which are divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog. The [[Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission]] is an independent body responsible for judicial appointments, salaries and discipline.

Bangladesh's legal system is based on [[common law]] and its principal source of laws are [[acts of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Bangladesh.html|first=Omar|last=Sial|title=A Research Guide to the Legal System of the Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh|website=[[GlobaLex]]|date=October 2008|access-date=27 April 2015}}</ref> The [[Bangladesh Code]] includes a list of all laws in force in the country. The code begins in 1836 and most of its listed laws were crafted under the [[British Raj]] by the [[Bengal Legislative Council]], the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]], the [[Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council]], the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. One example is the [[The Penal Code, 1860 (Bangladesh)|1860 Penal Code]]. From 1947 to 1971, laws were enacted by Pakistan's [[National Assembly of Pakistan|national assembly]] and the [[East Pakistan Provincial Assembly|East Pakistani legislature]]. The [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]] was the country's provisional parliament until 1973, when the first elected Jatiyo Sangshad (National Parliament) was sworn in. Although most of Bangladesh's laws were compiled in English, after a 1987 government directive laws are now primarily written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. While most of Bangladeshi law is [[secular]]; marriage, divorce and inheritance are governed by [[Sharia|Islamic]], [[Hindu law|Hindu]] and Christian [[family law]]. The judiciary is often influenced by legal developments in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], such as the [[Legitimate expectation|doctrine of legitimate expectation]].

The first major intergovernmental organisation joined by Bangladesh was the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1972. The country joined the [[United Nations]] in 1974, and has been elected twice to the [[UN Security Council]]. Ambassador [[Humayun Rashid Choudhury]] was elected president of the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1986. Bangladesh relies on [[multilateralism|multilateral]] diplomacy in the [[World Trade Organization]]. It is a major contributor to [[UN peacekeeping]], providing 113,000 personnel to 54 UN missions in the Middle East, the Balkans, Africa and the Caribbean in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afd.gov.bd/index.php/un-peacekeeping/bangladesh-in-un-mission|title=Bangladesh in UN Mission|author=Armed Forces Division|publisher=afd.gov.bd}}</ref>

In addition to membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations, Bangladesh pioneered regional co-operation in [[South Asia]]. Bangladesh is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), an organisation designed to strengthen relations and promote economic and cultural growth among its members. It has hosted several summits and two Bangladeshi diplomats were the organisation's secretary-general.

Bangladesh joined the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) in 1973. It has hosted the summit of OIC foreign ministers, which addresses issues, conflicts and disputes affecting [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]]. Bangladesh is a founding member of the [[Developing 8 Countries]], which is a bloc of eight Muslim-majority republics.

The neighbouring country of [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was one of the first countries to recognise Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Foreign_Policy|title=Foreign Policy – Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=19 September 2017}}</ref> Despite common regional interests, Bangladesh-Myanmar relations have been strained by the [[Rohingya genocide|Rohingya refugee crisis]] and the isolationist policies of the Myanmar military.

The parliament, government and civil society of Bangladesh have been at the forefront of [[International reaction to the 2016–17 Rohingya exodus|international criticism]] against Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, which the [[United Nations]] has described as [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Alam |first=Julhas |date=16 September 2017 |title=Bangladesh accuses Myanmar of violating its airspace |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/nationworld/sns-bc-as--myanmar-attacks-20170916-story.html |work=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]] |agency=Associated Press |access-date=19 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/un-myanmars-treatment-of-rohingya-textbook-example-of-ethnic-cleansing|title=Myanmar treatment of Rohingya looks like 'textbook ethnic cleansing', says UN|first=Michael|last=Safi|date=11 September 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=19 September 2017}}</ref>

Bangladesh's most politically important bilateral relationship is with neighbouring [[India]]. In 2015, major Indian newspapers called Bangladesh a "trusted friend".<ref>{{cite news |date=8 June 2015 |title=Indian papers back strong ties with 'trusted friend' Bangladesh |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33044181 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Bangladesh and India are South Asia's largest trading partners. The countries are collaborating in regional economic and infrastructure projects, such as a regional motor-vehicle agreement in [[eastern South Asia]] and a coastal shipping agreement in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. [[Bangladesh-India relations|Indo-Bangladesh relations]] often emphasise a shared cultural heritage, democratic values and a history of support for [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladeshi independence]]. Despite political goodwill, [[Deaths along the Bangladesh–India border|border killings of Bangladeshi civilians]] and the lack of a comprehensive water-sharing agreement for 54 trans-boundary rivers are major issues. In 2017, India joined Russia and China in refusing to condemn Myanmar's atrocities against the [[Rohingya]], which contradicted with Bangladesh's demand for recognising Rohingya human rights.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mahfuz Anam |date=9 September 2017 |title=Rohingya crisis: A concern for the region |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/asian-editors-circle/rohingya-crisis-concern-the-region-1459393 |work=The Daily Star |type=Opinion |access-date=19 September 2017}}</ref> However, the Indian air force delivered aid shipments for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rohingya aid from India, Morocco, Indonesia arrives |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/morocco-sends-rohingya-aid-indian-relief-arrive-bangladesh-myanmar-1462063 |work=The Daily Star |date=14 September 2017 |access-date=19 September 2017}}</ref> The crackdown against cattle smuggling in India has also affected Bangladesh.

Although Bangladeshi and Pakistani businesses have invested in each other, diplomatic relations are strained because of Pakistani denial of the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. The execution of a [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] leader in 2013 on committing of [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|war crimes]] during the liberation war was opposed in Pakistan and led to further strained ties.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Syed Tashfin |date=22 December 2013 |title=Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship strained |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/pakistan-bangladesh-relationship-strained-2013122210285955448.html |work=Al Jazeera |access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref>

[[Bangladesh-China relations|Sino-Bangladesh relations]] date to the 1950s and are relatively warm, despite the Chinese leadership siding with Pakistan during Bangladesh's war of independence. China and Bangladesh established bilateral relations in 1976 which have significantly strengthened and the country is considered a cost-effective source of arms for the Bangladeshi military.<ref>{{cite news |author=Sheikh Shahariar Zaman |date=18 March 2014 |title=China biggest arms supplier to Bangladesh |url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/foreign-affairs/2014/mar/18/china-biggest-arms-supplier-bangladesh |work=Dhaka Tribune |access-date=19 September 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919045546/http://archive.dhakatribune.com/foreign-affairs/2014/mar/18/china-biggest-arms-supplier-bangladesh |archive-date=19 September 2017  }}</ref> Since the 1980s 80 percent of Bangladesh's military equipment has been supplied by China (often with generous credit terms), and China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner.

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Bangladesh}}
[[File:Rajshahi College Library Inside 02.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Charyapada]]'' scrolls are the oldest surviving text of the Bengali language. The photograph was taken at the [[Rajshahi College]] Library]]
The predominant language of Bangladesh is [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (also known as Bangla). Bengali is the one of the easternmost branches of the [[Indo-European language]] family. It is a part of the [[Eastern Indo-Aryan languages]] in South Asia, which developed between the 10th and 13th centuries. Bengali is written using the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. In ancient Bengal, [[Sanskrit]] was the language of written communication, especially by priests. During the Islamic period, Sanskrit was replaced by Bengali as the [[vernacular language]]. The Sultans of Bengal promoted the production of Bengali literature instead of Sanskrit. Bengali also received [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] loanwords during the [[Sultanate of Bengal]]. Under [[Bengal Presidency|British rule]], Bengali was significantly modernised by Europeans. Modern Standard Bengali emerged as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the region. A heavily Sanskritized version of Bengali was employed by Hindu scholars during the [[Bengali Renaissance]]. Muslim writers such as [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] gave attention to the Persian and Arabic vocabulary of the language.

Today, the Bengali language standard is prescribed by the [[Bangla Academy]] in Bangladesh. More than 98 percent of people in Bangladesh speak Bengali as their native language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Condition of English in Bangladesh|url=http://www.eslteachersboard.com/cgi-bin/asia/index.pl?noframes;read=158|publisher=ESL Teachers Board|access-date=21 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115144121/http://www.eslteachersboard.com/cgi-bin/asia/index.pl?noframes;read=158|archive-date=15 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="constitution-I-5">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130115144123/http://www.parliament.gov.bd/Constitution_English/index.htm Constitution of Bangladesh] (As modified up to 17 May 2004), Part I, Article 5.</ref> Bengali is described as a [[dialect continuum]] where there are various [[Bengali dialects|dialects]] spoken throughout the country.

The [[Chakma language]] is another native Eastern Indo-Aryan language of Bangladesh. It is written using the [[Chakma script]]. The unique aspect of the language is that it is used by the Chakma people, who are a population with similarities to the people of East Asia, rather than the Indian subcontinent. The Chakma language is endangered due to its decreasing use in schools and institutions.

Other tribal languages include [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Meitei language|Meitei]], [[Kokborok]] and [[Rakhine language|Rakhine]]. Among the [[Austroasiatic languages]], the [[Santali language]] is spoken by the Santali tribe. Many of these languages are written in the Bengali script; while there is also some usage of the Latin script.

[[Urdu]] has a significant heritage in Bangladesh, in particular [[Old Dhaka]]. The language was introduced to Bengal in the 17th-century. Traders and migrants from North India often spoke the language in Bengal, as did sections of the Bengali upper class. Urdu poets lived in many parts of Bangladesh. The use of Urdu became controversial during the [[Bengali Language Movement]], when the people of East Bengal resisted attempts to impose Urdu as the main official language. In modern Bangladesh, the Urdu-speaking community is restricted to the country's [[Biharis in Bangladesh|Bihari]] community (formerly Stranded Pakistanis); and some sections of the [[Dhakaiyas|Old Dhakaiya]] population.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Urdu |title = Urdu – Banglapedia}}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh has a [[literacy rate]] of 72.9 percent as of 2018: 75.7% for males and 70.09% for females. The country's educational system is three-tiered and heavily subsidised, with the government operating many schools at the primary, secondary and higher-secondary levels and subsidising many private schools. In the tertiary-education sector, the Bangladeshi government funds over 45 state universities<ref name="ugc-universities.gov.bd">http://www.ugc-universities.gov.bd/public-universities</ref> through the [[University Grants Commission of Bangladesh|University Grants Commission]].

[[File:Literacy rate Bangladesh.png|thumb|right|Literacy rates in Bangladesh districts]]

The education system is divided into five levels: primary (first to fifth grade), junior secondary (sixth to eighth grade), secondary (ninth and tenth grade), higher secondary (11th and 12th grade) and tertiary.<ref name=CompEd>{{cite book|author=T. Neville Postlethwaite|title=The Encyclopedia of Comparative Education and National Systems of Education|page=130|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-08-030853-1}}</ref> Five years of secondary education (including junior secondary) ends with a [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) examination. Since 2009, the Primary Education Closing (PEC) examination has also been introduced. Students who pass the PEC examination proceed to secondary or matriculation training, culminating in the SSC examination.<ref name=CompEd/>

Students who pass the PEC examination proceed to three years of junior-secondary education, culminating in the [[Junior School Certificate]] (JSC) examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of secondary education, culminating in the SSC examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of higher-secondary education, culminating in the [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) examination.<ref name=CompEd/>

Education is primarily in Bengali, but English is commonly taught and used. Many Muslim families send their children to part-time courses or full-time religious education in Bengali and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in madrasas.<ref name=CompEd/>

Bangladesh conforms with [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] [[Education For All]] (EFA) objectives, the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) and other international declarations. Article 17 of the [[Bangladesh Constitution]] provides that all children between the ages of six and ten years receive a basic education free of charge.

The recorded history of art in Bangladesh can be traced to the 3rd century BCE, when [[terracotta]] sculptures were made in the region. In classical antiquity, a notable school of sculptural Hindu, Jain and Buddhist art developed in the Pala Empire and the Sena dynasty. Islamic art evolved since the 14th century. The architecture of the Bengal Sultanate saw a distinct style of domed mosques with complex niche pillars that had no minarets. [[Mughal Bengal]]'s most celebrated artistic tradition was the weaving of [[Jamdani]] [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] on fine muslin, which is now classified by UNESCO as an [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Jamdani motifs were similar to Iranian textile art (buta motifs) and Western textile art ([[Paisley (design)|paisley]]).

[[Pottery]] is widely used in Bengali culture.

The [[modern art]] movement in Bangladesh took shape during the 1950s, particularly with the pioneering works of [[Zainul Abedin]]. East Bengal developed its own modernist painting and sculpture traditions, which were distinct from the art movements in West Bengal. The [[Art Institute Dhaka]] has been an important center for visual art in the region. Its annual [[Mangal Shobhajatra|Bengali New Year parade]] was enlisted as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2016.

Modern Bangladesh has produced many of South Asia's leading painters, including [[SM Sultan]], [[Mohammad Kibria]], [[Shahabuddin Ahmed (artist)|Shahabuddin Ahmed]], [[Kanak Chanpa Chakma]], [[Kafil Ahmed]], [[Saifuddin Ahmed]], [[Qayyum Chowdhury]], [[Rashid Choudhury]], [[Quamrul Hassan]], [[Rafiqun Nabi]] and [[Syed Jahangir]], among others. [[Novera Ahmed]] and [[Nitun Kundu]] were the country's pioneers of modernist sculpture.

In recent times, photography as a medium of art has become popular. Biennial [[Chobi Mela]] is considered the largest photography festival in Asia.<ref>{{cite news |date=19 December 2014 |title=Chobi Mela kicks off next month |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/12/19/61610.php |location=Dhaka |newspaper=The Daily Observer}}</ref>

Bengal has a long history of [[feminist activism]] dating back to the 19th century. [[Begum Rokeya]] and [[Nawab Faizunnesa|Faizunnessa Chowdhurani]] played an important role in emancipating Bengali Muslim women from [[purdah]], prior to the country's division, as well as promoting girls' education. Several women were elected to the Bengal Legislative Assembly in the British Raj. The first women's magazine, ''[[Begum (magazine)|Begum]]'', was published in 1948.

In 2008, Bangladeshi female workforce participation stood at 26%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/03/25/000334955_20080325105524/Rendered/PDF/430450NWP0BD0gender0Box0327344B01PUBLIC1.pdf|title=World Bank Document|publisher=World Bank|access-date=19 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214942/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/03/25/000334955_20080325105524/Rendered/PDF/430450NWP0BD0gender0Box0327344B01PUBLIC1.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Women dominate [[blue collar]] jobs in the Bangladeshi garment industry.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Bangladesh}}
[[File:Ahsan Manzil-Front View.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ahsan Manzil]] is one of the largest residences in [[Old Dhaka]], where there are many [[Indo-Saracenic]] buildings]]
The architectural traditions of Bangladesh have a 2,500-year-old heritage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rahman |first=Mahbubur |year=2012 |chapter=Architecture |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Terracotta architecture is a distinct feature of Bengal. Pre-Islamic Bengali architecture reached its pinnacle in the Pala Empire, when the Pala School of Sculptural Art established grand structures such as the Somapura Mahavihara. [[Islamic architecture]] began developing under the Bengal Sultanate, when local terracotta styles influenced medieval mosque construction. The [[Adina Mosque]] of [[United Bengal]] was the largest mosque built on the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Adina_Mosque|title=Adina Mosque, – Banglapedia|website=en.Banglapedia.org|access-date=12 July 2019}}</ref>

The [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] was the largest medieval mosque built in Bangladesh, and is a fine example of Turkic-Bengali architecture. The [[Mughal architecture|Mughal style]] replaced indigenous architecture when Bengal became a province of the Mughal Empire and influenced the development of urban housing. The [[Kantajew Temple]] and [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] are excellent examples of late medieval [[Hindu temple architecture]]. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]], based on Indo-Islamic styles, flourished during the British period. The zamindar gentry in Bangladesh built numerous Indo-Saracenic palaces and country mansions, such as the [[Ahsan Manzil]], [[Tajhat Palace]], [[Uttara Gonobhaban|Dighapatia Palace]], [[Puthia Rajbari]] and [[Natore Rajbari]].
[[File:Guest house in Sylhet (01).jpg|thumb|The [[bungalow]], which originated in Bengal, is a common sight. The roof style seen in the picture is common in the hilly areas of [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]]]
Bengali [[vernacular architecture]] is noted for pioneering the [[bungalow]]. Bangladeshi villages consist of [[thatch]]ed roofed houses made of natural materials like [[mud]], [[straw]], wood and bamboo. In modern times, village bungalows are increasingly made of [[tin]].

[[Muzharul Islam]] was the pioneer of Bangladeshi modern architecture. His varied works set the course of modern architectural practice in the country. Islam brought leading global architects, including [[Louis Kahn]], [[Richard Neutra]], [[Stanley Tigerman]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], [[Robert Boughey]] and [[Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis|Konstantinos Doxiadis]], to work in erstwhile East Pakistan. Louis Kahn was chosen to design the National Parliament Complex in [[Sher-e-Bangla Nagar]]. Kahn's monumental designs, combining regional red brick aesthetics, his own concrete and marble [[brutalism]] and the use of lakes to represent Bengali geography, are regarded as one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. In more recent times, award-winning architects like [[Rafiq Azam]] have set the course of contemporary architecture by adopting influences from the works of Islam and Kahn.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Bengali cuisine|Bangladeshi cuisine}}
[[File:Bangladeshi cuisine.png|thumb|Traditional Bangladeshi Meal: [[Mustard seed]] [[Ilish]] [[Curry]], Dhakai [[Biryani]] and [[Pitha]]]]
[[White rice]] is the staple of Bangladeshi cuisine, along with many vegetables and [[lentil]]s. Rice preparations also include Bengali [[biryani]]s, [[pilaf|pulaos]], and [[khichuri]]s. [[Mustard (condiment)|Mustard]] sauce, [[ghee]], [[sunflower oil]] and fruit [[chutney]]s are widely used in Bangladeshi cooking. Fish is the main source of protein in Bengali cuisine. The [[Hilsa]] is the national fish and immensely popular across Bangladesh. Other kinds of fish eaten include [[rohu]], [[butterfish]], catfish, [[tilapia]] and [[barramundi]]. [[Fish egg]]s are a gourmet delicacy. Seafood holds an important place in Bengali cuisine, especially [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]]s and [[dried fish]]. Meat consumption includes chicken, beef, [[mutton]], [[venison]], [[duck]] and [[squab (food)|squab]]. In Chittagong, ''Mezban'' feasts are a popular tradition featuring the serving of hot beef [[curry]]. In Sylhet, the ''[[shatkora]]'' lemons are used to marinate dishes. In the tribal Hill Tracts, bamboo shoot cooking is prevalent. Bangladesh has a vast spread of desserts, including distinctive [[sweets]] like ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Rôshomalai'', ''[[Chomchom]]'', ''Mishti Doi'' and ''Kalojaam''. [[Pitha]]s are traditional boiled desserts made with rice or fruits. [[Halwa]] is served during religious festivities. [[Naan]], [[paratha]], [[luchi]] and [[bakarkhani]] are the main local breads. [[Milk tea]] is offered to guests as a gesture of welcome and is the most common hot beverage in the country. [[Kebab]]s are widely popular across Bangladesh, particularly [[seekh kebab]]s, [[chicken tikka]] and [[shashlik]]s.

Bangladesh shares its culinary heritage with the neighbouring Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. The two regions have several differences, however. In Muslim-majority Bangladesh, meat consumption is greater; whereas in Hindu-majority West Bengal, vegetarianism is more prevalent. The Bangladeshi diaspora dominates the South Asian restaurant industry in many Western countries, particularly in the United Kingdom.

The first feature film in East Pakistan, ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh]]'', was released in 1956. During the 1960s, 25–30 films were produced annually in Dhaka. By the 2000s, Bangladesh produced 80–100 films a year. While the Bangladeshi film industry has achieved limited commercial success, the country has produced notable independent filmmakers. [[Zahir Raihan]] was a prominent documentary-maker who was assassinated in 1971. The late [[Tareque Masud]] is regarded as one of Bangladesh's outstanding directors for his critically acclaimed films on social issues.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Tareque Masud, filmmaker extraordinaire|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/tareque-masud-filmmaker-extraordinaire-36845|date=2014-08-13|work=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Tareque Masud's 63rd birth anniversary observed|url=https://www.unb.com.bd/category/Lifestyle/tareque-masuds-63rd-birth-anniversary-observed/37230|website=UNB|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> Masud was honoured by [[FIPRESCI]] at the 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival]] for his film ''[[Matir Moina|The Clay Bird]]''.
