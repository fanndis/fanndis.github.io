'''Vimeo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|m|i|oʊ|}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/79338405|title=How to pronounce Vimeo?|publisher=Vimeo |access-date=January 17, 2019}}</ref>) is an American video hosting, sharing, and services platform headquartered in New York City. Vimeo operates on an ad-free basis, and instead derives revenue by providing subscription plans for businesses and video content producers and offering [[software as a service]] (SaaS) with video creation, editing, and broadcasting tools, enterprise software solutions, as well as the means for video professionals to connect with clients and other professionals. Vimeo focuses on the delivery of [[high-definition video]] across a range of devices.

The site was initially built by [[Jake Lodwick]] and [[Zach Klein]] in 2004 as a spin-off of [[CollegeHumor]] to share humor videos among colleagues, though put to the side to support the growing popularity of CollegeHumor. [[IAC (company)|IAC]] acquired CollegeHumor and Vimeo in 2006, and after [[Google]] had acquired [[YouTube]] for over {{USD|1.65 billion}}, IAC directed more effort into Vimeo to compete against YouTube, focusing on providing curated content and high-definition video to distinguish itself from other video sharing sites. Lodwick and Klein eventually left by 2009, and IAC implemented a more corporate-focused structure to build out Vimeo's services, with current CEO [[Anjali Sud]] having been in place since July 2017.

Vimeo was founded in November 2004 by [[Connected Ventures]], the parent company of the humor-based website [[CollegeHumor]], as a side project of web developers [[Jake Lodwick]] and [[Zach Klein]] to share and tag short videos with their friends.<ref name="fortune">{{cite web | url = https://fortune.com/2011/02/23/how-vimeo-became-hipster-youtube/ | title = How Vimeo became hipster YouTube | first = John Patrick | last=  Pullen | date = February 23, 2011 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] }}</ref> The idea for a video-sharing site was inspired after CollegeHumor received a large number of views from a posted video clip of the October 2004 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' show that included [[Ashlee Simpson]]'s infamous lip-syncing incident.<ref name="wired collegehumor"/> The name Vimeo was created by Lodwick as a play on the words ''video'' and ''me''.<ref name="wired collegehumor">{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/collegehumor/ |title = CollegeHumor Helped Shape Online Comedy.

Vimeo's user base grew only by a small amount during the next few years principally by word-of-mouth.<ref name="fortune"/>

[[IAC (company)|IAC]], owned by [[Barry Diller]], acquired a majority ownership of Connected Ventures in August 2006, as they were drawn by the success of CollegeHumor which was bringing around 6 million visitors a month at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/iac-buys-collegehumorcom-86081/ | title = IAC Buys CollegeHumor.com | first=  Brian | last = Morrissey | date = August 15, 2006 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[Ad Week]] }}</ref> In reviewing the assets of Connected Ventures, IAC discovered the Vimeo property; this had came at the same time that [[Google]] had purchased [[YouTube]] for {{USD|1.65 billion}} in October 2006.<ref name="fortune"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Paul R. |last=La Monica |title=Google to buy YouTube for $1.65&nbsp;billion |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/10/09/technology/googleyoutube_deal/ |website=[[CNNMoney]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=October 9, 2006 |access-date=March 26, 2017}}</ref> By the start of 2007, IAC had directed Lodwick, Klein, and Andrew Pile to work on Vimeo full time and expand its capabilities.<ref name="fortune"/> To differentiate themselves from YouTube and other video sharing sites that had appeared since Google's purchase, Vimeo was focused on the content creator with better upload tools, and better curation of content on the site rather than on popularity.<ref name="fortune"/> By October 2007, Vimeo was the first video sharing site to offer high-definition content to users via [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based high-definition video playback.<ref name="fortune"/><ref name="Lauria, Peter 2007">{{cite news |last=Lauria |first=Peter |work=New York Post |date=October 16, 2007 |title=Video-Sharing Web Site Goes High-Def}}</ref> While IAC's acquisition of Connected Ventures helped to target Vimeo's direction, the corporate nature of IAC created issues with many of the original staff of CollegeHumor and Vimeo.<ref name="wired collegehumor"/> Lodwick was planning to leave the company near the end of 2007, as he said that IAC's incorporation of business processes hampered their creativity, but was fired a few weeks before that point.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.inc.com/magazine/201307/issie-lapowsky/what-an-acquisition-means-for-your-company.html | title =  An Acquisition Is the End of a Dream | first = Issie | last =Lapowsky | date = August 2013 | access-date = May 8, 2020  |work = [[Inc (magazine)|Inc]] }}</ref> Klein left in early 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://observer.com/2009/09/boxee-nabs-iac-star-zach-klein/ | title = Boxee Nabs IAC Star Zach Klein | first = Gillian | last=  Reagan | date = September 18, 2009 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[The New York Observer]] }}</ref>

===Developing high-definition content delivery (2009–2017)===
Vimeo began rolling out a major redesign of its site in 2009 aimed to put the user's focus on the video, which ultimately was completed by January 2012. The new version was aimed to feature the video playback as the central focus of the design, contrasting with the numerous user interface elements that YouTube had within its layout at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2012/01/24/tech/vimeo-redesign/index.html | title = Vimeo to emphasize videos in redesign | first = Mark | last = Milian | date = January 24, 2012 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | publisher = [[CNN]] }}</ref> From 2008 to 2014, Vimeo had blocked the hosting of video game-related videos as they typically were longer than their normal content and took much of the site's resources. Vimeo did allow [[machinima]] videos with a narrative structure. The ban was lifted by October 2014.<ref name="gamingban">{{cite web |first=Blake |last=Whitman |url=http://www.vimeo.com/blog:140 |title=New upload rules |publisher=Vimeo Staff blog |date=July 21, 2008 |access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vimeo.com/guidelines |title=Community Guidelines |publisher=Vimeo |access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

In December 2014, Vimeo introduced [[4K resolution|4K]] support, though it would only allow downloading due to the low market penetration of 4K displays at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/8/7353199/vimeo-is-now-offering-4k-video-downloads-but-wont-stream-just-yet|title=Vimeo now offers 4K video downloads, but streaming isn't available yet|work=The Verge|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Streaming of 4K content launched the following year, along with [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] support.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/vimeo-4k-adaptive-streaming-1201652277/|title=Vimeo Starts Adaptive Streaming on the Web, iOS and Apple TV, Rolls Out 4K|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=December 3, 2015|work=Variety|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> In March 2017, Vimeo introduced [[360-degree video]] support, including support for [[virtual reality]] platforms and smartphones, stereoscopic video, and an online video series providing guidance on filming and producing 360-degree videos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/8/14852298/vimeo-360-degree-video-support|title=Vimeo introduces support for 360-degree videos|work=The Verge|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref>

===Transition to a software provider (2016–present)===
Vimeo acquired [[VHX]], a platform for premium over-the-top subscription video channels, in May 2016, subsequently offering this as a service to its sites customers.<ref name="CNBC">{{cite news|title=Vimeo acquires VHX to boost its video-on-demand business |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/02/vimeo-acquires-vhx-to-boost-its-video-on-demand-business/|date=May 2, 2016|access-date=June 9, 2016|website=[[TechCrunch]]}}</ref> Vimeo acquired the existing service [[Livestream]] in September 2017 to bolster its associated staff and technology, eventually integrated its streaming technology as Vimeo Live, another service offering for its service subscribers.<ref name="techcrunch livestream">{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/vimeo-acquires-livestream-launches-its-own-live-video-product/|title=Vimeo acquires Livestream, launches its own live video product|last=Perez|first=Sarah|work=TechCrunch|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref>

Around 2016, Vimeo had expressed its intentions to enter into the subscription video-on-demand market with its own original programming, with the intent of spending "tens of millions" on content to populate the service as to compete with services like [[Netflix]]. According to IAC CEO Joey Levin, some of the original programming would have been from content creators already on Vimeo, paid for their material to be used on the service, thus reducing their own costs in producing content in comparison to Netflix.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/vimeo-svod-tens-of-millions-dollars-1201907431/ | title = Vimeo Plans to Spend 'Tens of Millions' of Dollars on Content for New Subscription VOD Services | first= Todd | last= Spangler | date = November 2, 2016 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> However, by June 2017, Vimeo had scrapped this plan, recognizing that not only that they were far behind Netflix and others in this area but that they also had generally had far fewer potential viewers and that their ultimate goal, converting those viewers into customers of the site, would be difficult.<ref>{{cite web|  url = https://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/vimeo-subscription-vod-cancelled-netflix-1201847091/ | title = Vimeo Surrenders to Netflix: Why the Subscription Video Plan Was Never Going to Work | first = Graham | last = Winfrey | date = June 26, 2017 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[IndieWire]] }}</ref>

[[File:Anjali_Sud_41139139344.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Anjali Sud]], CEO of Vimeo since 2017]]
On this move, Vimeo decided to focus more heavily on supporting its content creators and customers,<ref name="cnn antiyoutube"/> transitioning itself away from being simply being a content-hosting or video-sharing website and move into the [[software as a service]] model.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://observer.com/2019/08/vimeo-coo-interview-ad-free-model-video-streaming-war/ | title = Vimeo COO: How an Ad-Free Strategy Won the Video Streaming War | first = Sissi | last =Cao | date=  August 17, 2019 | access-date = May 8, 2020  |work = [[The New York Observer]] }}</ref> According to CEO [[Anjali Sud]], Vimeo saw that the demand for online video services had shifted away from Hollywood productions and media producers and was gaining more traction by large businesses, and just as Vimeo had originally drawn attention from indie film makers at its start, they saw an opportunity to help with smaller businesses needed video sharing capabilities but lacking the resources to develop those internally.<ref name="cnn antiyoutube"/> The company introduced a number of tiers and services aimed for business use atop their existing services. Furthermore, Vimeo no longer considered itself a competitor to YouTube or other video-sharing sites, and instead called itself "the Switzerland for creators", according to Sud. Creators were allowed to copy and share their videos to any other video-sharing site as long as they continued to use Vimeo's video editing tools for preparing their creations.<ref name="marketwatch fight"/> In early 2017, Vimeo released collaborative review tools for its users, allowing them to privately share to other users to get feedback tied to individual frames of the video, thus keeping the video creation workflow entirely within the Vimeo service.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/18/vimeo-rolls-out-review-tools-that-let-reviewers-provide-time-coded-feedback-and-notes-on-individual-frames/ | title = Vimeo rolls out tools that let reviewers provide time-coded feedback and notes on individual frames | first = Paul | last = Sawers | date = January 18, 2017 | access-date = May 19, 2020 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref>

Vimeo acquired [[Magisto]], an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI)-backed video creation service with over 100 million users, in April 2019. While the deal's terms were not disclosed, the purchase was reportedly valued at $200 million.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/vimeo-acquires-magisto-1203189606/ | title = Vimeo Acquires Magisto, a Video-Creation Automation Company | first=  Todd | last=  Spangler | date = April 19, 2019 | access-date = May 19, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> Through the acquisition, Magisto's staff were brought into Vimeo, and their existing userbase gained access to Vimeo's toolset. For Vimeo, they saw Magisto's technology helpful for smaller businesses that may not have the funds or skills to product professional videos and could be aided by Magisto's technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/vimeo-has-acquired-short-form-video-creation-platform-magisto/|title=Vimeo has acquired short-form video-creation platform Magisto, reportedly for $200M|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref><ref name="marketwatch fight">{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-vimeo-dropped-its-fight-with-youtube-and-turned-ad-free-videos-into-a-real-business-2019-07-05|title=How Vimeo dropped its fight with YouTube and turned ad-free videos into a real business|last=Bary|first=Emily|website=MarketWatch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref> By February 2020, Vimeo launched Vimeo Create, the integration of Magisto's tools into the Vimeo platform to let its users easy create videos guided by AI agents from stock video footage offered by Vimeo and the users' own sources.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/25/vimeo-launches-ai-powered-social-video-editing-platform-out-of-beta/ | title = Vimeo launches AI-powered social video editing platform out of beta | first = Paul | last = Sawers | date = February 25, 2020 | access-date = May 19, 2020 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref>

In November 2020, IAC raised {{USD|150 million}} for Vimeo in anticipation of spinning off the subsidiary as its own company.<ref name="Barrons_Nov_2020"/>

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Leadership ===
After the departures of Lodwick and Klein, IAC brought in a more corporate structure to the company. By January 2009, Dae Mellencamp joined IAC as general manager of Vimeo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iac.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=20&item=1865|title=ManagementBios|publisher=IAC|access-date=January 31, 2012}}</ref> She served as CEO until March 19, 2012, when Kerry Trainor joined Vimeo as CEO.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/19/new-vimeo-ceo-kerry-trainor/|title=IAC replaces Vimeo CEO with former AOL exec Kerry Trainor|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}</ref> 

Around 2016, several high-level executives announced their departure from Vimeo, including Trainor. IAC's CEO Joey Levin was named as interim CEO for Vimeo during its search for a new CEO.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2016/digital/exec-shuffle-people-news/kerry-trainor-vimeo-exit-1201790736/ | title = Kerry Trainor Steps Down as Vimeo CEO | first = Todd | last = Spangler | date = June 7, 2016 | access-date = May 29, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> After a year-long search, IAC promoted then general manager [[Anjali Sud]] as the CEO.<ref name="cnn antiyoutube">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/media/vimeo-anjali-sud/index.html | title = Vimeo is thriving as the anti-YouTube.

=== Product offerings and revenue structure ===
In contrast with other video-sharing sites, Vimeo does not use any advertising either on its pages or embedded in videos.<ref name="marketwatch 2019"/><ref name="fortune"/> Instead, Vimeo sells its curated services and products to content creators for revenue as a [[software as a service]] (SaaS) model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/vimeo-ceo-anjali-sud-not-worried-about-youtube-netflix-2018-3|title=Vimeo's 34-year-old CEO on why she's not worried about YouTube or Netflix, and how she plans to bring in $100 million this year|last=Mazarakis|first=Richard Feloni, Anna|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref> The site offers a free tier of services, limiting uploads to 500 megabytes a week and with a cap on total data, while paid subscriber tiers, first introduced in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/presenting-vimeo-plus|title=Presenting Vimeo Plus!|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=The Vimeo Blog}}</ref> give the user highly weekly upload allowances and greater storage capacity.<ref name="fortune"/>    

Starting around 2016, Vimeo has also shifted towards supporting businesses through its offerings. In September 2016 it introduced a Business tier plan to allow for intra-business collaboration as well as for businesses to host informational videos for their customers.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/13/vimeo-business-launches-for-599year-offering-hosting-marketing-analytics-and-more/ | title = Vimeo Business launches for $599/year, offering hosting, marketing, analytics, and more | first = Paul | last = Sawers | date = September 13, 2016 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref> With the acquisition of Livestream in 2017, Vimeo added another tier for Premium subscribers, offering unlimited uploads and streaming events through Vimeo Live.<ref name="techcrunch livestream"/> On August 1, 2019, Vimeo launched Vimeo Enterprise, a set of tools designed for large organizations that allow users to manage and share live and on-demand video across workspaces, in August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercevideo.com/tech/vimeo-debuts-enterprise-video-services|title=Vimeo debuts enterprise video services|website=FierceVideo|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>

In addition to subscriptions, Vimeo has other revenue streams through additional services to its customers. Creators could sell access to individual videos since 2013, and later could offer subscription-based access in 2015, with Vimeo taking a 10% cut of the sales.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/vimeo-svod/ | title = Vimeo Now Lets Creators Launch Their Own Subscription Video-On-Demand Channels | first = Ryan | last = Lawler | date = June 2, 2015 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[TechCrunch]] }}</ref> Vimeo has offered a [[video on demand]] service since 2015, allowing its partners to sell Vimeo videos through their websites to their customers.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vimeo-launches-vod-publisher-network-765900 | title = Vimeo Launches VOD Publisher Network | first = Natalie | last = Jarvey | date = January 22, 2015 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>  Via its VHX acquisition, Vimeo offers an [[over-the-top media service]] (OTT), Vimeo OTT, which Vimeo subscribers can use to create custom mobile apps to provide on-demand video to the app's subscribers, with Vimeo handling the subscriptions, billing, and content delivery.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=124292 | title = Vimeo Debuts a Live and On-Demand OTT Subscription App Solution | first = Troy | last = Dreier | date = April 9, 2018 | access-date = July 12, 2020 | work = [[Streaming Media]] }}</ref> In 2018, the site launched Vimeo Stock to allow content creators to offer videos as [[stock footage]] to be used by others.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/05/vimeo-launches-stock-video-marketplace-starting-at-79-per-clip/ | title = Vimeo launches stock video marketplace starting at $79 per clip | first=  Paul | last=  Sawers |date = September 5, 2018 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vimeo-launches-stock-footage-marketplace-1139987|title=Vimeo Launches Stock Footage Marketplace|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>

To further promote Vimeo as a home for professional video support, Vimeo opened a "For Hire" job marketplace in September 2019, allowing companies seeking professional video services to freely post job requests for the site's users to browse and respond to.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/vimeo-for-hire-job-marketplace-1203345336/ | title = Vimeo Launches Video Production Jobs Marketplace | first = Janko | last = Roettgers | date = September 23, 2019 | access-date = May 19, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> Vimeo Record was launched in October 2020 to allow businesses to use recorded video messaging within their company or with their clients to aid in communications.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/vimeo-record/ | title = https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/vimeo-record/ | first = Anthony | last= Ha |date = November 17, 2020 | access-date = November 17, 2020 | work = [[TechCrunch]] }}</ref>

===Events===
Vimeo launched its Vimeo Festival and Awards program in 2010, and held subsequent events every eighteen months. The Festival allows video creators to submit their films for a small fee for consideration across multiple categories. Typically more than 5,000 videos are submitted, and these are narrowed to a field of 1,000 for select judge-panel to vote for winners across multiple categories. This culminates with a live awards presentation showing thewinning films in each category. Each category winner carries a cash prize and an overall best-in-show prize. Vimeo had established the Festival and Awards to help give video and filmmakers an opportunity to highlight their work on Vimeo's pages and gain potential work from clients.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Calling DIY Video Makers: Vimeo Festival + Awards Rides Again |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=December 13, 2011 |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/12/vimeo-festival-awards/ |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Neill|first1=Megan |title=Submissions Now Open For 2nd Vimeo Festival + Awards, $25,000 Grand Prize |url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/submissions-vimeo-festival-awards/ |access-date=May 20, 2020 |work=[[Adweek]] |date=December 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Which-Online-Video-Award-Is-Most-Important-86737.aspx | title = Which Online Video Award Is Most Important? | first= Tory | last= Dreier | date = December 14, 2012 | access-date = May 29, 2020 | work = [[StreamingMedia.com]] }}</ref>
