==History==
[[Image:Yahoo! Music Logo.png|right|thumb|Previous Yahoo! Music logo used until 2013.]]

Yahoo Music began as "LAUNCH", a website and magazine produced by [[LAUNCH Media]] which Yahoo acquired for US$12&nbsp;million in 2001.<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+thinks+entertainment+with+Launch+buy/2100-1023_3-269172.html Yahoo thinks entertainment with Launch buy]. News.com.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-27.</ref> LAUNCH was later rebranded as "Yahoo Music", then simply "Y! Music" in February 2005.  LAUNCH's [[LAUNCHcast]] [[Internet radio]] and music video offerings were integrated into Yahoo's site along with artist profiles containing an extensive selection of music and biographical information.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

On September 14, 2004, Yahoo purchased [[Musicmatch|Musicmatch, Inc.]], makers of the [[Musicmatch Jukebox]] software. As of Musicmatch 10.1, Yahoo has rebranded Musicmatch Jukebox as Yahoo Music Musicmatch Jukebox, and integrated it with the Yahoo Music Engine store. The main difference is the branding and physical program.
In 2005, Yahoo Music became the first major online music service to provide a $5 per month unlimited download service similar to the [[Open Music Model]], albeit with [[digital rights management]], called [[Yahoo Music Unlimited]].
In 2008, Yahoo announced that Yahoo Music Unlimited will be merged into [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]].<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/webdev/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206104504 Rhapsody Takes Over Yahoo's On-Demand Music]. Informationweek.com (February 5, 2008). Retrieved on 2012-03-27.</ref> This merge was completed with the shutdown of Yahoo Music Unlimited on September 30, 2008.

Yahoo Music was the number one online music site in terms of audience reach and total time spent in March 2007.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 2011, Yahoo Music became the main CBS Radio player, with AOL Radio switching to [[Barakadas]].

As of September 2018, Yahoo! Music's site has been consolidated into [[Yahoo! Entertainment]]'s site and all Yahoo! Music's URLs redirect to Yahoo! Entertainment with its own "Music" section.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}
