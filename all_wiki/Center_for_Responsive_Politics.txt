The '''Center for Responsive Politics''' ('''CRP''') is a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]], [[nonpartisan]] research group based in [[Washington, D.C.]], that tracks the effects of money and [[lobbying]] on elections and public policy.<ref name=political-junkie-handbook /> It maintains a public online database of its information.<ref name=open-secrets-about />

Its website, '''OpenSecrets.org''', allows users to track federal [[campaign contributions]] and lobbying by lobbying firms, individual lobbyists, industry, "[[dark money]]", [[list of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], and bills. Other resources include the personal financial disclosures of all members of the [[U.S. Congress]], the president, and top members of the administration. Users can also search by [[ZIP code]]s to learn how their neighbors are allocating their political contributions.<ref>"[https://www.opensecrets.org/states/ Get Local!]" Center for Responsive Politics. opensecrets.org.

==History==
CRP was founded in 1983 by retired U.S. Senators [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]], of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and [[Hugh Scott]] of [[Pennsylvania]], of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=founding/> It was officially incorporated on February 1, 1984.<ref>[https://corponline.dcra.dc.gov/BizEntity.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityId=2785557 "Center for Responsive Politics]". ''Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs''. Government of the District of Columbia. Retrieved November 3, 2019.</ref> In the 1980s, Church and Scott launched a "money-in-politics" project, whose outcome consisted of large, printed books. Their first book, published in 1988, analyzed spending patterns in congressional elections from 1974 through 1986, including 1986 soft money contributions in five states. It was titled ''Spending in Congressional Elections: A Never-Ending Spiral.''<ref name=campaign-finance />

==Activities==
In 1996, CRP launched its online counterpart, OpenSecrets.org. The website is a clearinghouse for data and analysis regarding money in politics.<ref name=founding/>

CRP hosts a [[Revolving door (politics)|Revolving Door]] database which documents the individuals who have passed between the public sector and [[Lobbying in the United States|K Street]].<ref name=the-bottom-line-or-public-health />

In 2015, ''[[The News & Observer]]'' published an [[op-ed]] by Robert Maguire, the political nonprofits investigator at CRP, that was critical of Carolina Rising, a [[501(c)(4)]] social welfare organization (i.e. an organization considered by the [[IRS]] to operate exclusively for the promotion of [[social welfare]]) for spending $4.7 million in 2014 on political ads in support of [[Thom Tillis]], Senate candidate from [[North Carolina]].<ref name=news-observer />

==Funding==
Major donors to the Center for Responsive Politics include the [[Sunlight Foundation]], [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]], the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], [[Open Society Foundations]], the [[Joyce Foundation]], and the [[Ford Foundation]]. At the end of 2017, the organization reported $1.44 million in annual revenue and $2.92 million in net assets.<ref name=990-2017/>

==Staff==
