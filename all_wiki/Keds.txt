===Early history===
[[File:Keds Champion sneaker, woman's, 1916 - Bata Shoe Museum - DSC00729.JPG|thumb|right|Keds Champion sneaker, for women, 1916]]

In 1916, [[U.S. Rubber]] consolidated 30 different shoe brand names to create one company. Initially, the brand name "Peds" was chosen for the company from the [[Latin]] word for feet, but the name was already trademarked. Keds was founded in 1916 and was later acquired by [[Stride Rite Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.a1-sneakers.com/keds-sneakers/|title=Keds Sneakers|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=24 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=From Altoids to Zima:The Surprising Stories Behind 125 Famous Brand Names| url=https://archive.org/details/fromaltoidstozim00morr| url-access=registration| author=Evan Morris| publisher=Simon and Schuster| date=November 9, 2004}}</ref> Because the shoes had a soft rubber sole, they became known as ''[[Sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]]'' as the rubber soles allowed "sneaking around silently".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sportswear-international.com/news/pages/protected/KEDS-BRINGS-SNEAKER-ART-TO-GOeRTZ-17-STORES_4198.html| title=Keds Brings Sneaker Art to Gortz 17 Stores| date=April 13, 2011| publisher=Sportswear International| access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://trendsylvania.net/isnt-spring-without-keds/| title=It Isn't Spring Without Keds| date=May 4, 2015| publisher=Trendsylvania| access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref><ref name=wwd/> By the early 1920s, the shoes were worn by Olympic soccer players, national and international tennis champions, and college athletes.<ref>{{cite book| title=Shoes: What Every Woman Should Know| author=Stephanie Pedersen| date=August 15, 2005| publisher=David & Charles}}</ref> In 1926, the Keds Triumph shoe was introduced.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fngmagazine.com/it/2012/07/mark-mcnairy-x-keds-triumph-canvas/| title=Mark McNairy x Keds Triumph Canvas| date=July 9, 2012| publisher=FNG Magazine| access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>

Keds has produced collaborative collections with companies including [[Kate Spade New York]], Madewell, Opening Ceremony, [[Steven Alan]] and [[Alice + Olivia]].
