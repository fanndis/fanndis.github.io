==Etymology==
The word ''incirlik'' ({{IPA-tr|indʒiɾlik|pron}}) means "fig tree grove", in the [[Turkish language]].

==History==
The decision to build the Incirlik Air Base was made during the [[Second Cairo Conference]] in December 1943, but construction only began after the end of the Second World War. The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] began the work in the spring of 1951. The [[U.S. Air Force]] initially planned to use the base as an emergency staging and recovery site for medium and heavy bombers. The [[Turkish General Staff]] and the U.S. Air Force signed a joint-use agreement for the new Air Base in December 1954. On 21 February 1955, the Air Base was officially named '''Adana Air Base''', with the 7216th Air Base Squadron as the host unit. This Air Base was renamed the "Incirlik Air Base" on 28 February 1958.

===Reconnaissance missions from Incirlik===
The early years of its existence proved the value of the presence of the Incirlik Air Base in [[Turkey]], not only in countering the threat of the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]], but also in responding to crises in the Middle East, such as in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].

Project 119L, a public U.S. Air Force [[weather balloon]] launching program served as a cover story ([[disinformation]]) for the true objective of the Incirlik Air Base: to mount [[strategic reconnaissance]] missions over the [[Soviet Union]]. Under the codename "[[Project Genetrix|GENETRIX]]", these balloon launches were carried out beginning in February 1956.

Following initial weather balloon operations, pilots began flying American [[Lockheed U-2]] aircraft [[reconnaissance]] missions as part of "Operation Overflight" by late 1957. These included nonstop flights back and forth between Incirlik and the [[NATO]] Air Base at the [[Norway|Norwegian]] town of [[Bodø]] starting in 1958.<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|47}}  In addition, U.S. Air Force [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|Boeing RB-47H Stratojets]] and [[U.S. Navy]] [[Martin P4M Mercator|P4M-1Q Mercator]] and [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] reconnaissance flights operated from Incirlik into Soviet-claimed air space over the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], and as far east as [[Afghanistan]].

The Incirlik Air Base was the main U-2 flight base in this entire region beginning in 1956.<ref name=Powers>{{Cite book |last=Powers |first=Francis |title=Operation Overflight: A Memoir of the U-2 Incident |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |year=1960 |isbn=9781574884227 |page=24,29,31–35,46}}</ref> This lasted until 1 May 1960, when a volley of about 14 Soviet [[SA-2]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s shot down the U-2 aircraft flown by the [[United States Central Intelligence Agency|American CIA]] pilot [[Francis Gary Powers]] near [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], Russia, a test site in the Soviet Union's [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM) program.

In addition to the Cold War aerial reconnaissance mission, Incirlik acted as an operational and logistics hub for an array of communications transmission and signals intelligence detachments located at various mountain sites, the latter focused on Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces near Turkey's borders.

===Lebanon crisis===
The [[Lebanon crisis of 1958]] arose during the summer of 1958, prompting the [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] of the United States to order the U.S. Air Force [[Tactical Air Command]] "[[Composite Air Strike Force]] Bravo" (several [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]]) to fly immediately from the United States to Incirlik. This Composite Air Strike Force consisted of [[F-100 Super Sabre]]s, [[B-57 Canberra]]s, R[[F-101 Voodoo]]s, [[B-66 Destroyer]]s, along with the supporting WB-66 weather planes. These aircraft and their supporting airmen overwhelmed the facilities of the Incirlik Air Base&nbsp;– which were also supporting [[transport plane|air transport planes]] that carried a [[U.S. Army]] [[infantry]] [[battalion]] from Germany to Lebanon. In the event, the U.S. Army and the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] were not involved in ground fighting. The U.S. Air Force warplanes flew non-combat missions to cover allied troop movements, to carry out a show-of-force flights over Lebanon, including over [[Beirut]], [[aerial reconnaissance]] flights, and true news and [[propaganda|propaganda leaflet]] drops on Lebanon.

As a part of an effort to bring units with combat experience into the region of Turkey, the [[U.S. Air Forces in Europe]] (USAFE) inactivated the 7216th Air Base Squadron, which had been promoted to an Air Base Group, and activated the 39th Tactical Group in its place at Incirlik on 1 April 1966. This Air Base Group assumed control of the permanent Air Force support units there, and it hosted the rotational Air Force squadrons that conducted training operations, and also maintained a NATO deterrent air force at the Incirlik Air Base.

===As a training site===
After the Lebanon crisis, the Tactical Air Command deployed F-100 fighter squadrons on 100-day rotations to Incirlik from the United States. The flying mission at Incirlik further diversified in 1970 when the [[Turkish Air Force]] agreed to allow the [[U.S. Air Forces in Europe]] to use its [[air-to-ground missile]] testing range at 240&nbsp;km northwest [[Konya]], providing a suitable training area for the warplane squadrons deployed to Incirlik. These units also conducted training at Incirlik's offshore [[air-to-air missile]] range over the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, except during the [[Cyprus dispute]], many types of U.S. Air Force warplanes, including [[F-4 Phantom II]]s, [[F-15 Eagle]]s, [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s, [[F-111 Aardvark]]s, [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]s, and the [[C-130 Hercules]] completed temporary duty rotations at Incirlik, not least in support of the base's NATO/USAFE forward-deployed nuclear mission.

===Embargo===
In mid-1975, the Turkish government announced that all U.S. military bases in Turkey would be closed and transferred to the Turkish Air Force. This action was in response to an [[arms embargo]] that the [[United States Congress]] imposed on Turkey for using American-supplied equipment during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974. Only Incirlik Air Base and [[İzmir Air Base]] remained open due to their NATO responsibilities, but all non-NATO activities at these locations were suspended.

After Congress lifted the embargo in September 1978, and also restored military and naval assistance to Turkey, normal operations resumed in Turkey, and the United States and Turkey signed the [[Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement]] (DECA) on 29 March 1980. After signing the DECA, the USAFE initiated the "Turkey Catch-up Plan" to improve the quality-of-life of airmen stationed at Incirlik. One of the major projects was a completely new base housing complex for airmen and officers.

===First Gulf War, Humanitarian Relief, and Operation Northern Watch===
After [[Iraq]]'s 1990 invasion of neighboring [[Kuwait]], the [[7440th Composite Wing]] (Provisional) assumed operational control of the 39th Tactical Group. The 7440th was the air component of [[Joint Task Force Proven Force]], which eventually controlled 140 aircraft and opened a northern front, forcing Iraq to split its defenses between the north and the south, where the main thrust of coalition attacks originated as part of Operation "[[Desert Storm]]". Following the war, Incirlik hosted "[[Operation Provide Comfort|Combined Task Force Provide Comfort]]", which oversaw [[Operation Provide Comfort]] (OPC), the effort to provide humanitarian relief to millions of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[refugee]]s in northern Iraq.

[[File:Donald H. Rumsfeld greets a U.S. Air Force staff sergeant serving with Combined Task Force Northern Watch.jpg|thumb|Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] during his visit to Incirlik Air Base, 4 June 2001]]
Between 1992 and 1997 [[Vickers VC10]]s from [[No. 101 Squadron RAF]] were based here for [[Operation Warden]] over Iraq.<ref>{{cite journal |title=19 Years Over Iraq |page=11 |journal=The Official RAF Annual Review 2010 |location=[[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] |publisher=[[Key Publishing]] |date=1 December 2010}}</ref>

The 39th TACG was redesignated the 39th Wing on 1 October 1993 and restructured as a standard Air Force objective wing.

The [[U.S. State Department]]'s "Operation Quick Transit" evacuated thousands of Kurds from northern Iraq late in 1996. The wing provided logistical support in Turkey to this operation, which signaled the end of the humanitarian aspect of Operation Provide Comfort (OPC). OPC ended 31 December 1996, and [[Operation Northern Watch]] (ONW) took its place 1 January 1997 with the task to enforce the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|U.N.-sanctioned no-fly zone]] north of the 36th parallel in Iraq.

The 39th Air and Space Expeditionary Wing was activated at Incirlik AB on 15 September 1997, to support and command USAF assets deployed to Incirlik supporting ONW, while Incirlik's tent city, Hodja Village, became the USAF's largest such "temporary" facility.

From 1994, the Turkish Air Force began receiving KC-135R-CRAG Stratotanker aerial refueling tankers. The seven aircraft are operated by the 101st Squadron, stationed at Incirlik.

===September 11, 2001 attacks===
In response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) began in October 2001. Incirlik served as a main hub for missions in support for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], including humanitarian airlift operations, [[MC-130]] special operations missions, [[KC-135]] refueling missions, prisoner transport to Guantanamo Bay(swap from C-17 to C-141s) and sustainment operations for deployed forces. The aerial port managed a 6-fold increase in airflow during the height of OEF. When the main bases in [[Afghanistan]] ([[Bagram Airfield]]) and the [[Uzbekistan]] air base ([[Karshi-Khanabad Air Base]]) were in use the Incirlik's airflow supporting OEF decreased to a baseline sustainment level.

===Iraq War===
[[Operation Northern Watch|ONW]] ended with the start of the [[Iraq War]] on 19 March 2003. ONW flew its last patrol on 17 March 2003, and closed a successful 12-year mission to contain the Iraqi military and inactivated 1 May 2003. The 39th ASEW was also inactivated, effective 1 May 2003. The wing was completely inactivated on 16 July 2003 and the 39th Air Base Group was activated in its place.

On 19 August 2003, the first rotation of deployed [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s and airmen arrived at Incirlik to support various operations in response to the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] as well as the post-[[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] reconstruction of Iraq and the ensuing insurgency.

On 6 January 2004, more than 300 [[U.S. Army]] soldiers of what would become thousands transited through Incirlik as the first stop back to their home post after spending almost a year in Iraq. Incirlik was part of what was described as the largest troop movement in U.S. history. Incirlik provided soldiers with a cot, warm location, entertainment and food for a few hours outside of a hostile war zone.

On 12 March 2004, the 39th Air Base Group inactivated and the [[39th Air Base Wing]] activated to provide the best mix of required support and, as new mission requirements emerge, to shoulder the burden and better contribute in the global war on terrorism.

===2005 Kashmir earthquake humanitarian relief===
Incirlik played a bridge role by providing support in the relief operation started after the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] on 8 October 2005. With the help of Turkish and American airmen, five [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] cargo planes from Air Bases in [[Italy]], Britain, Greece, and France flew urgently needed supplies including 10,000 tents from the warehouse of [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] in [[İskenderun|İskenderun, Turkey]] to [[Islamabad|Islamabad, Pakistan]] on 19 October.

===2006 Hezbollah–Israel War===
During the brief [[2006 Lebanon War|War between Hezbollah and Israel]] in July 2006, the Incirlik Air Base provided solace to Americans who had been evacuated by U.S. Navy [[warship]]s from [[Beirut|Beirut, Lebanon]] to [[Mersin|Mersin, Turkey]].

===2010 land claim lawsuits===
In 2010, three Armenian Americans filed a lawsuit against the Republic of Turkey and two banks for compensation of {{convert|122|acre|km2}} of land in the Adana region of Turkey, where Incirlik Air Base currently stands.<ref name=courtapp>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/harut-sassounian/armenians-sue-turkey-clai_b_800003.html |work=Huffington Post |title=Armenians Sue Turkey Claiming U.S. Air Base Land |date=23 December 2010}}</ref> An American court accepted the case and granted Turkey 21 days to respond to the lawsuit.<ref name=hurryiet>{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=u.s.-court-requests-turkey8217s-defense-in-lawsuit-filed-by-armenian-8211-americans-2011-05-17 |title=TURKEY – US court requests Turkey's defense in lawsuit filed by Armenian-Americans |website=Hurriyetdailynews.com |accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref> The defendant banks in Turkey requested the court extend the deadline for a response until September 2011.

U.S District Judge [[Dolly M.

As a result of the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]] and several Turkish tanker aircraft fueling rogue Turkish F-16's, external electrical power to the base was disconnected. A Turkish no fly order was also put into effect for US military aircraft in the area.  Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook at the time stated that "U.S. facilities at Incirlik are operating on internal power sources."  EUCOM spokesman Navy Capt. Danny Hernandez said: "All our assets in Turkey are fully under control and there was no attempt to challenge that status." and "There was no chaos at this base".

Due to deteriorating relations with Turkey, German MPs and lawmakers have suggested withdrawing German troops and weaponry from the base, to possibly relocate them elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|title=German lawmakers call for withdrawal of Bundeswehr troops from Turkey|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-lawmakers-call-for-withdrawal-of-bundeswehr-troops-from-turkey/a-37911461|website=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> In September 2017 the Germans finally left Turkey and were redeployed at an airbase near [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq]] in [[Jordan]].<ref>[https://www.dw.com/en/german-military-leaves-turkeys-incirlik-airbase/a-40717584 "German military leaves Turkey's Incirlik airbase"] dw.com</ref>

==Nuclear warhead storage==
İncirlik airbase hosts approximately fifty B61 nuclear bombs.<ref name="newyorker"/>

Laicie Heeley, a fellow with the Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense program at the [[Stimson Center]] said in 2016:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baird|first1=Jim|title=US Nuclear Weapons in Turkey at Risk of Seizure by Terrorists, Hostile Forces|url=http://www.stimson.org/content/us-nuclear-weapons-turkey-risk-seizure-terrorists-hostile-forces|website=stimson.org|publisher=[[Stimson Center]]|date=14 August 2016}}</ref>
{{Quote frame|From a security point of view, it’s a roll of the dice to continue to have approximately 50 of America’s nuclear weapons stationed at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, just 70 miles from the Syrian border. These weapons have zero utility on the European battlefield and today are more of a liability than asset to our NATO allies.|align=center}}

During the [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria]], tensions between Turkey and the US moved the [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s, stored by the US at the İncirlik airbase, back into focus. A removal was again debated, but Vipin Narang from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] pointed out, that the process of moving them under these circumstances poses risks and the weapons "could be vulnerable to accidents, theft or attack".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/us-bombs-at-turkish-airbase-complicate-rift-over-syria-invasion Julian Borger and Jennifer Rankin: "US bombs at Turkish airbase complicate rift over Syria invasion"] The Guardian 13 October 2019</ref>
