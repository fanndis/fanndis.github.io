== History ==

In September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the [[Governor of the Straits Settlements]], [[John Anderson (colonial administrator)|Sir John Anderson]], to establish a medical school in Singapore.<ref name="Loo Lay Yen">{{cite web |author=Loo Lay Yen |url=http://www.lib.nus.edu.sg/nusbiodata/history.htm# |title=National University of Singapore: A Brief Chronological History |publisher=Lib.nus.edu.sg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620012218/http://www.lib.nus.edu.sg/nusbiodata/history.htm |archive-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=5 October 1905|title=GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR MALAYA.|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepresswk19051005-1.2.36|access-date=2020-10-29|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|publisher=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (Weekly)}}</ref> Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 [[Straits dollars]] from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Zaccheus|first=Melody|date=2019-02-10|title=Shedding light on life and legacy of Peranakan pioneer Tan Kim Seng|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shedding-light-on-life-and-legacy-of-tan-kim-seng|access-date=2020-10-29|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=A Legacy of Giving|url=https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/giving/why-give/a-legacy-of-giving/|access-date=2020-10-29|website=medicine.nus.edu.sg}}</ref> On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the ''Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School''. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.<ref name=":0" />

In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from [[King Edward VII]] Memorial Fund, started by [[Lim Boon Keng]]. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to ''[[Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine|King Edward VII Medical School]]''. In 1921, it was again changed to ''King Edward VII College of Medicine'' to reflect its academic status.

In 1928,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nus.edu.sg/aboutus/milestones/1905.php#2 |title=National University of Singapore website – Milestones |publisher=Nus.edu.sg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403024959/http://www.nus.edu.sg/aboutus/milestones/1905.php#2 |archive-date=3 April 2012}}</ref> Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.

=== University of Malaya (1949–1962) ===
In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form [[University of Malaya]] on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the [[Federation of Malaya]] and Singapore.

The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

=== Nanyang University (1955-1980) ===
{{main|Nanyang University}}
In 1955, [[Nanyang University]] (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.<ref name="history" />

=== University of Singapore (1962–1980) ===
In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.<ref name="Loo Lay Yen" /> Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.

=== Present form ===
[[File:University Hall, National University of Singapore, February 2020.jpg|thumb|University Hall]]
The National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and [[Nanyang University]] on 6 August 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/general-information/history/|publisher=National University of Singapore|title=History|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref> This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nus.edu.sg/corporate/timeline/ | publisher = National University of Singapore | title = Milestones | accessdate = 11 August 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015032203/http://www.nus.edu.sg/corporate/timeline/ | archive-date = 15 October 2007 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam<ref name="www2.straitstimes.com">{{cite web|url = http://www2.straitstimes.com/Think/Story/STIStory_800832.html |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610195716/http://www2.straitstimes.com/Think/Story/STIStory_800832.html |archive-date=10 June 2012|title = Start-up godfather|work = The Straits Times|first = Grace|last = Chng|date= 20 May 2012}}</ref> and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.

NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.

== Education ==
NUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as [[communication in small groups|small group]] teaching ([[tutorial]]s) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system ([[course credit]]s). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.

NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).<ref>{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Research Opportunities |url=http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/education-at-nus/undergraduate-education/special-undergraduate-programmes/undergraduate-research-opportunities.html |website=Undergraduate Research Opportunities |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref> Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.

=== Residential colleges ===
The more recent residential developments at NUS are ''residential colleges'', modeled after the residential college systems of universities in the United Kingdom and the United States. Like halls, residential colleges have unique co-curricular activities. Residential colleges also have their own academic programmes, with general education (GE) requirements different from each other and from the rest of the University. The academic programmes in residential colleges take place in small-sized seminar classes.

====Cinnamon College====
Cinnamon College houses the University Scholars Programme (USP). Around 620 students live in the USP residential college, which contains the administrative and faculty offices for USP as well as teaching classrooms.

USP students take modules at the college and follow the current USP curriculum. They are required to take eight multi-disciplinary modules specially designed for USP students, including Writing and Critical Thinking, Quantitative Reasoning Foundation, and the University Scholars Seminar. Students have various options to fulfil their USP advanced curriculum requirements that include individual research with faculty mentors, and industrial and entrepreneurial attachments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://utown.nus.edu.sg/about-utown/residential-colleges.html|title=Residential Colleges|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906063842/http://utown.nus.edu.sg/about-utown/residential-colleges.html|archive-date=6 September 2011}}</ref>

====Tembusu College====
Tembusu College is one of the first two Residential Colleges in NUS University Town, an extension to the main NUS campus at Kent Ridge.  Tembusu houses mainly undergraduates, in addition to resident faculty, distinguished visiting scholars and a few graduate fellows.

The college offers five multi-disciplinary modules fulfilling the "University-Level Requirements" (2 General Education modules, 2 Breadth modules, and 1 Singapore Studies module) which most NUS undergraduates must read to graduate. Students read the rest of their modules in their home faculties. A University Town Residential Programme Certificate is issued to eligible students, along with the regular degree scroll. Students from non-modular faculties (i.e. Law, Medicine and Dentistry) also belong to the college, but with coursework tailored to their specific programmes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The Rector of Tembusu College is Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large and former United Nations Ambassador [[Tommy Koh]], who is also the former Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law.

====College of Alice & Peter Tan====
The College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) is a Residential College for all NUS undergraduates. In addition to providing a two-year academic programme (the University Town College Programme), CAPT is distinguished by the vision of helping students engage with the community within and outside of NUS. It consciously weaves the theme of active citizenship and community engagement through its curriculum and other aspects of the student experience.

====Residential College 4====
Residential College 4 (RC4) is the newest Residential College in NUS University Town to offer the University Town College Programme (UTCP). RC4 believes in catalysing a generation of systems citizens in Singapore by employing systems thinking and systems dynamic modelling to elicit mental models to emulate the complexity of the problems around us – such as population dynamics, diseases and healthcare.

Recent events and highlights of RC4 included the holding of the 2nd Asia-Pacific System Dynamics Conference 2017, RC4 Arts Night 2017: P.U.L.S.E, Cognitio Teas with various experts of varying fields, Rector's Tea, as well as volunteering events such as Popiah Making with Senior Citizens @ Lions Befrienders (Clementi) and DroneLive@UTown. More information about the college can be found at [http://rc4.nus.edu.sg/ NUS RC4]

====Ridge View Residential College====
Ridge View Residential College (RVRC) was formally established in April 2014, housed in the former Ridge View Residences. It is the only residential college that is situated outside University Town. The low-rise interconnected buildings are nestled against the backdrop of the Kent Ridge Forest, visually distinct with their brick-clad exteriors, open courtyards and heritage trees. The site was the former location for Kent Ridge Hall until November 2002. As the college program gradually evolved and the student community grew, construction began in November 2015 for a new building to complement the needs of the college. The new Annex building became operational in March 2017.

Law professor Tey Tsun Hang was also tried for allegedly offering better grades in exchange for sex, and was sentenced to five months in jail in June 2013. In February 2014, his verdict was overturned on appeal to the high court and he was acquitted of all charges. Despite this outcome, his attempt to regain permanent residency status in Singapore failed in December 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-NUS lecturer Tey Tsun Hang fails in bid to get back PR status|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ex-nus-lecturer-tey-tsun-hang-fails-bid-get-back-pr-status|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=MediaCorp Press Ltd}}</ref>

On 19 April 2019, a sexual misconduct incident, of which a female student, Monica Baey Beiermann, was filmed while showering in a student hostel by a fellow male student was revealed by the victim.
