The '''Rehnquist Court''' refers to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] from 1986 to 2005, when [[William Rehnquist]] served as [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. Rehnquist succeeded [[Warren Burger]] as Chief Justice after the latter's retirement, and Rehnquist served as Chief Justice until his death in 2005, at which point [[John Roberts]] was nominated and confirmed as Rehnquist's replacement. The Rehnquist Court is generally considered to be more conservative than the preceding [[Burger Court]], but not as conservative as the succeeding [[Roberts Court]]. According to [[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Jeffrey Rosen]], Rehnquist combined an amiable nature with great organizational skill, and he "led a Court that put the brakes on some of the excesses of the [[Earl Warren]] era while keeping pace with the sentiments of a majority of the country."<ref name="jrosen1">{{cite news|last1=Rosen|first1=Jeffrey|title=Rehnquist the Great?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/rehnquist-the-great/303820/|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=The Atlantic|date=April 2005}}</ref>

==Membership==
Rehnquist joined the Court in 1972 after [[Richard Nixon]] appointed him as an Associate Justice, and Rehnquist remained in that position until [[Ronald Reagan]] elevated him to the position of Chief Justice in 1986, when Warren Burger retired. Rehnquist's vacant Associate Justice seat was filled by [[Antonin Scalia]]. The Rehnquist Court thus began with Scalia and eight members of the [[Burger Court]]: Rehnquist, [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], [[Byron White]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun]], [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]], [[John Paul Stevens]], and [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. Powell retired in 1987; President Reagan's nomination of [[Robert Bork]] was defeated by the Senate, and his second nominee, [[Douglas Ginsburg]], withdrew before a vote. Reagan's third nominee, [[Anthony Kennedy]], was confirmed by the Senate. Brennan retired in 1990 and Marshall in 1991, giving President [[George H.W. Bush]] the opportunity to appoint Justices [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. White retired in 1993 and Blackmun retired in 1994, and President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] to replace them.

The composition of the Supreme Court remained unchanged for the balance of the Rehnquist era, which ended when Rehnquist died in September 2005. He was succeeded by the current Chief Justice, [[John Roberts]], who was appointed to the position by [[George W. Bush]].

[[File:USSC justice group photo-2005 current.jpg|thumb|300px|upright=2|The Rehnquist Court in 1998]]
The Rehnquist Court issued several notable rulings touching on many aspects of American life. Landmark cases of the Rehnquist Court include:<ref name="lgreenhouse1"/><ref name="tcurry1">{{cite news|last1=Curry|first1=Tom|title=Chief justice shaped high court conservatism|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5304454/ns/us_news-the_changing_court/t/chief-justice-shaped-high-court-conservatism/|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=NBC|date=4 September 2005}}</ref><ref name="bisk">{{cite news|last1=Biskupic|first1=Joan|title=Rehnquist left Supreme Court with conservative legacy|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/supremecourtjustices/2005-09-04-rehnquist-legacy_x.htm|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=USA Today|date=4 September 2005}}</ref>
* ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'' (1989): In a 5–4 decision written by Justice Brennan, the Court struck down a state law that prevented the burning of the [[flag of the United States|American flag]]. The court held that the act of burning the flag is protected speech under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In a subsequent case, ''[[United States v. Eichman]]'' (1990), the court struck down a similar federal statute.
* ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992): In a [[plurality opinion]] jointly written by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, the court upheld the constitutional right to have an [[abortion]] established in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973). However, ''Casey'' replaced the [[strict scrutiny]] standard of [[judicial review]] set out in ''Roe'' with the less stringent [[undue burden standard]], giving states more leeway in placing restrictions on abortion (e.g. states can require a 24-hour waiting period).
* ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995): In a 5–4 decision written by Justice Rehnquist, the court struck down the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990]] as an unconstitutional extension of Congressional power. Notably, this case marked the first time since the advent of the [[New Deal]] that the court struck down a law based on the [[Commerce Clause]].<ref name="lgreenhouse1"/> The law in question made it a federal crime to have a handgun near or in a school, and the Court held that possession of a handgun is not an economic activity and does not have a substantial effect on [[interstate commerce]].
* ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000): In a 5–4 decision written by Justice Rehnquist, the court struck down portions of the [[Violence Against Women Act of 1994]] as an unconstitutional extension of Congressional power. As in ''Lopez'', the court ruled that Congress had attempted to stretch the [[Commerce Clause]] beyond its constitutional meaning, and it struck down the federal provision that allowed victims of gender-motivated violence to sue their attackers in federal court.
* ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000): In a controversial [[per curiam decision]] in which four justices dissented, the Supreme Court overruled the [[Florida Supreme Court]] and halted a manual [[recount]] of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] ballots cast in Florida. The court ruled that the recount violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] as Florida lacked a statewide standard for recounting votes, and also ruled that no recount could possibly take place before the statutory "safe harbor" deadline. Without a recount, Republican [[George W. Bush]] won Florida's electoral votes and the presidency.
* ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' (2003): In a 5–4 decision written by Justice O'Connor, the court upheld the [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] [[College admissions in the United States#Race and ethnicity|admissions policy]] of the [[University of Michigan Law School]] on the grounds that the law school had a compelling interest in promoting class diversity. The court held that schools could use race as a factor in admissions, so long as the school did not use a quota system, which had been held to be unconstitutional in ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' (1978).
* ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003): In a 6–3 decision in which Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, the court invalidated several state [[sodomy law]]s. ''Lawrence'' overturned ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', a 1986 case in which the court had held that state laws criminalizing gay sexual acts were constitutional. In overturning ''Bowers'', the court ruled that intimate consensual sexual conduct was protected by [[substantive due process]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].
* ''[[McConnell v. FEC]]'' (2003): In a 5–4 decision written by Justices Stevens and O'Connor, the court upheld several provisions of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002]], including its restrictions on "[[soft money]]." The court held that not all political speech is protected by the First Amendment, and that the government has a legitimate interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption. The case was partially overturned by ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' (2010).

==Judicial philosophy==
Rehnquist had often been a lone conservative dissenter during the [[Burger Court]], but the appointments of O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and, perhaps most importantly, Thomas, moved the court to the right.<ref name="jrosen1"/><ref name="bisk2">{{cite news|last1=Biskupic|first1=Joan|title=Justice Stevens' memoir: Modest tone but pointed critiques|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/story/2011-11-02/john-paul-stevens-memoir/51043844/1|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=USA Today|date=2 November 2011}}</ref> Rehnquist favored returning power to the states at the expense of the federal government, and he was joined by Justices O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas in striking down federal laws,<ref name="lgreenhouse1"/> which the Rehnquist Court did more often than any previous court.<ref name="rbl"/><ref name="ringhand">{{cite journal|last1=Ringhand|first1=Lori|title=THE REHNQUIST COURT: A "BY THE NUMBERS" RETROSPECTIVE|journal=Journal of Constitutional Law|date=April 2007|volume=9|issue=4|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume9/issue4/Ringhand9U.Pa.J.Const.L.1033(2007).pdf|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref> These five justices formed a dominant conservative bloc, though Rehnquist was less committed to ideological purity than Scalia or Thomas,<ref name="jrosen1"/> and Justices Kennedy and O'Connor often served as swing votes who would side with the more liberal justices.<ref name="bisk"/><ref name="clane1">{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Charles|title=The Rehnquist Legacy: 33 Years Turning Back the Court|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/04/AR2005090401251.html|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=Washington Post|date=5 September 2005}}</ref> O'Connor's prominence as a swing vote led some to call it the "O'Connor Court," and she wrote several important opinions.<ref name="rbl">{{cite journal|last1=Berger Levinson|first1=Rosalie|title=Will the New Federalism Be the Legacy of the Rehnquist Court?|journal=Valparaiso University Law Review|date=Summer 2006|volume=40|issue=3|pages=589–598|url=http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1221&context=vulr|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref> Justice Stevens, the most senior associate justice during much of the Rehnquist Court, led the liberal bloc, which also included Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.<ref name="dsavage">{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=David|title=Court's Liberal Bloc Stands Firm|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/03/nation/na-legal3|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=LA Times|date=3 July 2005}}</ref> Stevens was often successful in winning over either or both of O'Connor and Kennedy in order to stymie the agenda of the court's conservative bloc.<ref name="msherman">{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Mark|title=Stevens carved liberal legacy on high court|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/04/09/stevens_carved_liberal_legacy_on_high_court/|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=Boston.com|date=9 April 2010}}</ref> Of the nine justices who served from 1994-2005, seven had been appointed by Republican presidents, and the relative liberalism of some of those justices (particularly Stevens and Souter) frustrated many in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name="dsavage2">{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=David|title=Stevens, Souter: Supremely Vexing to GOP|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/10/news/mn-8826|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=LA Times|date=10 June 2001}}</ref>
