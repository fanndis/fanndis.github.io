"'''Judas'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], recorded for her second studio album, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011). It was released by [[Interscope Records]] on April 15, 2011 as the second single from the album. Written and produced by Lady Gaga and [[RedOne|Nadir "RedOne" Khayat]], it is an [[electro house]] song about a woman in love with a man who betrayed her. It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past, and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she cannot escape. Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light.<ref name="post"/> The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in [[Microsoft Word]]. In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups, the song was generally well received by critics, who likened the song to "[[Bad Romance]]" with some noting it should have been the album's lead single.

"Judas" received generally positive reviews from most music critics. The song has a similar sound to Gaga's previous RedOne-produced tracks, including "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", "[[LoveGame]]", "[[Bad Romance]]", and "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]". It contains three distinct [[hook (music)|hooks]] and a [[house music|house]]-influenced [[break (music)|break down]]. Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption, regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be.  "Judas" initially had a strong sales opening, but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga's previous singles. The song reached the top ten of the charts in most major music markets, and also reached the top of the charts in South Korea.

A music video for the song was filmed in April 2011, co-directed by Gaga and [[Laurieann Gibson]] and co-starring [[Norman Reedus]]. It has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played [[Judas Iscariot]] and Gaga played [[Mary Magdalene]]. The video portrays them as modern day missionaries going to Jerusalem. It included the Biblical story of Judas [[Kiss of Judas|betraying]] Jesus, and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death. Before its release, the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] condemned Gaga for the use of religious imagery and her role in the video. However, the video was generally praised by critics and nominated for two awards at the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Gaga has performed "Judas" on a number of television shows, including ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]''{{'}}s "Summer Concert Series", and some of her concert tours, such as the [[Born This Way Ball]], [[artRAVE: The ARTPOP Ball]] and Las Vegas residency [[Lady Gaga Enigma|Enigma]].

<blockquote>
'Judas' is a metaphor and an analogy about forgiveness and betrayal and things that haunt you in your life and how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it is a metaphor.<ref name="msnca">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/music/features/pop-culture-as-religion-lady-gaga-explains-the-controversial-biblical-imagery-in-her-upcoming-music-video-judas|title=Pop culture as religion: Lady Gaga explains the controversial biblical imagery in her upcoming music video "Judas"|last=Ritchie|first=Kevin|date=April 26, 2011|access-date=April 27, 2011|publisher=[[MSN]].

</blockquote>
Gaga further elaborated on the inspiration behind the song as walking towards the light force in her life and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto the source of the light. "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," she said.<ref name="post"/> During her interview with [[Google]], Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life.<ref name="post"/> With [[Popjustice]] she clarified that she has a lot of things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence "Judas" represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape. Gaga said: "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am."<ref name="poop"/>

==Composition==
Garibay said that "Judas" sounded similar to many of Gaga's previous singles, like "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", "[[LoveGame]]", "[[Bad Romance]]", and "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]".<ref name="Garibay"/> According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, "Judas" finds Gaga in a similar territory music-wise but vocally she is in completely new territory; according to [[Popjustice]], in the verses and pre-chorus, Gaga hurls herself into a decadent half-sung, half-rapped [[Jamaican Patois]] style."<ref name="poop"/> Jason Gregory of [[Gigwise]] called the song a "heavy slice of [[Electro house|electro-house]] of the highest order".<ref name="electrohouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/blog/62586/Lady-Gaga-Judas-Review|title=Lady Gaga, 'Judas': Review|first=Jason|last=Gregory|work=[[Gigwise]]|publisher=Giant Digital|date=April 26, 2011|access-date=April 26, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908010940/http://www.gigwise.com/blog/62586/Lady-Gaga-Judas-Review|archive-date=September 8, 2011}}</ref> The song contains three [[hook (music)|hooks]], and begins with Gaga singing the line "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm in love with Judas", accompanied by building [[synths]]. This is followed by a thumping electronic beat, as Gaga sings, "Judahhh/ Juda-a-ah/ Gaga". The utterance of these words are reminiscent of the opening [[verse (popular music)|verse]] in "Bad Romance".<ref name="drop"/> Gaga's vocals are partially spoken, and at times have a Caribbean accent. The first verse follows as: "When he comes to me I am ready/ I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs/ Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain/ Even after three times, he betrays me/ I'll bring him down, a king with no crown."<ref name="googleinterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1660468/lady-gaga-judas-video.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga To Direct 'Judas' Video With Laurieann Gibson|last=Dinh|first=James|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|access-date=March 23, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324190933/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1660468/lady-gaga-judas-video.jhtml|archive-date=March 24, 2011}}</ref> The tone lightens up on the song's [[chorus effect|chorus]], which is influenced by '80s pop in its [[melody]], as the beat picks up a bit and Gaga sings, "I'm just a holy fool/ Oh, baby, it's so cruel/ But I'm still in love with Judas, baby."<ref name="drop"/>

After the second verse and chorus, the song features a [[break (music)|break down]] influenced by [[house music]]. Gaga chants the lines in the same way she does in the middle of "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]". Then she sings, "I wanna love you/ But something's pulling me away from you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to."<ref name="drop"/> In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of [[Rihanna]]'s by Matthew Perpetua of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. He also added that her voice sounded less [[Electro-industrial|dark and dramatic]] and was full of "bubbly sweetness".<ref name="Judas">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/preview-six-songs-from-lady-gagas-born-this-way-20110218|title=Preview Six Songs From Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way'|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|date=February 18, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 20, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223163431/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/preview-six-songs-from-lady-gagas-born-this-way-20110218|archive-date=February 23, 2011}}</ref> Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like [[Heavy metal music|tribal-techno]], and the whole song was "a turbo-charged electrogothic wrongness anthem".<ref name="poop"/> Dan Martin from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that the breakdown was in the [[dubstep]] genre with the chorus being "pure-pop".<ref name="nme"/> There were some similarities and influences of "Bad Romance" in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. "I wanted ['Judas'] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before but in terms of the formula I wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," she added.<ref name="poop"/> According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the [[time signature]] of common time, and is composed in the key of [[C minor]] with a [[tempo]] of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> to E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and the song follows a basic sequence of A{{music|flat}}–Fm<sub>7</sub>–Cm–B{{music|flat}}–Cm as its [[chord progression]].<ref name="Musicnotes">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0092696|title=Lady Gaga 'Judas' Sheet Music|year=2011|publisher=Musicnotes.com|last1=Germanotta|first1=Stefani|last2=Khayat|first2=Nadir|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref>

Gaga had posted some of the lyrics of the song in February 2011,<ref name="dig">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a314761/lady-gagas-judas-what-we-know.html|title=Lady GaGa's 'Judas': What we know|last=Corner|first=Lewis|date=April 15, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418024404/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a314761/lady-gagas-judas-what-we-know.html|archive-date=April 18, 2011}}</ref> and next month she revealed more lyrics for "Judas" in the [[Google]] interview. Gaga also confirmed that the song was influenced by the Biblical [[Judas Iscariot]].<ref name="googleinterview"/> According to Popjustice, lyrically on the surface "Judas" is a song about being double-crossed and contemplating revenge, but being repeatedly drawn to awfulness.<ref name="poop"/> The [[middle eight]] of the song, with the lyrics "But in the cultural sense I just speak in future tense. Judas kiss me if offenced, or wear an ear condom next time", talks about Gaga being beyond the ability to redeem herself, in terms of the traditional views of what a woman is supposed to be. "But I don't want to redeem myself, because in the cultural sense I believe that I'm just before my time. And if you don't like it, wear an ear condom," she explained. The main portion of the song is about Gaga in private and the middle eight is about Gaga in public, two themes that are explored elsewhere on the parent album too.<ref name="poop"/>

==Artwork and release==
In the 42nd episode of Gaga's web video series, called ''Transmission Gagavision'', it was revealed that the single's accompanying [[cover artwork]] was designed by Gaga in [[Microsoft Word]] and featured a black background with the word "Judas" written in red capital letters in [[Impact (typeface)|Impact font]]. Below it was a red [[Christian cross]] with a heart in the middle. Gaga photographed the design on her computer screen using her [[cellular telephone]] "for texture,"<ref name="talks"/> which resulted in visible [[pixels]] on the letters and cross, as well as a faint reflection of her face and hands holding the phone, to appear on the cover.<ref name="talks">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661864/lady-gaga-judas.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Talks 'Judas' Single, Influence Of Alexander McQueen|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|date=April 13, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416075738/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661864/lady-gaga-judas.jhtml|archive-date=April 16, 2011}}</ref><ref name="fans">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1662109/lady-gaga-judas.jhtml|title=Gaga's 'Judas': Fans Weigh In!|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|date=April 15, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416194233/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1662109/lady-gaga-judas.jhtml|archive-date=April 16, 2011}}</ref> The episode showed Gaga sitting in a meeting with her creative team Haus of Gaga, discussing the specifics of her album release.<ref name="talks"/> Scattered around Gaga were a number of photographs, which were speculated by [[MTV]] as something "Judas"-related. On one photo the word "Judas" was printed with a cross on it. Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the artwork could have easily appeared in director [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s version of ''[[Romeo + Juliet|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1996).<ref name="talks"/>

On the 41st episode of ''Transmission Gagavision'', Gaga announced that the song was going to be released soon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/04/06/lady-gaga-protester-judas/|title=Lady Gaga confronts Christian anti-gay protester; announces release date of 'Judas' single|first=Joseph Brannigan|last=Lynch|date=April 6, 2011|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=April 15, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409171316/http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/04/06/lady-gaga-protester-judas/|archive-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref> She added the abstract message along with the announcement: "Let the cultural baptism begin.

==Critical reception==

"Judas" was generally well received by most music critics. Jonathan Van Meter from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' gave the song a positive review, saying the song sounded like it was written for [[The Ronettes]], but was set to a "sledgehammering" dance beat.<ref name="vogue"/> [[MTV]]'s James Dinh noted that the song was very similar in its composition to "[[Bad Romance]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/04/15/lady-gaga-judas-2/|first=James|last=Dinh|title=Lady Gaga's 'Judas' Draws Comparisons To 'Bad Romance'|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|date=April 15, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618094126/http://www.lady-gaga.de/releases/detail/product/176475/judas-the-remixes-pt-ii/|archive-date=June 18, 2011}}</ref> [[Popjustice]] also compared it to "Bad Romance" describing it as "a highly evolved, Titanium-plated 'Bad Romance' from the year 2511 travelling half a millennium back in time to save music from a tidal wave of 'in the club'-obsessed pop drivel, and that's 'Judas'."<ref name="poop">{{cite web|title=Listening to Lady Gaga's next single is an enjoyable experience.|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5381&Itemid=206|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|date=April 6, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429015042/http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5381&Itemid=206|archive-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref> Kevin O'Donnel from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' felt that the song sounded like a rowdy, industrial-disco banger, and described Gaga's performance as "insanely over the top: She alternates between rapping, a robotic monotone, and a crow-like squawk — before gliding into a more conventional chorus that hews closer to 'Bad Romance'."<ref name="spin">{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2011/04/lady-gaga-gets-her-freak-judas/|title=Lady Gaga Gets Her Freak On With "Judas"|last=O'Donnel|first=Kevin|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=Spin Media LLC|date=April 16, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419032817/https://www.spin.com/2011/04/lady-gaga-gets-her-freak-judas/|archive-date=April 19, 2011}}</ref> He complimented the primal energy of the music of "Judas," and felt that the breakdown was one of the weirdest moments to hit the [[pop music]] scene in 2011.<ref name="spin"/> ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s Eric Henderson noted that the disconnection and deviation from Gaga's previous single "[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]" was more pronounced with "Judas". Musically he felt that "Judas" had the same "glitter-jackhammer level as 'Born This Way', though the big anthemic chords are almost inverted—not unlike [[Inner City (band)|Inner City]]'s Big Fun vs. Good Life. It's a good twin, evil twin thing." Henderson continued that the song conjured the imagery of a disturbed vision of hell, and in a warped sense the song seemed more forward-thinking to him and less of a message, "than the 'gay = great' equation at the heart of 'Born This Way'."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/04/single-review-lady-gagas-judas/|title=Single Review: Lady Gaga's "Judas"|last=Henderson|first=Eric|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=April 15, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418205001/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/04/single-review-lady-gagas-judas/|archive-date=April 18, 2011}}</ref>

Gibson and Gaga wanted to make sure the video's direction was perfect—so they directed it themselves. Gibson explained that while working with [[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]] on the music video for "Born This Way", they had felt that the ideas presented did not execute in a way they wanted. But with the music video of "Judas", the whole idea and the inspiration was clear enough. They had initially approached a director, but the dates did not work out with him, so Gaga's manager asked her and Gibson to direct the video instead.<ref name="Judasmv"/> With MTV News, Gibson explained that there was a "groundbreaking" message in the clip, which might "shock" the audience.<ref name="Judasmv"/>

Gibson said she took a moment before agreeing, as she had just wrapped up work on Gaga's [[Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden|Monster Ball HBO special]] but she could not resist in the end. "It's a phenomenal video: really powerful, really impactful," she added.<ref name="Judasmv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661567/lady-gaga-judas-video.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's 'Judas' Video Is 'Groundbreaking,' Laurieann Gibson Says|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=April 7, 2011|access-date=April 9, 2011|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409220055/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661567/lady-gaga-judas-video.jhtml|archive-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref> With ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem.

With ''[[NME]]'' magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being "beyond repentance", which evolved from the continuous media accusations towards her that "[she's] trashy. or pretentious or this and that.

The video opens with a motorcycle gang cruising down a freeway, wearing studded leather jackets. The motorcycle gang are the Twelve Apostles who followed Jesus, including Judas. Gaga as Mary Magdalene clutches onto a Jesus-like figure ([[Rick Gonzalez]]) who wears a golden crown of thorns. Among the riders is Judas ([[Norman Reedus]]), who crosses Gaga's bike as she looks meaningfully towards him. The gang passes under a flyover, when the song starts. They reach their rustic hideout called "[[Electric Chapel]]" where Gaga dances wearing a red [[sarong]] and a bikini top with crosses covering her nipples. Gaga's character watches curiously as the wily Judas enters the biker club and immediately gets involved in a brawl. While trying to protect Jesus from the fights she attempts to warn him about his apostle's impending betrayal, but becomes hypnotized by Judas' allure. The storyline is interspersed with choreographed dance sequences and close-ups of Gaga with stark imagery, including artistic eye make-up, which was compared to the Egyptian [[Eye of Horus]].<ref name="cheat">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663416/lady-gaga-judas-video-references.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's 'Judas' Video: A Pop-Culture Cheat Sheet|last=Montogomery|first=James|date=May 5, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2011|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509022504/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663416/lady-gaga-judas-video-references.jhtml|archive-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> Her flowing blonde hair is accented by a red bandana, blue leather top and puffy white dress in different parts of the clip. The blue top worn by Gaga displays the [[Sacred Heart]], a depiction of what Jesus is said to have revealed as a symbol of his love for humanity. During the second verses, Gaga points towards [[Saint Peter|Peter]] during the line "Build a house", and towards herself during "Or sink a dead body".

After the second chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and a stick of red lipstick bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, [[Maundy (foot washing)|washing their feet]] and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]''<ref name="mtvrevmv"/> and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663388/lady-gaga-laurieann-gibson-judas-video.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga 'Judas' Video 'Fulfills Our Vision,' Laurieann Gibson Says|last=Ellias|first=Matt|date=May 5, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2011|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507073021/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663388/lady-gaga-laurieann-gibson-judas-video.jhtml|archive-date=May 7, 2011}}</ref> Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the [[Kiss of Judas|fateful kiss]] upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls on the ground with a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.

Before its release, the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]'s president [[William Anthony Donohue]] criticized the music video for its portrayal of Gaga as [[Mary Magdalene]]. He spoke exclusively to HollywoodLife.com about Gaga's focus on Judas and Mary Magdalene, calling her "increasingly irrelevant" compared to people with "real talent", and attacked her for seemingly purposefully debuting the song and video close to [[Holy Week]] and [[Easter]].<ref name="hlife">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2011/04/08/lady-gaga-judas-mary-magdalene-catholic-talentless-offended-bill-donohue/|title=Catholic League On Gaga's 'Judas': 'If She Had More Talent, We'd Be More Offended'|last=O'Neil|first=Lorena|publisher=HollywoodLife.com|date=April 8, 2011|access-date=April 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414033851/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2011/04/08/lady-gaga-judas-mary-magdalene-catholic-talentless-offended-bill-donohue/|archive-date=April 14, 2011}}</ref> Gaga noted in an interview with E! that the video was not meant to cause controversy in any way, jokingly adding "the only controversial thing about this video is that I'm wearing [[Christian Lacroix]] and [[Chanel]] in the same frame".<ref name="Judasmv2">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663387/lady-gaga-judas-video.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Says 'Judas' Video Isn't 'An Attack On Religion'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=May 5, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2011|publisher=MTV ([[MTV Networks]])|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507073016/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663387/lady-gaga-judas-video.jhtml|archive-date=May 7, 2011}}</ref> After its release, the Catholic League released a statement clarifying that they did not find the clip to be anti-Catholic, although Gaga toyed with religious iconography in it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.blogs.foxnews.com/2011/05/06/lady-gagas-judas-video-is-a-mess-catholics-say/|title=Lady Gaga's 'Judas' video is 'a mess,' Catholics say|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=May 6, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509070002/http://entertainment.blogs.foxnews.com/2011/05/06/lady-gagas-judas-video-is-a-mess-catholics-say/|archive-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

Oscar Moralde from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' complimented the production of the video by calling it "visually stunning", while adding that "'Judas' is the work of a repertory, not a revolutionary.

"Judas" was part of the setlist of the [[Born This Way Ball]] (2012–2013) concert tour. After a speech about betrayal and loyalty, Gaga performed the track atop a turret of the big castle prop.

The group marched to protest about her "blasphemous" music, taking particular offense to the song "Judas", which they asserted as demeaning Jesus Christ. Responding to the protests, Gaga said in an official statement, "I'm not a creature of your government, Manila" and performed "Judas". Following the controversy, [[Roman Catholic]] legal authorities greenlit the concerts for May 21, 2012 and the following Tuesday, restricting nudity and acts deemed vulgar from the performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga Launches Her Own Protest in the Philippines – And Could Now Face Arrest|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/lady-gaga-launches-protest-philippines-face-arrest-162936894.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|access-date=May 21, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216221845/https://sg.news.yahoo.com/lady-gaga-launches-protest-philippines-face-arrest-162936894.html|archive-date=February 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Filipino Christian group protests Lady Gaga shows|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/filipino-christian-group-protests-lady-gaga-shows-article-1.1080548|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|access-date=May 21, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520072754/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/filipino-christian-group-protests-lady-gaga-shows-article-1.1080548|archive-date=May 20, 2012}}</ref>
