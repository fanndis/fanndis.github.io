'''William Hartley Hume Shawcross''', {{post-nominals|CVO}} (born 28 May 1946, in [[Sussex]], England) is a British writer and commentator, and the former Chairman of the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]].

==Career==
Shawcross was educated at [[St. Aubyns School|St Aubyns Preparatory School]], [[Rottingdean]], [[Eton College]] and [[University College, Oxford]]. He attended [[Saint Martin's School of Art|St Martin's Art School]] to study sculpture after leaving Oxford, and worked as a journalist for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]''.  In 1973, as a Congressional Fellow of the [[American Political Science Association]], Shawcross served in Washington, D.C. on the staffs of Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] and Representative [[Les Aspin]].<ref name="NYT-5-13-79">{{cite news |last1=Mitgang |first1=Herbert |title=How Writer Got Secrets Of U.S. Cambodian Acts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/13/archives/how-writer-got-secrets-of-us-cambodian-acts-information-for.html |accessdate=18 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=13 May 1979}}</ref>

Shawcross writes and lectures on issues of international policy, [[geopolitics]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[refugee]]s, as well as the British royal family.  He has written for a number of publications, including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',<ref name="Guardian">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jul/13/monarchy.biography|title=Profile: William Shawcross|last=Vulliamy|first=Ed|date=2003-07-13|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}</ref> in addition to writing numerous books. 

His books include highly regarded and ground-breaking studies of important and recent international topics: the [[Prague Spring]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Iranian Revolution]], the [[Iraq War]], foreign assistance, [[humanitarian intervention]], and the [[United Nations]]. Two of them, ''Sideshow'' and ''The Quality of Mercy'', were included on ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''{{'}}s annual lists of the roughly 15 top books of the year for 1979 and 1984, respectively.<ref name="NYT-12-30-79A"/><ref name="NYT-12-2-1984"/> 

Since 2002, he has also written several books about the British royal family, including the official biography of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], published in 2009. He writes glowingly about the royal family, for example in an April 2020 piece about [[Queen Elizabeth II]] captioned "Thank God for the Queen": "One happy result of the horrible virus is that it has prompted the Queen to give us not one but two statements of her faith in this country and in God. Together they demonstrate vividly the exquisite, strong but light touch of our almost timeless monarch."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shawcross |first1=William |title=Thank God for the Queen |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/thank-god-for-the-queen |accessdate=2 September 2020 |work=www.spectator.co.uk |date=14 April 2020}}</ref> 

Shawcross was Chairman of [[ARTICLE 19]], the international centre on censorship, from 1986 to 1996. He was a Member of the Council of the [[Disasters Emergency Committee]] from 1997 to 2002, and a board member of the [[International Crisis Group]] from 1995 to 2005.<ref name="Independent">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/william-shawcross-profile-from-scourge-of-nixon-to-establishment-lackey-10487534.html|title=William Shawcross: From scourge of Nixon to Establishment lackey?|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Shawcross was a member of the [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]]'s Informal Advisory Group from 1995 to 2000. From 1997 to 2003, he was a member of the [[BBC World Service]] Advisory Council. In 2008, he became a Patron of the [[Wiener Library]], and in 2011 he joined the board of the [[Anglo-Israel Association]] and was appointed to the board of the [[Henry Jackson Society]].

Shawcross took up the Chairmanship of the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] on 1 October 2012, and served as chair until February 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.williamshawcross.org/index.php?page=cv |title=Curriculum Vitae  |website=William Shawcross}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/william-shawcross-reappointed-as-chair-of-the-charity-commission |title=William Shawcross reappointed as Chair of the Charity Commission |website=GOV.UK}}</ref> His appointment to a second three-year term in 2015 was called "controversial" at the time, with some Labour Party members raising concerns about how it was handled.<ref name="Telegraph-2015">{{cite news |last1=Hope |first1=Christopher |title=Political storm over Charity Commission boss:Labour furious over reappointment of Tory favourite William Shawcross |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11412937/Political-storm-over-Charity-Commission-boss.html |accessdate=3 November 2019 |work=The Telegraph |date=15 February 2015}}</ref> A January 2018 assessment of his tenure concluded that he "won praise from government but heavy criticism from within the charity sector."  <ref name="3S">{{cite news |last1=Cook |first1=Stephen |title=The ups and downs of the Shawcross years |url=https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/ups-downs-shawcross-years/governance/article/1455092 |accessdate=2 November 2019 |work=Third Sector |date=23 January 2018}}</ref>

==Political views==
Shawcross's politics have been described as having moved to the right over the course of his life.<ref name="Independent"/>  His 1979 book on Cambodia, ''Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia'', resulted in Shawcross's being "lauded by liberal intellectuals and America's East Coast elite."<ref name="Independent"/>  The U.S. left continues to praise Shawcross's earlier work; for example, in September 2019, ''Sideshow'' was cited at length in an opinion piece in ''[[The Intercept]]'' defending Rep. [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]].<ref name="Intercept">{{cite news |last1=Mackey |first1=Robert |title=Creepy Republican Ad During Democratic Debate Attacks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez |url=https://theintercept.com/2019/09/12/debate-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-new-faces-pac-ad/ |accessdate=1 November 2019 |work=The Intercept |date=13 September 2019}}</ref>

As an initial indicator of how his views were shifting, in his 1990 introduction to the revised edition of his 1970 biography of [[Alexander Dubček]], Shawcross wrote, "My own principal criticism [of his 1970 book] is that I did not realize adequately that the experiment of humane Communism, or Socialism with a Human Face, was impossible, perhaps even a contradiction in terms.  . . .  The last twenty years have shown nothing so much as the catastrophic nature of Communism everywhere.  Wherever Communism has triumphed—I think particularly of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos—its consequences have been utterly disastrous."<ref name="Dubcek">{{cite book |last1=Shawcross |first1=William |title=Dubcek |date=1990 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-671-72870-9 |edition=Rev. and updated |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dubcek00shaw }}</ref>{{rp|page=6}}  In 1992, he wrote an "admiring" biography of [[Rupert Murdoch]].<ref name="Independent"/>  In 1994, about his 1970s journalism from Vietnam, in light of subsequent abuses by the governments of Cambodia, [[Vietnam]], and [[Laos]], Shawcross wrote, "I think I concentrated too easily on the corruption and incompetence of the South Vietnamese and their American allies, was too ignorant of the inhuman Hanoi regime, and far too willing to believe that a victory by the Communists would provide a better future."<ref name="Commentary">{{cite news |last1=Rodman |first1=Peter W. |title=Grantsmanship & the Killing Fields |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/grantsmanship-the-killing-fields/ |accessdate=1 November 2019 |work=Commentary}}</ref>  Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, he supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq.<ref name="Guardian"/>  His 2003 selection by Buckingham Palace to write the authorized biography of the Queen Mother was described as drawing "Shawcross into the bosom of the monarchy in a way rarely enjoyed by any layman", and the resulting book led to him being described as a "royalist writer."<ref name="Guardian"/><ref name="Independent"/>  In November 2018 he appeared to walk back his 1979 criticism of Henry Kissinger in ''Sideshow;'' in an argument that Kissinger should be allowed to speak at [[New York University]], Shawcross noted "regret" for the "tone" of his prior criticism of Kissinger, which he minimized as "a policy disagreement over Cambodia", as opposed to "a moral crusade", and he concluded that Kissinger "is an extraordinary man who deserves respect."<ref name="RCP">{{cite news |last1=Shawcross |first1=William |title=Kissinger and I Were Once at Odds, But Let Him Speak |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/11/20/kissinger_and_i_were_once_at_odds_but_let_him_speak_138694.html |accessdate=1 November 2019 |work=Real Clear Politics |date=20 November 2018}}</ref>  In November 2019 he took a position in support of Britain's exit from the European Union, on the basis of the E.U.'s problematic nature and approach, summarizing his position as "There are risks in proceeding with [[Brexit]].

The change over time in Shawcross's politics has been compared to the political shifts of his father [[Hartley Shawcross|Sir Hartley Shawcross]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], and [[Christopher Hitchens]].<ref name="BRIT-COUNCIL">{{cite web |title=William Shawcross – Literature |url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/william-shawcross |website=British Council: Literature |accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="NS">{{cite news |last1=Cowley |first1=Jason |title=NS Man of the year – William Shawcross |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/194905 |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=New Statesman |language=en}}</ref>  While noting other speculative possible reasons for the shift, [[William Traub]] posited, "it's more instructive to consider the possibility that Shawcross has remained true to his principles, but that a morally driven foreign policy looks very different after 9/11 than it did before."<ref name="NYT-1-11-04">{{cite news |last1=Traub |first1=James |title=The Good War? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/books/the-good-war.html |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=11 January 2004}}</ref>

==Selected Books==
===''Dubcek'' (1970, revised 1990)===
Shawcross's first published book was a biography of [[Alexander Dubček]], the leader of [[Czechoslovakia]] during the 1968 [[Prague Spring]] whose "socialism with a human face" briefly brought freedom into the [[Soviet Bloc]].  According to the introduction to the 1990 edition, the book's genesis was in Shawcross's travels to Czechoslovakia as a 22-year-old recent college graduate in 1968–69, when he witnessed the Prague Spring and its aftermath.<ref name="Dubcek"/>{{rp|pages=1–3}}  In April 1969, as his first assignment, ''[[The Times]]'' sent Shawcross to Prague to report on Dubcek's deposition from power, which led him to decide "I would like to write a book about Dubcek", and to spend several months in Czechoslovakia researching it.<ref name="Dubcek"/>{{rp|pages=3–5}}  The book concluded (grandiosely) that Dubcek "was quite convinced that he had discovered in 1968 that for which philosophers and philanthropists have for centuries searched—the just society.  He may have been right."<ref name="Dubcek"/>{{rp|page=206}}

''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', in December 1971, named ''Dubcek'' among the year's "noteworthy titles", describing it in a June 1971 capsule review as: "Written less than a year after Alexander Dubcek's resignation, this biography of the Czech leader by a London journalist is an authoritative, first‐rate job."<ref name="NYT-12-5-71">{{cite news |title=1971: A Selection Of Noteworthy Titles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/05/archives/1971-a-selection-of-noteworthy-titles.html?searchResultPosition=3 |accessdate=3 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=5 December 1971}}</ref><ref name="NYT-6-6-71">{{cite news |title=A Selection Of Recent Titles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/06/archives/a-selection-of-recent-titles-a-selection-of-recent-titles.html?searchResultPosition=2 |accessdate=3 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=6 June 1971}}</ref>

Shawcross revised and reissued ''Dubcek'' in 1990 upon its subject's return to prominence and power during the [[Velvet Revolution]], following two decades of rustication.

===''Crime and Compromise: Janos Kadar and the Politics of Hungary Since Revolution'' (1974)===
Shawcross next wrote "a political study of Hungarian politician [[Janos Kadar]]" who, like Dubcek, "tried to negotiate with Communist dogmas to create more humane regimes."<ref name="BRIT-COUNCIL"/> 
In it, Shawcross argued that, following Kadar's 1956 betrayal of Hungarian President [[Imre Nagy]], "Kadar worked to reunite Hungary and succeeded in making it one of the most advanced countries in the [[Warsaw Pact]] in both economic and democratic terms."<ref name="BRIT-COUNCIL"/>

In his mostly-favorable review in ''The Washington Post'', Robert Dean, a CIA analyst, wrote that "Shawcross has succeeded admirably in conveying a sense of the atmosphere which has come to prevail in the wake of the reform, and how a cautious reformist ethos and economic success have in turn shaped cultural life, social policies, and the attitudes of youth."<ref name="W-POST-6-30-1974">{{cite news |last1=Dean |first1=Robert W. |title=Measure for Measure: Hungary Under Janos Kadar (book review) |work=Washington Post |date=30 June 1974}}</ref> Dean thought that the book portrayed Kadar less well than it did Hungary: "One senses that Shawcross would have liked to have produced a biography of Kadar but was stymied by the incompleteness of information."<ref name="W-POST-6-30-1974"/>

===''Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia'' (1979)===
''Sideshow'' is, at least in the United States, Shawcross's best known and most controversial book.<ref name="NYT-3-3-04">{{cite news |last1=Asmus |first1=Ronald D. |title=Using American Power: Definite and Opposite Views |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/books/books-of-the-times-using-american-power-definite-and-opposite-views.html?searchResultPosition=8 |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=3 March 2004}}</ref> To write it, Shawcross interviewed over 300 people and reviewed thousands of U.S Government documents, some classified Top Secret, obtained using the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].<ref name="NYT-4-24-79">{{cite news |last1=Leonard |first1=John |title=Books of The Times – SIDESHOW.

The study stresses how the decision to attack a neutral country was a patent violation of the American Constitution. As in his previous two books, Shawcross combines an interest in international policies with a private focus on the personal relationship between Nixon and Kissinger.

''Sideshow'' received high praise and awards.  The [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury recommended a special citation for it in the 1980 awards based on its  "extraordinary qualities", although it was ineligible for the prize because its author was not American; the Pulitzer board declined that recommendation, however.<ref name="NYT-4-15-80">{{cite news |last1=Kihss |first1=Peter |title=Drama Pulitzer to 'Talley's Folly'; Mailer Honored for Gilmore Book |work=New York Times |date=15 April 1980}}</ref> ''The New York Times Book Review'' selected ''Sideshow'' among its top 17 "Editor's Choice" books of 1979, describing it as an "indictment" of Kissinger and Nixon.<ref name="NYT-12-30-79A">{{cite news |title=Editors' Choice, 1979 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/12/30/issue.html |accessdate=3 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=30 December 1979}}</ref>  It won the [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Award in Journalism]]'s Book Award for 1979.<ref name="NYT-2-25-80">{{cite news |title=Reporter and an Obituary Writer for the Times Get Polk Awards |work=New York Times |date=25 February 1980}}</ref>  Columnist [[Anthony Lewis]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', "I think it is the most interesting and the most important book on American foreign policy in many years.

Kissinger, who declined Shawcross's interview requests when the book was being written,<ref name="RCP"/> vociferously denounced ''Sideshow'', as did American conservatives.

===''The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience'' (1984)===
''The Quality of Mercy'' again addresses Cambodia, but as a critical assessment of the aid and relief efforts of governments, UN bodies, and international relief agencies following the suffering inflicted on that country by its [[Khmer Rouge]] government and by its neighbor, [[Vietnam]].

Though it has received less attention than others, ''The Quality of Mercy'' is, by some, the most highly regarded of Shawcross's books.  To be sure, it has critics.  The historian and Cambodia expert [[Ben Kiernan]], who "was Shawcross's interpreter for several weeks" when he was researching the book, wrote a long, critical essay.<ref name="BCAS">{{cite journal |last1=Kiernan |first1=Ben |title=William Shawcross, declining Cambodia |journal=Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars |date=1986 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |doi=10.1080/14672715.1986.10412591 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The Australian journalist [[John Pilger]]—who is criticized in ''The Quality of Mercy'',<ref name="Quality"/>{{rp|pages=139–141}} and the two men have a continuing history of public disagreements<ref name="Kamm">{{cite web |title=Pilger and his public |url=https://oliverkamm.typepad.com/blog/2007/12/pilger-and-his.html |website=Oliver Kamm |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>—reportedly attacked Shawcross in a ''[[New Statesman]]'' review as a "born-again cold warrior."<ref name="NLR">{{cite news |last1=Evans |first1=Grant |title=William Shawcross's Cambodian Crusade, NLR I/152, July–August 1985 |url=https://newleftreview.org/issues/I152/articles/grant-evans-william-shawcross-s-cambodian-crusade.pdf |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=New Left Review |date=July–August 1985 |language=en}}</ref>
But [[Ed Vulliamy]], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', called it "Shawcross's bravest, most complicated and astute work",  commenting that "the little-known ''Quality of Mercy'' examined and challenged deficiencies in the international aid programme to Cambodia, which lavished assistance on the remnants of [[Pol Pot]]'s Khmer Rouge, perpetuating the violence."<ref name="Guardian"/>
The editors of ''The New York Times Book Review'' included it among their fifteen "Editor's Choice" books, as the best books of 1984.<ref name="NYT-12-2-1984">{{cite news |title=Editor's Choice: The Best Books of 1984 |work=The New York Times |date=2 December 1984}}</ref>  [[Colin Campbell (critic)|Colin Campbell]], in the ''[[New York Times]]'', concluded, "This is a startling book and most of it is very persuasive."  He stated that on most counts, "Mr. Shawcross's subtlety and lack of sanctimony are remarkable."  He also considers it "noteworthy that a journalist who in the past attacked American policy so fiercely has, in this book, portrayed at least the United States Embassy in [[Bangkok]] as one of the best informed and most decently efficient actors in the refugee drama."<ref name="NYT-7-16-94"/>  Human rights activist [[Aryeh Neier]], reviewing ''The Quality of Mercy'' in the ''New York Times Book Review'', similarly stated that "a reader cannot help but be impressed by his apparent fairness" and called it "a splendid book that will have a profound impact."<ref name="7-22-84A"/>  He concluded that ''The Quality of Mercy'' "may well be the best account we have of the politics of international charity."<ref name="7-22-84A"/>

''The Quality of Mercy'' was republished in 1985 with an additional final chapter, "Report from Ethiopia—May 1985", describing the then-ongoing relief effort in response to the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]] in light of the Cambodian experience.<ref name="Quality">{{cite book |last=Shawcross |first=William |title=The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust, and Modern Conscience; with a Report from Ethiopia |date=1984 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0671606409 |edition=Touchstone 1985}}</ref>{{rp|pages=431–451}}  Shawcross drew a number of lamentable parallels, for example that "in Ethiopia as well as Cambodia, humanitarian aid was being used by a Communist regime to underwrite war."<ref name="Quality"/>{{rp|pages=450–451}} The essay concluded, "In neither Cambodia nor Ethiopia did the ordinary people for whom the aid was delivered benefit from it to the extent which had been intended and which they deserved.

===''The Shah's Last Ride'' (1988)===
This book's US subtitle was "The Fate of an Ally;" its 1989 UK subtitle was "The Story of the Exile, Misadventures and Death of the Emperor."  ''The Shah's Last Ride'' is, in the words of its prologue, "the story of a journey, the Shah's forlorn journey into exile and death, and of various elements of his rule—his relations with the British and Americans, his secret police, [[SAVAK]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], oil, the arms trade. The tale of the fall and exile of the Shah is one which illustrates the nature of relationship between states and leaders.  It is a story of loyalty and convenience."<ref name="Shah">{{cite book |last1=Shawcross |first1=William |title=The Shah's last ride: the story of the exile, misadventures and death of the Emperor |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |isbn=070113254X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/shahslastridesto06shaw }}</ref>{{rp|page=14}}  It retraces the odyssey of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|the last Shah]] of [[Iran]] after being driven into exile by the [[Iranian Revolution]], first to [[Egypt]], and then in succession to [[Morocco]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Mexico]], [[the United States]], [[Panama]], and finally back to Egypt, where he died.<ref name="NR-1988">{{cite news |last1=Ajami |first1=Fouad |title=Kissinger's Revenge (book review) |work=The New Republic |date=10 October 1988}}</ref>  Shawcross traces his own interest in Iran to the 1960s: "Ardeshir Zahedi, the Shah's Ambassador to London, became a firm friend of my family then, and has remained so since."<ref name="Shah"/>{{rp|page=417}}  As a further family connection, Shawcross's father "was once President of the [[Iran Society in Britain]]."<ref name="Shah"/>{{rp|page=419}}

Many reviewers praised ''The Shah's Last Ride'' for the high quality of its narrative and storytelling, with praise such as "a compelling, evenhanded, artful book, more like a novel than a history;"<ref name="WPO-10-2-88">{{cite news |last1=Powers |first1=Thomas |title=King Without a Country (book review) |work=Washington Post |date=2 October 1988}}</ref><ref name="CHI-TRIB">{{cite news |last1=Nelson |first1=Warren L. |title=Understanding Iran: Straight Talk About a Land that Most Americans Like to Hate (book reviews) |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 October 1988}}</ref><ref name="Kirkus">{{cite news |title=THE SHAH'S LAST RIDE by William Shawcross (book review) |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/william-shawcross/the-shahs-last-ride/ |accessdate=20 November 2019 |work=Kirkus Reviews |date=17 October 1988 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="ZK">{{cite news |last1=Khalilzad |first1=Zalmay |title=Sad Stories About the Shah's Last Days (book review) |work=Wall Street Journal |date=2 November 1988}}</ref>  Much of what criticism the book received arose from its narrow focus.  One Middle East expert, [[Daniel Pipes]], wrote that Shawcross "has done his best to eke out the details of this sad, small tale. But this reader concludes that he has pretty much wasted his time, and Shawcross himself seems to know it."<ref name="Orbis">{{cite news |last1=Pipes |first1=Daniel |title=The Shah's Last Ride: The Fate of an Ally (book review)|url=https://www.danielpipes.org/11238/shah-last-ride |accessdate=20 November 2019 |work=Orbis |date=Spring 1989 |language=en}}</ref>  Another, [[Zalmay Khalilzad]] (later Republican-appointed U.S. Ambassador to, successively, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations), criticized the book for not highlighting the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]]'s failures in its dealings with the Shah.<ref name="ZK"/>  A third Middle East expert, [[Fouad Ajami]], criticized Shawcross for telling the Shah's story as a sympathetic (or at least pathetic) tale of "the woes of an ailing, old man, dying of cancer" rather than one of an oppressive dictator and his long, brutal reign.<ref name="TNR-1988">{{cite news |last1=Ajami |first1=Douad |title=Kissinger's Revenge (book review) |work=The New Republic |date=10 October 1988}}</ref> Ajami further criticized Shawcross's choice of sources from the Shah's circle, and his credulous attitude toward them. In a critique that may have foreshadowed Shawcross's later writing about another royal family, Ajami posited that Shawcross's sources, including the Shah's twin sister, [[Ashraf Pahlavi|Princess Ashraf]], were able to work their royal charms to disarm his reportorial skepticism.<ref name="TNR-1988"/>

===''Murdoch'' (1992)===
In a change from international affairs, Shawcross next wrote a biography of [[Rupert Murdoch]].  Its 1992 UK title was ''Rupert Murdoch: Ringmaster of the Information Circus;'' it was published in the US in 1993 as ''Murdoch: The Making of a Media Empire''. ''New York Times'' reviewer Herbert Mitgang commented there was a "red flag" present: Shawcross had let Murdoch read a draft before publication, violating "an unwritten rule for the most esteemed American biographers."<ref name="NYT-1-27-93">{{cite news |last1=Mitgang |first1=Herbert |title=Books of The Times; The Inside Tales of a Media Empire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/27/books/books-of-the-times-the-inside-tales-of-a-media-empire.html?searchResultPosition=11 |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=27 January 1993}}</ref> The pundit [[Andrew Sullivan]], in ''The New York Times Book Review'', described ''Murdoch'' as "what a Murdoch paper would surely call a suck-up."<ref name="NYT-1-17-93">{{cite news |last1=Sullivan |first1=Andrew |title=A Press Lord Without a Rosebud |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/books/a-press-lord-without-a-rosebud.html?searchResultPosition=25 |accessdate=3 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=17 January 1993}}</ref>

Despite the issues raised, Mitgang's review was generally positive, while Sullivan wrote that Shawcross, albeit "unwittingly", "achieved something very valuable", in "expos[ing] the banality of a highly sophisticated and successful businessman", and "plac[ing] the real issue behind the story of Mr. Murdoch's career—the nature of a democratic culture—away from the petty demonization of an entrepreneur and on the larger forces that have determined his fate."<ref name="NYT-1-27-93"/><ref name="NYT-1-17-93"/> ''The Economist'' made a similar point in a more straightforward way: "Although this is a fine, superbly-researched and vivid book on the Murdoch enigma, the enigma remains."<ref name="ECON-1992">{{cite news |title=Paper Money (book reviews) |work=The Economist |date=26 September 1992}}</ref>

The 1992 publication of ''Murdoch'' raised a brief flurry in the literary world. ''[[The New Yorker]]'', then edited by [[Tina Brown]], published a short ''Talk of the Town'' piece by [[Francis Wheen]], wondering how "could Willie Shawcross, who made his name in the seventies with ''Sideshow'', an indignant expose of Henry Kissinger's destruction of Cambodia, become Murdoch's hagiographer?"<ref name="NYER">{{cite news |last1=Wheen |first1=Francis |title=Seduction |url=https://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1992-10-12#folio=042 |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=New Yorker |date=12 October 1992}}</ref> David Cornwall, better known by his ''nom de plume'' [[John le Carré]], wrote a responsive letter in defense of Shawcross, calling Wheen's essay "one of the ugliest pieces of partisan journalism that I have witnessed in a long life of writing."<ref name="Newsweek-1992">{{cite news |title=The Letter She Wouldn't Print |url=https://www.newsweek.com/letter-she-wouldnt-print-200084 |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=Newsweek |date=25 October 1992 |language=en}}</ref> Brown said she would only publish Cornwall's letter if he cut it to one paragraph, he released it to the press instead, and the contretemps drew much media attention.<ref name="BRIT-COUNCIL"/><ref name="NEWSWEEK">{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Russell |title=When Harry Met Willie |url=https://www.newsweek.com/when-harry-met-willie-200072 |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=Newsweek |date=25 October 1992 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="WP-1992">{{cite news |last1=Streitfeld |first1=David |last2=Trueheart |first2=Charles |title=THE TIFF OF THE TOWN |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/10/15/the-tiff-of-the-town/e331897a-cdc6-42f6-ae80-72edf17625e2/ |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=15 October 1992}}</ref><ref name="NYT-10-15-92">{{cite news |last1=Carmody |first1=Deirdre |title=Tina Brown Accused Of Misusing New Yorker |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/15/arts/tina-brown-accused-of-misusing-new-yorker.html |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=15 October 1992}}</ref>

===''Deliver Us From Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords, and a World of Endless Conflict'' (2000)===
''Deliver Us From Evil'' overviews the work of the [[United Nations]] during the 1990s to ameliorate situations in many of the world's trouble spots of that decade, largely as seen through the eyes of [[Kofi Annan]], whom Shawcross accompanied on his travels.<ref name="ECON-5-13-2000">{{cite news |first=A |last=nonymous |url=https://www.economist.com/review/2000/05/11/other-mens-wars |title=Other men's wars (book review) |work=Economist |date=13 May 2000}}</ref>

Reviews were mixed to negative.  Some meted out limited praise: "highly readable, if at times repetitive and scattershot,"<ref name="BOOT">{{cite news |last1=Boot |first1=Max |authorlink1=Max Boot|title=Paving the Road to Hell (book review) |work=Foreign Affairs |date=March–April 2000}}</ref> "admirably fair in his judgments,"<ref name="ECON-5-13-2000"/> and "thoughtful but inconclusive" as well as "a useful reality check for all those well-meaning people who clamor for the United Nations to do something."<ref name="WP-3-26-2000">{{cite news |last1=Lippman |first1=Thomas W. |authorlink1=Thomas Lippman|title=No End of Trouble (book review) |work=Washington Post |date=26 March 2000}}</ref>

At the most negative end of the spectrum, a capsule review in ''The New Yorker'' concluded: "Shawcross's reporting here is often secondhand; his prose is dreary; and his thinking (which frequently takes refuge in anti-Americanism) is lazy. The result is an insult to the gravity of the issues he purports to address, and—worse—to the anguish of the world's politically endangered peoples."<ref name="NYER-4-24-2000">{{cite news |title=Briefly Noted |first=A |last=nonymous |url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2000-04-24#folio=218 |accessdate=22 November 2019 |work=New Yorker |date=24 April 2000}}</ref>  Shawcross's optimistic attitude "as a booster for the UN" was criticized as unwarranted by reviewers from left and right, with all arguing the UN has a long record of failures.<ref name="NYER-4-24-2000"/><ref name="ECON-5-13-2000"/><ref name="BOOT"/> His identifying Cambodia as a UN success story drew particular quibbles,<ref name="WP-3-26-2000"/><ref name="KAGAN">{{cite news |last1=Kagan |first1=Robert |authorlink1=Robert Kagan|title=Power Failure (book review) |work=Commentary |date=April 2000}}</ref> while several found fault with the book's analytical conclusions (or, more precisely, its lack thereof).<ref name="WP-3-26-2000"/><ref name="KAGAN"/>

[[Robert Kagan]], reviewing it for ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', labelled ''Deliver Us From Evil'' "little more than an exercise in liberal handwringing."<ref name="KAGAN"/>

The more balanced reviewers, witness [[Terence O'Brien (New Zealand diplomat)|New Zealand diplomat Terence O'Brien]] who was on the ground at UN Headquarters for large parts of Shawcross' tale during the ascendancy of [[Bill Clinton]], paint it as excellent first-hand history and feel that it "is unlikely soon to be bettered", terming his book sharp and comprehensive. "Shawcross enjoys a reputation as a chronicler of the blemishes in modern international behaviour... The response of the so-called international community to the continuing rash of internal conflict is subjected to clinical appraisal" might have triggered some reviewers' [[esprit de corps]] so readers are well-advised to read and judge for themselves.<ref name="tonzh">{{cite news |last1=O'Brien |first1=Terence |authorlink1=Terence O'Brien (New Zealand diplomat)|title=William Shawcross: Deliver Us From Evil |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=150610 |work=New Zealand Herald |date=9 September 2000}}</ref>

===''Allies'' (2003)===
Like other Shawcross books, ''Allies'' was published under two different subtitles, in a 2003 hardback as "The U.S., Britain, and Europe in the Aftermath of the Iraq War", and in a 2005 paperback as "Why the West Had to Remove Saddam."  The book has been described as a polemic, rather than a work of journalism, with some commentators observing that, unlike other books by Shawcross, it has no footnotes.<ref name="NYT-1-11-04"/><ref name="NS"/><ref name="ECONOMIST-2004">{{cite news |title=Dear friends; the Iraq War (book review) |work=The Economist |date=31 January 2004}}</ref> One critic wrote of Shawcross as "a vocal supporter of President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[War on Terror]] and praises [[Tony Blair]]'s interventionist policies in Iraq and [[Afghanistan]], writing off criticism of the two leaders as hysterical."<ref name="BRIT-COUNCIL"/>

Regarding Shawcross's position in ''Allies'' compared to his prior positions, especially in ''Sideshow'', the reviewer in ''The New York Times'' asked "What's going on here?" while the conservative U.S. journals ''[[The National Review]]'' and ''The American Spectator'' were surprised and laudatory.<ref name="NYT-1-11-04"/><ref name="NR">{{cite news |title=The Shawcross Redemption |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2004/01/shawcross-redemption/ |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=National Review |date=29 January 2004}}</ref><ref name="AS-2004">{{cite news |last1=Regnery |first1=Alfred S. |title=Our New Best Friend (book review) |work=The American Spectator |date=March 2004}}</ref>  ''The National Review'' wrote, "Shawcross has written an outstanding justification of the Anglo-American effort to drive [[Saddam Hussein]] from power. It is an exemplary piece of moral clarity and fine writing."<ref name="NR"/>

===''Justice and the Enemy: Nuremberg, 9/11, and the Trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed'' (2011)===
''Justice and the Enemy'' considered the [[George W. Bush]] administration's post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] military commissions in light of the [[Nuremberg trials]].  In it, according to  the law professor and former U.S. Justice Department official [[Jack Goldsmith]], Shawcross "provides a deeply sympathetic account of how" the Bush administration resolved "difficult choices and trade-offs in deciding how to bring justice to the perpetrators of 9/11."<ref name="NYT-1-20-12">{{cite news |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Jack |title=Justice And the Enemy – Nuremberg, 9/11, and the Trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed – By William Shawcross – Book Review |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/justice-and-the-enemy-nuremberg-9-11-and-the-trial-of-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-by-william-shawcross-book-review.html?searchResultPosition=26 |accessdate=3 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=20 January 2012}}</ref>

''The Economist''{{'}}s reviewer of ''Justice and the Enemy'' found the book lacking "original research on [[al-Qaeda]]", its Nuremberg comparisons unhelpful, and its author "keener to score points against all those who roundly condemn President George Bush's strategy" than to draw useful conclusions.<ref name="ECON-2012">{{cite news |title=A tricky business; prosecuting al-Qaeda (book review) |work=The Economist |date=14 January 2012}}</ref>
