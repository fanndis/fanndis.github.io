'''Catholic theology''' is the understanding of [[Catholic]] doctrine or teachings, and results from the studies of [[theologian]]s. It is based on [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[Catholic Bible|scripture]], and [[sacred tradition]], as interpreted authoritatively by the [[magisterium]] of the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{CCC|pp=74|end=95}}</ref><ref>{{CCC|pp=1953|end=1955}}</ref> This article serves as an introduction to various topics in Catholic theology, with links to where fuller coverage is found.

Major teachings of the Catholic Church discussed in the early councils of the church are summarized in [[List of Christian creeds|various creeds]], especially the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene (Nicene-Constantinopolitan) Creed]] and the [[Apostles' Creed]]. Since the 16th century the Church has produced [[catechism]]s which summarize its teachings, most recently [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|in 1992]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLbf1iijp-cC|title=Introducing the Catechism of the Catholic Church: Traditional Themes and Contemporary Issues|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8091-3495-3|editor-last=Marthaler|editor-first=Berard L.|location=New York|chapter=Preface}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/laetamurmagnopere.htm|title=''Laetamur magnopere''|last=John Paul II|year=1997|publisher=Vatican|access-date=9 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211121910/http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/laetamurmagnopere.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=11 February 2008}}</ref>

The [[Catholic Church]] understands the living tradition of the Church to contain the essentials of its doctrine [[Infallibility of the Church|on faith and morals]] and to be protected from error, at times through [[De fide|infallibly defined]] teaching.<ref>{{CCC|891}}</ref> The Church believes in revelation guided by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] through [[Catholic Bible|sacred scripture]], developed in [[sacred tradition]] and entirely rooted in the original ''deposit of faith''. This developed deposit of faith is protected by the "magisterium" or [[College of Bishops]] at ecumenical councils overseen by the pope,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DhpKxQT8n74C|title=Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-19-285439-1|editor-last=McManners|editor-first=John|location=Oxford|pages=37–38|chapter=Chapter 1|quote="The 'synod' or, in Latin, 'council' (the modern distinction making a synod something less than a council was unknown in antiquity) became an indispensable way of keeping a common mind, and helped to keep maverick individuals from centrifugal tendencies.

Formal Catholic worship is ordered by means of the [[Catholic liturgy|liturgy]], which is regulated by Church authority. The celebration of the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], one of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]], is the center of Catholic worship. The Church exercises control over additional forms of personal [[Catholic prayer|prayer]] and [[Catholic devotions|devotion]] including the [[Rosary]], [[Stations of the Cross]], and [[Eucharistic adoration]], declaring they should all somehow derive from the Eucharist and lead back to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html|title=Sacrosanctum concilium|website=www.vatican.va|at=13|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref> The Church community consists of the ordained [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|clergy]] (consisting of the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopate]], the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]], and the [[Deacon|diaconate]]), the [[laity]], and those like [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s living a [[consecrated life]] under their [[Monasticism|constitutions]].

According to the ''Catechism'', [[Christ]] instituted seven sacraments and entrusted them to the Church.<ref name="CCC|1131">{{CCC|1131}}</ref> These are [[Baptism (Catholic Church)|Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation (Chrismation)]], the [[Eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]], [[Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]], the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]], [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]] and [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|Matrimony]]. The Catholic bishops at the [[Second Vatican Council]], after centuries of celebration of the Mass in Latin, found it salutary to decree:
<blockquote>Pastors of souls must therefore realize that, when the liturgy is celebrated, something more is required than the mere observation of the laws governing valid and licit celebration; it is their duty also to ensure that the faithful take part fully aware of what they are doing, actively engaged in the rite, and enriched by its effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html |title=''Sacrosanctum Concilium,'' 11.

== Profession of Faith ==

=== Human capacity for God ===
The Catholic Church teaches that "The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself."<ref>{{CCC|27}}</ref> While man may turn away from God, God never stops calling man back to him.<ref>{{CCC|30}}</ref> Because man is created in the image and likeness of God, man can know with certainty of God's existence from his own human reason.<ref>{{CCC|36}}</ref> But while "Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God," in order "for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man, and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith."<ref>{{CCC|35}}</ref>

In summary, the Church teaches "Man is by nature and vocation a religious being. Coming from God, going toward God, man lives a fully human life only if he freely lives by his bond with God."<ref>{{CCC|44}}</ref>

=== God comes to meet humanity ===
The Church teaches God revealed himself gradually, beginning in the Old Testament, and completing this revelation by sending his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth as a man. This revelation started with [[Adam and Eve]],<ref>{{CCC|54}}</ref> and was not broken off by their original sin;<ref>{{CCC|55}}</ref> rather, God promised to send a redeemer.<ref>{{Bibleref|Genesis|3:15|DRA}}</ref> God further revealed himself through [[Covenant (biblical)|covenants]] between [[Noah]] and [[Abraham]].<ref>{{CCC|56}}</ref><ref>{{CCC|59}}</ref> God delivered the law to Moses on Mount Sinai,<ref>{{CCC|62}}</ref> and spoke through the Old Testament [[Prophets of Christianity|prophets]].<ref>{{CCC|64}}</ref> The fullness of God's revelation was made manifest through the coming of the Son of God, Jesus Christ.<ref>{{CCC|65}}</ref>

=== Creeds ===
{{Main|Creed}}
{{Wikisource-multi|object=section|Apostles Creed|Athanasian Creed|Nicene Creed}}
Creeds (from Latin ''credo'' meaning "I believe") are concise doctrinal statements or confessions, usually of religious beliefs. They began as baptismal formulas and were later expanded during the [[Christology|Christological]] controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith.

The [[Apostles Creed]] (''Symbolum Apostolorum'') was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. It is the most popular creed used in worship by Western Christians. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.<ref>Jaroslav Pelikan and Valerie Hotchkiss, editors. ''Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition]''. Yale University Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-300-09389-6}}.</ref>

The [[Nicene Creed]], largely a response to [[Arianism]], was formulated at the Councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 325 and 381 respectively,<ref>Catholics United for the Faith, [http://www.cuf.org/faithfacts/details_view.asp?ffID=191 "We Believe in One God"]; ''Encyclopedia of Religion,'' "Arianism" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411190838/http://www.cuf.org/faithfacts/details_view.asp?ffID=191 |date=11 April 2008 }}</ref> and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref name="ephesus">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm Council of Ephesus]" (1913).</ref> It sets out the main principles of Catholic Christian belief.<ref name="Schaff" /> This creed is recited at Sunday Masses and is the core statement of belief in many other Christian churches as well.<ref name="Schaff">Schaff, ''Creeds of Christendom, With a History and Critical Notes'' (1910), pp. 24, 56</ref><ref name="Richardson">Richardson, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' (1983), p. 132</ref>

The [[Athanasian Creed]], received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, says: "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance."<ref>''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm Athanasian Creed]" (1913).</ref>

== Scriptures ==
{{Main|Catholic theology of Scripture}}

[[Christianity]] regards the [[Bible]], a collection of [[Biblical canon|canonical]] books in two parts (the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]), as authoritative. It is believed by Christians to have been written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and therefore for many it is held to be the [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] Word of God.<ref>{{CCC|pp=105|end=108}}</ref><ref>Second Helvetic Confession, [http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm |date=3 December 2007 }}</ref><ref>[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html ''online text'']</ref> Protestants believe the Bible contains all [[Revelation|revealed truth]] necessary for salvation. This concept is known as [[Sola scriptura]].<ref>[[Keith Mathison]], ''[[The Shape of Sola Scriptura]]'' ([[Canon Press]], 2001)</ref> The [[Books of the Bible|books]] that are considered canonical vary depending upon the denomination using or defining it. These variations are a reflection of the range of [[traditions]] and [[Ecumenical council|councils]] that have convened on the subject. The Bible always includes books of the Jewish scriptures, the [[Tanakh]], and includes additional books and reorganizes them into two parts: the books of the [[Old Testament]] primarily sourced from the Tanakh (with some variations), and the 27 books of the [[New Testament]] containing books originally written primarily in [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pcusa.org/101/101-bible.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010509124520/http://pcusa.org/101/101-bible.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-05-09 |title=PC(USA) – Presbyterian 101 – What is The Bible? |access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref> The [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] canons include other books from the [[Septuagint]] Greek Jewish canon which Catholics call [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical]].<ref>{{CCC|120}}</ref> Protestants consider these books [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]]. Some versions of the Bible have a separate Apocrypha section for the books not considered canonical by the publisher.<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 39 Oxford University Press (1993). {{ISBN|0-19-504645-5}}.</ref>

Catholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.<ref>{{CCC|pp=115|end=118}}</ref> The ''literal'' sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation.

The ''spiritual'' sense has three subdivisions: the allegorical, moral, and [[Anagoge|anagogical]] (meaning mystical or spiritual) senses.
* The ''allegorical'' sense includes [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. An example would be the [[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] being understood as a "type" (sign) of baptism.<ref>{{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|10:2|NIV}}</ref>
* The ''moral'' sense understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
* The ''anagogical'' interpretation includes [[eschatology]] and applies to eternity and the [[Apocalypse|consummation of the world]].

Catholic theology adds other rules of interpretation which include:
* the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the ''literal'';<ref>Thomas Aquinas [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm "Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses"]; cf. {{CCC|116}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906114843/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm |date=6 September 2006 }}</ref>
* the historical character of the four Gospels, and that they faithfully hand on what Jesus taught about salvation;<ref>[[Second Vatican Council]] [https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531175312/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html |date=31 May 2014 }}</ref>
* that scripture must be read within the "living Tradition of the whole Church";<ref>{{CCC|113}}</ref>
* the task of authentic interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the pope.<ref>{{CCC|85}}</ref>

=== Sacraments ===
{{Main|Sacraments of the Catholic Church}}

There are seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] of the Church, of which the source and summit is the [[Eucharist]].<ref name="CCC|1324">{{CCC|1324}}</ref> According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]]'', the sacraments were instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church.<ref name="CCC|1131"/> They are vehicles through which God's grace flows into the person who receives them with the proper disposition.<ref name="CCC|1131"/><ref>{{CCC|1128}}</ref> In order to obtain the proper disposition, people are encouraged, and in some cases required, to undergo sufficient preparation before being permitted to receive certain sacraments.<ref name="mongoven">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3EhoyPNSV4C|title=The Prophetic Spirit of Catechesis: How We Share the Fire in Our Hearts|last=Mongoven|first=Anne Marie|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8091-3922-7|location=New York|page=68}}{{Better source|date=May 2016}}</ref> And in receiving the sacraments, the ''Catechism'' advises: "To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is to fall into superstition."<ref name="CCC|2111">{{CCC|2111}}</ref> Participation in the sacraments, offered to them through the Church, is a way Catholics obtain [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], [[Absolution|forgiveness of sins]] and formally ask for the Holy Spirit.<ref name="CCC|1131"/><ref>{{CCC|1119}}</ref><ref>{{CCC|1122}}</ref><ref>{{CCC|1127}}</ref><ref>{{CCC|1129}}</ref> These sacraments are: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation (Chrismation)]], the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], [[Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance and Reconciliation]], the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]], [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]], and [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|Matrimony]].

The Catholic Mass is separated into two parts. The first part is called Liturgy of the Word; readings from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s are read prior to the [[Gospel|gospel reading]] and the priest's [[homily]].

==== Eastern Catholic ====
{{See also|Divine Liturgy}}
In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the term ''[[Divine Liturgy]]'' is used in place of ''Mass'', and various [[Catholic liturgical rites|Eastern rites]] are used in place of the Roman Rite. These rites have remained more constant than has the Roman Rite, going back to early church times. Eastern Catholic and Orthodox liturgies are generally quite similar.

The liturgical action is seen as transcending time and uniting the participants with those already in the heavenly kingdom. Elements in the liturgy are meant to symbolize eternal realities; they go back to [[Early Christians|early Christian]] traditions which evolved from the Jewish-Christian traditions of the [[Early Christianity|early church]].

The first part of the Liturgy, or "Liturgy of the Catechumens", has scripture readings and at times a homily. The second part derives from the [[Last Supper]] as celebrated by the early Christians. The belief is that by partaking of the Communion bread and wine, the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]], they together become the body of Christ on earth, the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/questions/divineliturgy|title=The Divine Liturgy - Questions & Answers|website=oca.org|language=en|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref>

==== Liturgical calendar ====
{{Main|Liturgical calendar|General Roman Calendar}}
In the Latin Church, the annual calendar begins with [[Advent]], a time of hope-filled preparation for both the celebration of [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus' birth]] and his [[Second Coming]] at the end of time. Readings from "[[Ordinary Time]]" follow the Christmas Season, but are interrupted by the celebration of Easter in Spring, preceded by 40 days of Lenten preparation and followed by 50 days of Easter celebration.

The [[Paschal Triduum|Easter (or Paschal) Triduum]] splits the Easter vigil of the early church into three days of celebration, of Jesus[[Mass of the Lord's Supper|the Lord's Supper]], of [[Good Friday]] (Jesus' [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death on the cross]]), and of Jesus' [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. The season of [[Eastertide]] follows the Triduum and climaxes on [[Pentecost]], recalling the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus' disciples in the [[Cenacle|upper room]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1c1a1.htm|title=''CCC'', 1095}}</ref>

== Holy Trinity ==
{{Main|Trinity}}
[[File:Cairo Trinidad.jpeg|250px|right|thumb|''Holy Trinity'' by [[Francesco Cairo]] (1607–1665)]]

The ''[[Trinity]]'' refers to the belief in one God, in three distinct [[person]]s or [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]. Trinity is from Latin Word (Tris Unitas) English (Three in One/One in Three)IJohn 5:7 KJV. These are referred to as '[[God the Father|the Father]]' (the creator and source of all life), '[[God the Son|the Son]]' (the word or expression of the Father, who also became [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ]]), and '[[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|the Holy Spirit]]' (the bond of love between Father and Son, present in the hearts of humankind). Together, these three persons form a single [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]].<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'', pp. 87–90</ref><ref>T. Desmond Alexander, ''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', pp. 514–15</ref><ref>Alister E. McGrath, ''Historical Theology'' p. 61</ref> The word ''trias'', from which ''trinity'' is derived, is first seen in the works of [[Theophilus of Antioch]]. He wrote of "the Trinity of God (the Father), His [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]] (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)".<ref>Theophilus of Antioch ''Apologia ad Autolycum'' II 15</ref> The term may have been in use before this time. Afterwards it appears in [[Tertullian]].<ref>McManners, John. ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. p. 50 Oxford University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-19-822928-3}}.</ref><ref>Tertullian ''De Pudicitia'' chapter 21</ref> In the following century the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of [[Origen]].<ref>McManners, John. ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''.  p. 53. Oxford University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-19-822928-3}}.</ref>

According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see [[Perichoresis]]). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being eternal yet [[Divine filiation|begotten]] of the Father; and the Holy Spirit 'proceeding' from Father and ([[Filioque|in Western theology]]) from the Son.<ref>Vladimir Lossky; [[Loraine Boettner]]</ref> Regardless of this apparent difference in their origins, the three 'persons' are each [[eternity|eternal]] and [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]]. This is thought by Trinitarian Christians to be the revelation regarding God's nature which Jesus Christ came to deliver to the world, and is the foundation of their belief system. According to a prominent Catholic [[Karl Rahner|theologian]] of the 20th century: "In God’s self communication to his creation through grace and Incarnation, God really gives himself, and really appears as he is in himself." This would lead to the conclusion that we come to a knowledge of the immanent Trinity through the study of God's work in the "[[Economy of Salvation|Economy]]" of creation and salvation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/rahner.htm|title=Karl Rahner (Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology)|website=people.bu.edu|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref>

The orb, or the globe of the world, is almost exclusively associated with the Father in depictions of the [[Trinity]]]]
The central statement of Catholic faith, the [[Nicene Creed]], begins, "I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible." Thus, Catholics believe that God is not a part of nature, but that God created nature and all that exists. God is viewed as a loving and caring God who is active both in the world and in people's lives, and desires humankind to love one another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/john/13|title=John 13:34|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Monreale god resting after creation.jpg|thumb|200px|Christ depicted as the creator of the world, [[Byzantine mosaic]] in [[Monreale]], [[Sicily]].]]

According to Church teaching, in an event known as the "fall of the angels", a number of angels chose to rebel against God and his reign.<ref name="CCC|390">{{CCC|390}}</ref><ref>{{CCC|392}}</ref><ref name="CCC|405">{{CCC|405}}</ref> The leader of this rebellion has been given many names including "[[Lucifer]]" (meaning "light bearer" in Latin), "[[Satan]]", and the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]].

{{quote|Original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin—an inclination to evil that is called concupiscence.|CCC §&nbsp;405<ref name="CCC|405"/>|source=}}

==== Sin ====
{{Main|Sin}}

Christians classify certain behaviors and acts to be "sinful," which means that these certain acts are a violation of conscience or divine law. Catholics make a distinction between two types of sin.<ref>{{CCC|1854}}</ref> [[Mortal sin]] is a "grave violation of God's law" that "turns man away from God",<ref>{{CCC|1855}}</ref> and if it is not redeemed by repentance it can cause exclusion from Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell.<ref>{{CCC|1861}}</ref>

In contrast, [[venial sin]] (meaning "forgivable" sin) "does not set us in direct opposition to the will and friendship of God"<ref name="CCC|1850">{{CCC|1863}}</ref> and, although still "constituting a moral disorder",<ref>{{CCC|1875}}</ref> does not deprive the sinner of friendship with God, and consequently the eternal happiness of heaven.<ref name="CCC|1850"/>

{{Main|Christian views of Jesus|Christ|Redeemer (Christianity)}}
[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A depiction of Jesus and Mary, the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] (12th century)]]

In the [[Old Testament]], God promised to send his people a savior.<ref name="Kreeft71">Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity'' (2001), pp. 71–72</ref> The church believes that this savior was Jesus whom [[John the Baptist]] called "the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world". The Nicene Creed refers to Jesus as "the only begotten son of God, … begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made." In a supernatural event called the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], Catholics believe God came down from heaven for our salvation, became man through the power of the Holy Spirit and was born of a virgin Jewish girl named [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. They believe Jesus' mission on earth included giving people his word and example to follow, as recorded in the four [[Gospel]]s.<ref name="McGrath">McGrath, ''Christianity: An Introduction'' (2006), pp. 4–6</ref> The Church teaches that following the example of Jesus helps believers to grow more like him, and therefore to true love, freedom, and the fullness of life.<ref>{{Bibleref|John|10:1–30}}</ref><ref name="Schreck265">Schreck, ''The Essential Catholic Catechism'' (1997), p. 265</ref>

The focus of a Christian's life is a firm belief in [[Jesus]] as the [[Son of God]] and the "[[Messiah]]" or "[[Christ]]". The title "Messiah" comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word מָשִׁיחַ (''māšiáħ'') meaning ''anointed one''. The Greek translation {{lang|grc|Χριστός}} (''Christos'') is the source of the English word "[[Christ]]".<ref>McGrath, Alister E. ''Christianity:An Introduction''. pp. 4–6. Blackwell Publishing (2006). {{ISBN|1-4051-0899-1}}.</ref>

Christians believe that, as the Messiah, Jesus was [[anointing|anointed]] by God as ruler and savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of [[Messianic prophecies of Jesus|messianic prophecies]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from [[Jewish Messiah|the contemporary Jewish concept]]. The core Christian belief is that, through [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|the death and resurrection of Jesus]], [[original sin|sinful]] humans (which are all humans (Romans 3:23)) can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Immortality|eternal life]] in heaven.<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. pp. 513, 649. Oxford University Press (1993). {{ISBN|0-19-504645-5}}.</ref>

Catholics believe in the resurrection of Jesus. According to the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]], the central figure of Christianity, was [[Crucifixion|crucified]], died, buried within a tomb, and resurrected three days later.<ref>{{Bibleref|John|19:30–31|NIV}}, {{Bibleref|Mark|16:1|NIV}}, {{Bibleref|Mark|16:6|NIV}}</ref> The New Testament mentions several [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] on different occasions to his [[twelve apostles]] and disciples, including "more than five hundred brethren at once",<ref>{{Bibleref2|1Corinthians|15:6|NIV|1 Cor. 15:6}}</ref> before Jesus' [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]]. Jesus's death and resurrection are the essential doctrines of the Christian faith, and are commemorated by Christians during [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter]], as well as on each Sunday and in each celebration of the Eucharist, the [[Paschal mystery|Paschal feast]]. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious [[debate]]s and [[interfaith]] dialogues.<ref>Lorenzen, Thorwald. ''Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today''. Smyth & Helwys (2003), p. 13. {{ISBN|1-57312-399-4}} .</ref>

As [[Paul the Apostle]], an early Christian convert, wrote, "If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless".<ref>{{Bibleref2|1Cor|15:14|NLT|1 Cor. 15:14}})</ref><ref>Ball, Bryan and William Johnsson, editors.

Generally, Christian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus.<ref>This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early [[List of Christian creeds|Creeds]], the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the [[Reformation]] including the [[Thirty Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]], works contained in the [[Book of Concord]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}{{Clarify|date=April 2008}}</ref><ref>Two denominations in which a resurrection of Jesus is not a doctrine are the Quakers and the Unitarians.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}</ref> Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the early church.<ref>Fuller, Reginald H.

The church teaches that as signified by the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] of Jesus and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], all people have an opportunity for forgiveness and freedom from sin, and so can be reconciled to God.<ref name="Kreeft71" /><ref>{{CCC|608}}</ref>

==== Grace and free will ====
{{further|Infused righteousness}}
The operation and effects of grace are understood differently by different traditions. Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach the necessity of the [[free will]] to cooperate with grace.<ref>{{CCC|1987|title="Grace and Justification"}}</ref> This does not mean we can come to God on our own and then cooperate with grace, as [[Semipelagianism]], an early church heresy, postulates. Human nature is not evil, since God creates no evil thing, but we continue in or are inclined to sin ([[concupiscence]]). We need grace from God to be able to "repent and believe in the gospel." [[Reformed theology]], by contrast, teaches that people are completely [[total depravity|incapable of self-redemption]] to the point human nature itself is evil, but the grace of God overcomes [[Irresistible grace|even the unwilling heart]].<ref>Westminster Confession, [http://www.pcanet.org/general/cof_chapvi-x.htm#chapx Chapter X]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410133140/http://www.pcanet.org/general/cof_chapvi-x.htm |date=10 April 2008 }};

==== Forgiveness of sins ====
{{further|Baptism#Catholicism|Penance (Catholic Church)}}
According to Catholicism, forgiveness of sins and purification can occur during life – for example, in the sacraments of [[Baptism#Catholicism|Baptism]]<ref>{{CCC|1263}}</ref> and [[Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]].<ref>{{CCC|1468}}</ref> However, if this purification is not achieved in life, venial sins can still be purified after death.<ref>{{CCC|1030}}</ref>

The sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick]] is performed only by a priest, since it involves elements of forgiveness of sin. The priest anoints with oil the head and hands of the ill person while saying the prayers of the Church.<ref name="Kreeft373">Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity'' (2001), p. 373</ref>

==== Baptism and second conversion ====
{{Main|Baptism}}
[[File:AugustineBaptism.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]]'' by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]]]
People can be cleansed from all personal sins through [[Baptism]].<ref name="Kreeft308">Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity'' (2001), p. 308</ref> This sacramental act of cleansing admits one as a full member of the church and is only conferred once in a person's lifetime.<ref name="Kreeft308" />

The [[Catholic Church]] considers baptism so important "parents are obliged to see that their infants are baptised within the first few weeks" and, "if the infant is in danger of death, it is to be baptised without any delay."{{CIC1983|867}} It declares: "The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second century on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole 'households' received baptism, infants may also have been baptized."<ref>{{CCC|1252}}</ref>

At the [[Council of Trent]], on 15 November 1551, the necessity of a [[second conversion]] after [[baptism]] was delineated:<ref>{{cite book|last=Hindman|first=Ross Thomas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COVi91uaZJEC|title=The Great Divide|quote=''Session 14'' (November 15, 1551): The necessity of a "second conversion" after baptism is confirmed. According to the ''Catechism'': "This second conversion is an uninterrupted task for the whole Church who, clasping sinners to her bosom, is at once holy and always in need of purification, and follows constantly the path of penance and renewal" ({{CCC|1428}})|date=21 September 2008|access-date=19 October 2009|isbn=9781606476017}}</ref> {{quote|This [[second conversion]] is an uninterrupted task for the whole Church who, clasping sinners to her bosom, is at once holy and always in need of purification, and follows constantly the path of penance and renewal. Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before Him, does not aim first at outward works, "sackcloth and ashes," fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion. (CCC 1428<ref>{{CCC|1428}}</ref> and 1430<ref>{{CCC|1430}}</ref>)}}

David MacDonald, a Catholic [[Christian apologetics|apologist]], has written in regard to paragraph 1428, that "this endeavor of conversion is not just a human work. It is the movement of a "contrite heart," drawn and moved by [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us first."<ref name="MacDonald">{{cite web|author=David MacDonald|url=http://www.davidmacd.com/catholic/born_again_catholics.htm|title=Are Catholics Born Again?|quote=I think that greater common ground can be found if we compare the Evangelical "Born Again" experience to the Catholic "Second Conversion" experience which is when a Catholic surrenders to Jesus with an attitude of "Jesus, take my will and my life, I give everything to you."  This is a spontaneous thing that happens during the journey of faithful Catholics who "get it." Yup, the Catholic Church teaches a personal relationship with Christ:  The ''Catechism'' says: 1428 Christ's call to conversion continues to resound in the lives of Christians. This second conversion is an uninterrupted task for the whole Church who, "clasping sinners to her bosom, [is] at once holy and always in need of purification, [and] follows constantly the path of penance and renewal." This endeavor of conversion is not just a human work. It is the movement of a "contrite heart," drawn and moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us first. 1430 Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before Him, does not aim first at outward works, "sackcloth and ashes," fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion. The Pope and the Catechism are two of the highest authorities in the Church. They are telling us to get personal with Jesus.|year=2003|access-date=19 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826094911/http://www.davidmacd.com/catholic/born_again_catholics.htm|archive-date=26 August 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==== Penance and Reconciliation ====
{{Main|Penance (Catholic Church)}}
Since Baptism can only be received once, the sacrament of [[Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance or Reconciliation]] is the principal means by which Catholics obtain forgiveness for subsequent sin and receive God's grace and assistance not to sin again. This is based on Jesus' words to his disciples in the ''Gospel of John'' 20:21–23.<ref name="Kreeft336">Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity'' (2001), p. 336</ref> A penitent confesses his sins to a priest who may then offer advice or impose a particular penance to be performed. The penitent then prays an [[Act of Contrition|act of contrition]] and the priest administers [[absolution]], formally forgiving the person's sins.<ref name="Kreeft344">Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity'' (2001), p. 344</ref> A priest is forbidden under penalty of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] to reveal any matter heard under the [[Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church)|seal of the confessional]].

The Nicene Creed ends with, "We look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come." Accordingly, the Church teaches each person will appear before the judgment seat of Christ immediately after death and receive a [[particular judgment]] based on the deeds of their earthly life.<ref name="Schreck">Schreck, ''The Essential Catholic Catechism'' (1997), pp. 379–86</ref> Chapter 25:35–46 of the ''Gospel of Matthew'' underpins the Catholic belief that a day will also come when Jesus will sit in a universal judgment of all humankind.<ref name="OneFaith98">Barry, ''One Faith, One Lord'' (2001), p. 98, quote: "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me … amen I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."</ref><ref name="Matthew25">{{Bibleverse||Matthew|25:35–36}}</ref> The [[Last Judgment|final judgment]] will bring an end to human history.

There are three states of afterlife in Catholic belief. [[Heaven#In Roman Catholicism|Heaven]] is a time of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever.<ref name="Schreck" /> Purgatory is a temporary state of purification for those who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others.<ref name="Schreck" /> Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins, and had no intention of changing their ways go to [[Hell in Christian beliefs#Roman Catholicism|hell]], an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God's love.<ref name="Schreck" /> God [[predestination|predestines]] no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned.<ref name="Schreck" /> Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, like the good thief who was crucified next to Jesus.<ref name="Schreck" /><ref name="Luke23">{{Bibleverse||Luke|23:39–43}}</ref>

The Catholic Church teaches that the fate of those in purgatory can be affected by the actions of the living.<ref>{{CCC|1032}}</ref>

In the same context there is mention of the practice of [[indulgence]]s. An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven.<ref>{{CCC|1471}}</ref> Indulgences may be obtained for oneself, or on behalf of Christians who have died.<ref>{{CCC|1479}}</ref>

Prayers for the dead and indulgences have been envisioned as decreasing the "duration" of time the dead would spend in purgatory. Traditionally, most indulgences were measured in term of days, "quarantines" (i.e. 40-day periods as for Lent), or years, meaning that they were equivalent to that length of canonical penance on the part of a living Christian.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/penance/indulgences.asp |title=Indulgences in the Catholic Church |publisher=Catholic-pages.com |access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref> When the imposition of such canonical penances of a determinate duration fell into desuetude these expressions were sometimes popularly misinterpreted as reduction of that much time of a person's stay in purgatory.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> (The concept of time, like that of space, is of doubtful applicability to purgatory.) In [[Pope Paul VI]]'s revision of the rules concerning indulgences, these expressions were dropped, and replaced by the expression "partial indulgence", indicating that the person who gained such an indulgence for a pious action is granted, "in addition to the remission of temporal punishment acquired by the action itself, an equal remission of punishment through the intervention of the Church."<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6INDULG.HTM Pope Paul VI, Apostolic Constitution on Indulgences], norm 5</ref>

Historically, the practice of granting indulgences and the widespread<ref>Section "Abuses" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Purgatory]</ref> associated abuses, which led to their being seen as increasingly bound up with money, with criticisms being directed against the "sale" of indulgences, were a source of controversy that was the immediate occasion of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Germany and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12700b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Reformation |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-06-01 |access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>

=== Salvation outside the Church ===
{{Main|Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus}}

The Catholic Church teaches that it is the [[Four Marks of the Church|one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church]] founded by Jesus. Concerning non-Catholics, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]],'' drawing on the document ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' from [[Vatican II]], explains the statement "Outside the Church there is no salvation":<blockquote>Reformulated positively, this statement means that all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body. 

Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.

This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church ... but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience – those too may achieve eternal salvation.

Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it is impossible to please him, the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men.<ref>{{CCC|pp=846|end=848}}</ref></blockquote>

Catholics believe the Church exists simultaneously on earth [[Church militant and church triumphant|(Church militant)]], in [[Purgatory]] (Church suffering), and in Heaven (Church triumphant); thus Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the other saints are alive and part of the living Church.<ref name="Kreeft113">Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity'' (2001), pp. 113–14</ref> This unity of the Church in heaven and on earth is called the "[[communion of saints]]".<ref name="Kreeft114">Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity'' (2001), p. 114</ref><ref name="CCC|956">{{CCC|956}}</ref>

=== One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic ===
{{Main|Subsistit in|Lumen gentium|Dominus Iesus}}
Section 8 of the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen gentium]],'' states "this Church constituted and organized in the world as a society, subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with him, although many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of its visible structure. These elements, as gifts belonging to the Church of Christ, are forces impelling toward catholic unity."

<!-- THIS IS TOO DETAILED FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO CATHOLIC THEOLOGY, AND REPETITIVE OF THE ABOVE: Protestants reject the Catholic Church's dogma that Jesus Christ established "only one church", which the Catholic Church identifies as itself.

They also rejected the doctrinal statement issued by Pope Benedict XVI, which states that only the Catholic Church could be called the "church". Protestants argued that the pope is wrong, and that they were legitimate churches as well.

Although the Catholic Church establishes, believes and teaches that it is the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church, and "the sole Church of Christ", it also believes that the Holy Spirit can extend grace to those outside of the Church by extraordinary, extrasacramental means. In Lumen gentium, the Catholic Church acknowledges that the Holy Spirit is active among the ecclesiastical communities separated from itself, though the Holy Spirit's work among them is to "impel towards Catholic unity" and thus bring them to salvation. The document also calls for ecumenical dialogue amongst all Christians.
 -->
===Faith of the church===
Faith of the Church ([[Latin]]: ''fides ecclesiae'') is a basic concept of Catholic theology which implies that not the faithful individual but the [[Catholic Church]] as a whole is considered to be the primary carrier of [[Christianity|Christian faith]].<ref>https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PY.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 166-169]</ref> This refers to the act of believing (''fides qua creditur'') as well as to the matters of doctrine (''fides quae creditur'').

According to Catholic teaching, the Church has received the complete faith by [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] through the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] (''depositum fidei''). Led by the [[Holy Spirit]], as promised by Christ (John 16:12-14), the Church progressively during the times "unpacks" and displays the germ of the [[creed]], such keeping it actual and alive. May there be reductions or unbalances in single ages or regions, the Church as a whole, however, is trusted to be sustained in the truth and to maturate towards its complete understanding. 

Equally, in this concept, the act of believing, the personal devotion to the holy and inconceivable [[God]], for the individual is participation in the devotion of the Church, which means in the devotion of Christ himself to the Father in the Holy Spirit.

The single faithful, in consequence, is invited to acquire the faith of the Church, as assiduously as possible, into his personal possession, nevertheless being aware of the insufficiency of isolated cogitation and listening to the common voice of the Church.

== Devotion to the Virgin Mary and the saints ==
{{Main|Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church}}
[[File:Albrecht Dürer 022.jpg|thumb|The Holy Family]]
Catholics believe that the Church (community of Christians) exists both on earth and in heaven simultaneously, and thus the Virgin Mary and the Saints are alive and part of the living Church. Prayers and devotions to Mary and the saints are common practices in Catholic life. These devotions are not [[latria|worship]], since only God is worshiped. The Church teaches the Saints "do not cease to intercede with the Father for us. ... So by their fraternal concern is our weakness greatly helped."<ref name="CCC|956"/>

Catholics venerate Mary with many titles such as "Blessed Virgin", [[Theotokos|"Mother of God"]], "Help of Christians", "Mother of the Faithful". She is given special honor and devotion above all other saints but this honor and devotion differs essentially from the adoration given to God.<ref>{{CCC|971}}</ref> Catholics do not worship Mary but honor her as mother of God, mother of the Church, and as a spiritual mother to each believer in Christ.<ref name="OneFaith">{{CCC|paragraph unspecified}}</ref> She is called the greatest of the saints, the first disciple, and [[Queen of Heaven]]<ref name="OneFaith" /> (Rev. 12:1). Catholic belief encourages following her example of holiness.<ref name="OneFaith" /> Prayers and devotions asking for her intercession, such as the [[Rosary]], the [[Hail Mary]], and the [[Memorare]] are common Catholic practice.<ref name="OneFaith" /> The Church devotes several liturgical feasts to Mary, mainly the [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Mary, Mother of God]], [[Visitation (Christianity)|the Visitation]], [[the Assumption]], the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary; and in the Americas the Feast of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]. Pilgrimages to Marian shrines like [[Lourdes]], France, and [[Fátima, Portugal]], are also a common form of devotion and prayer.

== Ordained ministry: Bishops, priests, and deacons ==
{{Main|Catholic Church hierarchy|College of Bishops|Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Deacon}}
[[File:Dalmatic.jpg|thumb|left|Roman Catholic deacon wearing a [[dalmatic]]]]
Men become bishops, priests or [[deacon]]s through the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]]. Candidates to the priesthood must have a college degree in addition to another four years of theological training, including pastoral theology. The Catholic Church, following the example of Christ and Apostolic tradition, ordains only males.<ref>{{CCC|1577}}</ref> The Church teaches that, apart from ministry reserved for priests, women should participate in all aspects in the Church's life and leadership<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/faith/story.php?id=75145|title=Pope Francis addresses women's role in the Church - Living Faith - Home & Family - News - Catholic Online|last=News)|first=Elise Harris (CNA/EWTN|website=Catholic Online|language=en|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Nazareth">{{Cite book|last= Benedict XVI|first= Pope|title=Jesus of Nazareth|orig-year=2007 |year= 2007|publisher= Doubleday |isbn=978-0-385-52341-7 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/jesusofnazareth00bene/page/180 180]–81 |quote= The difference between the discipleship of the Twelve and the discipleship of the women is obvious; the tasks assigned to each group are quite different. Yet Luke makes clear—and the other Gospels also show this in all sorts of ways—that "many" women belonged to the more intimate community of believers and that their faith—filled following of Jesus was an essential element of that community, as would be vividly illustrated at the foot of the Cross and the Resurrection.|url=https://archive.org/details/jesusofnazareth00bene |url-access= registration|access-date=14 April 2014}}</ref>

The [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] are believed to possess the fullness of Catholic priesthood; priests and deacons participate in the ministry of the bishop. As a body, the [[College of Bishops]] are considered the successors of the Apostles.{{CIC1983|42}}{{CIC1983|375}} The pope, cardinals, patriarchs, primates, archbishops and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] are all bishops and members of the Catholic Church episcopate or College of Bishops. Only bishops canperform the sacrament of holy orders.<ref name="OneFaith" />

Many bishops head a [[diocese]], which is divided into [[parish]]es. A parish is usually staffed by at least one priest. Beyond their pastoral activity, a priest may perform other functions, including study, research, teaching or office work. They may also be [[Rector (Catholic Church)|rectors]] or [[chaplain]]s. Other titles or functions held by priests include those of [[Archimandrite]], [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Secular or Regular, [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]], [[Chorbishop]], Confessor, Dean of a Cathedral Chapter, Hieromonk, Prebendary, Precentor, etc.

[[Permanent deacon]]s, those who do not seek priestly ordination, preach and teach. They may also baptize, lead the faithful in prayer, witness marriages, and conduct wake and funeral services.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Deacons |url=http://www.usccb.org/deacon/faqs.shtml |author=Committee on the Diaconate |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |access-date=4 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224174854/http://www.usccb.org/deacon/faqs.shtml |archive-date=24 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Candidates for the diaconate go through a diaconate formation program and must meet minimum standards set by the bishops' conference in their home country. Upon completion of their formation program and acceptance by their local bishop, candidates receive the sacrament of Holy Orders. In August 2016 Pope Francis established the [[Study Commission on the Women's Diaconate]], to determine whether ordaining women as deacons should be revived. This would include the deacon's role of preaching at the Eucharist.

While deacons may be married, only celibate men are ordained as priests in the [[Latin Church]].{{CIC1983|1031}}{{CIC1983|1037}} Protestant clergy who have converted to the Catholic Church are sometimes excepted from this rule.<ref name="married priests" /> The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] ordain both celibate and married men.<ref name="married priests">{{cite web| title =Married, reordained clergy find exception in Catholic church | publisher =Washington Theological Union | year =2003 | url =http://www.wtu.edu/news/InTheNews/married-reordained-9-05-03.htm | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20031013050157/http://www.wtu.edu/news/InTheNews/married-reordained-9-05-03.htm | archive-date =13 October 2003 | access-date =28 February 2008}}</ref> All rites of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that, after ordination, marriage is not allowed.<ref name="brit">{{Cite EB1911|last=Coulton|first=George Gordon|authorlink=G.

=== Apostolic succession ===
{{Main|Apostolic succession}}

[[Apostolic succession]] is the belief that the pope and Catholic [[bishop]]s are the spiritual successors of the original twelve apostles, through the historically unbroken chain of consecration (see: [[Holy orders]]). The pope is the spiritual head and leader of the Catholic Church who makes use of the [[Roman Curia]] to assist him in governing. He is elected by the [[College of Cardinals]] who may choose from any male member of the Church but who must be ordained a bishop before taking office. Since the 15th century, a current cardinal has always been elected.<ref>{{cite web| last =Thavis | first =John | title =Election of new pope follows detailed procedure

The [[New Testament]] contains warnings against teachings considered to be only masquerading as Christianity,<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|11:13-15}}; {{Bibleverse|2|Peter|2:1-17}}; {{Bibleverse|2|John|7-11}}; {{Bibleverse||Jude|4-13}}</ref> and shows how reference was made to the leaders of the Church to decide what was true doctrine.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Acts|15:1-2}}</ref> The Catholic Church believes it is the continuation of those who remained faithful to the apostolic leadership and rejected false teachings.<ref>{{CCC|pp=84|end=90}}</ref> Catholic belief is that the Church will never defect from the truth, and bases this on Jesus' telling Peter "the gates of hell will not prevail against" the Church.<ref name="Matthew">{{Bibleverse||Matthew|16:18–19}}</ref> In the ''Gospel of John'', Jesus states, "I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now. But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth".<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|16:12–13}}</ref>

=== Clerical celibacy ===
{{Main|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)}}

Regarding clerical celibacy, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' states:{{quote|text=All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain celibate "for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." ({{bibleref2|Matthew|19:12|NRSVCE}}) Called to consecrate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to "the affairs of the Lord," ({{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|7:32|NRSVCE}}) they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God.<br />
In the Eastern Churches, a different discipline has been in force for many centuries. While bishops are chosen solely from among celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and priests. This practice has long been considered legitimate; these priests exercise a fruitful ministry within their communities. Moreover, priestly celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern Churches and many priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the East as in the West a man who has already received the sacrament of Holy Orders can no longer marry.<ref>{{CCC|pp=1579|end=1580}}</ref>}}

The Catholic Church's discipline of mandatory [[celibacy]] for priests within the Latin Church (while allowing very limited individual exceptions) has been criticized for not following either the [[Protestant Reformation]] practice, which rejects mandatory celibacy, or the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]'s and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]]'s practice, which requires celibacy for bishops and [[priestmonk]]s and excludes marriage by priests after ordination, but does allow married men to be ordained to the priesthood.

In July 2006, Bishop [[Emmanuel Milingo]] created the organization [[Married Priests Now!]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wpherald.com/articles/326/1/Archbishop-launches-married-priests-movement/quotMarried-Priests-Nowquot.html |title=Archbishop launches married priests movement |date=14 July 2006 |work=World Peace Herald |access-date=16 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222235907/http://wpherald.com/articles/326/1/Archbishop-launches-married-priests-movement/quotMarried-Priests-Nowquot.html |archive-date=22 December 2007 }}</ref> Responding to Milingo's November 2006 consecration of bishops, the Vatican stated "The value of the choice of priestly celibacy... has been reaffirmed."<ref>{{Cite news| title = Vatican stands by celibacy ruling | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6153452.stm | publisher = BBC News |date=16 November 2006 | access-date = 16 November 2006}}</ref>

Conversely, some young men in the United States are increasingly entering formation for the priesthood because of the long-held, traditional teaching on priestly celibacy.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303772904577335290865863450 | title = Traditional Catholicism Is Winning | date=12 April 2012 | work= Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

== Contemporary issues ==

=== Catholic social teaching ===
[[File:Last Judgement (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]—Fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]]]]
{{Main|Catholic social teaching}}
[[Catholic social teaching]] is based on the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of all others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal [[Works of Mercy|works of mercy]]. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require Catholics to share their knowledge with others, comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give advice and correction to those who need it, and pray for the living and the dead.<ref name="OneFaith98" /> 

=== Creation and evolution ===
{{Main|Evolution and the Catholic Church}}
Today, the Church's official position remains a focus of [[controversy]] and is non-specific, stating only that [[faith]] and [[science|scientific findings]] regarding [[human evolution]] are not in conflict, specifically:<ref>{{cite web|title=Adam, Eve, and Evolution |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/adam_eve_and_evolution.asp |access-date=3 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329020837/http://www.catholic.com/library/Adam_Eve_and_Evolution.asp |archive-date=29 March 2008 }}</ref> the Church allows for the possibility that the human body developed from previous biological forms but it was by God's special providence that the immortal soul was given to humankind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Adam_Eve_and_Evolution.asp|title=Adam, Eve, and Evolution|date=29 March 2008|access-date=29 December 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329020837/http://www.catholic.com/library/Adam_Eve_and_Evolution.asp|archive-date=29 March 2008}}</ref>

This view falls into the spectrum of viewpoints that are grouped under the concept of ''[[theistic evolution]]'' (which is itself opposed by several other significant points-of-view; see [[Creation–evolution controversy]] for further discussion).

== Comparison of traditions ==

=== Latin and Eastern Catholicism ===
{{Main|Latin Church|Eastern Catholic Churches|Palamism|Essence–energies distinction}}
The Eastern Catholic Churches have as their theological, spiritual, and liturgical patrimony the traditions of [[Eastern Christianity]]. Thus, there are differences in emphasis, tone, and articulation of various aspects of Catholic theology between the Eastern and Latin churches, as in [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]]. Likewise, medieval Western [[scholasticism]], that of [[Thomas Aquinas]] in particular, has had little reception in the East.

While Eastern Catholics respect [[papal authority]], and largely hold the same theological beliefs as Latin Catholics, Eastern theology differs on specific Marian beliefs. The traditional Eastern expression of the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary]], for instance, is the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]], which emphasizes her falling asleep to be later assumed into heaven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.east2west.org/faq/doctrine.htm#dormition Comparison of the Assumption and the Dormition of Mary|title=Doctrine|date=9 July 2016|website=From East to West}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] is a teaching of Eastern origin, but is expressed in the terminology of the Western Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.east2west.org/faq/doctrine.htm#IC Explanation of the Immaculate Conception from an Eastern Catholic perspective|title=Doctrine|date=9 July 2016|website=From East to West}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Eastern Catholics, though they do not observe the Western [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], have no difficulty affirming it or even dedicating their churches to the Virgin Mary under this title.<ref>http://www.assumptioncatholicchurch.net/ Many Eastern Catholic churches bear the titles of Latin Church doctrines such as the Assumption of Mary.</ref>

=== Orthodox and Protestant ===
{{Further|Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences}}
{{anchor|Catholicism and other Christian denomination}}The beliefs of other Christian denominations differ from those of Catholics to varying degrees. [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] belief differs mainly with regard to [[papal infallibility]], the [[filioque]] clause, and the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]], but is otherwise quite similar.<ref>Langan, ''The Catholic Tradition'' (1998), p. 118</ref><ref>Parry, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'' (1999), p. 292</ref> [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches vary in beliefs, but generally differ from Catholics regarding the authority of the pope and church tradition, as well as the role of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[saint]]s, the role of the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]], and issues pertaining to [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]], good works, and [[salvation]].<ref name="McManners254">McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'' (2002), pp. 254–60</ref> The [[five solas]] were one attempt to express these differences.
