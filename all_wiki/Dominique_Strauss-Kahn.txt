'''Dominique Gaston André Strauss-Kahn''' ({{IPA-fr|dɔminik stʁos kan}}; born 25 April 1949) is a French politician, former managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and a controversial figure in the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] due to his involvement in several financial and sexual scandals.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/strauss-kahn-takes-the-stand-in-french-pimping-trial/ |title=strauss kahn takes the-stand in french pimping trial |date=9 February 2015 |work=[[The Times of Israel]]}}</ref> He is often referred to in the media,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/15/dominique-strauss-kahn-sex-arrest |title=Dominique Strauss-Kahn's sex arrest could end presidential hopes |last=Willsher |first=Kim |date=15 May 2011 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=15 May 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dominique Strauss-Kahn |url=http://www.gala.fr/les_stars/leurs_bio/dominique_strauss-kahn# |work=Les Stars: Bios de Stars |publisher=Gala.fr |accessdate=15 May 2011 |language=fr}}</ref> and by himself,<ref>Dominique Strauss Kahn founded a law firm called "DSK Consultants" and wrote a book in 2006 called "365 jours", where the DSK acronyms takes half the cover</ref> by his initials ''DSK''. Strauss-Kahn was appointed managing director of the IMF on 28 September 2007, with the backing of his country's conservative [[President of France|president]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. He served in that capacity until his resignation on 18 May 2011, in the wake of [[New York v. Strauss-Kahn|allegations that he had sexually assaulted a hotel maid]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Boschat |first1=Nathalie |last2=Gauthier-Villars |first2=David |last3=El-Ghobashy |first3=Tamer |title=Strauss-Kahn Resigns From IMF |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703509104576331623409445148?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref> Other allegations followed.

He was a professor of economics at [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense]] and [[Sciences Po]], and was [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Employment (France)|Minister of Economy and Finance]] from 1997 to 1999, as part of [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government. He sought the nomination in the [[French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2006|Socialist Party presidential primary of 2006]], but was defeated by [[Ségolène Royal]] in November.

== Early life ==
Dominique Strauss-Kahn was born on 25 April 1949 in the wealthy Paris suburb of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], Hauts-de-Seine. He is the son of lawyer Gilbert Strauss-Kahn. Strauss-Kahn's father was born to an [[History of the Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish]] father and a Catholic mother from [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]; Strauss-Kahn's mother is from a [[Sephardic Jew]]ish family in [[Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Michel Taubmann |title=Qui est vraiment Dominique Strauss-Kahn |url=https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/qui-est-vraiment-dominique-strauss-kahn-05-05-2011-1329735_20.php |newspaper=Le Point |language=fr |date=5 May 2011 |access-date=15 November 2018}}</ref>

He and his parents settled in [[Agadir]], Morocco, in 1951, but after the [[1960 Agadir earthquake|1960 earthquake]] moved to [[Monaco]],<ref name=":0" /> where his father practiced law. While the family was living in Monaco, Strauss-Kahn went to school at the [[Lycee Albert Premier|Lycee Albert 1er]]. The family later{{when|date=May 2011}} returned to Paris, where he attended [[classes préparatoires]] at the [[Lycée Carnot]]. He graduated from [[HEC Paris]] in 1971 and from [[Sciences Po]] and the [[Paris Institute of Statistics]] in 1972. He sat and failed the entrance examination for [[École nationale d'administration]], but obtained a [[bachelor degree]] in public law, as well as a [[PhD]] and an ''[[agrégation]]'' (1977) in economics at the [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense|Université Paris X (Nanterre)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.republique-des-lettres.fr/10546-dominique-strauss-kahn.php |title=Dominique Strauss-Kahn |publisher=Republique-des-lettres.fr |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20081120193644/http://www.republique-des-lettres.fr/10546-dominique-strauss-kahn.php |archivedate=20 November 2008}}</ref>

== Career outside politics ==
From 1977 to 1981, Strauss-Kahn lectured at the [[University of Nancy]]-II, first as an assistant, and later as assistant professor, before taking a position at the [[University of Nanterre]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 1982, he was appointed to the Plan Commission as head of the finance department, and later as Deputy Commissioner, a position he held until his election to the National Assembly in 1986.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} After his ousting in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 parliamentary election]]s, Strauss-Kahn founded DSK Consultants, a corporate law consulting firm. Upon resigning from [[Lionel Jospin]]'s government he resumed his academic duties, teaching economics at Sciences Po from 2000 until his appointment to the IMF in 2007.<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2007/pr07211.htm "IMF Executive Board Selects Dominique Strauss-Kahn as IMF Managing Director"], Press Release No. 07/211, 28 September 2007.</ref>

== Political career ==
Strauss-Kahn was first an activist member of the [[Union of Communist Students]],<ref name=Lib>David Revault d'Allones, "''Le PS donne au monde un grand argentier''" in ''[[Libération]]'', 29 September 2007 {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/evenement/evenement1/281549.FR.php read on-line] <!-- please do not change ref format, this link is subjected to [[link rot]] --></ref> before joining in the 1970s the Centre d'études, de recherches et d'éducation socialiste (Center on Socialist Education Studies and Research, CERES) led by [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]], future presidential candidate at the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 election]].<ref name=Lib/> There, he befriended the future [[Prime Minister of France]] Lionel Jospin (PS).

After the [[1981 French presidential election|election of President]] [[François Mitterrand]] (PS) in 1981, he decided to stay out of government. He got involved in the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS), which was led by Lionel Jospin, and founded ''Socialisme et judaïsme'' ("''Socialism and Judaism''"). The next year, he was appointed to the ''Commissariat au plan'' (Planning Commission) as ''commissaire-adjoint''.

In 1986 he was [[1986 French legislative election|elected Member of Parliament]] for the first time in the [[Haute-Savoie]] [[Department (France)|department]], and [[1988 French legislative election|in 1988]] in the [[Val-d'Oise]] department. He became chairman of the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly Committee on Finances]], famously exchanging heated words with the Finance Minister [[Pierre Bérégovoy]] (PS).

=== Minister for Industry (1991–93) ===
In 1991, he was nominated by Mitterrand to be Junior [[Minister for Industry (France)|Minister for Industry and Foreign Trade]]<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/gvt5rep.asp#cresson « Gouvernement Edith Cresson »], Feb 2012, ''[[Assemblee Nationale]]'', 17 May 1991 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> in [[Édith Cresson]]'s social-democratic government. He kept his position in Pierre Bérégovoy's government<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/gvt5rep.asp#beregovoy "Gouvernement Pierre Bérégovoy"], Feb 2012, ''[[Assemblee Nationale]]'', 5 April 1992 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> until the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 general elections]].<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/gvt5rep.asp#balladur "Gouvernement Édouard Balladur"], Feb 2012, ''[[Assemblee Nationale]]'', 31 March 1993 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

After the electoral defeat of 1993, Strauss-Kahn was appointed by former Prime Minister [[Michel Rocard]] chairman of the ''groupe des experts du PS'' ("Group of Experts of the Socialist Party"), created by [[Claude Allègre]]. The same year, he founded the law firm DSK Consultants, and worked as a business lawyer.

In 1994, Raymond Lévy, who was director of [[Renault]], invited him to join the ''Cercle de l'Industrie'', a French industry lobby in [[Brussels]], where he met the billionaire businessman [[Vincent Bolloré]] and top manager [[Louis Schweitzer (CEO)|Louis Schweitzer]]; Strauss-Kahn served as secretary-general and later as vice-president. This lobbyist activity earned him criticism from the [[alter-globalization]] left.

In June 1995, he was elected mayor of [[Sarcelles]] and married [[Anne Sinclair]], a famous television journalist working for the private channel [[TF1]] and in charge of a political show, ''Sept sur Sept''. She ceased presenting this show after Strauss-Kahn's nomination as Minister of Economics and Finance in 1997, in order to avoid conflict of interest, while Strauss-Kahn himself ceded his place as mayor to [[François Pupponi]] in order to avoid double responsibilities.

=== Minister for Economics, Finances and Industry (1997–99) ===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2011}}
In 1997, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin (PS) appointed Strauss-Kahn as [[Minister for Economics, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister for Economics, Finance and Industry]], making him one of the most influential ministers in his [[Plural Left]] government.

Although it was in theory contrary to the Socialist Party's electoral program, he implemented a wide [[privatization]] program, which included among others the [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] of [[France Télécom]]; he also implemented some deregulation policies in the [[research and development]] sector. The French economy achieved an excellent performance during his term of office: GDP increased, whereas unemployment and public debt decreased (creation of 300,000 jobs in 1998, a level not seen since 1969). This helped to strengthen his popularity and managed to win the support of former supporters of Jospin and [[Michel Rocard]], making him the leader of the reform-oriented group ''Socialisme et démocratie''. Strauss-Kahn was an early proponent of reducing the working week to [[35-hour workweek|35 hours]], a measure implemented by [[Martine Aubry]], Minister for Social Policies.

In 1998 he became one of the leaders of the Socialist Party for the regional elections in the [[Île-de-France (region)|Ile-de-France]] region (Paris and suburbs), which were won by the PS. But as Strauss-Kahn refused to swap his ministry for the executive leadership of the Ile-de-France, [[Jean-Paul Huchon]] became the president of the regional council.

In 1999, he was accused of corruption in two financial scandals related to [[Elf Aquitaine]] and [[the MNEF Affair]], a student mutual [[health insurance]], and decided to resign from his ministerial office to fight these charges, in agreement with the "[[Balladur jurisprudence]]". He was replaced by [[Christian Sautter]]. He was acquitted in November 2001, and was reelected in a by-election in the Val-d'Oise.

As Minister of Economics and Finance, Strauss-Kahn succeeded in decreasing [[VAT]] to 5.5% for renovation works in construction, thus supporting this activity. At the same time, he decreased the budget deficit, which was more than 3% of GDP under [[Alain Juppé]]'s center-right government (1995–97). He thus prepared France's entrance into the eurozone. Strauss-Kahn also repealed the Thomas Act on [[hedge fund]]s, and launched the Conseil d'orientation des retraites (Orientation Council on [[Pensions]]).

Strauss-Kahn succeeded in combining followers of Jospin and Rocard in the same political movement, ''Socialisme et démocratie'', but failed to make it more than an informal network.

=== In opposition ===
After [[Jacques Chirac]]'s success in the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] and the following [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP)'s majority in Parliament, Strauss-Kahn was re-elected Member of Parliament on 16 June 2002, in the 8th circonscription of the Val-d'Oise. He first declined in taking part in the new leadership of the PS, then in the opposition, in the 2003 congress of the party. But he joined the party's leadership again at the end of 2004, and was given overall responsibility for drawing up the Socialist programme for the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], along with Martine Aubry and [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]]. During the summer meeting of 2005, he announced that he would be a candidate for the primary elections of the Socialist Party for the presidential election.

At the same time, Strauss-Kahn co-founded the think tank ''À gauche en Europe'' (To the Left in Europe) along with Michel Rocard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww1.gauche-en-europe.org/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203224343/http://www.gauche-en-europe.org/global.php?id=club&lg=fr |url-status=dead |title=gauche-en-europe.org - gauche-en-europe Resources and Information. |archivedate=3 December 2007 |website=ww1.gauche-en-europe.org}}</ref> He presided jointly with [[Jean-Christophe Cambadélis]] over the ''Socialisme et démocratie'' current in the PS.

Strauss-Kahn was one of the first French politicians to enter the [[blogosphere]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blogdsk.net/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040311201435/http://www.blogdsk.net/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 March 2004 |title=Le blog de Dominique Strauss-Kahn |publisher=Blogdsk.net |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> his blog became one of the most visited, along with Juppé's, during his stay in [[Quebec]].<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/20060810.FIG000000186_les_politiques_aussi.html ] ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 10 August 2006 {{in lang|fr}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929142434/http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/20060810.FIG000000186_les_politiques_aussi.html |date=29 September 2007}}</ref>

Strauss-Kahn then campaigned for a 'Yes' vote in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum]]. More than 54% of the French citizens refused it, damaging Strauss-Kahn's position inside the PS,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} while left-wing [[Laurent Fabius]], who had campaigned for a 'No' vote, was reinforced.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Strauss-Kahn sought the nomination for the Socialist candidacy in the 2007 presidential election. His challengers were former prime minister Laurent Fabius and [[Ségolène Royal]], the president of the [[Poitou-Charentes]] region. Strauss-Kahn finished second, behind Royal. On 13 April 2007, Strauss-Kahn called for an "anti-[[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] front" between the two rounds of the forthcoming [[2007 French presidential election|presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article555.html?debut_mmmot=24 |title=A Look behind the Operation for an Alliance of the Center |newspaper=[[L'Humanité]] |date=17 April 2007}}</ref><ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/2007-04-17_Politique_Les-dessous-de-l-operation-alliance-du-centre ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110225933/http://www.humanite.fr/2007-04-17_Politique_Les-dessous-de-l-operation-alliance-du-centre |date=10 November 2007}}</ref> Following Ségolène Royal's defeat, Strauss-Kahn criticized the PS's strategy and its chairman, [[François Hollande]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article570.html |title=The Hardline Right Moves into the Élysee Palace&nbsp;– Sarkozy Wins the French Presidential Election |newspaper=[[L'Humanité]] |date=7 May 2007}}</ref><ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/2007-05-07_Politique_Une-droite-dure-s-installe-a-l-Elysee ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827013654/http://www.humanite.fr/2007-05-07_Politique_Une-droite-dure-s-installe-a-l-Elysee |date=27 August 2007}}</ref> Along with Fabius, he then resigned from the party's national directorate in June 2007.<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/2007-06-29_Politique_Le-piege-a-elephants ] ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 29 June 2007 {{in lang|fr}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090221/http://www.humanite.fr/2007-06-29_Politique_Le-piege-a-elephants |date=29 September 2007}}</ref> Strauss-Kahn had been widely expected to seek the Socialist nomination for [[President of France]] in [[2012 French presidential election|2012]],<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6132OR20100204 |title=IMF chief says may quit early; eyes French politics? |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=4 February 2010 |first=Anna |last=Willard }}</ref> and was considered an early favorite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lejdd.fr/Election-presidentielle-2012/Depeches/Sondages-Ifop-JDD-L-etau-se-resserre-entre-Hollande-et-DSK-314097/ |title=Sondages Ifop-JDD: L'étau se resserre entre Hollande et DSK |publisher=Lejdd.fr |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517073306/http://www.lejdd.fr/Election-presidentielle-2012/Depeches/Sondages-Ifop-JDD-L-etau-se-resserre-entre-Hollande-et-DSK-314097/ |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== IMF Managing Director (2007–11) ===
On 10 July 2007, Strauss-Kahn became the consensus European nominee to be the head of the IMF, with the personal support of President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (member of the right [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party). Former Polish Prime Minister [[Marek Belka]] withdrew his candidacy as it was opposed by the majority of European countries.<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/20070710.WWW000000271_fmi_strauss_kahn_candidat_officiel_de_lunion_europeenne.html FMI: Strauss-Kahn candidat officiel de l'Union européenne], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 10 July 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Some critics alleged that Sarkozy proposed Strauss-Kahn as managing director of the IMF to deprive the Socialist Party of one of its more popular figures.<ref>{{cite news |title=France's Sarkozy wants Strauss-Kahn as IMF head |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/07/07/us-france-imf-idUSPAB00331220070707 |publisher=Reuters |date=7 July 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref>

Strauss-Kahn became the front runner in the race to become Managing Director of the IMF, with the support of the 27-nation European Union, the United States, China and most of Africa. On 28 September 2007, the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s 24 executive directors selected him as the new [[managing director]]. Strauss-Kahn replaced Spain's [[Rodrigo Rato]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/en/About/senior-officials/managing-directors |title=IMF Managing Directors |website=img.org |access-date=2019-09-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908155348/https://www.imf.org/en/About/senior-officials/managing-directors |archive-date=2019-09-08}}</ref> On 30 September 2007, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was formally named as the new head of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The only other nominee was the Czech [[Josef Tošovský]], a late candidate proposed by Russia. Strauss-Kahn said: "I am determined to pursue without delay the reforms needed for the IMF to make financial stability serve the international community, while fostering growth and employment".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7018756.stm |title=Frenchman is named new IMF chief |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> Under Strauss-Kahn the IMF's pursuit of financial stability included calls for a possible replacement of the dollar as the world's reserve currency. An IMF report from January 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4523 |title=Enhancing International Monetary Stability-A Role for the SDR? |publisher=Imf.org |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> called for a stronger role for [[special drawing rights]] (SDR) in order to stabilize the [[global financial system]]. According to the report, an expanded role for SDRs could help to stabilize the international monetary system. Furthermore, for most countries (except for those using the US dollar as their currency) there would be several advantages in switching the pricing of certain assets, such as oil and gold, from dollars to SDRs. For some commentators, that amounts to a call for a "new world currency that would challenge the dominance of the dollar".<ref>{{cite news |author=Heather Stewart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/10/imf-boss-calls-for-world-currency |title=IMF boss calls for global currency |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=15 May 2011 |date=10 February 2011}}</ref>

In 2008, the IMF Board appointed an independent investigator following allegations that Strauss-Kahn had had an affair with a subordinate, Piroska Nagy, who was married at the time to economist [[Mario Blejer]]. Nagy alleged that Strauss-Kahn had used his position to coerce her into the affair.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/world/europe/17fund.html |title=Woman in 2008 Affair Is Said to Have Accused I.M.F.

''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'' dubbed him "le grand séducteur" (the Great Seducer).<ref>{{cite web |title=Dominique Strauss-Kahn: The Great Seducer |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/145889/20110515/imf-strauss-kahn.htm#ixzz1MTCvTxRu |publisher=IB Times |date=15 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

Strauss-Kahn made comments that could be perceived as critical of global financial actors, in an interview for a documentary about the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'' (2010). He said he had attended a dinner organised by former Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] in which several CEOs of  'the biggest banks in the U.S.' had admitted they (or perhaps bankers in general) were 'too greedy' and bore part of the responsibility for the crisis. They said the government "'should regulate more, because we are too greedy, we can't avoid it.'" Strauss-Kahn said he warned the officials of a number of departments of the U.S. government of an impending crisis. He also said: "At the end of the day, the poorest&nbsp;– as always&nbsp;– pay the most."<ref>{{cite web|author=Charles Ferguson|url=http://www.sonyclassics.com/awards-information/insidejob_screenplay.pdf |title=Inside Job screenplay |publisher=Sony Pictures Classics |accessdate=16 May 2011|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Referring to his diplomatic efforts to secure IMF aid for Europe following the [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis|2010 sovereign debt crisis]], economist [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] described Strauss-Kahn as "[[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]] with a [[BlackBerry]]".<ref name = "crisis">{{cite web

Following Strauss-Kahn's arrest for sexual assault in New York, economist [[Eswar Prasad]] said that should he be forced to step down, the IMF "will find it hard to find as effective and skilful an advocate for keeping the institution central to the global monetary system".<ref name = "crisis"/>

[[John Lipsky]], the IMF's second-in-command, was named acting Managing Director on 15 May 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/05/17/arrest_may_cloud_europes_debt_talks/ |title=Arrest may cloud Europe's debt talks |first=Pan |last=Pylas |date=17 May 2011 |newspaper=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

Strauss-Kahn resigned from the IMF on 18 May 2011, after being arrested by New York police on 15 May over allegations of sexual assault.
