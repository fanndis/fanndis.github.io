In 2008, H&M purchased 60 percent of shares in the Swedish fashion company FaBric Scandinavien AB and bought the remaining shares in 2010 with a price totaling SEK552&nbsp;million ($62.3&nbsp;million).

==Labour practices==
In August 2011, nearly 200 workers passed out in one week at a Cambodian factory supplying H&M. Fumes from chemicals, poor ventilation, [[malnutrition]], and even "mass hysteria" have all been blamed for making workers ill. The [[minimum wage]] in the country is the equivalent of $66 (£42) a month, a level that human rights groups say is not even half that required to meet basic needs.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/02/cambodian-workers-peoples-tribunal-factory | title = Cambodian workers hold "people's tribunal" to look at factory conditions  | date = 2 February 2012|work=The Guardian | accessdate =2 February 2012 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Butler}}</ref>

The same year Bangladeshi and international labor groups put forth a detailed safety proposal that entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for [[inspector]]s to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a [[legally binding]] contract between suppliers, customers, and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in [[Dhaka]], major European and North American retailers, including H&M, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/big-brands-rejected-bangladesh-factory-safety-plan-122206229.html;_ylt=AnVOsdd0ELiYKWzzSu_voqq3scB_;_ylu=X3oDMTQ1anZ1YTM5BG1pdANMYXRlc3ROZXdzIExpc3RpbmcEcGtnAzZkOTA2NmZiLTg4MWYtM2RlNS04M2Q5LThkOWZiOGM1MDBjNgRwb3MDMgRzZWMDTWVkaWFTdG9yeUxpc3RUZW1wBHZlcgM2OWJkMWU1MC1hZTczLTExZTItYmRiZi03MjgzNTZkYWU1MDg-;_ylg=X3oDMTFlamZvM2ZlBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdAMEcHQDc2VjdGlvbnM-;_ylv=3|title=Big brands rejected Bangladesh factory safety plan|date=26 April 2013|work=Yahoo News}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that in a conscious action sustainability report for 2012, H&M published a list of factories supplying 95% of its garments. Most retailers and brands do not share this information, citing commercial confidentiality as a reason.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/h-and-m-sustainability-report|title=H&M: how does the fashion retailer's sustainability report stack up?|author=Lucy Siegle|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

After the April [[2013 Savar building collapse]], the company and other retailers signed on to the [[Accord on Factory and Building Safety in Bangladesh]]. On 19 May 2013, a textile factory that produced apparel for H&M in [[Phnom Penh]], Cambodia collapsed injuring several people.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324787004578497091806922254 |title=H&M Clothes Made in Collapsed Cambodian Factory - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref> The incident has raised concerns regarding industrial safety regulations.

In September 2015, CleanClothes.org, an NGO involved in garment labor working conditions, reported on a lack of specific fire safety renovations in H&M suppliers' factories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanclothes.org/resources/publications/hm-bangladesh-september-2015.pdf|title=Evaluation of H&M Compliance with Safety Action Plans for Strategic Suppliers in Bangladesh|publisher=The Clean Clothes Campaign|date=September 2015| access-date =23 October 2016|quote=16% of H&M factories haven't removed locking doors ... 61% of H&M factories with no fire exits}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
Since January 2012 H&M has offered its [[H&M Design Award]], an annual design prize for fashion graduates.

Starting in February 2013, H&M offered patrons a [[voucher]] in exchange for used garments. Donated garments was to be processed by I:CO, a retailer that repurposes and recycles used clothing with the goal of creating a [[zero waste]] economy. The initiative is similar to a clothes-collection voucher program launched in April 2012 by [[Marks & Spencer]] in partnership with [[Oxfam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9726240/HandM-to-launch-global-clothes-collecting-initiative.html|title=H& to launch global clothes collecting initiative – Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.hm.com/content/hm/NewsroomSection/en/NewsRoom/NewsroomDetails/global-clothes-collecting-initiative.html|title=News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ico-spirit.com/us/Home-1.html|title=I:CO-System – I:CO – RETHINK.
