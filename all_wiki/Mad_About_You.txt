'''''Mad About You''''' is an American [[sitcom]] television series starring [[Paul Reiser]] and [[Helen Hunt]] as a married couple in [[New York City]].

It initially aired on [[NBC]] from September 23, 1992, to May 24, 1999, winning numerous awards including four [[Golden Globe Award]]s and twelve [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. On March 6, 2019, a limited series revival was picked up by [[Charter Spectrum|Spectrum Originals]] for 12 episodes.

==Plot==
The series focuses mainly on newlyweds Paul Buchman, a [[documentary]] filmmaker, and Jamie Stemple Buchman, a [[public relations]] specialist, as they deal with everything from humorous daily minutiae to major struggles. Near the end of the show's run, they have a baby daughter, whom they name Mabel.

==Production==
Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser were paid $1 million per episode for the last season (with their contracts calling for them to be paid equally). However, ratings fell sharply that year as the series was shuffled away from its Tuesday slot to prop up a fledgling Monday night line-up of comedies on [[NBC]].

The show's theme song, "Final Frontier", was composed by Reiser and [[Don Was]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/4e6b879475ab4b0e922426846b317ce0 |title=Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt reprise ‘90s hit `Mad About You’ |work=Associated Press |date=19 November 2019 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> It was originally performed by [[Andrew Gold]], but a version performed by [[Anita Baker]] made its debut at the beginning of the sixth season. Baker's rendering, in addition to Gold's, was used on several episodes of the last two seasons, and appears on the show's soundtrack album. Gold's version is available on the collection ''Thank You for Being a Friend: The Best of Andrew Gold''.

Exterior views of buildings were filmed in [[Manhattan]]. Paul and Jamie's New York City Apartment was located at 5th Avenue and 12th Street. The [[Old Town Bar and Restaurant]] on 45 E. 18th Street was used for the fictional ''Riff's Restaurant'' in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103484/locations?ref_=tt_ql_dt_5|title=Filming & Production

===Revival===
In April 2018, it was announced that [[Sony Pictures Television]] would revive the show with the two lead actors reprising their roles,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/12/mad-about-you-paul-reiser-helen-hunt-revival/|title=''Mad About You'': Paul Reiser, Helen Hunt close deals for series revival|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=April 12, 2018|access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref> though Reiser expressed doubt about it in July 2018.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title=Paul Reiser On ‘Mad About You’ Revival: "It Likely Won’t Happen" |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/paul-reiser-mad-about-you-revival-it-likely-wont-happen-sony-pictures-tv-helen-hunt-1202424631/ |access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> In September 2018, Reiser stated that the revival was still on the table, but that "the studio needs to figure out if they know how to do it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/paul-reiser-mad-about-you-reboot-1202946917/|title=Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt Are All in for the 'Mad About You' Reboot|work=Variety|first=Rachel|last=Yang|date=September 18, 2018|access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>

Many of the main and recurring cast members reprised their roles for the revival. The most notable former main cast member not to reprise her role was [[Leila Kenzle]], who played Jamie's best friend, Fran Devanow. Kenzle retired from acting in 2003 and became a psychotherapist. Fran's husband, Mark, does return in the revival, but the character is now remarried.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/will-lisa-kudrow-be-in-the-mad-about-you-revival-ursula-had-big-plans-19352919|title=Lisa Kudrow Might Reprise Her Epic 'Mad About You' Character|website=Bustle}}</ref>

==Cast and characters==

===Original run (1992–1999)===

'''Main'''
* [[Paul Reiser]] as Paul Buchman, a filmmaker. After attending the [[New York University]] Film School, he struggled for recognition before finally succeeding in filmmaking in New York City. He and his family reside near [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], on lower Fifth Avenue.
* [[Helen Hunt]] as Jamie "James" Buchman (née Stemple, born February 19, 1963), the younger daughter of Gus and Theresa Stemple. After seven boyfriends at [[Yale University]], she met Paul Buchman at a New York newsstand by stealing his copy of ''[[The New York Times]]'' with an implausible excuse. Her difficult relationship with her mother-in-law is an ongoing source of jokes on the show. The character also appeared in one episode of Friends (The One With The Two Parts Part One). 
* Maui as Murray, the Buchmans' dog. He was a puppy when Paul found him, and Paul met Jamie while walking him. He sometimes chases what the couple assume is an invisible mouse, and often ends up crashing into the bedroom wall. In a later episode, Jamie discovers that there is indeed a real mouse that Murray has been chasing. In the two-part series finale, ''The Final Frontier,'' adult Mabel says that Murray died when she was six, but she was not told until she was twelve. Twice voted the most popular dog by the readers of ''TV Guide,''<ref>TV guide, Volume 46. 1998.</ref> Murray is loyal and endearing while being very laid back and a bit thick-skulled. Maui was originally found in a [[Castaic, California]], animal shelter by noted Hollywood animal trainer [[Boone Narr]]. Maui weighed 58 pounds and was primarily trained by Betty Linn. His first assignments came in TV commercials and as the backup for the top dog in the feature film ''[[Bingo (1991 film)|Bingo]]''.<ref>[http://www.thepoop.com/mediahounds/madaboutyou/default.asp Media Hounds: Murray on Mad About You] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120145638/http://www.thepoop.com/mediahounds/madaboutyou/default.asp |date=November 20, 2006 }}</ref>.  
* [[Anne Ramsay]] as Lisa Stemple, Jamie's older sister. Lisa has unfathomable psychological issues. Jamie is referred to as "Stella" in a book written by Lisa's therapist: "It was Stella's overprotectiveness that suffocated her ability to relate to others, and tethered her to a lifetime of insecurity and neurosis." After an envious rage, she blames Jamie for all of her problems in an interview with her shrink that becomes a chapter of a book called "Manics." With no place else to go, she does her laundry at Paul's and Jamie's apartment while scavenging through her sister's clothes and food. Every visit from her parents triggers her eating disorder. In between bouts of weirdness, she still cares deeply for Paul and Jamie and is often trusted to house sit for them, usually with unfortunate results.
* [[Leila Kenzle]] as Fran Devanow, Jamie's best friend. She is the regional vice president at Farrer-Gantz Public Relations who hired Jamie as her assistant. Near 1989, Fran quits Farrer-Gantz to spend time with her obnoxious five-year-old son, Ryan, and husband, Mark. Jamie is then promoted to Fran's position. Fran and Mark's relationship lasts 10 years, and their separation shocks Jamie and Paul. After divorcing Mark, Fran returns to her old position at Farrer-Gantz, since Jamie had quit. Eventually, Fran also quits and goes into business with Jamie. In time, Fran and Mark reconcile.
* [[John Pankow]] as Ira Buchman, Paul's cousin. He first appears in the episode "The Wedding Affair." Ira is from the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. He worked for Paul's father, Burt, at Buchman's Sporting Goods. Paul and Ira have a close friendship, but their hidden rivalry came out when Ira took ownership of Buchman's Sporting Goods upon Burt's retirement. Even so, he frequently appears as loving and supportive towards Paul and Jamie.  The character also appeared in sitcom Friends (The One With The Two Parts Part One). 
* [[Cynthia Harris]] as Sylvia Buchman, Paul's mother. Sylvia almost always gives Jamie a hard time, but occasionally does show kindness towards her daughter-in-law.
* [[Louis Zorich]] as Burt Buchman, Paul's father. Burt runs a sporting goods store – until he passes it on to Ira upon retirement. His signature line in the show occurs whenever he visits Paul and Jamie's apartment, exclaiming at the door, "It's me, Burt!  Burt Buchman—your father!"
* Alyssa and Justin Baric (twins) as Mabel Buchman, Paul and Jamie's daughter. She was finally named when Jamie's overbearing mother proclaimed that "'''M'''others '''A'''lways '''B'''ring '''E'''xtra '''L'''ove", an homage to ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' where Rob and Laura explain Ritchie's middle name. Alyssa and Justin Baric played Mabel from the beginning of season six when Mabel was brought home from the hospital ("Coming Home"). They continued to play the role of Mabel for numerous episodes. Carter and Madison Gayle play the role at a later time. In the season six episode "Letters to Mabel," an 18-year-old Mabel is played by [[Meredith Bishop]]. In the series finale, a teen Mabel is played by [[Cara DeLizia]], and an adult Mabel is played by [[Janeane Garofalo]].
* [[Richard Kind]] as Dr. Mark Devanow, Fran's ex-husband, with whom she is on good terms. A former obstetrician, Mark left Fran and their young son because he felt smothered and wanted to see the world. After returning to New York, he converts to Buddhism and works for a grocery store, although ultimately he returns to his old profession. In due course, he wins Fran back.

===Crossovers===
''Mad About You'' has had numerous connections to other NBC sitcoms set in New York City, as well as various other programs.

''[[Friends]]'' (owned by [[Warner Bros. Television]]): [[Lisa Kudrow]] played the recurring role of [[Ursula Buffay|Ursula]], a flaky [[waitress]] at Riff's Bar, a local restaurant that Paul and Jamie frequented. Kudrow went on to star in the NBC sitcom ''Friends'', playing the also somewhat flaky character of [[Phoebe Buffay]], and for a time both series shared the same Thursday night line-up. While not originally intended, the characters of Ursula and Phoebe were later found to be identical twin sisters. In a ''Friends'' episode ("The One With The Two Parts", 1st Season), as part of a night of NBC sitcom crossovers, Jamie and Fran walk into [[Central Perk]] and mistake Phoebe for Ursula. Hunt and Kenzle were not identified on screen as Jamie and Fran. In the season three episode "Pandora's Box", Jamie causes a citywide power blackout in New York City, and the effects of the blackout are seen in the ''Friends'' episode, "The One with the Blackout", and there was also a blackout in the episode "Birthday in the Big House" of the short-lived NBC sitcom ''[[Madman of the People]]''. All three episodes originally aired during the evening of November 3, 1994, alongside a ''Seinfeld'' episode which did not incorporate the blackout premise.

''[[Seinfeld]]'': In one episode ("The Apartment", 1st Season), Paul, pressured by Jamie, decides to sign over the lease of his old "bachelor pad" to the current tenant who is subleasing. When the tenant is revealed to be [[Cosmo Kramer]] ([[Michael Richards]]) of ''Seinfeld'', Paul asks Kramer "What ever happened to that Jerry guy who used to live there?" ''Seinfeld'', however, twice contradicted this connection, once even featuring a running joke about George's distaste for his fiancée Susan's fondness for watching ''Mad About You''. In the ''Mad About You'' season seven episode "Season Opener", Paul, under the effects of [[Viagra]], ran into [[Jerry Seinfeld]] in the street, who tells Paul to go away. At this point in ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s chronology, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to be [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|in prison]].

''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'': [[Carl Reiner]] reprised the role of Alan Brady from the 1960s sitcom. The episode made several references to the older show, such as Jamie at one point crying and whining "Oh, Paul!" – a take on [[Mary Tyler Moore]]'s character Laura Petrie's frequent refrain "Oh, Rob!" – Ten episodes earlier, Paul almost trips over a box and says, "Get me, I'm [[Dick Van Dyke]]."

''[[Style & Substance]]'': In the 2019 revival ("Real Estate for Beginners", 8th Season), [[Jean Smart]] appeared as Chelsea Stevens-Kobolakis,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/mad-about-you-jason-alexander-and-jean-smart-to-guest-star-on-spectrum-revival/ |title=‘Mad About You': Jason Alexander and Jean Smart to Guest-Star on Spectrum Revival |last=Baysinger |first=Tim |date=2019-12-04 |website=The Wrap |access-date=2020-01-29 |quote=Smart will portray Chelsea Stevens-Kobolakis, an eccentric best-selling author, lifestyle guru and podcaster who runs a weekend seminar that Paul and Jamie attend — accidentally.}}</ref> a controlling, abrasive, short-tempered character that she had previously portrayed in showrunner [[Peter Tolan]]'s<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/scituate%E2%80%99s-peter-tolan-goes-%E2%80%98mad%E2%80%99/ar-AAI1pqE |title=Scituate’s Peter Tolan goes ‘Mad’  |last=Barbuto |first=Dana |date=2019-09-29 |website=MSN |access-date=2020-01-29 |quote=Tolan is the showrunner, executive producer and writer for the series, premiering Nov. 20 on Spectrum Originals.}}</ref> short-lived 1998 series.

In 1997, Atlantic Records released a ''Mad About You'' soundtrack. The soundtrack from and inspired by the sitcom, is composed of fun and sentimental songs and clips from the show. The tracks are organized chronologically marking the milestones of the couple's relationship. The album is bookended by the two versions of Paul Reiser's song "Final Frontier"—the first track is the classic version used in the show's opening, and the last track is Anita Baker's jazzy, full-length rendition, with Reiser on keyboard. The 21 tracks are as follows:
