He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on October 6, 1994 by a voice vote, and received commission on October 7, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/tatel-david-s.|title=Tatel, David S. - Federal Judicial Center|website=fjc.gov|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref>

In June 2017, Tatel found the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] did not prevent the survivors of a Holocaust victim from suing to recover art stolen by [[Nazi plunder]]ers, over the partial dissent of Senior Judge [[A. Raymond Randolph]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/650-657_Online.pdf|title=FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW |website=harvardlawreview.org |format=PDF|access-date=2020-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite court|litigants=de Csepel v.

In October 2019, Tatel filed the majority opinion in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, finding that the United States House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform had the authority to compel [[Mazars|Mazars USA]], via subpoena, to produce documents relating to the personal financial information of President [[Donald Trump]], including several years' worth of income tax returns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/19-5142/19-5142-2019-10-11.html|title=Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, No. 19-5142 (D.C. Cir. 2019)|website=Justia Law|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> That decision was vacated and remanded, 7–2, by the [[SCOTUS]] in an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts on July 9, 2020. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented with the remand, with the former citing:<blockquote>Congress' legislative powers do not authorize it to engage in a nationwide inquisition with whatever resources it chooses to appropriate for itself. The majority's solution—a nonexhaustive four-factor test of uncertain origin—is better than nothing. But the power that Congress seeks to exercise here has even less basis in the Constitution than the majority supposes. I would reverse in full because the power to subpoena private, nonofficial documents is not a necessary implication of Congress' legislative powers. If Congress wishes to obtain these documents, it should proceed through the impeachment power. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.<ref>[https://casetext.com/case/trump-v-mazars-usa-llp-2 Trump v.
