The '''Group of Seven''' ('''G7''') is an [[International organization|intergovernmental organization]] consisting of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. The heads of government of the member states, as well as the representatives of the [[European Union]], meet at the annual G7 Summit.

As of 2018, the G7 represents 58% of the [[List of countries by total wealth|global net wealth]] ($317&nbsp;trillion),<ref name="GWD2018">[http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=777FDF0E-E060-F608-52DAF97E062CC35B Research Institute – Global Wealth Databook 2018]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> more than 46% of the global [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) based on [[Nominal GDP|nominal values]], and more than 32% of the global GDP based on [[purchasing power parity]].

The concept of a forum for the world's major industrialized countries emerged before the [[1973 oil crisis]]. On Sunday, 25 March 1973, the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]], [[George Shultz]], convened an informal gathering of [[finance ministers]] from West Germany [[Helmut Schmidt]], France [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], and the United Kingdom [[Anthony Barber]] before an upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. When running the idea past President [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]], he noted that he would be out of town and offered use of [[White House|the White House]]. The meeting was subsequently held in the [[Library (White House)|library]] on the ground floor.<ref name="Schultz">Shultz, George P. (1993).

Then, in 1974, [[Georges Pompidou|President Pompidou]] of France died and his immediate successor refused to run in the special election, making two changes of [[head of state]] in France in one year. Chancellor Brandt of West Germany was forced to resign in a scandal, and his successor lasted only nine days making two changes in West Germany as well. In addition, then-President of the United States [[Richard Nixon]] and Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] were forced to resign in disgrace. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] was forced to broker a deal to form a government after a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|hung election]], which was so unstable that [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|another election the same year]] had to take place, and finally, the traditionally unstable government of the 1st Italian Republic changed [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|Prime Ministers]] yet again. The new American President [[Gerald Ford]], asked some other new heads of state/government to hold a retreat the following year to get to know one another.

In [[1st G6 summit|1975, a summit]] hosted by France brought together representatives of six governments: France, West Germany, [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the United Kingdom, and the United States. Schmidt was head of government and Giscard d'Estaing head of state, respectively, in their respective countries, and since they both spoke fluent English, it occurred to them that they, and British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] and U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] could get together in an informal retreat and discuss election results and the issues of the day. In late spring, d'Estaing of France invited the [[heads of government]] from West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States to a summit in [[Château de Rambouillet]];<ref name=evian>{{cite web|url=http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/the_g8/questions_about_the_g8.html#question1|title=Evian summit – Questions about the G8|publisher=Ministère des Affaires étrangères, Paris|access-date=18 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420120547/http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/the_g8/questions_about_the_g8.html#question1|archive-date=20 April 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the annual meeting of the six leaders was organized under a rotating presidency, forming the Group of Six (G6).

Until the 1985 [[Plaza Accord]] no one outside a tight official circle knew when the seven finance ministers met or what they agreed upon. The summit was announced the day before and a communiqué was issued afterwards.<ref>{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Robert K|chapter=Dollar Devaluations|title=Understanding Globalization: The Social Consequences of Political, Economic, and Environmental Change|year=2005|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|page=346}}</ref>

Following [[20th G7 summit|1994's G7 summit in Naples]], Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7 after the group's summits.

==Controversy==
===2014 suspension and subsequent exclusion of Russia===
{{further|40th G7 summit}}
In March 2014 Russia was suspended by G7 members from the political forum G8 following the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]]. After the suspension, in January 2017 the Russian Federation decided permanently to leave the G8. It was confirmed in June 2018.<ref name="CNN.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/24/politics/obama-europe-trip/index.html |title=U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8 |publisher=CNN.com |date=24 March 2014 |access-date=25 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Russia Is Ousted From Group of 8 by U.S. and Allies|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/world/europe/obama-russia-crimea.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 March 2014|access-date=21 December 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Alison|last=Smale|first2=Michael D.|last2=Shear}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/24/there-is-no-g8-russia-suspended-from-exclusive-club-until-it-changes-course-group-of-seven-nations-says/|title=Russia suspended from G8 over annexation of Crimea, Group of Seven nations says |work=National Post |date=24 March 2014|access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="russia-suspension">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/russia-g8-kremlin-crimea-ukraine-vladimir-putin-g7-g20-a7525836.html|title=Russia just quit the G8 for good}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-brushes-off-possibility-of-g-8-return|title=Russia brushes off possibility of G-8 return|last=hermesauto|date=9 June 2018}}</ref>

===2015 protests===
{{further|41st G7 summit}}
About 7,500 protesters led by the group 'Stop-G7' demonstrated during the summit. About 300 of those managed to reach the 3&nbsp;m high and 7&nbsp;km long security fence surrounding the summit location despite Germany's immense efforts to prevent it and despite its remote location – the luxury hotel [[Schloss Elmau]] at the foot of the Wetterstein mountains (altitude of {{convert|1008|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level). The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the closer area of the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.<ref name=Spiegel07June>{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel: Proteste um Schloss Elmau – Demonstranten wandern bis zum G7-Zaun.|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/g7-gipfel-protestzug-erreicht-zaun-um-schloss-elmau-a-1037560.html|access-date=11 June 2015|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=7 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=Bild03June>{{cite news|title=Bild: 7 Kilometer lang, 3 Meter hoch, auf ganzer Länge beleuchtet.|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/muenchen/g7-gipfel/mit-hohem-sicherheitsaufgebot-41201204.bild.html|access-date=11 June 2015|newspaper=[[Bild]]|date=3 June 2015}}</ref>

===2018 Trump conflict over tariffs and Russia===
{{further|44th G7 summit|Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)}}
The [[44th G7 summit|2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada]], was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump's position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting to not sign the economic section of the joint communiqué that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behavior as a "depressing withdrawal," while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him "to be serious."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tg24.sky.it/mondo/2018/06/10/g7-canada-trump.html|title=G7, Trump non-accetta il documento finale. Merkel: "Ritiro deprimente" – Sky TG24|language=it}}</ref> In the final statement signed by all members except the US, G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the [[Minsk Agreement]].<ref name="auto" />

Trump repeated calls for Russia to be re-admitted to the group in the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, saying it should be included in discussions relating to Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The Italian Prime Minister [[Giuseppe Conte]] supported Trump's proposal, [[Shinzo Abe]] of Japan was neutral, and the rest of the G7 pushed back against the suggestion, after which the atmosphere allegedly became "tense".

===2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil ===
{{further|45th G7 summit|2019 Brazil wildfires}}
U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]'s reiteration of Russia's readmission to the group (see above), instigation of a [[trade war]] with China, increased tensions in Iran, Trump's alleged reluctance to attend the conference and a number of international crises made the 2019 G7 meeting in [[Biarritz]], [[France]] the most divided since its inception. Following Trump's previous rescinding of his signature to a joint communiqué agreed in 2018 due to an alleged slight from Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] (see above), French President [[Emmanuel Macron]] agreed that the group would not issue a joint communiqué at the Biarritz conference.<ref name="Borger">{{cite news |last1=Borger |first1=Julian |title=G7: Trump's demands for Russia's readmission cause row in Biarritz |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/25/g7-trumps-demands-for-russias-readmission-causes-row-in-biarritz |access-date=26 August 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2019}}</ref>

The G7 nations pledged {{USD|20 million}} to help Brazil and other countries in South America to fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as "relatively small amount" given the scale of the problem.<ref name="HenaoSouza">{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/efe8b06f1b6b47fd8937938c6333d441|title=G-7 pledges funds to fight Amazon fires|last1=Henao|first1=Res|date=26 August 2019|work=AP News|access-date=26 August 2019|last2=Souza|first2=Marcelo De}}</ref>  Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between European Union and Brazil ([[Mercosur]]) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mercosur trade deal gives EU leeway to pressure Brazil on Amazon fires: Maas |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-amazon-germany/mercosur-trade-deal-gives-eu-leeway-to-pressure-brazil-on-amazon-fires-maas-idUSKCN1VG0LJ |access-date=26 August 2019 |work=Reuters |date=26 August 2019}}</ref>
