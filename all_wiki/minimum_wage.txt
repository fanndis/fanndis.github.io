A '''minimum wage''' is the lowest [[remuneration]] that employers can legally pay their workers—the [[price floor]] below which workers may not sell their labor.

[[Supply and demand|Supply and demand models]] suggest that there may be employment losses from minimum wages. However, if the labor market is in a state of [[monopsony]] (with only one employer available who is hiring), minimum wages can increase the efficiency of the market. There is debate about the full effects of minimum wages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/15-minimum-wage|title=$15 Minimum Wage|website=www.igmchicago.org|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas C. |last=Leonard |chapter=The Very Idea of Apply Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and Its Antecedents |title=Toward a History of Applied Economics |editor-first=Roger E. |editor-last=Backhouse |editor2-first=Jeff |editor2-last=Biddle |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=978-0-8223-6485-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/towardhistoryofa0000unse/page/117 117–144] |year=2000 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/towardhistoryofa0000unse |url=https://archive.org/details/towardhistoryofa0000unse/page/117 }}</ref><ref name="Gwartney">{{cite book |last1=Gwartney |first1=James David |first2=J.

The movement for minimum wages was first motivated as a way to stop the exploitation of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, by employers who were thought to have unfair bargaining power over them. Over time, minimum wages came to be seen as a way to help lower-income families. Modern national laws enforcing compulsory union membership which prescribed minimum wages for their members were first passed in New Zealand and Australia in the 1890s.

Although [[minimum wage law]]s are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the [[standard of living]] of workers, [[poverty reduction|reduces poverty]], reduces inequality, and boosts morale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/raise-minimum-wage/|title=Should We Raise The Minimum Wage?|date=30 August 2017|publisher=The Perspective|access-date=4 September 2017}}</ref> In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment because some low-wage workers "will be unable to find work...[and] will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed"<ref name="WSJ100309">{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574402820278669840|title=The Young and the Jobless|date=3 October 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=11 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111120719/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574402820278669840|archive-date=11 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Oxford">{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Economics|last=Black|first=John|date=18 September 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860767-0|page=300}}</ref><ref name="Card&Krueger" />.

Modern minimum wage laws trace their origin to the [[Ordinance of Labourers 1349|Ordinance of Labourers]] (1349), which was a decree by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] that set a'' [[maximum wage]]'' for laborers in [[medieval England]].<ref name=Mihm>{{cite news|last=Mihm|first=Stephen|title=How the Black Death Spawned the Minimum Wage|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-09-05/how-the-black-death-spawned-the-minimum-wage|access-date=17 April 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg View|date=5 September 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234149/http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-09-05/how-the-black-death-spawned-the-minimum-wage|archive-date=18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/6760/405260Minimum0101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 April 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012530/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/6760/405260Minimum0101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf?sequence=1 |archive-date=19 April 2014 }}</ref>  King Edward III, who was a wealthy landowner, was dependent, like his lords, on [[serfs]] to work the land.

Subsequent amendments to the ordinance, such as the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] (1351), increased the penalties for paying a wage above the set rates.<ref name="Mihm"/>

While the laws governing wages initially set a ceiling on compensation, they were eventually used to set a [[living wage]]. An amendment to the Statute of Labourers in 1389 effectively fixed wages to the price of food. As time passed, the [[Justice of the Peace]], who was charged with setting the maximum wage, also began to set formal minimum wages. The practice was eventually formalized with the passage of the Act Fixing a Minimum Wage in 1604 by [[King James I]] for workers in the textile industry.<ref name=Mihm/>

By the early 19th century, the Statutes of Labourers was repealed as increasingly [[History of capitalism|capitalistic England]] embraced ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies which disfavored regulations of wages (whether upper or lower limits).<ref name="Mihm" /> The subsequent 19th century saw significant [[Timeline of labor issues and events|labor unrest]] affect many industrial nations. As [[trade unions]] were decriminalized during the century, attempts to control wages through [[collective agreement]] were made. However, this meant that a uniform minimum wage was not possible. In ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848, [[John Stuart Mill]] argued that because of the [[collective action problems]] that workers faced in organisation, it was a justified departure from ''laissez-faire'' policies (or [[freedom of contract]]) to regulate people's wages and hours by the law.

It was not until the 1890s that the first modern legislative attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name="Starr" /> The movement for a minimum wage was initially focused on stopping [[sweatshop]] labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries.<ref name=Nordlund>{{cite book|last=Nordlund|first=Willis J.|title=The quest for a living wage : the history of the federal minimum wage program|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780313264122|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNnsATsBQa4C&q=history+of+minimum+wage+laws&pg=PR7}}</ref> The sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered to be substandard wages.

So can international public opinion, by pressuring [[multinational companies]] to pay [[Third World]] workers wages usually found in more industrialized countries.

[[File:Wage labour 2.svg|thumb|Graph showing the basic [[supply and demand]] model of the minimum wage in the labor market.]]
{{Main|Supply and demand}}

According to the supply and demand model of the labor market shown in many economics textbooks, increasing the minimum wage decreases the employment of minimum-wage workers.<ref name="Card&Krueger" /> One such textbook states:<ref name="Gwartney"/>
{{quote|
If a higher minimum wage increases the wage rates of unskilled workers above the level that would be established by market forces, the quantity of unskilled workers employed will fall. The minimum wage will price the services of the least productive (and therefore lowest-wage) workers out of the market. … the direct results of minimum wage legislation are clearly mixed. Some workers, most likely those whose previous wages were closest to the minimum, will enjoy higher wages. Others, particularly those with the lowest prelegislation wage rates, will be unable to find work. They will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed.}}

A firm's cost is an increasing function of the wage rate. The higher the wage rate, the fewer hours an employer will demand of employees. This is because, as the wage rate rises, it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers (or hire them for fewer hours). The [[Labour demand|demand of labor]] curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right.<ref name="Ehren">Ehrenberg, R. and Smith, R. "Modern labor economics: theory and public policy", HarperCollins, 1994, 5th ed.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Since higher wages increase the quantity supplied, the [[Labour supply|supply of labor]] curve is upward sloping, and is shown as a line moving up and to the right.<ref name="Ehren"/>  If no minimum wage is in place, wages will adjust until quantity of labor demanded is equal to quantity supplied, reaching [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], where the supply and demand curves intersect. Minimum wage behaves as a classical [[price floor]] on labor. Standard theory says that, if set above the equilibrium price, more labor will be willing to be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers, creating a [[Economic surplus|surplus]] of labor, i.e. unemployment.<ref name="Ehren" /> The economic model of markets predicts the same of other commodities (like milk and wheat, for example): Artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause an increase in quantity supplied and a decrease in quantity demanded. The result is a surplus of the commodity. When there is a wheat surplus, the government buys it. Since the government does not hire surplus labor, the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment, which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them.<ref name="SowellBasic"/>

The supply and demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the equilibrium wage, minimum wage laws will cause unemployment.<ref name="MB">{{cite book |last1=McConnell |first1=C.

===Monopsony===
[[File:Monopsony3.png|thumb|Modern economics suggests that a moderate minimum wage may increase employment as labor markets are [[Monopsony|monopsonistic]] and workers [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack bargaining power]].]]
{{Main|Monopsony}}
The supply and demand model predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts people who are not hired (or lose their jobs) when companies cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the model can account for. One complicating factor is possible [[monopsony]] in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets in the sense of the traditional '[[company town]],' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=William M. |last1=Boal |first2=Michael R |last2=Ransom |date=March 1997 |title=Monopsony in the Labor Market |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=35 |issue=1  |pages=86–112 |jstor=2729694}}</ref>

Modern economic theory predicts that although an excessive minimum wage may raise unemployment as it fixes a price above most demand for labor, a minimum wage at a more reasonable level can increase employment, and enhance growth and efficiency. This is because labor markets are [[Monopsony|monopsonistic]] and workers persistently [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack bargaining power]].  When poorer workers have more to spend it stimulates [[effective aggregate demand]] for goods and services.<ref>e.g. DE Card and AB Krueger, ''Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage'' (1995) and S Machin and A Manning, ‘Minimum wages and economic outcomes in Europe’ (1997) 41 European Economic Review 733</ref><ref name=Rittenberg>{{cite book|last1=Rittenberg|first1=Timothy Tregarthen, Libby|title=Economics|year=1999|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781572594180|page=290|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HveHgrID5GYC&q=monopsony+minimum+wage&pg=PA290|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref>

===Criticisms of the supply and demand model===
The argument that a minimum wage decreases employment is based on a simple supply and demand model of the labor market. A number of economists (for example [[Pierangelo Garegnani]],<ref>{{cite journal |first1=P. |last1=Garegnani |title=Heterogeneous Capital, the Production Function and the Theory of Distribution |journal=The Review of Economic Studies |volume=37 |issue=3 |date=July 1970 |pages=407–36 |jstor=2296729 |doi=10.2307/2296729}}</ref> Robert L.

Michael Anyadike-Danes and [[Wynne Godley]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1989.tb00809.x |title=Real Wages and Employment: A Sceptical View of Some Recent Empirical Work |year=1989 |last1=Anyadike-Danes |first1=Michael |last2=Godley |first2=Wynne |journal=The Manchester School |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=172–87}}</ref> argue, based on simulation results, that little of the empirical work done with the textbook model constitutes a potentially [[Falsifiability|falsifiable theory]], and consequently empirical evidence hardly exists for that model. Graham White<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Graham |last1=White |title=The Poverty of Conventional Economic Wisdom and the Search for Alternative Economic and Social Policies |journal=The Drawing Board: An Australian Review of Public Affairs |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=November 2001 |pages=67–87 |url=http://www.australianreview.net/journal/v2/n2/white.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524091537/http://www.australianreview.net/journal/v2/n2/white.html |archive-date=24 May 2013 }}</ref> argues, partially on the basis of Sraffianism, that the policy of increased [[labor market flexibility]], including the reduction of minimum wages, does not have an "intellectually coherent" argument in economic theory.[[File:Minimum to Average Wage for OECD Countries.png|thumb|Minimum wage levels in [[OECD]] countries as a share of average full-time wage, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE|title=Minimum relative to average wages of full-time workers|last=OECD|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502184031/http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=MIN2AVE|archive-date=2 May 2014}}</ref>]]
Gary Fields, Professor of Labor Economics and Economics at [[Cornell University]], argues that the standard textbook model for the minimum wage is ambiguous, and that the standard theoretical arguments incorrectly measure only a one-sector market. Fields says a two-sector market, where "the self-employed, service workers, and farm workers are typically excluded from minimum-wage coverage... [and with] one sector with minimum-wage coverage and the other without it [and possible mobility between the two]," is the basis for better analysis. Through this model, Fields shows the typical theoretical argument to be ambiguous and says "the predictions derived from the textbook model definitely do not carry over to the two-sector case. Therefore, since a non-covered sector exists nearly everywhere, the predictions of the textbook model simply cannot be relied on."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/01437729410059323 |title=The Unemployment Effects of Minimum Wages |year=1994 |last1=Fields |first1=Gary S. |journal=International Journal of Manpower |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=74–81|url=https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/articles/1118 }}</ref>

An alternate view of the labor market has low-wage labor markets characterized as [[monopsonistic competition]] wherein buyers (employers) have significantly more [[market power]] than do sellers (workers). This monopsony could be a result of intentional [[collusion]] between employers, or naturalistic factors such as [[Labor market segmentation|segmented markets]], [[search cost]]s, [[Information asymmetry|information costs]], [[Geographic mobility|imperfect mobility]] and the personal element of labor markets.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In such a case a simple supply and demand graph would not yield the [[market clearing|quantity of labor clearing]] and the wage rate. This is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged, instead of using the upward labor supply curve shown in a supply and demand diagram, monopsonistic employers would use a steeper upward sloping curve corresponding to [[Marginal cost|marginal expenditures]] to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition. Also, the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation.

Such a case is a type of [[market failure]] and results in workers being paid less than their marginal value. Under the monopsonistic assumption, an appropriately set minimum wage could increase both [[wages]] and employment, with the optimal level being equal to the [[marginal product of labour|marginal product of labor]].<ref name="Manning2003">{{cite book |title=Monopsony in motion: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets |last=Manning |first=Alan |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11312-8 }}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> This view emphasizes the role of minimum wages as a [[regulated market|market regulation]] policy akin to [[antitrust]] policies, as opposed to an illusory "[[free lunch]]" for low-wage workers.

Another reason minimum wage may not affect employment in certain industries is that the demand for the product the employees produce is highly [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Gillespie, Andrew|title=Foundations of Economics|page=240|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007}}</ref> For example, if management is forced to increase wages, management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since demand for the product is highly inelastic, consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay off workers. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argues this explanation neglects to explain why the firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Krugman |first=Paul|title=Economics|page=385|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2013}}</ref>

Three other possible reasons minimum wages do not affect employment were suggested by [[Alan Blinder]]: higher wages may reduce [[turnover (employment)|turnover]], and hence training costs; raising the minimum wage may "render moot" the potential problem of recruiting workers at a higher wage than current workers; and minimum wage workers might represent such a small proportion of a business's cost that the increase is too small to matter. He admits that he does not know if these are correct, but argues that "the list demonstrates that one can accept the new empirical findings and still be a card-carrying economist."<ref>{{cite news |first=Alan S. |last=Blinder |title=The $5.15 Question |work=The New York Times |date=23 May 1996 |page=A29 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/23/opinion/the-5.15-question.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701015950/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/23/opinion/the-5.15-question.html |archive-date=1 July 2017 }}</ref>

=== Mathematical models of the minimum wage and frictional labor markets ===
The following mathematical models are more quantitative in orientation, and highlight some of the difficulties in determining the impact of the minimum wage on labor market outcomes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/labor-economics-second-edition|title=Labor Economics|last1=Cahuc|first1=Pierre|last2=Carcillo|first2=Stéphane|last3=Zylberberg|first3=André|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=9780262027700|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=796–799}}</ref> Specifically, these models focus on labor markets with frictions.

==== Welfare and labor market participation ====
Assume that the decision to participate in the labor market results from a trade-off between being an unemployed job seeker and not participating at all.&nbsp;All individuals whose expected utility outside the labor market is less than the expected utility of an unemployed person <math>V_{u}</math> decide to participate in the labor market.&nbsp;In the basic search and [[Matching theory (economics)|matching model]], the expected utility of unemployed persons <math>V_{u}</math> and that of employed persons <math>V_{e}</math> are defined by:

<math display="block">\begin{aligned}
rV_{e} &= w + q(V_{u}-V_{e}) \\
rV_{u} &= z + \theta m(\theta) (V_{e}-V_{u})
\end{aligned}</math>Let <math>w</math> be the wage, <math>r</math> the interest rate, <math>z</math> the instantaneous income of unemployed persons, <math>q</math> the exogenous job destruction rate, <math>\theta</math> the labor market tightness, and <math>\theta m(\theta)</math> the job finding rate.&nbsp;The profits <math>\Pi_{e}</math> and <math>\Pi_{v}</math> expected from a filled job and a vacant one are:<math display="block">r\Pi_{e} = y-w+q(\Pi_{v}-\Pi_{e}), \quad r\Pi_{v} = -h + m(\theta)(\Pi_{e}-\Pi_{v})</math>where <math>h</math> is the cost of a vacant job and <math>y</math> is the productivity.&nbsp;When the ''free entry condition'' <math>\Pi_{v} = 0</math> is satisfied, these two equalities yield the following relationship between the wage <math>w</math> and labor market tightness <math>\theta</math>:
{{Labor|expanded=rights|sp=us}}
<math display="block">{h\over{m(\theta)}} = {y-w\over{r+q}}</math>If <math>w</math> represents a minimum wage that applies to all workers, this equation completely determines the equilibrium value of the labor market tightness <math>\theta</math>.&nbsp;There are two conditions associated with the matching function:<math display="block">m'(\theta) < 0, \quad [\theta m(\theta)]' > 0</math>This implies that <math>\theta</math> is a decreasing function of the minimum wage <math>w</math>, and so is the job finding rate <math>\alpha = \theta m(\theta)</math>.&nbsp;A hike in the minimum wage degrades the profitability of a job, so firms post fewer vacancies and the job finding rate falls off.&nbsp;Now let's rewrite <math>rV_{u}</math> to be:<math display="block">rV_{u} = {(r+q)z + \theta m(\theta) w\over{r+q + \theta m(\theta)}}</math>Using the relationship between the wage and labor market tightness to eliminate the wage from the last equation gives us:
<math display="block">rV_{u} = {\theta m(\theta)y + (r+q)z - \theta(r+q)h\over{r+q + \theta m(\theta)}}</math> If we maximize <math>rV_{u}</math> in this equation, with respect to the labor market tightness, we find that:<math display="block">{[1-\eta(\theta)](y-z)\over{r+q+\eta(\theta)\theta m(\theta)}} = {h\over{m(\theta)}}</math>where <math>\eta(\theta)</math> is the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of the matching function:<math display="block">\eta(\theta) = -\theta{m'(\theta)\over{m(\theta)}} \equiv -\theta {d\over{d\theta}}\log m(\theta)</math>This result shows that the expected utility of unemployed workers is maximized when the minimum wage is set at a level that corresponds to the wage level of the decentralized economy in which the bargaining power parameter is equal to the elasticity <math>\eta(\theta)</math>.&nbsp; The level of the negotiated wage is <math>w^{*}</math>.

If <math>w < w^{*}</math>, then an increase in the minimum wage increases participation ''and'' the unemployment rate, with an ambiguous impact on employment.&nbsp;When the bargaining power of workers is less than <math>\eta(\theta)</math>, an increases in the minimum wage improves the welfare of the unemployed - this suggests that minimum wage hikes can improve labor market efficiency, at least up to the point when bargaining power equals <math>\eta(\theta)</math>.&nbsp;On the other hand, if <math>w \geq w^{*}</math>, any increases in the minimum wage entails a decline in labor market participation and an increase in unemployment.

==== Job search effort ====
In the model just presented, we found that the minimum wage always increases unemployment.&nbsp;This result does not necessarily hold when the search effort of workers in [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogenous]].

Consider a model where the intensity of the job search is designated by the scalar <math>\epsilon</math>, which can be interpreted as the amount of time and/or intensity of the effort devoted to search.&nbsp;Assume that the arrival rate of job offers is <math>\alpha\epsilon</math> and that the wage distribution is degenerated to a single wage <math>w</math>.&nbsp;Denote <math>\varphi(\epsilon)</math> to be the cost arising from the search effort, with <math>\varphi' > 0, \; \varphi'' > 0</math>.&nbsp;Then the discounted utilities are given by:<math display="block">\begin{aligned}
rV_{e} &= w + q(V_{u}-V_{e}) \\
rV_{u} &= \max_{\epsilon} \; z - \varphi(\epsilon) + \alpha \epsilon(V_{e}-V_{u})
\end{aligned}</math>Therefore, the optimal search effort is such that the marginal cost of performing the search is equation to the marginal return:<math display="block">\varphi'(\epsilon) = \alpha(V_{e}-V_{u})</math>This implies that the optimal search effort increases as the difference between the expected utility of the job holder and the expected utility of the job seeker grows.&nbsp;In fact, this difference actually grows with the wage.&nbsp;To see this, take the difference of the two discounted utilities to find:<math display="block">(r+q)(V_{e}-V_{u}) = w-\max_{\epsilon}\left[z - \varphi(\epsilon) + \alpha \epsilon(V_{e}-V_{u}) \right]</math>Then differentiating with respect to <math>w</math> and rearranging gives us:<math display="block">{d\over{dw}}(V_{e}-V_{u}) = {1\over{r+q+\alpha\epsilon^{*}}} > 0</math>where <math>\epsilon^{*}</math> is the optimal search effort.&nbsp;This implies that a wage increase drives up job search effort and, therefore, the job finding rate.&nbsp;Additionally, the unemployment rate <math>u</math> at equilibrium is given by:<math display="block">u = {q\over{q+\alpha\epsilon}}</math>A hike in the wage, which increases the search effort and the job finding rate, decreases the unemployment rate.&nbsp;So it is possible that a hike in the minimum wage ''may'', by boosting the search effort of job seekers, boost employment.&nbsp;Taken in sum with the previous section, the minimum wage in labor markets with frictions can improve employment and decrease the unemployment rate when it is sufficiently low.&nbsp;However, a high minimum wage is detrimental to employment and increases the unemployment rate.

==Empirical studies==

This disagreement usually takes the form of competing [[empirical]] tests of the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] of [[supply and demand]] in [[Labour economics|labor markets]] and the degree to which [[Market (economics)|markets]] differ from the efficiency that [[Economic model|models]] of [[perfect competition]] predict.

Economists have done empirical studies on different aspects of the minimum wage, including:<ref name="Neumark" />
* Employment effects, the most frequently studied aspect
* Effects on the [[Income distribution|distribution of wages and earnings]] among low-paid and higher-paid workers
* Effects on the distribution of incomes among low-income and higher-income families
* Effects on the skills of workers through job training and the deferring of work to acquire education
* Effects on prices and profits
* Effects on [[on-the-job training]]
Until the mid-1990s, a general consensus existed among economists, both conservative and liberal, that the minimum wage reduced employment, especially among younger and low-skill workers.<ref name="Card&Krueger">{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Card |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |title=Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage |url=https://archive.org/details/mythmeasurement00davi |url-access=registration |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1995 |pages=1, 6–7}}</ref> In addition to the basic supply-demand intuition, there were a number of empirical studies that supported this view. For example, [[Edward Gramlich|Gramlich]] (1976) found that many of the benefits went to higher income families, and that teenagers were made worse off by the unemployment associated with the minimum wage.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gramlich | first1 = Edward M.  | year = 1976| title = Impact of Minimum Wages on Other Wages, Employment, and Family Incomes | url = https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1976/06/1976b_bpea_gramlich_flanagan_wachter.pdf| journal = Brookings Papers on Economic Activity | volume = 1976 | issue = 2| pages = 409–61 | doi = 10.2307/2534380 | last2 = Flanagan | first2 = Robert J. | last3 = Wachter | first3 = Michael L. | jstor = 2534380  }}</ref>

Brown et al. (1983) noted that time series studies to that point had found that for a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using [[ordinary least squares]] vs. [[generalized least squares]] [[Regression analysis|regression procedures]], and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–24.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Charles |last1=Brown |first2=Curtis |last2=Gilroy |first3=Andrew |last3=Kohen |title=Time-Series Evidence of the Effect of the Minimum Wage on Youth Employment and Unemployment |journal=The Journal of Human Resources |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=Winter 1983 |pages=3–31 |jstor=145654 |doi=10.2307/145654|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w0790.pdf }}</ref>[[File:CBO Projected Effects of Minimum Wage Increases v1.png|thumb|right|CBO table illustrating projections of the effects of minimum wage increases on employment and income, under two scenarios]]

Wellington (1991) updated Brown et al.'s research with data through 1986 to provide new estimates encompassing a period when the real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) value of the minimum wage was declining, because it had not increased since 1981. She found that a 10% increase in the minimum wage decreased the absolute teenage employment by 0.6%, with no effect on the teen or young adult unemployment rates.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Alison J. |last1=Wellington |title=Effects of the Minimum Wage on the Employment Status of Youths: An Update |journal=The Journal of Human Resources |volume=26 |issue=1 |date=Winter 1991 |pages=27–46 |jstor=145715 |doi=10.2307/145715}}</ref>

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in December 2013: "A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs....America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage. ... High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world’s highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not|title=The logical floor|journal=The Economist|date=14 December 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801064646/http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not|archive-date=1 August 2017}}</ref>

The restaurant industry is commonly studied because of its high number of minimum wage workers. A 2018 study from the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] focusing on food services showed that minimum wage increases in Washington, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose gave workers higher pay without hampering job growth.<ref>{{cite news |last=Eidelson |first=Josh |date=6 September 2018 |title=Higher Minimum Wage Boosts Pay Without Reducing Jobs, Study Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-06/higher-minimum-wage-boosts-pay-without-reducing-jobs-study-says|work=Bloomberg |access-date=20 September 2018}}</ref> A 2017 study of restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area examined the period 2008-2016 and the effect that a minimum wage increase had on the probability of restaurants going out of business, and broke out results based on the restaurant's rating on the review site [[Yelp]]. The study found no effect for 5-star (highest rated) restaurants (regardless of the expensiveness of the cuisine) but those with increasingly lower ratings were increasingly likely to go out of business (for example a 14% increase at 3.5 stars for a $1 per hour minimum wage increase).  It also noted that the Yelp star rating was correlated with likelihood of minority ownership and minority customer base.  Importantly, it noted that restaurants below 4 star in rating were proportionally more likely to hire low-skilled workers.  The minimum wage increases during this period did not prevent growth in the industry overall – the number of restaurants in San Francisco went from 3,600 in 2012 to 7,600 in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-minimum-20170519-story.html |title=Minimum wage increases can kill businesses — if they already stink |date=19 May 2017 |author=Michael Hiltzik |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> An August 2019 study from [[The New School]]'s Center for New York City Affairs and the think tank National Employment Law Project, which advocates for raising the minimum wage,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nelp.org/old-campaign/raising-the-minimum-wage/|title=Raising the minimum wage|website=National Employment Law Project|access-date=December 17, 2019}}</ref> found that the restaurant industry in New York City has been "thriving" following an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour.<ref>{{cite news |last= Akhtar|first=Allana|date=August 10, 2019 |title=NYC's $15 minimum wage hasn't brought the restaurant apocalypse — it's helped them thrive|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-restaurant-industry-thriving-after-15-dollar-minimum-wage-2019-8|work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref>

A 2019 study in the ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' found that minimum wage increases did not have an impact on the overall number of low-wage jobs in the five years subsequent to the wage increase.

In another study, which shared authors with the above, published in the ''American Economic Review'' found that a large and persistent increase in the minimum wage in Hungary produced some disemployment with the large majority of additional cost being passed on to consumers.

===Card and Krueger===
In 1992, the minimum wage in New Jersey increased from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the adjacent state of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. [[David Card]] and [[Alan B. Krueger|Alan Krueger]] gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania in an attempt to see what effect this increase had on employment within New Jersey. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November–December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times.<ref name="Card & Krueger 1994">{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Card |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |title=Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=84 |issue=4 |date=September 1994 |pages=772–93 |jstor=2118030|url=http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp017d278t020 }}</ref> Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the increase in the minimum wage slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.<ref name="Card & Krueger 1994" />

For example, they look at the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990–91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In addition to their own findings, they reanalyzed earlier studies with updated data, generally finding that the older results of a negative employment effect did not hold up in the larger datasets.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Card | last2 = Krueger | year = 2000 | title = Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Reply | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 90 | issue = 5| pages = 1397–420 | doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1397| s2cid = 1140202 }}</ref>

In 1996, [[David Neumark]] and William Wascher reexamined Card and Krueger's result using administrative [[payroll|payroll records]] from a sample of large fast food restaurant chains, and reported that minimum wage increases were followed by decreases in employment.

In 1996 and 1997, the federal minimum wage was increased from $4.25 to $5.15, thereby increasing the minimum wage by $0.90 in Pennsylvania but by just $0.10 in New Jersey; this allowed for an examination of the effects of minimum wage increases in the same area, subsequent to the 1992 change studied by Card and Krueger. A study by Hoffman and Trace found the result anticipated by traditional theory: a detrimental effect on employment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/eej.2008.1 |title=NJ and PA Once Again: What Happened to Employment when the PA–NJ Minimum Wage Differential Disappeared? |year=2009 |last1=Hoffman |first1=Saul D |last2=Trace |first2=Diane M |journal=Eastern Economic Journal |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=115–28|s2cid=43434737 |url=http://graduate.lerner.udel.edu/sites/default/files/ECON/PDFs/RePEc/dlw/WorkingPapers/2007/UDWP2007-08.pdf }}</ref>

Further application of the methodology used by Card and Krueger by other researchers yielded results similar to their original findings, across additional data sets.<ref name="Dube" /> A 2010 study by three economists ([[Arindrajit Dube]] of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, William Lester of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Michael Reich of the University of California, Berkeley), compared adjacent counties in different states where the minimum wage had been raised in one of the states. They analyzed employment trends for several categories of low-wage workers from 1990 to 2006 and found that increases in minimum wages had no negative effects on low-wage employment and successfully increased the income of workers in food services and retail employment, as well as the narrower category of workers in restaurants.<ref name="Dube">{{cite journal |first1=Arindrajit |last1=Dube |first2=T.

A 2017 study found that in Seattle, increasing the minimum wage to $13 per hour lowered income of low-wage workers by $125 per month, due to the resulting reduction in hours worked, as industries made changes to make their businesses less labor intensive.

Finally, a study by Overstreet in 2019 examined increases to the minimum wage in Arizona. Utilizing data spanning from 1976 to 2017, Overstreet found that a 1% increase in the minimum wage was significantly correlated with a 1.13% increase in per capita income in Arizona. This study could show that smaller increases in minimum wage may not distort labor market as significantly as larger increases experienced in other cities and states. Thus, the small increases experienced in Arizona may have actually led to a slight increase in economic growth.<ref>Overstreet, Dallin.

In 2019, economists from Georgia Tech published a study that found a strong correlation between incresases to the minimum wage and detectable harm to the financial conditions of small businesses, including a higher rate of bankruptcy, lower hiring rates, lower credit scores, and higher interest payments.

In July 2019, the Congressional Budget Office published the impact on proposed national $15/hour legislation.  It noted that workers who retained full employment would see a modest improvement in take home pay offset by a small decrease in working conditions and non-pecuniary benefits.  However, this benefit is offset by three primary factors; the reduction in hours worked, the reduction in total employment, and the increased cost of goods and services. Those factors result in a decrease of about $33 Billion in total income and nearly 1.7-3.7 million lost jobs in the first three years (the CBO also noted this figure increases over time). <ref name="2019 Congressional Budget Office">{{Cite journal|date=July 2019 |title=The Effects on Employment and Family Income of Increasing the Federal Minimum Wage |url=https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-07/CBO-55410-MinimumWage2019.pdf}}</ref>

In response to an April 2016 Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) report advocating the raising of the minimum wage to deter crime, economists used data from the 1998-2016 Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), and National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) to assess the impact of the minimum wage on crime. They found that increasing the minimum wage resulted in increased property crime arrests among those ages 16-to-24.

===Statistical meta-analyses===
Several researchers have conducted statistical [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of the employment effects of the minimum wage. In 1995, Card and Krueger analyzed 14 earlier [[Time series|time-series studies]] on minimum wages and concluded that there was clear evidence of [[publication bias]] (in favor of studies that found a statistically significant negative employment effect). They point out that later studies, which had more data and lower standard errors, did not show the expected increase in [[t-statistic]] (almost all the studies had a t-statistic of about two, just above the level of [[statistical significance]] at the .05 level).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Card |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |date=May 1995 |title=Time-Series Minimum-Wage Studies: A Meta-analysis |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=238–43 |jstor=2117925}}</ref> Though a serious methodological indictment, opponents of the minimum wage largely ignored this issue; as Thomas Leonard noted, "The silence is fairly deafening."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-117 |title=The Very Idea of Applying Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and Its Antecedents |year=2000 |last1=Leonard |first1=T.

In 2005, T.D. Stanley showed that Card and Krueger's results could signify either publication bias or the absence of a minimum wage effect. However, using a different methodology, Stanley concluded that there is evidence of publication bias and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00250.x |title=Beyond Publication Bias |year=2005 |last1=Stanley |first1=T.

Stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 U.S. studies on disemployment effects and concluded that Card and Krueger's initial claim of publication bias is still correct. Moreover, they concluded, "Once this publication selection is corrected, little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x |title=Publication Selection Bias in Minimum-Wage Research?

==Debate over consequences==
Minimum wage laws affect workers in most low-paid fields of employment<ref name="Neumark" /> and have usually been judged against the criterion of reducing poverty.<ref name="Palgrave1987">{{cite book | last = Eatwell | first = John, Ed. |author2=Murray Milgate |author3=Peter Newman  | title = The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics | publisher = The Macmillan Press Limited | year = 1987 | location = London | pages = 476–78 | isbn = 978-0-333-37235-7 }}</ref> Minimum wage laws receive less support from economists than from the general public. Despite decades of experience and economic research, debates about the costs and benefits of minimum wages continue today.<ref name="Neumark" />

Various groups have great ideological, political, financial, and emotional investments in issues surrounding minimum wage laws. For example, agencies that administer the laws have a vested interest in showing that "their" laws do not create unemployment, as do labor unions whose members' finances are protected by minimum wage laws. On the other side of the issue, low-wage employers such as restaurants finance the Employment Policies Institute, which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Harry |last1=Bernstein |title=Troubling Facts on Employment |work=Los Angeles Times |date=15 September 1992 |page=D3 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-15/business/fi-836_1_part-time-jobs |access-date=6 December 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217204239/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-15/business/fi-836_1_part-time-jobs |archive-date=17 December 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Erik |last1=Engquist |date=May 2006 |title=Health bill fight nears showdown |journal=Crain's New York Business |volume=22 |issue=20 |page=1}}</ref> The presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on the issue is not always based on dispassionate analysis.

A widely circulated argument that the minimum wage was ineffective at reducing poverty was provided by [[George Stigler]] in 1949:
* Employment may fall more than in proportion to the wage increase, thereby reducing overall earnings;
* As uncovered sectors of the economy absorb workers released from the covered sectors, the decrease in wages in the uncovered sectors may exceed the increase in wages in the covered ones;
* The impact of the minimum wage on family income distribution may be negative unless the fewer but better jobs are allocated to members of needy families rather than to, for example, teenagers from families not in poverty;
* Forbidding employers to pay less than a legal minimum is equivalent to forbidding workers to sell their labor for less than the minimum wage.

A similar survey in 2006 by Robert Whaples polled PhD members of the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA).

Surveys of labor economists have found a sharp split on the minimum wage. Fuchs et al. (1998) polled labor economists at the top 40 research universities in the United States on a variety of questions in the summer of 1996. Their 65 respondents were nearly evenly divided when asked if the minimum wage should be increased. They argued that the different policy views were not related to views on whether raising the minimum wage would reduce teen employment (the median economist said there would be a reduction of 1%), but on value differences such as income redistribution.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Victor R. |last1=Fuchs |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |first3=James M. |last3=Poterba |date=September 1998 |title=Economists' Views about Parameters, Values, and Policies: Survey Results in Labor and Public Economics |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=1387–425 |jstor=2564804}}</ref> [[Daniel B. Klein]] and Stewart Dompe conclude, on the basis of previous surveys, "the average level of support for the minimum wage is somewhat higher among labor economists than among AEA members."<ref name="Klein & Dompe 2007">{{cite journal |last1=Klein |first1=Daniel |first2=Stewart |last2=Dompe |title=Reasons for Supporting the Minimum Wage: Asking Signatories of the 'Raise the Minimum Wage' Statement |date=January 2007 |journal=Economics in Practice |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=125–67 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/reasons-for-supporting-the-minimum-wage-asking-signatories-of-the-raise-the-minimum-wage-statement |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213221725/http://econjwatch.org/articles/reasons-for-supporting-the-minimum-wage-asking-signatories-of-the-raise-the-minimum-wage-statement |archive-date=13 December 2011 }}</ref>

In 2007, Klein and Dompe conducted a non-anonymous survey of supporters of the minimum wage who had signed the "Raise the Minimum Wage" statement published by the [[Economic Policy Institute]]. 95 of the 605 signatories responded. They found that a majority signed on the grounds that it transferred income from employers to workers, or equalized bargaining power between them in the labor market. In addition, a majority considered disemployment to be a moderate potential drawback to the increase they supported.<ref name="Klein & Dompe 2007" />

In 2013, a diverse group of 37 economics professors was surveyed on their view of the minimum wage's impact on employment. 34% of respondents agreed with the statement, "Raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment." 32% disagreed and the remaining respondents were uncertain or had no opinion on the question. 47% agreed with the statement, "The distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to low-skilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy", while 11% disagreed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_br0IEq5a9E77NMV |title=Minimum Wage |publisher=[[IGM Forum]] |date=26 February 2013 |access-date=6 December 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821030142/http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_br0IEq5a9E77NMV |archive-date=21 August 2013 }}</ref>

==Alternatives==
Economists and other political commentators have proposed alternatives to the minimum wage. They argue that these alternatives may address the issue of poverty better than a minimum wage, as it would benefit a broader population of low wage earners, not cause any unemployment, and distribute the costs widely rather than concentrating it on employers of low wage workers.

===Basic income===
{{main|Basic Income}}
A [[basic income]] (or [[negative income tax]] - NIT) is a system of [[social security]] that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. Supporters of the basic-income idea argue that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer, as there would be no risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, jobseekers could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills (via education and training), which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the USA show that people spent more time studying while the program{{which|date=June 2019}} was running.<ref>

Proponents argue that a basic income that is based on a broad tax base would be more economically efficient than a minimum wage, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing [[deadweight loss|losses in efficiency]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Guaranteed minimum income===
A [[guaranteed minimum income]] is another proposed system of [[social welfare provision]]. It is similar to a basic income or negative income tax system, except that it is normally conditional and subject to a means test. Some proposals also stipulate a willingness to participate in the [[labor market]], or a willingness to perform [[community services]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=67osAAAAIBAJ&pg=766,4664677&dq=guaranteed+minimum+income+labor+market&hl=en |title=Suggestion: Raise welfare children in institutions |website=Star-News |date=28 January 1972 |access-date=19 November 2013}}</ref>

===Refundable tax credit===
A [[refundable tax credit]] is a mechanism whereby the tax system can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include the [[earned income tax credit]] and the additional [[child tax credit]] in the US, and [[working tax credit]]s and [[child tax credit]]s in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a [[negative income tax]], in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income.  This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).<ref name="wbur">{{cite news|title=What The Research Says In The Minimum Wage Debate|agency=WBUR|date=28 April 2014|author=David Scharfenberg}}</ref>

Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark are examples of developed nations where there is no minimum wage that is required by legislation.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="NYT-20141027-LA" /> Such nations, particularly the Nordics, have very high union participation rates.<ref name="Olson">Olson, Parmy (9/01/2009).

=== Wage subsidies ===
Some economists such as [[Scott Sumner]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=10232|title=TheMoneyIllusion " You can't redistribute income . . |last=Sumner|first=Scott|website=www.themoneyillusion.com|access-date=11 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811222858/http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=10232|archive-date=11 August 2017}}</ref> and [[Edmund Phelps]]<ref>Phelps, Edmund S. "Low-wage employment subsidies versus the welfare state." ''The American Economic Review'' 84.2 (1994): 54-58.</ref> advocate a wage subsidy program. A wage subsidy is a payment made by a government for work people do. It is based either on an hourly basis or by income earned. Advocates argue that the primary deficiencies of the EITC and the minimum wage are best avoided by a wage subsidy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/wage-subsidy-better-way-help-poor-7778.html|title=The Wage Subsidy: A Better Way to Help the Poor {{!}} Manhattan Institute|date=25 September 2015|work=Manhattan Institute|access-date=11 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811230231/https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/wage-subsidy-better-way-help-poor-7778.html|archive-date=11 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/08/19/wage-subsidies-are-better-than-raising-the-minimum-wage|title=A Better Wage Hike|last=Cass|first=Oren|date=19 August 2015|website=US NEWS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820110346/http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/08/19/wage-subsidies-are-better-than-raising-the-minimum-wage|archive-date=20 August 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=11 August 2017}}</ref> However, the wage subsidy in the United States suffers from a lack of political support from either major [[political parties in the United States|political party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/wage-subsidies.html|title=Noahpinion: Wage subsidies|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=7 December 2013|website=Noahpinion|access-date=11 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811224635/http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/wage-subsidies.html|archive-date=11 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/wage-subsidies-might-be-good-idea-republicans-will-never-support-it/|title=Wage subsidies might be a good idea, but Republicans will never support it|last=Drum|first=Kevin|date=3 December 2013|work=Mother Jones|access-date=11 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811224733/https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/wage-subsidies-might-be-good-idea-republicans-will-never-support-it/|archive-date=11 August 2017}}</ref>

===Education and training===

Providing education or funding apprenticeships or technical training can provide a bridge for low skilled workers to move into wages above a minimum wage.  For example, Germany has adopted a state funded [[apprenticeship]] program that combines on-the-job and classroom training.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/why-germany-is-so-much-better-at-training-its-workers/381550/ Why Germany Is So Much Better at Training Its Workers]</ref> Having more skills makes workers more valuable and more productive, but having a high minimum wage for low-skill jobs reduces the incentive to seek education and training.<ref>[https://work.chron.com/alternatives-raising-minimum-wage-18704.html Alternatives to Raising Minimum Wage]</ref> Moving some workers to higher-paying jobs will decrease the supply of workers willing to accept low-skill jobs, increasing the market wage for those low skilled jobs (assuming a stable labor market).  However, in that solution the wage will still not increase above the marginal return for the role and will likely promote automation or business closure.

Reactions from former McDonald's USA Ed Rensi about raising minimum wage to $15 is to completely push humans out of the picture when it comes to labor if they are to pay minimum wage at $15 they would look into replacing humans with machines as that would be the more cost-effective than having employees that are ineffective. During an interview on FOX Business Network’s Mornings with Maria, he stated that he believes an increase to $15 an hour would cause job loss at an extraordinary level. Rensi also believes it does not only affect the fast food industry, franchising he sees as the best business model in the United States, it is dependent on people that have low job skills that have to grow and if you cannot pay them a reasonable wage then they are going to be replaced with machines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/05/24/fmr-mcdonalds-usa-ceo-35k-robots-cheaper-than-hiring-at-15-per-hour.html|title=Fmr.
