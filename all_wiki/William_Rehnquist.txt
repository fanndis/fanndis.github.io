'''William Hubbs Rehnquist''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|k|w|ɪ|s|t}} {{respell|REN|kwist}}; October 1, 1924 – September 3, 2005) was an American lawyer and jurist who served on the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] for 33 years, first as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] from 1972 to 1986 and then as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] from 1986 until his death in 2005. Considered a conservative, Rehnquist favored a conception of [[federalism]] that emphasized the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]'s reservation of powers to the states. Under this view of federalism, the court, for the first time since the 1930s, struck down an act of Congress as exceeding its power under the [[Commerce Clause]].

Rehnquist grew up in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] during the final years of [[World War II]]. After the war's end in 1945, Rehnquist studied [[political science]] at [[Stanford University]] and [[Harvard University]], then earned a law degree from the [[Stanford Law School]]. He clerked for Associate Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] during the Supreme Court's 1952–1953 term, then entered private practice in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He served as a legal adviser for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nominee [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], and in 1969 President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Rehnquist as [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]]. In 1971, Nixon nominated Rehnquist to succeed Associate Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]], and Rehnquist won [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation that same year. Rehnquist quickly established himself as the most conservative member of the [[Burger Court]]. In 1986, President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Rehnquist to succeed retiring Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]], and Rehnquist again won Senate confirmation.

Rehnquist served as Chief Justice for nearly 19 years, making him the fourth-longest-serving Chief Justice, and the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States by time in office|eighth-longest-serving Justice]]. He became an intellectual and social leader of the [[Rehnquist Court]], earning respect even from the Justices who frequently opposed his opinions. Though he remained a member of the conservative wing of the court, Associate Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] were often regarded as more conservative. As Chief Justice, Rehnquist presided over the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment trial]] of President [[Bill Clinton]].

Rehnquist wrote the majority opinions in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995) and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000), holding in both cases that Congress had exceeded its power under the Commerce Clause. He opposed the court's ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) decision and continued to argue that ''Roe'' had been incorrectly decided in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992). In ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000), he voted with the court's majority to end the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|Florida recount]].

==Early life==
Rehnquist was born on October 1, 1924 and grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]]. His father, William Benjamin Rehnquist, was a sales manager at various times for printing equipment, paper, and medical supplies and devices; his mother, Margery Peck Rehnquist—the daughter of a local hardware store owner who also served as an officer and director of a small insurance company—was a local civic activist, as well as translator and homemaker.<ref>Herman J. Obermayer, Rehnquist: A Personal Portrait of the Distinguished Chief Justice of the United States (2009 Simon and Schuster) pp.24–26</ref> His paternal grandparents had immigrated from [[Sweden]].<ref name=atlan1>{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|title=Rehnquist the Great?|work=The Atlantic |year=2005|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/rehnquist-the-great/3820|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref><ref name="reindeer-twig">It means, in direct translation to English: ''reindeer twig''.</ref>

Rehnquist graduated from [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] in 1942.<ref name="stanford lane">Lane, Charles. [http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/julaug/features/rehnquist.html "Head of the Class: Fresh from service in World War II, William Rehnquist went west unsure of his future.

"So, for the brainy kid they had called 'Bugs' back home at suburban Shorewood High School, just outside Milwaukee, weather was a key criterion in selecting a college."</ref> He attended [[Kenyon College]], in [[Gambier, Ohio]], for one quarter in the fall of 1942, before entering the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]]. He served from 1943–1946, mostly in assignments in the United States. He was put into a pre-[[meteorology]] program and assigned to [[Denison University]] until February 1944, when the program was shut down. He served three months at [[Will Rogers Field]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], three months in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]], and then went to [[Hondo, Texas]], for a few months. He was then chosen for another training program, which began at [[Chanute Field]], [[Illinois]], and ended at [[Fort Monmouth|Fort Monmouth, New Jersey]]. The program was designed to teach the maintenance and repair of weather instruments. In the summer of 1945, Rehnquist went overseas as a weather observer in North Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=50&GA=94&DocTypeId=HR&DocNum=622&GAID=8&LegID=21862&SpecSess=&Session=|title=Illinois General Assembly - Full Text of HR0622|website=www.ilga.gov}}</ref>

After the war, Rehnquist attended [[Stanford University]] with assistance under the provisions of the [[G.I. Bill]].<ref name="supreme court">{{cite book|title=The United States Supreme Court|author=Christopher L. Tomlins|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |year=2005|url=https://archive.org/details/unitedstatessupr00toml|url-access=registration|accessdate=October 21, 2008|isbn=978-0-618-32969-4}}</ref>
In 1948, he received both a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[political science]], as well as an election to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. In 1950, he attended [[Harvard University]], where he received another Master of Arts, this time in government. He later returned to Stanford, and graduated from the [[Stanford Law School]] in the same class as [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], with whom he would serve on the Supreme Court. They briefly dated at Stanford<ref name="Biskupic-SDO">[[Joan Biskupic|Biskupic, Joan]]. ''Sandra Day O'Connor: How the First Woman on the Supreme Court became its most influential justice''.

==Law clerk at the Supreme Court==
Rehnquist went to Washington, D.C., to work as a [[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States#Robert H. Jackson|law clerk]] for Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] during the court's 1952–1953 term.<ref name="BiskupicSept4">[[Joan Biskupic|Biskupic, Joan]]. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/supremecourtjustices/2005-09-04-rehnquist-legacy_x.htm "Rehnquist left Supreme Court with conservative legacy"]. ''USA Today''. September 4, 2005.</ref> There, he wrote a memorandum arguing against federal court-ordered school [[desegregation]] while the court was considering the landmark case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which was decided in 1954. Rehnquist's 1952 memo, entitled "A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases", defended the "separate-but-equal" doctrine. In that memo, Rehnquist said:

{{quote|To the argument that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minority are... I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by "liberal" colleagues, but I think ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' was right and should be reaffirmed.<ref name="Rehnquist-RandomThought">{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST/pdf/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST-4-16-6.pdf |author=William Rehnquist |title=A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases |accessdate=November 14, 2017 }}, S. Hrg. 99-1067, Hearings Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination of Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States (July 29–31, and August 1, 1986).</ref>}}

In both his 1971 Senate confirmation hearing for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justice]] and his 1986 hearing for chief justice, Rehnquist testified that the memorandum reflected the views of Justice Jackson rather than his own views. Rehnquist said, "I believe that the memorandum was prepared by me as a statement of Justice Jackson's tentative views for his own use."<ref name="1971 confirm">1971 confirmation hearings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}<!-- NOTE: A MEETING NAME/DATE IS NOT A PUBLISHED, RELIABLE SOURCE. --></ref> Elsie Douglas, long-time secretary and confidante of Justice Jackson, stated during Rehnquist's 1986 hearings that his allegation was "a smear of a great man, for whom I served as secretary for many years. Justice Jackson did not ask law clerks to express his views. He expressed his own and they expressed theirs. That is what happened in this instance."<ref name="Sarbanes">{{cite web|title=132 Cong. Rec. 23548 (Speech of Senator Paul Sarbanes) |year=1986 |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/law/nominations/rehnquist-cj/statements.pdf}}</ref>

However, the papers of Justices [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]] and [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]] indicate that Justice Jackson voted for ''Brown'' in 1954 only after changing his mind.<ref name="Schwartz-Decision">Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote: "In the original conference there were only four who voted that segregation in the public schools was unconstitutional. Those four were Black, Burton, Minton, and myself." See Bernard Schwartz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5cUCl4hSWUC&pg=PA96 Decision: How the Supreme Court Decides Cases]'', page 96 (Oxford 1996). Likewise, Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] wrote: "I have no doubt that if the segregation cases had reached decision last term, there would have been four dissenters—Vinson, Reed, Jackson, and Clark." Ibid.</ref>

At his 1986 hearings for chief justice, Rehnquist tried to put further distance between himself and the 1952 memo: "The bald statement that 'Plessy was right and should be reaffirmed,' was not an accurate reflection of my own views at the time."<ref name="Liptak">Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/weekinreview/11lipt.html?ei=5088&en=5f85796f9c88b565&ex=1284091200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print "The Memo That Rehnquist Wrote and Had to Disown"], ''NY Times'' (September 11, 2005)</ref> However, Rehnquist acknowledged defending ''Plessy'' in arguments with fellow law clerks.<ref name="Canellos">[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/08/23/memos_may_not_hold_robertss_opinions/ "Memos may not hold Roberts's opinions"], ''The Boston Globe'', Peter S. Canellos, August 23, 2005 Rehnquist said in 1986 about his conversations with other clerks about ''Plessy'' that he: {{quote|thought ''Plessy'' had been wrongly decided at the time, that it was not a good interpretation of the equal protection clause to say that when you segregate people by race, there is no denial of equal protection. But ''Plessy'' had been on the books for 60 years. Congress had never acted, and the same Congress that had promulgated the 14th Amendment had required segregation in the District schools. I saw factors on both sides. I did not agree then, and I certainly do not agree now, with the statement that "Plessy against Ferguson is right and should be reaffirmed." I had ideas on both sides, and I do not think I ever really finally settled in my own mind on that. Around the lunch table I am sure I defended it. I thought there were good arguments to be made in support of it.}} S. Hrg. 99–1067, Hearings Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination of Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States (July 29, 30, 31, and August 1, 1986).</ref>

Several commentators have concluded that the memo reflected Rehnquist's own views rather than those of Justice Jackson.<ref name="Schwartz">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Bernard|title=Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Jackson, and the "Brown" Case |journal=Supreme Court Review|volume=1988|issue=1988|pages=245–267|year=1988|issn=0081-9557|jstor=3109626|doi=10.1086/scr.1988.3109626|s2cid=147205671}}</ref><ref name="Kluger">{{cite book|last=Kluger|first=Richard|title=Simple Justice: The History of ''Brown v.

A biography on Jackson corroborates this explanation, stating that Jackson instructed his clerks to express their own views, not his.<ref name="mr right">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961645-5,00.html|title=Reagan's Mr. Right |work=TIME|date=June 30, 1986|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref> This conclusion is further corroborated by an article published in ''The Boston College Law Review'' in 2012, which analyzes a 1955 letter written to Justice Frankfurter that criticized Justice Jackson.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Brad|last2=Barrett|first2=John Q.|title=Rehnquist's Missing Letter: A Former Law Clerk's 1955 Thoughts on Justice Jackson and Brown|journal=The Boston College Law Review|date=2012|volume=53|issue=2|pages=631–660 |url=http://bclawreview.org/review/53_2/05_snyder_barrett|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref>

In any event, while later serving on the Supreme Court, Rehnquist made no effort to reverse or undermine the ''Brown'' decision and frequently relied upon it as precedent.<ref>[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST/pdf/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST-4-13-1.pdf "Cases where Justice Rehnquist has cited Brown v.

Board'' and in favor of ''Plessy'', even though he now saw the Court's decision in ''Brown'' as correct.<ref name="mr right"/>

In a memorandum to Justice Jackson about ''[[Terry v. Adams]]'',<ref name="Terry v. Adams">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&court=US&case=/us/345/461.html ''Terry v. Adams''], 345 U.S. 461 (1953)</ref> which involved the right of blacks to vote in an allegedly private Texas election, Rehnquist wrote:

{{quote|The Constitution does not prevent the majority from banding together, nor does it attaint success in the effort. It is about time the Court faced the fact that the white people of the south do not like the colored people. The constitution restrains them from effecting this dislike through state action, but it most assuredly did not appoint the Court as a sociological watchdog to rear up every time private discrimination raises its admittedly ugly head.<ref name="stanford lane"/>}}

In another memorandum to Justice Jackson regarding the same case (''Terry''), Rehnquist wrote:

{{quote|Clerks began screaming as soon as they saw this that 'Now we can show those damn southerners, etc.' I take a dim view of this pathological search for discrimination and as a result I now have something of a mental block against the case.<ref name="Yarbrough">Tinsley E.

Nevertheless, Rehnquist recommended to Justice Jackson that the Supreme Court should agree to hear the ''Terry'' case.

==Private practice==
Rehnquist moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where he was in private law practice from 1953 to 1969. He began his legal work in the firm of [[Denison Kitchel]], subsequently serving as the national campaign manager of the [[Barry M. Goldwater]] presidential campaign in [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964]]. Prominent clients included [[Jim Hensley]], the future father-in-law of [[John McCain]].<ref>{{cite book|title=McCain: The Essential Guide to the Republican Nominee: His Character, His Career and Where He Stands|url=https://archive.org/details/mccainessentialg0000silv|url-access=registration|author=Mark Silva|page=[https://archive.org/details/mccainessentialg0000silv/page/44 44]|isbn=978-1600781964|year=2008}}</ref> During these years, Rehnquist was active in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and served as a legal advisor under Kitchel to Goldwater's campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|title=Denison Kitchel, 94; Ran Goldwater's Presidential Bid |date=October 24, 2002|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref> He collaborated with [[Harry Jaffa]] on Goldwater's speeches.<ref>[[David Gordon (philosopher)|Gordon, David]] (Fall 2001).

Many years later, during the 1971 hearing for associate justice and later during the 1986 [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearings on his chief justice nomination, several people came forward to complain about Rehnquist's participation in [[Operation Eagle Eye (United States)|Operation Eagle Eye]], a Republican attempt to discourage minority voters in Arizona elections, when Rehnquist served as a [[Scrutineer|poll watcher]] in the early 1960s.<ref name="Roddy">Roddy, Dennis (December 2, 2000).

==Justice Department==
When [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] was elected in [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]], Rehnquist returned to work in Washington. He served as [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], from 1969 to 1971.<ref name="cornell-bio">{{cite web |url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/rehnquist.bio.html |title=LII: US Supreme Court: Justice Rehnquist |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}</ref> In this role, he served as the chief lawyer to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N.

President Nixon mistakenly referred to him as "Renchburg" in several of the tapes of [[Oval Office]] conversations revealed during the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] investigations.<ref name="Renchburg">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E1DF1331F937A35752C1A9679C8B63 |title=Renchburg's the One! |work=New York Times |author=Jeffrey Rosen |date=November 4, 2001 |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}</ref>

Because he was well-placed in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], Rehnquist was mentioned for many years as a possibility for the source known as [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] during the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/under-the-dome/was-rehnquist-deep-throat-2005-02-23.html |title=Was Rehnquist 'Deep Throat'? |publisher=Thehill.com |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114002203/http://thehill.com/under-the-dome/was-rehnquist-deep-throat-2005-02-23.html |archive-date=January 14, 2008 }}</ref> Once [[Bob Woodward]] revealed on May 31, 2005, that [[W.

In fall 1971, Nixon received the resignations of two Supreme Court justices, [[Hugo Black]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]]. After compiling an initial list of possible appointees that ran afoul of [[Warren Burger|Chief Justice Burger]] and the [[American Bar Association]], Nixon considered Rehnquist for one of the slots. [[Henry Kissinger]] discussed the possible pick with presidential advisor [[H.R. Haldeman]] and asked, "Rehnquist is pretty far right, isn't he?" Haldeman responded, "Oh, Christ! He's way to the right of Buchanan,"<ref>Perlstein, Rick (2008), p. 605</ref> referring to then-presidential advisor [[Patrick Buchanan]].

==Associate Justice==
[[File:William Rehnquist official portrait 1972.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rehnquist portrait as an Associate Justice in 1972]]

Nixon nominated Rehnquist to replace [[John Marshall Harlan II]] on the Supreme Court upon Harlan's retirement, and after being confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a 68–26 vote on December 10, 1971, Rehnquist took his seat as an associate justice on January 7, 1972.{{cn|date=June 2020}} There were two vacancies on the court at the time; Nixon nominated [[Lewis Franklin Powell Jr.]] to fill the other, left by the retirement of [[Hugo Black]]. Black died September 25, 1971, and Harlan died on December 29 of that year.

On the [[Warren E. Burger|Burger]] Court, Rehnquist promptly established himself as the most conservative of Nixon's appointees, taking a narrow view of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and a broad view of state power. Rehnquist almost always voted "with the prosecution in criminal cases, with business in antitrust cases, with employers in labor cases, and with the government in speech cases."<ref name="woodward 221">Bob Woodward & Scott Armstrong, ''The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court''. 1979.

For years, Rehnquist was determined to keep cases involving individual rights in state courts away from federal reach.<ref name="woodward 221"/><ref name="woodward 222">Bob Woodward & Scott Armstrong, ''The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court''. 1979. Simon and Schuster. Page 222.</ref>

In ''[[National League of Cities v. Usery]]'' (1977), Rehnquist's majority opinion invalidated a federal law extending [[minimum wage]] and maximum hours provisions to state and local government employees.<ref name="Friedman 114">Friedman, Leon. ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'', Volume V. Chelsea House Publishers. 1978. Page 114.</ref> Rehnquist wrote that "this exercise of congressional authority does not comport with the federal system of government embodied in the Constitution."<ref name="Friedman 114"/>

As chief justice, Rehnquist presided over what law professor [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] has called a "federalist revolution",<ref>[[Erwin Chemerinsky|Chemerinsky, Erwin]] (March 11, 2005) [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2132&context=faculty_scholarship Keynote Address: Rehnquist Court's Federalism Revolution], 41 ''Willamette Law Review'' 827</ref> during which the Court limited federal power in cases such as ''[[New York v. United States]]'', ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', ''[[Printz v. United States]]'', and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]''. Similarly, [[Cato Institute]] scholar [[Roger Pilon]] has said that "[t]he Rehnquist court has revived the doctrine of federalism . . . only at the edges and in very easy cases."<ref>Roh, Jane (June 14, 2005) [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159308,00.html Rehnquist's Legacy: A Balanced Court], ''[[Fox News]]''</ref>

===Equal protection, civil rights, and abortion===
Rehnquist rejected a broad view of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 1952, while serving as a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, Rehnquist wrote a memorandum which concludes that "''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' was right and should be re-affirmed. If the Fourteenth Amendment did not enact Spencer's [[Social Statics]], it just as surely did not enact Myrddahl's American Dilemma" (''[[An American Dilemma]]''), by which he meant that the Court should not "read its own sociological views into the Constitution."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/print/sources_document7.html|title=A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases}}</ref> He believed that the Fourteenth Amendment was meant only as a solution to the problems of slavery, and was misapplied when applied towards abortion rights or prisoner's rights.<ref name="woodward 221"/><ref name="woodward 411">Bob Woodward & Scott Armstrong, ''The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court''. 1979. Simon and Schuster. Page 411.</ref> Rehnquist believed that the Court "had no business reflecting society's changing and expanding values" and argued that this was the domain of the Congress.<ref name="woodward 221"/> Rehnquist tried to weave his view of the amendment into his opinion for ''Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer'', but it was rejected by the other justices.<ref name="woodward 411"/> Rehnquist later extended what he said he saw as the scope of the amendment, writing in ''Trimble v. Gordon'': "except in the area of the law in which the Framers obviously meant it to apply—classifications based on race or on national origin".<ref name="trimble">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=430&invol=762 ''Trimble v. Gordon''], 430 U.S. 762 (1977)</ref>

Also, during the Burger Court's deliberations over ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', Rehnquist promoted his view that court's jurisdiction does not apply over [[abortion]].<ref name="woodward 235">Bob Woodward & Scott Armstrong, ''The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court''. 1979. Simon and Schuster. Page 235.</ref>

He voted against the expansion of school [[desegregation]] plans and the establishment of legalized abortions, dissenting in ''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}. Rehnquist expressed his views about the [[Equal Protection Clause]] in cases like ''Trimble v. Gordon'':<ref name="trimble"/>

{{quote|Unfortunately, more than a century of decisions under this Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment have produced ... a syndrome wherein this Court seems to regard the Equal Protection Clause as a cat-o'-nine-tails to be kept in the judicial closet as a threat to legislatures which may, in the view of the judiciary, get out of hand and pass "arbitrary", "illogical", or "unreasonable" laws. Except in the area of the law in which the Framers obviously meant it to apply—classifications based on race or on national origin, the first cousin of race—the Court's decisions can fairly be described as an endless tinkering with legislative judgments, a series of conclusions unsupported by any central guiding principle.}}

===Other issues===
Rehnquist consistently defended state-sanctioned [[school prayer|prayer in public schools]].<ref name="mr right"/>

Rehnquist held a restrictive view of criminals' and prisoners' rights, and held the view that capital punishment is constitutionally permissible.<ref name="Friedman 124">Friedman, Leon. ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'', Volume V. Chelsea House Publishers. 1978. Page 124.</ref> He supported the view that the Fourth Amendment permitted a warrantless search incident to a valid arrest.<ref name="Friedman 122">Friedman, Leon. ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'', Volume V. Chelsea House Publishers. 1978. Page 122.</ref>

In ''[[Nixon v. Administrator of General Services]]'' (1977), Rehnquist dissented from a decision upholding the constitutionality of an act that gave a federal agency administrator certain authority over former President Nixon's presidential papers and tape recordings.<ref name="Friedman 113">Friedman, Leon. ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'', Volume V. Chelsea House Publishers. 1978. Page 113.</ref> He dissented solely on the ground that the law was "a clear violation of the constitutional principle of separation of powers".<ref name="Friedman 114"/><ref name="Friedman 113"/>

During oral argument in ''[[Duren v. Missouri]]'' (1978), the court faced a challenge to laws and practices that made jury duty voluntary for women in that state. At the end of [[Ruth Ginsburg]]'s oral presentation Rehnquist asked her, "You will not settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/23/AR2007082300903_pf.html|title=Redefining Fair With a Simple Careful Assault.

Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Diamond v. Diehr]]'', {{ussc|450|175|1981}}, which began a gradual trend toward overturning the ban on software patents in the United States first established in ''[[Parker v. Flook]]'', {{ussc|437|584|1978}}. In ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'', pertaining to [[video cassette recorder]]s such as the Betamax system, Justice Stevens again wrote an opinion providing a broad [[fair use]] doctrine while Rehnquist joined the dissent, which supported stronger copyrights. Years later, in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', {{ussc|537|186|2003}}, Rehnquist was in the majority favoring the copyright holders, with Justices Stevens and Breyer dissenting in favor of a narrower construction of copyright law.

===Rehnquist's view of the rational basis test===
David Shapiro, professor of law at [[Harvard University]], wrote that while Rehnquist was an associate justice, he disliked even minimal inquiries into legislative objectives except in the areas of race, national origin, and infringement of specific constitutional guarantees.<ref name="Friedman 115">Friedman, Leon. ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'', Volume V. Chelsea House Publishers. 1978. Page 115.</ref> For Rehnquist, the [[Rational basis review|rational basis test]], which is an important part of equal protection jurisprudence, was not a standard for weighing the interests of the government against the individual; rather, it was a label to describe a preordained result.<ref name="Friedman 115"/> Shapiro in 1978 pointed out that Rehnquist had avoided joining rational basis determinations for years, except in one case, ''[[Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld]]''.<ref name="Friedman 115"/> Rehnquist eschewed the Court majority's approach to equal protection, writing in dissent in ''[[Trimble v. Gordon]]'' that the state's distinction should be sustained because it was not "mindless and patently irrational".<ref name="Friedman 115"/> (The court struck down an Illinois law allowing illegitimate children to inherit by intestate succession only from their mothers.)

Shapiro pointed out that Rehnquist seemed content to find a sufficient relationship between a challenged classification and perceived governmental interests "no matter how tenuous or speculative that relationship might be".<ref name="Friedman 115"/><ref name="Friedman 116">Friedman, Leon. ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'', Volume V. Chelsea House Publishers. 1978. Page 116.</ref>

A practical result of Rehnquist's view of rational basis can be seen in ''[[Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur]]'', wherein the Court's majority struck down a school board rule that required every pregnant teacher to take unpaid maternity leave beginning five months before the expected birth of her child.<ref name="Friedman 116"/> Justice Powell wrote an opinion rested on the ground that the school board rule was too overinclusive to survive equal protection analysis.<ref name="Friedman 116"/> In dissent, Rehnquist attacked Powell's opinion, saying:

{{quote|If legislative bodies are to be permitted to draw a line anywhere short of the delivery room, I can find no judicial standard of measurement which says the ones drawn here were invalid.<ref name="Friedman 116"/>}}

Shapiro writes that Rehnquist's opinion implied:

{{quote|That there is no constitutionally significant difference between a classification that encompasses virtually no one outside the scope of its purpose and a classification so overinclusive that the vast majority of those falling within are beyond its intended scope.<ref name="Friedman 116"/>}}

Rehnquist's dissent in ''[[United States Department of Agriculture v. Murry]]'' illuminates his view that a classification should pass muster under the rational basis test so long as that classification is not entirely counter-productive with respect to the purposes of the legislation in which it is contained.<ref name="Friedman 116-117">Friedman, Leon. ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'', Volume V. Chelsea House Publishers. 1978. Pages 116–117.</ref> Shapiro alleges that Rehnquist's stance "makes rational basis a virtual nullity".<ref name="Friedman 116"/>

===Relations on the Court===
Rehnquist built warm personal relations with his colleagues, even with ideological opposites. Justice [[William Brennan Jr.]] "startled one acquaintance by informing him that 'Bill Rehnquist is my best friend up here.'"<ref name="Garrow">David Garrow, "The Rehnquist Reins", ''New York Times'', October 6, 1996.</ref> Rehnquist and Justice [[William O. Douglas]] bonded over a shared iconoclasm and love of the west.<ref name="Charlie Rose">Undated 2003–04 ''[[Charlie Rose Show]]'' interview with Rehnquist.</ref> ''The Brethren'' claims that the court's "liberals found it hard not to like the good-natured, thoughtful Rehnquist", despite finding his legal philosophy "extreme",<ref name="woodward 267">Woodward & Armstrong, The Brethren 267 (2005) (1979 ed. at __).</ref> and that Justice [[Potter Stewart|Stewart]] regarded Rehnquist as "excellent" and "a "team player, a part of the group in the center of the court, even though he usually ended up in the conservative bloc".<ref name="woodward 498">''The Brethren'', 2005 ed. at 498 (1979 ed. at ___).</ref>

Since Rehnquist's first years on the Supreme Court, other justices criticized what they saw as his "willingness to cut corners to reach a conservative result", "gloss[ing] over inconsistencies of logic or fact" or distinguishing indistinct cases to reach their destination.<ref name="woodward 268&499">''The Bretheren'', 2005 ed. at 268, 499 (1979 ed. at 407–8, __)</ref><ref name="Friedman 121">Leon Friedman, ''The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions'' (1978), page 121.</ref> In ''[[Jefferson v.

Reluctant to compromise, Rehnquist was the most frequent sole dissenter during the Burger years, garnering the nickname "the Lone Ranger".<ref name="mr right"/> He usually voted with Chief Justice Burger,<ref name="woodward 269">''The Brethren'', 2005 ed. at __ (1979 ed. at 269).</ref> and—recognizing "the importance of his relationship with Burger"—often went along to get along, joining Burger's majority opinions even when he disagreed with them, and, in important cases, "tr[ying] to straighten him out".<ref name="woodward 499"/>

When Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] retired in 1986, President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Rehnquist to fill the position. Although Rehnquist was to the right of Burger,<ref name="Eisler">Eisler, Kim Isaac (1993). ''A Justice for All: William J. Brennan, Jr., and the decisions that transformed America''. p. 272.

During [[Advice and consent#United States|confirmation hearings]], Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] challenged Rehnquist on his unwitting ownership of property that had a [[restrictive covenant]] against sale to Jews<ref name="Oser">Alan S. Oser, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DC1639F932A3575BC0A960948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all "Unenforceable Covenants are in Many Deeds"], ''New York Times'' (August 1, 1986).
<blockquote>Mr. Rehnquist has said he was unaware of discriminatory restrictions on properties he bought in [[Arizona]] and [[Vermont]], and officials in those states said today that he had never even been required to sign the deeds that contained the restrictions.... He told the committee he would act quickly to get rid of the covenants. The restriction on the Vermont property prohibits the lease or sale of the property to "members of the Hebrew race"&nbsp;...

(such covenants were held to be unenforceable under the 1948 Supreme Court case ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]''). Despite this and other controversies, including a concern over his membership in the [[Alfalfa Club]] (which at the time did not allow women to join),<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DD1039F932A3575BC0A960948260&pagewanted=print "President Asserts He Will Withhold Rehnquist Memos"], ''New York Times'', August 1, 1986.</ref> the [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmed his appointment by a 65–33 vote (49–2 in the [[Senate Republican Conference]], with [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Jake Garn]] abstaining, and 16–31 in the [[Senate Democratic Caucus]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Record–Senate|date=September 17, 1986|page=23803|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/266_1986.pdf|access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref> and he assumed the office on September 26. Rehnquist's seat as an associate justice was filled by newly appointed [[Antonin Scalia]]. Rehnquist would be the first person since [[Harlan F. Stone]] to have served as both an Associate Justice and Chief Justice.

Rehnquist had no prior experience as a judge upon his appointment to the Court. His only experience in presiding over a case at the trial level was in 1984. He was invited by Judge D. Dortch Warriner to preside over a civil case, ''Julian D. Heislup, Sr. and Linda L. Dixon, Appellees, v. Town of Colonial Beach, Virginia, et al.'' Exercising the authority of a Supreme Court justice to preside over lower court proceedings, he oversaw the jury trial involving allegations that police department employees had their civil rights violated when they testified in a matter involving alleged police brutality against a teenage boy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Press|first=Associated|date=1999-01-10|title=Chief justice has presided over only one other trial|url=https://www.deseret.com/1999/1/10/19426101/chief-justice-has-presided-over-only-one-other-trial|access-date=2020-10-29|website=Deseret News|language=en}}</ref> Rehnquist ruled on behalf of the plaintiffs in a number of motions, allowing the case to go to the jury. When the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded damages, the defendants appealed. The appeal was argued before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 4, 1986—sixteen days before Rehnquist was nominated to become Chief Justice. Forty-three days after Rehnquist was sworn in as Chief Justice, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, overruling Rehnquist, and concluding that there was insufficient evidence to have sent the matter to the jury.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Julian D.

In 1999, Rehnquist became the second chief justice (after [[Salmon P. Chase]]) to preside over a presidential [[impeachment]] trial, during the proceedings against President [[Bill Clinton]]. In 2000, Rehnquist wrote a concurring opinion in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', the case that effectively ended the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000#Florida election results|presidential election controversy in Florida]]. He concurred with four other justices in that case that the [[Equal Protection Clause]] barred a "standardless" manual recount of the votes as ordered by the [[Florida Supreme Court]].

In his capacity as chief justice, Rehnquist administered the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|Oath of Office]] to the following presidents of the United States:
* [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1989
* [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993 and 1997
* [[George W. Bush]] in 2001 and 2005

===Leadership of the Court===
Rehnquist's predecessor as chief justice, Warren Burger, had floundered as a leader, alienating his colleagues with his overbearing manner, his inability to effectively manage the justices' conference sessions, and abuse of his seniority—in particular, his tendency to change his vote on important cases so that he could maintain control over opinion assignments.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Woodward |last2=Armstrong |first1=Bob |first2=Scott |title=The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=1979 |isbn=0-671-24110-9 |page={{page needed|date=June 2011}} |url=https://archive.org/details/brethreninsideth00wood }}</ref> Rehnquist, in sharp contrast, won over his fellow justices with his easygoing, humorous, and unpretentious personality. He also tightened up the justices' conferences, keeping the justices from going too long or off track and not allowing any justice to speak twice before all had spoken once, and gained a reputation for scrupulous fairness in assigning opinions: Rehnquist assigned no Justice (including himself) two opinions before everyone had been assigned one, and made no attempts to interfere with assignments for cases in which he was in the minority. Most significantly, Rehnquist successfully lobbied Congress in 1988 to give the Court control of its own docket, cutting back on mandatory appeals and certiorari grants in general.<ref name="Toobin">Toobin, Jeffrey.

Rehnquist added four yellow stripes to the sleeves of his robe in 1995. He was a lifelong fan of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas, and after appreciating the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s costume in a community theater production of ''[[Iolanthe]]'' he thereafter appeared in court with the same striped sleeves.

===Federalism doctrine===
Rehnquist was expected by scholars to push the Supreme Court in a more conservative direction during his tenure. One area many commentators expected to see changes was in limiting the power of the federal government and in increasing the power of state governments.<ref name="Cato-Legacy">{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4689 |title=Rehnquist's Federalist Legacy |publisher=Cato.org |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}</ref> However, legal reporter Jan Crawford says some of Rehnquist's victories toward the federalist goal of scaling back congressional power over the states had little practical impact.<ref name="Crawford">Crawford, Jan. ''Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court''. 2007. Penguin Books. Page 29.</ref>

Rehnquist voted with the majority in ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997) and would refer to that decision as precedent for requiring Congress to defer to the Court as regards interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment (including the Equal Protection Clause) in a number of cases. ''Boerne'' held that any statute that Congress enacted to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment (including the Equal Protection Clause) had to show "a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end". The Rehnquist Court's congruence and proportionality theory replaced the "ratchet" theory that had arguably been advanced in ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'' (1966).<ref>http://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/2/EDSERV/DLU/BCAST/MATLS/Rehnquist_LEGENDS.pdf</ref> According to the "ratchet" theory, Congress could "ratchet up" civil rights beyond what the Court had recognized, but Congress could not "ratchet down" judicially recognized rights. According to the majority opinion of Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], which Rehnquist joined in ''Boerne'':

{{quote|There is language in our opinion in ''Katzenbach v. Morgan'', 384 U.S. 641 (1966), which could be interpreted as acknowledging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands the rights contained in §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one.... If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be "superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means".}}

The Rehnquist Court's congruence and proportionality standard made it easier to revive older precedents preventing Congress from going too far<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/05/politics/politicsspecial1/william-h-rehnquist-architect-of-conservative.html|title=William H. Rehnquist, Architect of Conservative Court, Dies at 80|first=Linda|last=Greenhouse|date=September 5, 2005|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref> in enforcing equal protection of the laws.<ref>''Age Discrimination in Employment Law''. Barbara Lindemann and David D. Kadue. Page 699. 2003, Washington DC.</ref>

One of the Rehnquist Court's major developments involved reinforcing and extending the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]],<ref>http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5296&context=faculty_scholarship</ref> which limits the ability of Congress to subject non-consenting states to lawsuits by individual citizens seeking money damages.

In both ''[[Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents]]'' (2000) and ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' (2001), the Court held that Congress had exceeded its power to enforce the Equal Protection Clause. In both those cases, Rehnquist was in the majority that held discrimination by states based upon age or disability (as opposed to race or gender) need satisfy only [[rational basis review]] as opposed to [[strict scrutiny]].
[[File:Visit reopening rehnquist 600.jpg|thumb|Rehnquist at the National Archives Rotunda in 2003]]
Though the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] by its terms applies only to suits against a state by citizens of another state, the Rehnquist Court often extended this principle to suits by citizens against their own states. One such case was ''[[Alden v. Maine]]'' (1999), in which the Court explained that the authority to subject states to private suits does not follow from any of the express enumerated powers in Article One of the Constitution, and therefore the ''Alden'' Court looked to the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] to see if that Clause authorized Congress to subject the states to lawsuits by the state's own citizens. Rehnquist agreed with Justice Kennedy's statement that such lawsuits were not "necessary and proper":

{{quote|Nor can we conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers.}}

Rehnquist also led the Court toward a more limited view of Congressional power under the [[Commerce Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution. For example, he wrote for a 5-to-4 majority in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', {{ussc|514|549|1995}}, striking down a federal law as exceeding congressional power under the Clause.

''Lopez'' was followed by ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', {{ussc|529|598|2000}}, in which Rehnquist wrote the Court's opinion striking down the civil damages portion of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 1994 as regulating conduct that does not have a significant direct effect on interstate commerce. Rehnquist's majority opinion in ''Morrison'' also rejected an [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] argument on behalf of the Act. All four dissenters disagreed with the Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause, and two dissenters (Stevens and [[Stephen Breyer]]) also took issue with the Court's Equal Protection analysis. Regarding the Commerce Clause, Justice [[David Souter]] asserted that the Court was improperly seeking to convert the judiciary into a "shield against the commerce power".

Regarding the Equal Protection Clause, Rehnquist's majority opinion in ''Morrison'' cited precedents limiting the Clause's scope, such as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), which held that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to state actions, not private acts of violence. Dissenting Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Stevens, agreed with the majority that it "is certainly so" that Congress may not "use the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of power to remedy the conduct of private persons". However, Breyer and Stevens took issue with another aspect of the ''Morrison'' Court's Equal Protection analysis: they argued that cases that the majority had cited (including ''[[United States v. Harris]]'' and the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' regarding lynching and segregation respectively) did not consider "this kind of claim" in which state actors "failed to provide adequate (or any) state remedies". In response, the ''Morrison'' majority asserted that the Violence Against Women Act was "directed not at any State or state actor, but at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias".

The federalist trend set by ''Lopez'' and ''Morrison'' was seemingly halted by ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' (2005), in which the court broadly interpreted the Commerce Clause to allow Congress to prohibit the intrastate cultivation of [[medical cannabis|medicinal]] [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Rehnquist, along with O'Connor and Thomas, dissented in ''Raich''.

Rehnquist authored the majority opinion in ''[[South Dakota v. Dole]]'' (1987), upholding Congress's reduction of funds to states not complying with the national 21-year-old drinking age. Rehnquist's broad reading of Congress's spending power was also seen as a major limitation on the Rehnquist Court's push towards redistribution of power from the federal government to the states.

===''Stare decisis''===
Some commentators expected the Rehnquist Court to overrule several controversial decisions broadly interpreting the Bill of Rights.<ref name="mr right"/> The Rehnquist Court, however, expressly declined to overrule ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' in its decision in ''[[Dickerson v. United States]]''. Rehnquist believed that federal judges should not impose their personal views on the law or stray beyond the intent of the framers by reading broad meaning into the Constitution; he saw himself as an "apostle of judicial restraint".<ref name="mr right"/> [[Columbia Law School]] Professor Vincent Blasi said of Rehnquist in 1986 that "[n]obody since the 1930s has been so niggardly in interpreting the Bill of Rights, so blatant in simply ignoring years and years of precedent."<ref name="mr right"/> (In the same article, Rehnquist was quoted as retorting that "such attacks come from liberal academics and that 'on occasion, they write somewhat disingenuously about me'.")

Rehnquist was a foe of the Court's 1973 ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision. In 1992, that decision survived by a 5–4 vote, in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', which relied heavily on the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]''. Dissenting in ''Casey'', Rehnquist criticized the Court's "newly minted variation on ''stare decisis''", and asserted his belief "that ''Roe'' was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to ''stare decisis'' in constitutional cases".<ref name="Cornell-PlanParentVCasey">{{cite web|date=June 29, 1992|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-744.ZX3.html|title=Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey|publisher=[[Cornell Law School]]|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref>

The Court dealt with another abortion case, this time dealing with [[partial birth abortion]] in ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (2000). Again, a 5–4 decision, and again a dissent from Rehnquist urged that ''stare decisis'' should not be the sole consideration: "I did not join the joint opinion in ''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey'', 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and continue to believe that case is wrongly decided."

===LGBT rights===
Among the many closely watched decisions during Rehnquist's tenure was ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' (1996). Colorado had adopted an amendment to the state constitution ("Amendment 2") that the Court majority said would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to protect homosexual citizens from discrimination on the basis of their [[sexual orientation]]. Rehnquist joined the dissent, which argued that the Constitution of the United States says nothing about this subject, so "it is left to be resolved by normal democratic means". The dissent, written by Justice Scalia, argued as follows (some punctuation omitted):

{{quote|General laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination would continue to prohibit discrimination on the basis of homosexual conduct as well. This&nbsp;... lays to rest such horribles, raised in the course of oral argument, as the prospect that assaults upon homosexuals could not be prosecuted. The amendment prohibits special treatment of homosexuals, and nothing more. It would not affect, for example, a requirement of state law that pensions be paid to all retiring state employees with a certain length of service; homosexual employees, as well as others, would be entitled to that benefit.}}

The dissent mentioned the Court's then-existing precedent in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' (1986), that "the Constitution does not prohibit what virtually all States had done from the founding of the Republic until very recent years—making homosexual conduct a crime." By analogy, the ''Romer'' dissent reasoned that:

{{quote|If it is rational to criminalize the conduct, surely it is rational to deny special favor and protection to those with a self avowed tendency or desire to engage in the conduct.}}

The dissent listed murder, [[polygamy]], and cruelty to animals as behaviors that the federal Constitution allows states to be very hostile toward, and in contrast the dissent stated: "the degree of hostility reflected by Amendment 2 is the smallest conceivable." The ''Romer'' dissent added:

{{quote|I would not myself indulge in&nbsp;... official praise for heterosexual monogamy, because I think it no business of the courts (as opposed to the political branches) to take sides in this culture war. But the Court today has done so, not only by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine to take the victory away from traditional forces, but even by verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence to traditional attitudes.}}

With the case of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' in 2003, the Supreme Court under Rehnquist went on to overrule ''Bowers''. Rehnquist again dissented along with Scalia and [[Clarence Thomas]]. The Court's result in ''Romer'' had described the struck-down statute as "a status-based enactment divorced from any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acluutah.org/weaverdecision.htm |title=Weaver v. Nebo School District |publisher=Acluutah.org |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}</ref> The sentiment behind that statute had led to the court evaluating it with a "more searching" form of review.<ref name="Cornell-LawrenceVTexas">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZC.html |title=Lawrence V. Texas |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}</ref> Similarly, in ''Lawrence'', "moral disapproval" was found to be an unconstitutional basis for condemning a group of people.<ref name="Cornell-LawrenceVTexas"/> The Court protected homosexual behavior in the name of liberty and autonomy.<ref name="Cornell-LawrenceVTexas"/>

Rehnquist sometimes reached results favorable to homosexuals, for example voting to allow a gay [[CIA]] employee to sue on the basis of constitutional law for improper personnel practices (although barring suit on the basis of administrative law in deference to a claim of national security reasons),<ref name="Webster v. Doe">''[[Webster v. Doe]]'', 486 U.S. 592 (1988).</ref>
voting to allow same-sex [[sexual harassment]] claims to be adjudicated,<ref name="Oncale v. Sundowner">''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.]]'', 523 US 75 (1998).</ref>
and voting to allow the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] to require students to pay a mandatory fee that subsidized gay groups along with all other student organizations.<ref name="Regents v. Southworth">''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=98-1189 Board of Regents v. Southworth]'', 529 U.S. 217 (2000).</ref>

===Civil Rights Act===
Rehnquist voted with the majority in denying a private right to sue for discrimination based on race or national origin involving a disparate impact under title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], in ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'' (2001), which involved the issue of whether a citizen could sue a state for not providing [[driver's license]] exams in languages other than English. ''Sandoval'' cited ''[[Cannon v. University of Chicago]]'' (1979) as a precedent. The Court voted 5–4 that various facts (regarding disparate impact) mentioned in a footnote of ''Cannon'' were not part of the holding of ''Cannon''. The majority also viewed it as significant that §602 of Title VI did not repeat the rights-creating language (race, color, or national origin) in §601.

===Religion clauses===
In 1992, Rehnquist joined ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'''s dissenting opinion that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution only forbids government from preferring one particular religion over another.<ref name="nytimes souter">{{cite news |title=Souter Anchoring the Court's New Center|work=New York Times|date=July 3, 1992|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DE1F3AF930A35754C0A964958260|accessdate=June 27, 2008|first=Linda|last=Greenhouse}}</ref>
Justice Souter wrote a dissent specifically addressed to Rehnquist on this issue in 1992.<ref name="nytimes souter"/>

Rehnquist also led the way in allowing greater state assistance to religious schools, writing for another 5-to-4 majority in ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]''. In ''Zelman'', the Court approved a [[school voucher]] program that aided church schools along with other private schools.

In June 2005, Rehnquist wrote the [[plurality opinion]] upholding the constitutionality of a display of the [[Ten Commandments]] at the Texas state capitol in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The case was ''[[Van Orden v. Perry]]''. Rehnquist wrote:

{{quote|Our cases, [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] like, point in two directions in applying the [[Establishment Clause]]. One face looks toward the strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout our Nation's history.... The other face looks toward the principle that governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom.}}

This decision was joined by Justices Scalia, Thomas, Breyer, and Kennedy.

===First Amendment===
[[University of Chicago Law School]] Professor [[Geoffrey Stone]] explains that Rehnquist was by an impressive margin the member of the Supreme Court least likely to invalidate a law as violating "the freedom of speech, or of the press".<ref name="uchicago1">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/Stonerehnquist.html |title=University of Chicago Law School > News 09.06.2005: Stone Says Rehnquist's Legacy Does not Measure Up |publisher=Law.uchicago.edu |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}</ref> [[Justice Burger]], who was chief justice when Rehnquist started as an associate justice, was 1.8 times more likely to vote in favor of the First Amendment; Scalia, 1.6 times; Thomas, 1.5 times.<ref name="uchicago1"/> Excluding unanimous Court decisions, Rehnquist voted to reject First Amendment claims 92% of the time.<ref name="uchicago1"/> In issues involving freedom of the press, Rehnquist rejected First Amendment claims 100% of the time.<ref name="uchicago1"/> Stone says:

{{quote|There were only three areas in which Rehnquist showed any interest in enforcing the constitutional guarantee of free expression: in cases involving advertising, religious expression, and campaign finance regulation.<ref name="uchicago1"/>}} However, as he did in ''[[Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia]]'', Rehnquist voted against freedom of advertising if an advertisement involved [[birth control]] or abortion.

===Fourteenth Amendment===
Rehnquist wrote a concurrence agreeing to strike down the male-only admissions policy of the [[Virginia Military Institute]], as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.<ref name="US v. Virginia">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=u20026 ''United States v. Virginia''], 518 U.S. 515 (1996)</ref><ref name="justia">{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/518/515/case.html |title=United States v. Virginia – 518 U.S. 515 (1996) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> However, he declined to join the majority opinion's basis for using the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], writing:

{{quote|Had [[Virginia]] made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation.<ref name="justia"/>}}

This rationale supported facilities separated on the basis of gender:

{{quote|It is not the 'exclusion of women' that violates the Equal Protection Clause, but the maintenance of an all-men school without providing any—much less a comparable—institution for women.... It would be a sufficient remedy, I think, if the two institutions offered the same quality of education and were of the same overall caliber.<ref name="justia"/>}}

Rehnquist remained skeptical about the Court's Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence; some of his opinions most favorable to equality resulted from statutory rather than constitutional interpretation. For example, in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'' (1986), Rehnquist established a hostile-environment sexual harassment cause of action under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], including protection against psychological aspects of harassment in the workplace.

==Legacy==

Jeffery Rosen has argued that William Rehnquist's "tactical flexibility was more effective than the rigid purity of Scalia and Thomas."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Jeffery|title=Rehnquist the Great |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/rehnquist-the-great/303820/|date=April 2005}}</ref>
Rosen says:

{{quote|In truth, Rehnquist carefully staked out a limbo between the right and the left and showed that it was a very good place to be. With exceptional efficiency and amiability he led a Court that put the brakes on some of the excesses of the Earl Warren era while keeping pace with the sentiments of a majority of the country—generally siding with economic conservatives and against cultural conservatives. As for judicial temperament, he was far more devoted to preserving tradition and majority rule than the generation of fire-breathing conservatives who followed him. And his administration of the Court was brilliantly if quietly effective, making him one of the most impressive chief justices of the past hundred years.}}

In ''The Partisan: The Life of William Rehnquist'', biographer [[John A. Jenkins]] was critical of Rehnquist's history with racial discrimination. He noted that, as a private citizen, Rehnquist had protested the Court's decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', and as a justice, consistently ruled against racial minorities in [[affirmative action]] cases. Only when white males began to make [[reverse discrimination]] claims, did Rehnquist become sympathetic to equal protection arguments.<ref>''[[Adarand Constructors v. Pena]]'', 515 U.S. 200 (1995); ''[[City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.]]'', 488 U.S. 469 (1989); ''[[Regents v Bakke|Regents of the Univ. of Calif. v. Bakke]]'', 438 U.S. 265 (1978).</ref>

[[Charles Fried]] has described the Rehnquist Court's "project" as being "to reverse not the course of history but the course of constitutional doctrine's abdication to politics".<ref>Fried, Charles (2004). ''Saying What the Law Is: The Constitution in the Supreme Court''. pp. 46–47. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01954-6}}</ref> Legal reporter Jan Greenburg has said that conservative critics noted that the Rehnquist court did little to overturn the left's successes in the lower courts, and in many cases actively furthered them.<ref name="Greenburg1">Greenburg, Jan Crawford. ''Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court''. 2007. Penguin Books. p. 29.</ref>

However, in 2005, law professor [[John Yoo]] wrote: "It is telling to see how many of Rehnquist's views, considered outside the mainstream at the time by professors and commentators, the court has now adopted."<ref name="yoo rehnquist">

==Personal health==
After Rehnquist's death in 2005, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] honored a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request detailing the Bureau's background investigation prior to Rehnquist's nomination as chief justice. The files reveal that for a period, Rehnquist had been addicted to [[Placidyl]], a drug widely prescribed for [[insomnia]]. Placidyl can be addictive, and it was not until he was hospitalized that doctors learned of the depth of his dependency.

Rehnquist was prescribed Placidyl by Dr. Freeman Cary, a physician at the U.S. Capitol, for insomnia and back pain from 1972 through 1981 in doses exceeding the recommended limits. The FBI report concluded, however, that Rehnquist was already taking the drug as early as 1970.<ref name="maurolegaltimes">[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1167818524831 "Rehnquist FBI File Sheds New Light on Drug Dependence, Confirmation Battles"].

There, he underwent a month-long [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]] process.<ref name=MSNBC/> While hospitalized, he had typical [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms, including [[hallucination]]s and [[paranoia]]. For example, "One doctor said Rehnquist thought he heard voices outside his hospital room plotting against him and had 'bizarre ideas and outrageous thoughts', including imagining 'a [[CIA]] plot against him' and seeming to see the design patterns on the hospital curtains change configuration."<ref name="Cooperman">{{cite news |title=Sedative Withdrawal Made Rehnquist Delusional in '81 |last=Cooperman |first=Alan|work=The Washington Post|date=January 5, 2007|page=A01|accessdate=March 15, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/04/AR2007010400140_pf.html}}</ref>

On July 1, 2005, Rehnquist's colleague [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] announced her impending retirement from her position of associate justice, after consulting with Rehnquist and learning that he intended to remain on the Court.

==Replacement as Chief Justice==
Rehnquist's death, just over two months after O'Connor announced her impending retirement, left two vacancies to be filled by President George W. Bush. On September 5, 2005, Bush withdrew the nomination of Judge [[John Roberts]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] to replace O'Connor as associate justice, and instead nominated him to replace Rehnquist as chief justice. Roberts was confirmed by the [[U.S. Senate]] and sworn in as the new chief justice on September 29, 2005. Roberts had [[List of Law Clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States#William Rehnquist 2|clerked]] for Rehnquist in 1980–1981.<ref name="Liptak&Purdum">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/politics/politicsspecial1/31roberts.html |title=As Clerk for Rehnquist, Nominee Stood Out for Conservative Rigor |work=The New York Times  |author=Adam Liptak And Todd S.

==Family life==
Rehnquist's paternal grandparents immigrated separately from [[Sweden]] in 1880. His grandfather Olof Andersson, who changed his surname from the [[patronymic]] Andersson to the [[family name]] Rehnquist, was born in the province of [[Värmland]]; his grandmother was born Adolfina Ternberg in the [[Vreta Kloster|Vreta Kloster parish]] in [[Östergötland]].
