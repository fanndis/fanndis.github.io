'''Scotland Yard''' (officially '''New Scotland Yard''') is a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for the headquarters building of the [[Metropolitan Police]], the [[territorial police force]] responsible for policing all [[London boroughs|32 boroughs of London]], excluding the [[City of London]].

The name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had a rear entrance on a street called [[Great Scotland Yard]].<ref name="definition1">{{cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703105844/http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm |archive-date=2013-07-03 |url-status=dead |title=Metropolitan Police Service – History of the Metropolitan Police Service |publisher=Met.police.uk |access-date=22 March 2017}}</ref> The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance to the police station, and over time the street and the Metropolitan Police became synonymous. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in 1964 that, just as [[Wall Street]] gave its name to New York's financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London.<ref name=Farnsworth>{{cite news |last=Farnsworth |first=Clyde H. |title=Move is planned by Scotland Yard |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 May 1964 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/15/move-is-planned-by-scotland-yard.html |access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref> This building was acquired by [[hypermarket]]s operator [[Lulu Hypermarket|Lulu Group International]] in 2015 and redeveloped into a luxury hotel, operated by [[Hyatt]], which opened in December 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/new-great-scotland-yard-hotel-a4308561.html |title=First look: Scotland Yard hotel opens after revamp |last=Ackerman |first=Naomi |date=2019-12-09 |website=[[Evening Standard]] |access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/england-united-kingdom/great-scotland-yard/lhrub |title=Great Scotland Yard Hotel |publisher=[[Hyatt]] |access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>

The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the [[Victoria Embankment]], and the name "New Scotland Yard" was adopted for the new headquarters.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Soho: The Windmill Years 1932-1964 |ISBN=978-1-445-60684-2 |page=104}}</ref> An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) moved its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed building on [[Broadway, London|Broadway]] in [[Victoria, London|Victoria]]. In summer 2013, it was announced that the force would move to the [[Curtis Green Building]] – which is the third building of New Scotland Yard's previous site (1890–1967) – and that the headquarters would be renamed Scotland Yard.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Metropolitan Police HQ announced as Curtis Green Building |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22593003 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 May 2013 |access-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> In November 2016, MPS moved to its new headquarters, which continues to bear the name of "New Scotland Yard".<ref name=MetroPoliceStaffMove/><ref name=RoyalOpeningPostponed/>

==History==
[[File:Old "New Scotland Yard", Westminster - geograph.org.uk - 1600086.jpg|thumb|The original New Scotland Yard, now called the [[Norman Shaw Buildings]]; at the far right is the Curtis Green Building, which became New Scotland Yard in November 2016]]
The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] is responsible for law enforcement within [[Greater London]], excluding the square mile of the [[City of London]], which is covered by the [[City of London Police]], and the [[London Underground]] and [[National Rail]] networks, which are the responsibility of the [[British Transport Police]].

===4 Whitehall Place===
The Metropolitan Police was formed by [[Robert Peel]] with the implementation of the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829|Metropolitan Police Act]], passed by Parliament in 1829.<ref name="definition1"/> Peel, with the help of [[Eugène-François Vidocq]], selected the original site on Whitehall Place for the new police headquarters. The first two [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|commissioner]]s, [[Charles Rowan]] and [[Richard Mayne]], along with various police officers and staff, occupied the building. Previously a private house, 4 Whitehall Place ({{coord|51.50598|-0.12609|display=inline|region:GB_scale:2000|name=Original Scotland Yard - 4 Whitehall Place}}) backed onto a street called [[Great Scotland Yard]].
===Victoria Embankment===
By 1887, the Metropolitan Police headquarters had expanded from 4 Whitehall Place into several neighbouring addresses, including 3, 5, 21 and 22 Whitehall Place; 8 and 9 Great Scotland Yard, and several stables.<ref name="definition1"/> Eventually, the service outgrew its original site, and new headquarters designed by architect [[Richard Norman Shaw]] were built ({{coord|51.50222|-0.12463|display=inline|region:GB_scale:2000|name=New Scotland Yard - Norman Shaw North Building (second location)}}) on the Victoria Embankment, overlooking the [[River Thames]], south of what is now the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s headquarters. In 1888, during the construction of the new building, workers discovered the dismembered torso of a female; the case, known as the '[[Whitehall Mystery]]', was never solved. In 1890, police headquarters moved to the new location, which was named New Scotland Yard. By this time, the Metropolitan Police had grown from its initial 1,000 officers to about 13,000 and needed more administrative staff and a bigger headquarters. Further increases in the size and responsibilities of the force required even more administrators and space. Therefore, new buildings were constructed and completed in 1906 and 1940, so that New Scotland Yard became a three-building complex. ({{coord|51.50183|-0.12446|display=inline|region:GB_scale:2000|name=Norman Shaw South Building (extension to New Scotland Yard)}}). The first two buildings are now a Grade I [[listed building|listed structure]] known as the [[Norman Shaw Buildings]].

The original building at 4 Whitehall Place still has a rear entrance on Great Scotland Yard. Stables for some of the [[Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch|mounted branch]] are still located at 7 Great Scotland Yard, across the street from the first headquarters.

===10 Broadway===
[[File:New Scotland Yard, Broadway.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|The former New Scotland Yard building in Victoria Street]]
The headquarters of the Metropolitan Police were moved to 8-10 Broadway in 1967, in a new building constructed on a site that also bordered onto Victoria Street.

In 2008, the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]] (MPA) bought the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] of 10 Broadway for around £120 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Metropolitan Police to sell New Scotland Yard |author=Justin Davenport |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/metropolitan-police-to-sell-new-scotland-yard-8252711.html |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=30 October 2012 |access-date=26 May 2013}}</ref>

10 Broadway was sold to the [[Abu Dhabi Financial Group]] in December 2014 for £370 million, and redevelopment plans for a six-building, mixed-use development were approved in February 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last=Curry |first=Rhiannon |date=24 February 2016 |title=Green light to demolish New Scotland Yard to make way for flats |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/02/24/green-light-to-demolish-new-scotland-yard-to-make-way-for-flats/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref> Ownership was officially passed from the MPA to the Abu Dhabi Financial Group when the relocation was completed on 31 October 2016;<ref name=MetroPoliceStaffMove/> the building began demolition later that year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rowlinson |first=Liz |date=18 October 2019 |title=Prime property buyers return to Westminster |url=https://www.ft.com/content/1db2c99a-ee79-11e9-a55a-30afa498db1b |work=[[Financial Times]] |location=London |access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref>

In May 2013 the Metropolitan Police confirmed that the New Scotland Yard building on Broadway would be sold and the force's headquarters would be moved back to the [[Curtis Green Building]] on the Victoria Embankment. A competition was announced for architects to redesign the building prior to the Metropolitan Police moving to it in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Met confirms Scotland Yard to be sold |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/met-confirms-scotland-yard-to-be-sold/story-fn3dxix6-1226647232424 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=20 May 2013 |access-date=26 May 2013}}</ref> This building previously housed the Territorial Policing headquarters and is adjacent to the original New Scotland Yard (Norman Shaw North Building).
