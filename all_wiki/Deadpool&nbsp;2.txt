'''''Deadpool 2''''' is a 2018 American <!-- Please do not add "comedy" or any other genres here. We use the most general category for the lead.-->[[superhero film]] based upon the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Deadpool]]. It is the eleventh installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], and is the [[sequel]] to 2016's ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]''. The film was directed by [[David Leitch]] from a screenplay by [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Ryan Reynolds]], who stars in the title role alongside [[Josh Brolin]], [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Julian Dennison]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Brianna Hildebrand]], and [[Jack Kesy]]. In the film, Deadpool forms the [[X-Force]] to protect a young mutant from the time-traveling soldier [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

Plans for a sequel to ''Deadpool'' began before the original film's release, and were confirmed in February 2016. Though the original creative team of Reynolds, Reese, Wernick, and director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] were quickly set to return for the second film, Miller left the project in October 2016 due to creative differences with Reynolds and was soon replaced by Leitch. An extensive casting search took place to fill the role of Cable, with Brolin ultimately cast. Filming took place in [[British Columbia]] from June to October 2017. The film is dedicated to stuntwoman [[Joi Harris|Joi "SJ" Harris]], who died in a motorcycle accident during filming.

''Deadpool 2'' was released in the United States on May 18, 2018 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film outgrossed its predecessor, earning over $785&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the highest-grossing film in the ''X-Men'' series, as well as the [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|highest-grossing R-rated film]], until ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' surpassed it the following year. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor, cast performances, story and action sequences. Some critics considered it better than the first film, but others criticized its tone and script. A [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13-rated version]] of the film, titled ''[[#Once Upon a Deadpool|Once Upon a Deadpool]]'', was released on December 12, 2018 to mixed reviews. With the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of]] [[21st Century Fox]] by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], a third ''Deadpool'' film is being developed by [[Marvel Studios]].

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
After fighting organized crime as the wisecracking mercenary [[Deadpool]] for two years, Wade Wilson fails to kill one of his targets on his anniversary with his girlfriend [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]. That night, after the pair decides to start a family together, the target tracks Wade down and inadvertently kills Vanessa. Wade kills all but one of the men in revenge, before pulling them both into the path of an oncoming truck. Blaming himself for Vanessa's death, he attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wade has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but remains alive due to his healing abilities and his body is put back together by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Wade is left with only a [[Skee-Ball]] token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa.

Recovering at the [[X-Mansion]], Wade reluctantly agrees to join the [[X-Men]] because he believes Vanessa would have wanted him to. He, Colossus, and [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins / Firefist]] at an orphanage, labeled a "[[Conversion therapy|Mutant Re-education Center]]". Realizing that Russell has been abused by the orphanage staff, Deadpool kills one of the staff members before being restrained by Colossus, and both Wade and Russell are arrested. Fitted with power-suppressing collars, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], a cybernetic soldier from the future, travels back in time to kill Russell.

Cable storms the Ice Box and attacks Russell. Wade, whose collar breaks in the ensuing melee, attempts to defend Russell. After Cable takes Vanessa's token, Wade forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Russell overhears Wade deny that he cares for the young mutant in order to protect him. Near death again, Wade has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Russell. Deadpool organizes a team called [[X-Force]] to break Russell out of a prison-transfer convoy and defend him from Cable. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachute, but all members die during the landing except for Deadpool and the lucky [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. While they fight Cable, Russell frees fellow inmate [[Juggernaut (comics)|the Juggernaut]], who agrees to help Russell kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, rips Deadpool in half, and escapes alongside Russell.

While recovering, Cable offers to work with Wade and Domino to stop Russell from killing the headmaster; in the future, Russell succeeds in killing the headmaster and becomes a [[serial killer]], eventually burning Cable's family alive. Wade accepts on condition that Cable give him a chance to talk Russell down. At the orphanage, they are overpowered by the Juggernaut while Russell pursues the headmaster until Colossus, who had at first refused to help due to Deadpool's murderous ways, arrives to distract the Juggernaut. When Deadpool fails to placate Russell, Cable shoots at the young mutant. Deadpool leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Ice Box collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing this sacrifice, Russell does not kill the headmaster, which changes the future so that Cable's family now survives. Cable uses the last charge on his time-traveling device, which he needed to return to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token in front of Wade's heart. Now when Deadpool takes the bullet for Russell, it is stopped by the token and both survive, while Russell still has his change of heart. Afterward, the headmaster is run over and killed by Wade's friend and taxi driver [[Dopinder]].

In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits sequence]], Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her girlfriend [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]] repair Cable's time-traveling device for Deadpool. He uses it to save the lives of Vanessa and X-Force member Peter, and kills both ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''{{'}}s version of Deadpool and actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] while he is considering starring in the film ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''.<!-- WP:FILMPLOT, please do not add details not included in Theatrical release version. -->

[[File:Deadpool 2 Japan Premiere Red Carpet Ryan Reynolds (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Reynolds at the [[Tokyo]] premiere of the film]]
* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]: <br />A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation.<ref name="GreenLight" /> He forms the X-Force, a team of mutants,<ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /> after finding himself at his "lowest point" at the beginning of the film.<ref name="Fridging" /> The film makes several references to Deadpool's [[pansexuality]] after the first film was criticized for ignoring it.<ref name="LGBTQ" /> As a co-writer on the film, Reynolds ad-libbed much of his dialogue throughout the production process.<ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" /> For the film's mid-credits sequence, [[archive footage]] of Reynolds portraying Deadpool in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' is used, and Reynolds also portrays himself before he acted in the film ''Green Lantern''.<ref name="MidCredits" />
* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]: <br />A [[Time travel in fiction|time-traveling]] cybernetic soldier, "in many ways the opposite of Deadpool".<ref name="Brolin" /> Director [[David Leitch]] called the dynamic between Cable and Deadpool "sort of classic buddy-cop fare", and compared them to the characters portrayed by [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Eddie Murphy]], respectively, in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).<ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /> Leitch added that the character as written in the script was mostly just an "action character", and he relied on Brolin to add nuance to the role and explore the character's internal pain to avoid it becoming a caricature.<ref name="LeitchTHRMay2018" /> Brolin signed a four-film deal to play the character,<ref name="Brolin" /> and described his appearance here as just the introduction for the character, with "three more movies to reveal more".<ref name="BrolinOct2017" />
* [[Morena Baccarin]] as [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]: <br />Wilson's fiancée.<ref name="Baccarin" /> The character is killed at the beginning of the film in an example of "[[women in Refrigerators|fridging]]"—the killing of a female character to forward the development of a male character. This happens to Cable's wife and daughter as motivation for his story arc as well. Leitch and the writers said they were unaware of the term "fridging", and that they were not being "consciously sexist". Earlier versions of the film simply had Vanessa breaking up with Wilson, but the writers wanted to use the opportunity to "engender great suffering for him by having his line of work be the thing that costs Vanessa her life". They were also more comfortable with the deaths due to the increased number of strong female characters in the film, and because the deaths are reversed by the end of the film with time travel; screenwriter [[Rhett Reese]] stated, "Maybe that's a sexist thing. I don't know. And maybe some women will have an issue with that. I don't know. I don't think that that'll be a large concern, but it didn't even really occur to us."<ref name="Fridging" /> Baccarin said she trusted the storyline was necessary for the film, and emphasized the fact that Vanessa is saved at the end of the film.<ref name="BaccarinPremiereTHR" />
* [[Julian Dennison]] as [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins / Firefist]]: <br />A young mutant with pyrokinesis who is being hunted by Cable.<ref name="Dennison" /><ref name="Firefist" /> Reynolds insisted on casting Dennison after seeing him in ''[[Hunt for the Wilderpeople]]'' (2016),<ref name="Firefist" /> with the character "tailor-made" for him, and no other actors considered for the role.<ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /> The character is considered a villain for much of the film,<ref name="Juggernaut" /> which Leitch thought was an "interesting take on the whole angle of the villain".<ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /> Dennison felt the role was particularly special because, being "chubby", he would watch superhero films and "never see anyone like me. I am excited to be that for other kids who look like me."<ref name="DennisonRepresentation" />
:*[[Sala Baker]] as Older Firefist, who appears in Cable's future.<ref name="Baker" />
* [[Zazie Beetz]] as [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]: <br />A mercenary with the mutant ability to manipulate [[luck]],<ref name="Beetz" /><ref name="DominoCasting" /> who joins Deadpool's X-Force team.<ref name="Tan" /> Leitch described the film's version of the character as Beetz' own "real fun interesting take",<ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /> with the actress interpreting the character as an only child who forms a "sibling sort of relationship" with Deadpool, with "that back-and-forth banter where she is not dealing with his".<ref name="TheStarWomen" /> Beetz began "working out everyday" when she got the role, which required her to shoot guns and use "full body" physicality,<ref name="BeetzMay2017" /> and chose not to shave her armpits to match the changing perception of the practice among the general public and to prove that it is "not something that is gross or shameful".<ref name="BeetzArmpits" />
* [[T.J. Miller]] as [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]:<br> Wilson's best friend and the owner of a bar frequented by mercenaries.<ref name="TJMiller" />
* [[Brianna Hildebrand]] as [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]: <br />A teenage [[X-Men|X-Man]] with the mutant power to detonate atomic bursts from her body,<ref name="KapicicHildebrand" /> she is now a "new level of X-Men" after being a trainee in the first film.<ref name="LiefeldKapicicTeaser" /> Hildebrand felt that "it's cool that she's grown and matured and she still has so much of this essence of a punk kid" from the first film, and added that the character would have a "cooler" costume in the sequel.<ref name="HildebrandMar2017"/> The filmmakers intended to have Hildebrand shave her head to indicate that her abilities burned off her hair, but she was unable to do so due to a television series commitment.<ref name="HildebrandFandomMay2018"/> The film also reveals that Negasonic is in a same-sex relationship, which is the first openly [[LGBTQ]] relationship depicted in a Marvel film.<ref name="LGBTQ" /> When Reynolds asked Hildebrand how she felt about the potential storyline during development, the actress—a member of the LGBTQ community herself—responded positively with the stipulation that the film not make "a big deal" about the relationship.<ref name="HildebrandTooFabMay2018" /> In a statement, [[GLAAD]] President and CEO [[Sarah Kate Ellis]] praised the relationship as "a milestone in a genre that too often renders LGBTQ people invisible, and should send a message to other studios to follow this example of inclusive and smart storytelling".<ref name="GLAADStatement"/>
* [[Jack Kesy]] as [[Black Tom Cassidy]]: <br />A mutant inmate of the facility where Deadpool and Firefist are imprisoned.<ref name="Kesy"/> He was originally written as a more prominent antagonist, who would have acted as a "devil on Firefist's shoulder", but it was reduced after the writers decided that there were too many antagonists in the story, and that the budget would be better spent on a character such as [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref name="ReducedBlackTom"/>

In addition to portraying Deadpool and himself, Reynolds provided the voice for the Juggernaut. Juggernaut is credited as being voiced by "himself", and was previously portrayed by [[Vinnie Jones]] in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. According to Reese, the creative team on ''Deadpool 2'' felt that appearance did not do justice to the character. Wanting an additional villain for the film to support Firefist for the final fight with X-Force, the writers chose Juggernaut because he is "a force of nature [who] was probably the coolest character never to be used ... in the right way".<ref name="Juggernaut"/> The character's face was modeled on Leitch's, with Reynolds providing [[Facial motion capture|facial capture]] and his voice.<ref name="ColossusJuggernautFight"/> The latter was digitally modulated to make it deeper. Reese added that the character "didn't have many lines, he's a man of few words, but he's a man of great anger and forcefulness".<ref name="Juggernaut"/>

[[Stefan Kapičić]] voices [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], an X-Men with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel.<ref name="KapicicHildebrand" /> Kapičić described Colossus as one of the most important characters in the film, requiring a more intense process for Kapičić during recording for the character. He explained that Colossus would continue to try make Deadpool a better person and potential X-Men after doing so in the first film.<ref name="KapicicCableTrailer" /> Unlike the first film, Kapičić also provided performance capture for the character's face on the sequel, while [[Andre Tricoteux]] returned to stand-in for the character on set.<ref name="KapicicTHRMay2018" /> [[Leslie Uggams]] and [[Karan Soni]] also return from the first film as Deadpool's elderly roommate [[Blind Al]] and the taxi driver [[Dopinder]], respectively.<ref name="Uggams" /><ref name="Soni" /> Additionally, [[Eddie Marsan]] plays the headmaster of the [[Mister Sinister|Essex]] Home for Mutant Rehabilitation, an orphanage;<ref name="Marsan" /><ref name="Essex" /> [[Robert Maillet]] briefly appears as Sluggo, an inmate of the Ice Box who originally had a more prominent antagonistic role alongside Black Tom before both roles were reduced due to the number of villains in the film;<ref name="Maillet" /><ref name="CutMutants" /> [[Hayley Sales]] and Islie Hirvonen respectively appear as Cable's wife and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]], their daughter, during a flashforward;<ref name="CableWife&Daughter" /> and [[Shiori Kutsuna]] portrays [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend and fellow X-Men.<ref name="Kutsuna" /><ref name="Yukio" /> A version of Yukio previously appeared in the 2013 film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'', portrayed by [[Rila Fukushima]].<ref name="YukioWolverine" /> The film's version of the X-Force team also includes [[Terry Crews]] as [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]],<ref name="CableTrailer" /><ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /> [[Lewis Tan]] as [[Shatterstar]],<ref name="Tan" /> [[Bill Skarsgård]] as [[Zeitgeist (comics)|Zeitgeist]],<ref name="Skarsgard" /> [[Rob Delaney]] as Peter,<ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /> and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Vanisher]]. Pitt was considered for the role of Cable before scheduling issues prevented him from taking it; he filmed his Vanisher cameo in two hours during post-production.<ref name="RTCameos" />

Reprising their roles as the X-Men for a brief cameo are [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X]], [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].<ref name="X-MenCameos" /><ref name="X-MenCameosList" /> Archive footage of [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film series character)|Logan / Wolverine]] from ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' is used in the mid-credits sequence, with Jackman's permission. This was re-edited for the sequence, and included raw footage shot for that film.<ref name="MidCredits" /> Luke Roessler, who portrays a young [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]] in the ''X-Men'' based television series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', appears as a young mutant credited as "Cereal Kid".<ref name="LegionCrossover?" /> When Cable travels to the present day, he comes across two "rednecks" discussing a toilet paper manifesto. This was inspired by a real manifesto written by Reese, which the writers wanted to be discussed in the film by a certain "calibre" of actor: the characters are portrayed by [[Alan Tudyk]] and a disguised [[Matt Damon]], with the latter credited as "Dickie Greenleaf" (a reference to the 1999 film ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' in which Damon stars).<ref name="RTCameos" /><ref name="Damon" /> Leitch and writers Reese and [[Paul Wernick]] respectively cameo as Ice Box inmate "Ground Chuck Mutant", a news helicopter pilot, and a news cameraman.<ref name="RTCameos" /> [[Stan Lee]] was unable to cameo in the sequel, as he did in the first film and the short ''[[No Good Deed (2017 film)|No Good Deed]]'', but his likeness was used for a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] in the X-Mansion and for graffiti on a wall.<ref name="WritersTHRMay2018" /><ref name="LeitchColliderMay2018" />

==Production==
===Development===
Producer [[Simon Kinberg]] revealed in September 2015 that discussions had begun regarding ideas for a sequel to ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', which was set to be released in February 2016. One idea was for the film to introduce the character [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who had previously been looked at to appear in the first ''Deadpool'' and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) before that.<ref name="KinbergColliderSep2015" /> Cable's inclusion in the potential sequel was confirmed by the character Deadpool while breaking the [[fourth wall]] in the [[post-credit scene]] of the first film. [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], a character with connections to Cable in the comics, was also believed to be featured in the sequel.<ref name="DominoRumor" /> By the first film's release, [[20th Century Fox]] had green-lit a sequel, with writers [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]] returning to write the screenplay. Though director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] and producer/star [[Ryan Reynolds]] were not confirmed for the sequel at the time, Fox was "intent on keeping the creative team together".<ref name="GreenLight" /> Miller and Reynolds' involvement was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon that April,<ref name="CinemaCon2016" /> though Miller had still not formally signed on to direct the sequel. He began work developing the script with the writers, while Reynolds had signed a new contract granting him "casting approval and other creative controls".<ref name="MillerExit2" />

{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=It has to tonally and stylistically be as fresh and original [as the first film]. That's a big challenge especially because they had 10 years to gestate on the first movie and we don't have that kind of time on the second movie. That's the biggest mandate [for the sequel] ... we have to resist the temptation to make it bigger.|source=—Producer Simon Kinberg on approaching ''Deadpool 2''<ref name="EWDec2016" />}}
In June 2016, Kinberg expected filming to begin at the beginning of 2017.<ref name="KinbergColliderJun2016" /> By August, [[Kyle Chandler]] was believed to be in the running to portray Cable.<ref name="Chandler" /> Testing of actresses for Domino had also begun by October, with the shortlist of actresses under consideration including [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Sofia Boutella]], [[Stephanie Sigman]], [[Sylvia Hoeks]], [[Mackenzie Davis]], [[Ruby Rose]], [[Eve Hewson]], and [[Kelly Rohrbach]].<ref name="DominoCasting" /> The producers were particularly interested in casting a black or Latina actress in the role.<ref name="Beetz" />

At the end of October, Miller left the film over "mutual creative differences" with Reynolds,<ref name="MillerExit" /> reportedly based on several factors, including Reynolds' expanded creative control over the sequel; Miller's wish for a more stylized follow-up than the first film, versus Reynolds' focus "on the raunchy comedy style that earned the first movie its R rating"; and Miller's intention to cast Chandler as Cable, which Reynolds opposed. Fox ultimately backed "its marketable star" over Miller, who had made his [[directorial debut]] with the first film.<ref name="MillerExit2" /> Miller denied this report,<ref name="MillerResponse" /> while Reynolds said he could only add that "I'm sad to see him off the film. Tim's brilliant and nobody worked harder on ''Deadpool'' than he did."<ref name="ReynoldsResponseMiller" /> Miller's plans for the film included introducing the young mutant [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and a comic book accurate portrayal of Cable, having [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]] embrace her Copycat persona from the comics, and featuring a fight between [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]. The latter is a member of the [[Fantastic Four]], and the studio had approved crossing the character over from that franchise before Miller's exit.<ref name="MillerOriginalPlans" /> A week after Miller's departure, Fox was looking at [[David Leitch]], [[Drew Goddard]], Magnus Martens, and [[Rupert Sanders]] as potential replacements for the director.<ref name="DeadlineOct2016" /><ref name="LeitchConfirmed" /> Leitch was the "strong frontrunner" for the role,<ref name="MashableLeitch" /> and signed on a month later.<ref name="LeitchConfirmed" /> Reynolds, a fan of Leitch's ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]'', said the director "really understands those ''Deadpool'' sensibilities and where we need to take the franchise", and "can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it was shot for 10–15 times what it cost".<ref name="EWDec2016" />

=== Writing ===
The first completed draft from Wernick and Reese was expected around June 2016;<ref name="KinbergColliderJun2016" /> multiple had been completed by January 2017.<ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017" /> The pair felt a responsibility to explore the team [[X-Force]], which includes Deadpool, Cable, and Domino in the comics, but to also keep the film focused on Deadpool.<ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017XForce" /><ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017" /> By the next month, the studio was still not happy with the script, with Reynolds and the writers "bunkered down ... trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to make". Goddard joined them as a consultant.<ref name="Goddard" /> Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds were credited for the script, the three having split the film's scenes between them before passing them around to be re-written by the others. Reese felt they were able to maintain "one voice" because of their long history with the character during development on the first film.<ref name="WritersTHRMay2018" />

''Deadpool 2'' is set "more or less" when the first film ends, and focuses on "an existential crisis and a deeply personal cause" for Deadpool. Leitch felt that retaining these personal stakes was more compelling for audiences than trying to build the film around global stakes.<ref name="NYTMay2018" /> The writers felt that the sequel was tonally similar to the first film, but wanted to explore a different theme by focusing on a group of individuals (X-Force) and their need for family,<ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" /> with Reynolds explaining that "the first movie is a love story masquerading as a comic-book movie, and this one is kind of a family film masquerading as a comic-book film again." Deadpool spends around half of the film unmasked, which the writers wanted for exploring the more emotional scenes, though Reynolds was reluctant to do this because he found the make-up required to portray an unmasked Deadpool "time consuming and really uncomfortable".<ref name="WritersTHRMay2018" /> An early idea was to have the film begin five years after the first and explore Deadpool being a father, but the writers quickly decided that this was "never, ever going to work" and reworked the idea to explore the character wanting to have a child but being unable to.<ref name="ReynoldsEWDad" />

Earlier versions of the script included prominent roles for the characters [[Black Tom Cassidy]] and Sluggo, but they ultimately had a supporting role and a brief appearance, respectively. The villain [[Mister X (Marvel Comics)|Mr. X]] was also included in early drafts, but was cut due to the number of villains already in the film. The mutant inmates of the Ice Box were going to be explored more by having Cable breaking into the prison cause their power dampening collars to malfunction. This was removed from the script due to not being feasible within the film's budget.<ref name="CutMutants" /> Leitch fought to include more aspects of Cable's backstory in the film after the writers chose to mostly ignore it due to it being convoluted;<ref name="Leitch/FilmMay20182" /><ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017Cable" /> a painting of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] which would have acknowledged that character as Cable's father was ultimately cut, but the [[Techno-Organic Virus]] that Cable is inflicted with and his daughter [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] are depicted.<ref name="Leitch/FilmMay20182" /> The film features contradictory connections to the various films of the franchise, which Leitch acknowledged as confusing but said that the issue had not really been discussed during development since the ''Deadpool'' films are considered their own "entity" in a way, and the character of Deadpool allows them to be "flexible with the timeline, per se".<ref name="LeitchTimeline" />

Reese and Wernick preferred to use jokes in the film that only certain members of the audience would understand, though Reynolds would not allow some to be used if he thought not enough people would enjoy them (including a reference to golfer [[Davis Love III]]).<ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" /> Following the announcement of the [[proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] in December 2017, the film includes several Disney related jokes including a [[running gag]] about the Disney film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' (2013). However, Fox did make the producers remove a joke from the film that directly acknowledged the deal, which Reynolds said "was a wise decision".<ref name="DisneyJokes" /> Other cut jokes included many "bizarre" characters interviewing to join the X-Force, such as an idea to have [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] reprise his role as the [[Human Torch]] from the ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' films.<ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" />

===Pre-production===
Reese and Wernick confirmed in January 2017 that [[Stefan Kapičić]]'s [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Brianna Hildebrand]]'s [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]], and [[Karan Soni]]'s Dopinder would be returning from the first film to "make at least an appearance".<ref name="KapicicHildebrand" /><ref name="Soni" /> By the beginning of March 2017, [[Michael Shannon]] had been in the running to portray Cable, but no longer could due to a scheduling conflict.<ref name="ShannonCollider" /> [[David Harbour]] had screen-tested for the role,<ref name="Harbour" /> and [[Pierce Brosnan]] was believed to be in negotiations for a part in the film, potentially Cable.<ref name="Brosnan" /> Reynolds announced shortly after that [[Zazie Beetz]] had been cast as Domino.<ref name="Beetz" /> Shannon was in the running to portray Cable again later in the month, and was considered the frontrunner ahead of a shortlist that also included Harbour.<ref name="ShannonFrontrunner" /> [[Brad Pitt]] was also considered for the role, but had "moved on".<ref name="Pitt" /> Leitch soon addressed the potential casting of these actors, saying Shannon "would make an incredible Cable ... If that happens, I would be through the roof";<ref name="LeitchShannon" /> and on Pitt, "We had a great meeting with Brad, he was incredibly interested in the property. Things didn't work out schedule-wise [but] I think he would've made an amazing Cable."<ref name="LeitchPitt" /> At the end of March, [[Morena Baccarin]] confirmed her return from the first film as [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]], and expressed interest in exploring the character's Copycat persona from the comics in the sequel.<ref name="Baccarin" /> [[Josh Brolin]] emerged as a "surprise contender" to play Cable in April, ahead of Shannon and Harbour, and was officially cast in the role. Brolin also portrays the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thanos]], in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name="Brolin" />

Also in April, [[Leslie Uggams]] confirmed that she would be reprising her role of [[Blind Al]] from the first film,<ref name="Uggams" /> while Fox gave the sequel a June 1, 2018 release date.<ref name="ReleaseDate" /> Noting the release date, Leitch wanted to ensure that the film "was worthy of a summer tentpole movie, and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films", specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film "bigger" than the first one. However, he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original "in terms of the tone, and the fun ... I love that challenge" of combining that with the increased scope. The film uses Deadpool's fourth wall-breaking to reference this release period, with Leitch calling these comments "definitely fresh and timely when they come up".<ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /> In May 2017, Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of ''Deadpool 2'' to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds, Brolin, and Beetz in an ''X-Force'' film. Casting for the characters—[[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], and [[Shatterstar]]—would take place over the coming months, though Reese denied the accuracy of this report.<ref name="XForce3" /> Later, [[T.J. Miller]] confirmed that he would return from the first film as [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]], and described the sequel as "even more weaselicious" than the first. He noted that Reynolds and the writers had "really put the time in on the script" to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans.<ref name="TJMiller" /> [[Jack Kesy]] also joined the cast, as [[Black Tom Cassidy]].<ref name="Kesy" /> In June, [[Shioli Kutsuna]] was cast in a key role for the film,<ref name="Kutsuna" /> Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]]. The writers felt free to use the character in whatever way the film needed due to her having only a minor role in the comics.<ref name="Yukio" />

===Filming===
[[File:Rivervieweastlawn.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam served as the location for the initial and final battle scenes.]]

Initial filming had begun by June 17, 2017, at [[Hatley Park National Historic Site#Hatley Castle and Gardens|Hatley Castle]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada, which is used to portray the [[X-Mansion]] in the ''X-Men'' films.<ref name="HatleyFilming" /> [[Principal photography]] began in [[Vancouver]], on June 26, under the [[working title]] ''Love Machine''.<ref name="ProductionDates" /><ref name="WorkingTitle" /><ref name="Sela" /> The East Lawn building of [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]] in [[Coquitlam]] served as the location for the initial and final battle sequences.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cleugh, Janis |url=https://www.tricitynews.com/news/we-are-fully-booked-bc-housing-says-of-riverview-filming-action-1.23328358 |title=We are fully booked, BC Housing says of Riverview filming action |work=Tricitynews.com |date=June 7, 2018 |access-date=November 26, 2018}}</ref> [[Jonathan Sela]] served as cinematographer for the film.<ref name="Sela" /> At the end of June, Reynolds revealed that [[Julian Dennison]] had been cast in the film.<ref name="Dennison" /> The next month, T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than the first film, and that "it's not going to be the same movie in a different location [like ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'']. It's got different stakes, different things happen, some pretty tragic, dark shit happens in the first part of the film, in the beginning, and the rest of the film is kind of dealing with that."<ref name="MillerJul2017" /> By then, Kapičić had been working with Leitch on set, and expected to continue contributing to Colossus through to April 2018.<ref name="KapicicJul2017" /> Production on the ''X-Men'' film ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' was taking place in [[Montreal]] concurrently with the filming of ''Deadpool 2'', with Kinberg directing that film. He directed a brief moment where the X-Men are seen through an open door in the X-Mansion, which was added to ''Deadpool 2'' with the aid of green screen to allow those characters to appear in this film.<ref name="X-MenCameos" />

Leitch worked closely with Sela, the pair having previously collaborated on Leitch's earlier films, to acknowledge the aesthetic of the first film while expanding the look of the sequel to match the new situations and characters introduced. The pair created specific shot lists and plans for blocking out scenes before they arrived on set, and were very particular about the colors they used; they planned the color palette of the entire film, and also produced color wheels detailing specific palettes for each set piece. These color wheels were sometimes adjusted several days into the filming of a sequence after [[digital intermediate]] work revealed a different look than Leitch and Sela had been anticipating. Elements that were carried over from the first film included the "moodiness" and saturation of scenes set in Deadpool's apartment, and the contrast with blacks in action sequences, while Cable's future had a new aesthetic unlike anything in the first film. Another example of these color wheels was the sequence in which Firefist is introduced, with Leitch taking advantage of the scene being set during day to overemphasize the lighting and create a general sepia/orange tone that represented the fire abilities the character displays. This aesthetic met the storytelling needs of the scene as well as the practicalities of the filmmaking process.<ref name="Leitch/FilmMay2018" /> Because the film was shot digitally, Sela worked with Vantage Film to develop custom lenses that created the "texture and flavor" he wanted for it where he otherwise would have manipulated the exposure and development of film stock to achieve the same effect.<ref name="SelaVarietyApr2018" />

[[File:Shaw Tower 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|An accident during filming on location at Shaw Tower in Vancouver caused the death of stunt woman [[Joi Harris|Joi "SJ" Harris]].]]

On August 14, stunt woman [[Joi Harris|Joi "SJ" Harris]] died in a motorcycle accident after losing control and crashing into [[Shaw Tower (Vancouver)|Shaw Tower]]. Harris was working on the film as a stunt performer for the first time and had only joined the production a week before. Harris was not wearing a helmet because the character she was portraying, Domino, does not wear one in the scene, and there had not been time since she joined the film to create one for her to fit underneath the Domino wig. She had two full days of rehearsing the stunt as well as five more attempts on the day of the accident.<ref name="StuntWomanDeath" /><ref name="ProductionRestart" /> Veteran stunt double Melissa Stubbs had been available and willing to do the stunt, but the inexperienced Harris was preferred due to her skin color being a match for Beetz. This decision was criticized by multiple stunt professionals, with many noting that Harris' experiences racing motorcycles did not necessarily qualify her as an able stunt performer.<ref name="HarrisTHR" /> Production was shut down immediately after the incident, but resumed two days later. With this news also came reports that the film's crew were "enduring very long hours" and were "exhausted by the schedule", with the studio confirming that some days had increased from the scheduled 12–13 hours filming to over 15 hours.<ref name="StuntWomanDeath" /><ref name="ProductionRestart" /> The film's credits includes a dedication to the stuntwoman that reads "In memory of Sequana Harris".<ref name="HarrisDedication" />

Earlier in August, Reynolds revealed that [[Rob Delaney]] was at the film's set,<ref name="Delaney" /> and [[Eddie Marsan]] revealed later in the month that he was also on set for a role in the film.<ref name="Marsan" /> Filming in Vancouver was expected to last until October 6,<ref name="ProductionDates" /> with production on ''Deadpool 2'' being officially completed on October 14.<ref name="FilmingEnds" /> Discussing the film's action, having previously worked as a stunt coordinator, Leitch said that all stunts are "variations on a theme" with the same basic elements, but Deadpool allows you to "subvert those basics, and there's an expectation for a classic gag, but oops, maybe you get something else". He also felt that introducing Domino gave the film unique opportunities for action sequences taking advantage of her luck-based abilities, as well as focusing on Deadpool's healing abilities and trying to use those interestingly.<ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /> Darrin Prescott served as second-unit director on the film,<ref name="Prescott" /> and Jonathan Eusebio was the stunt-coordinator for the film,<ref name="Eusebio" /> both having worked on ''John Wick'' previously.<ref name="Prescott" /><ref name="Eusebio" /> Domino's abilities were envisioned as a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] "on steroids", while Deadpool allowing his arm to be broken during a fight was an example of his abilities being used.<ref name="Leitch/FilmMay2018" /> Unlike the first film, for which Fox was unwilling to pay for the writers to be on set,<ref name="ReynoldsPayWritersD1" /> the studio did pay for Reese and Wernick to be on set for the sequel. Leitch was happy for this to happen, Reynolds wanted them to be there, and it allowed the pair to continue contributing to the script and suggest new jokes and ideas throughout the filming process.<ref name="WritersEsquireMay2018" />
[[Scroggins Aviation]] Mockup & Effects was hired to supply a [[CH-47 Chinook]] (s/n 90-00204) in the film. Scroggins made modification to the CH-47 and worked with SFX to rig it to a motion base (Gimbal), It would be the first time a real Chinook was placed on a motion base in a motion picture.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine = Cinefex | date = August 2018 | issue = #160 | title = Knocking'em Dead | author = Graham Edwards | url = http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue160.htm }}</ref>

===Post-production===
Fox revealed in November that the film was technically untitled at that point, and not officially known as ''Deadpool 2'' as had been assumed; the studio was temporarily referring to the film as ''The Untitled Deadpool Sequel''.<ref name="Untitled" /> [[T.J. Miller sexual misconduct allegations|Sexual misconduct allegations against T.J. Miller]] surfaced a month later, and by January 2018 some commentators had called for Miller to be replaced in the film in a similar manner to how [[Kevin Spacey]] was replaced by [[Christopher Plummer]] through reshoots in ''[[All the Money in the World]]'' (2017). Producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] addressed whether this would be possible, saying "We're in the final editing. I don't think so."<ref name="RTJan2018" /> Miller was later [[T.J. Miller#Amtrak bomb threat incident|arrested for calling in a false bomb threat]]; Reynolds would not comment on either issue, but stated that Miller would not be appearing in the ''[[X-Force (film)|X-Force]]'' film.<ref name="NYTMay2018" /> Also in January, the film's release was moved up to May 18, 2018.<ref name="Jan2018ReleaseChange" />

In February 2018, [[Terry Crews]] was revealed to have a role in the film,<ref name="CableTrailer" /> the character Shatterstar was confirmed to be appearing,<ref name="KapicicCableTrailer" /> and the production returned to Vancouver for six days of reshoots under a new working title, ''Daisy''.<ref name="Reshoots" /><ref name="THRReshoots" /> Some reports emerged by mid-March claiming that these reshoots were due to poor audience responses during test screenings of the film, and consisted of sweeping changes.<ref name="ReshootReports" /> However, the film was soon confirmed to be testing better than the original did, up to 98 out of 100 over three different tests (compared to a maximum score of 91 during tests of the first film). Because of this, the reshoots were adding more of the elements that audiences responded positively to, including additional material featuring Cable and Domino.<ref name="ReshootReports" /><ref name="THRReshoots" /> [[Sam Hargrave]] joined the film as a stunt coordinator for the reshoots, trying to "breathe some new life in a couple of sequences". He highlighted a car chase which combines vehicles, actors, and green screen.<ref name="Hargrave" /> By the end of the month, Pitt filmed a secret cameo appearance as the ''X-Force'' team member [[Vanisher]] during two hours of filming in Los Angeles,<ref name="THRReshoots" /><ref name="RTCameos" /> having been asked to shoot the part by Reynolds and agreeing to be paid "scale", which Reese described as the equivalent of a [[Starbucks]] coffee. This was the final photography work done for the film.<ref name="PittScale" /> The film's first full trailer officially titled the film ''Deadpool 2'',<ref name="OfficialTrailer" /><ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /> and revealed that Crews was portraying [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]]; confirmed that Delaney would appear, portraying Peter; and that [[Bill Skarsgård]] also had a role.<ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /> The film's final trailer, released a month later, confirmed that [[Lewis Tan]] would portray Shatterstar, joining Domino, Bedlam, and Peter as members of ''X-Force''.<ref name="Tan" /> The group also includes Skarsgård's character, revealed to be [[Zeitgeist (comics)|Zeitgeist]].<ref name="Skarsgard" />

One scene that was cut from the film following test screenings was a [[post-credits scene]] featuring Deadpool travelling back in time to kill a baby [[Adolf Hitler]]. It was decided that the scene made audiences too "squeamish", which was not the feeling that the creative team wanted people to be leaving the film with.<ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" /> The film originally did not have any post- or mid- credits scenes, with the Hitler scene and the film's other time-traveling mid-credits scenes shot during additional photography. The latter came about when someone suggested the time travel device be used to fix real-world mistakes like Reynolds' role in ''Green Lantern'' which the writers felt was "the funniest idea ever, and what a great idea to end the movie".<ref name="ReducedBlackTom" /> Additional footage of the X-Force team was shot for the film's marketing to hide the fact that the majority of the X-Force are immediately killed as a joke in the film.<ref name="X-ForceExtraFootage" /> Due to Deadpool's mask, the creative team was able to change the character's dialogue up to the film being officially completed; Reynolds took this opportunity to keep adding new jokes to the film as long as possible.<ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" />

Visual effects for the characters of Colossus and Juggernaut were provided by [[Framestore]]. The model for Colossus was altered from the first film to make him more "chiseled and angular", and his movements were based on motion capture done by [[Andre Tricoteux]] on set. Tricoteux wore several metallic pieces, including a helmet and chest piece, as reference. Kapičić provided the character's facial performance. The character's "iconic metal ridges" were live textured by animators for the first film, but Framestore changed this to use a combination of shape movement and distortion so they could be more precise with the geometry of the lines. Juggernaut was represented on set by a {{convert|6|ft|8|in|m}} stand-in, who wore a helmet extension to match the character's {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m}} height. A full-scale replica of the character's metal helmet was built for interacting with stunts on set, but the final version was completely digital along with the rest of the character. Framestore animators found it challenging to move the helmet in a way that the character could still move his head underneath it, and studied the movement of [[bodybuilders]] for the character. Juggernaut's face was modeled on Leitch's, and Reynolds provided facial capture for the character, but this was modified during the animation process. For the final fight between the two characters, two stuntmen who matched the height difference between the two were filmed on a motion capture stage for reference; this footage was edited into a [[previsualization]].<ref name="ColossusJuggernautFight" /> Other VFX companies like [[DNEG]], [[Method Studios]] and [[Weta Digital]] contributed to the film with supervision by Mike Brazelton, Stephen Naze, Sean Konrad, Dan Macarin, and Dan Glass.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 1, 2019|title=DEADPOOL 2 - The Art of VFXThe Art of VFX|url=http://www.artofvfx.com}}</ref>

==Music==
{{main|Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)}}
[[Junkie XL]] chose not to return for ''Deadpool 2'' after composing the score for the first film, given that Miller was "the driving force behind" him working on that film in the first place.<ref name="JunkieXL"/> In October 2017, it was confirmed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be writing the score for ''Deadpool 2'' after doing the same for Leitch's previous films.<ref name="Bates"/> Bates approached the music with a slight [[Rock music|rock]] sensibility,<ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" /> and used a distorted guitar run through a [[wah-wah pedal]], microsynths to add "unique colors", and a choir.<ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" /> The choir originally sings lyrics such as "you can't stop this motherfucker" and "holy shit balls!", which ultimately earned the score a parental advisory warning. It is the first score album to receive such a warning. Bates felt this was not "merit-less debauchery, it was just fun. It's very rare that we can work on something at such a high professional level that embraces the irreverence of Deadpool."<ref name="ScoreParentalAdvisory" />

Leitch wanted to create an original song for the film that served as an emotional through-line for all of the film's characters; the song "[[Ashes (Celine Dion song)|Ashes]]" was ultimately produced, as recorded by [[Céline Dion]]. Leitch directed a music video to go with the release of the song, and Reynolds both wanted to produce a music video to accompany the song; Leitch was initially conflicted about this, as he wanted audiences to discover the song,<ref name="EWAshesBreakdown" /> which was filmed in [[The Colosseum at Caesars Palace]].<ref name="AshesFilmingLocation" /> It features dancer [[Yanis Marshall]] performing as Deadpool in high heels while Dion sings the song.<ref name="Marshall" /> The song was released as a single with the music video on May 3, 2018,<ref name="AshesRelease" /><ref name="EWAshesBreakdown" /> before [[Sony Classical Records]] released a score album on May 11,<ref name="ScoreParentalAdvisory" /> and [[Columbia Records]] released an album featuring the songs from the film—including "Ashes"—on May 18.<ref name="SoundtrackRelease" /><ref name="SoundtrackReleaseDate" />

==Marketing==
For the Fox presentation at CineEurope 2017 in June, Reynolds made a video message featuring himself in costume as Deadpool from the film's set.<ref name="CineEurope2017" /> The first teaser poster, which pays homage to [[Norman Rockwell]]'s 1943 painting ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'', was released that November. Justin Carter of [[Comic Book Resources]] found it "oddly appropriate for ''Deadpool 2'' to co-opt [this] iconic work for a modern pop culture audience" as it is "true to Deadpool's incredibly referential nature".<ref name="CBRTeaserPoster" /> Eric Diaz of [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]] said, "It strikes exactly the irreverent tone you'd expect for the ''Deadpool'' sequel."<ref name="NerdistTeaserPoster" /> The first footage from the film debuted the following week, at the end of a video where Reynolds (in-character as Deadpool) parodies [[Bob Ross]] and his television show ''[[The Joy of Painting]]''.<ref name="VergeTeaser" /><ref name="LiefeldKapicicTeaser" /> The video was described by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Ryan Parker as "completely out of left field" and setting the tone perfectly for the film, though his colleague Graeme McMillan was less positive due to not knowing of Ross (''Deadpool'' co-creator [[Fabian Nicieza]] thought the fact that many in the audience wouldn't know of Ross made the video "exactly the kind of quirky pop culture choice that works perfectly for ''Deadpool''"). Parker added, "This trailer only showed a few seconds from the film, but fans will be talking about it all day" because of the presentation, unlike "any other trailer which would have shown so little of the product".<ref name="THRTeaser" />

Rather than pay for an expensive advertisement spot during [[Super Bowl LII]], the film's official [[Twitter]] account was used to "live tweet" the event with in-character commentary from Deadpool.<ref name="SuperBowl" /> A new trailer for the film was released later that week, focusing on introducing Cable. Parker felt that "Reynolds and company have completely changed the trailer game. The formula of just showing some of the actual movie, but with a tiny story thrown in is such an incredible marketing idea." McMillan and their colleague Aaron Couch praised the trailer playing on the visual effects for Cable's arm not being finished, noting it as a joke about the visual effects to remove [[Henry Cavill]]'s mustache from ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''. The group collectively praised the overall marketing for the franchise, with McMillan suggesting that the campaign for the sequel may surpass that of the first ''Deadpool''.<ref name="CableTrailer" /> A full trailer for the film, explaining its general plot, was released at the end of March. ''[[Forbes]]'' contributor Scott Mendelson called it "pretty funny and mostly entertaining", but was disappointed in it being a "conventional" trailer compared to the more out-there videos previously released for the film. He explained that he thought the first film "had a winning lead character and fine character-centric jokes, but a pretty generic origin story plot that eventually became the thing it was critiquing", and was concerned that the sequel would turn out to be "a more standard 'superhero sequel' sell". Mendelson also noted the inclusion of T.J. Miller in the trailer following the reveal of sexual misconduct allegations against the actor in late 2017, calling it "inevitable no matter how tarnished his reputation might be these days".<ref name="OfficialTrailerForbes" /> The ''Hollywood Reporter'' group also noted the more traditional style of the trailer, but remained generally positive about the film and highlighted the supporting cast for the film as appearing in the trailer, including Brolin, Beetz, Kutsuna, and Crews.<ref name="OfficialTrailerTHR" />

Also in March, a Twitter account was established for the character Peter and began to be regularly updated with tweets about his interests, including photos of the character [[beekeeping]] and preparing for his role in the ''X-Force'' team (as seen in the film).<ref name="PeterTwitter" /><ref name="io9PeterTwitter" /> A month later, Fox released the final trailer for the film, with Mendelson lamenting that it was as "conventional" as the previous trailer but finding it understandable that Fox not be seen to be hiding the film, and ultimately felt that the trailer indicated the film would be "a pretty solid comic book sequel".<ref name="FinalTrailerForbes" /> The group at ''The Hollywood Reporter'' praised the final trailer as well, highlighting its references to ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' and the [[DC Extended Universe|DC universe]] as well as its introduction of Peter.<ref name="FinalTrailerTHR" /> At the end of April, Leitch stated that alternate versions of jokes that had been cut from the film were included in the trailers, since "only one can live in the movie, so we might have snuck a couple in sort of additional materials that people can discover."<ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /> As part of a promotion for the film with beverage company Mike's Harder, the Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Girls fictional bar from the film was emulated in pop-ups at the Alligator Lounge in New York from April 26 through 28, and the Slipper Clutch in Los Angeles from May 10 through 12. The pop-ups respectively served pizza and [[chimichanga]]s, traditionally Deadpool's favorite food, as well as ''Deadpool''-inspired Harder drinks. The campaign also included the chance to win a trip to the film's premiere through Harder, and the Los Angeles pop-up benefited the nonprofit DTLA Film Festival.<ref name="HarderPromotion" /> All-in-all, the studio spent $135 million on promotions and advertisements for the film.<ref name=profit/>

==Release==
===Theatrical===
====Initial====
''Deadpool 2'' premiered at [[Empire, Leicester Square|Leicester Square]] in [[London]] on May 10, 2018.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} It was released in the United States on May 18, 2018, having been previously scheduled for release on June 1 of that year.<ref name="ReleaseDate" /><ref name="Untitled" />

====Extended====
Leitch's initial cut of the film was around two hours and twelve minutes, with "nips and tucks" done to it to get the run time down to the final two hours. By May 2018, Leitch was working on an official extended edition of the film with Fox wanting to "spin that out as a special thing". He said it would be closer to his initial runtime and would include a cut montage of Deadpool trying to commit suicide in various ways, an extended sequence in the X-Mansion, and alternate versions of jokes that were not chosen for the film's theatrical version.<ref name="ExtendedCut" /> The extended cut, known as ''The Super Duper Cut'' or ''The Super Duper $@%!#& Cut'' was screened at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018 at an event titled ''Deadpool 2: Uncut Screening''.<ref name="Uncut" /> Ahead of the screening, a panel was held at the convention moderated by Soni and featuring other cast members. Some of the scenes cut from the theatrical version of the film were debuted at the panel.<ref name="SDCC2018Panel" /> ''The Super Duper Cut'' also changed and added some post-credits scenes, including Deadpool preventing Peter's death, referencing Wolverine's death in [[Logan (film)|''Logan'']], and extending the "Baby Hitler" post-credit scene from the theatrical release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/deadpool-2-post-credits-extended-cut-baby-hitler/2/|title=Deadpool 2 Extended Cut's Four New Post-Credits Scenes Explained|date=August 9, 2018|website=ScreenRant |access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref> ''The Super Duper Cut'' received mixed reviews from critics, who said that the extended version did not add sufficient new material to the film, and that viewers were likely to retain their same opinions from the film's theatrical release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/deadpool-2-extended-cut-review/|title=‘Deadpool 2’ Extended Cut Review: Is More Better?|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|date=August 24, 2018|website=Collider |access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref> Mike Sorrentino from [[CNET]] noted that many of the new jokes in the extended cut were not as good as the original material, and that one of his favorite jokes was edited out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/deadpool-2-the-super-duper-cut-review-longer-but-not-necessarily-better/|title=Deadpool 2: The Super Duper Cut is longer but not necessarily better|last=Sorrentino|first=Mike|website=CNET |access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>

====''Once Upon a Deadpool''====
At the end of September 2018, Fox announced that it would release an untitled ''Deadpool'' film in theaters on December 21 in place of ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'', which was moved to February 2019. The studio suggested that press and fans "guess away" as to what this new film would be, but it was believed to be a re-cut version of ''Deadpool 2'' that would carry a PG-13 rating rather than being R-rated like the initial theatrical release.<ref name="PG13Cut" /> Reynolds hinted that the version of the film would feature Deadpool telling the story of the film to [[Fred Savage]], parodying ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987) (also a 20th Century Fox film) in which a young Savage was told a bedtime story by [[Peter Falk]] who avoided "the scary parts that were a bit too adult for the youngster".<ref name="PrincessBrideParody" /> Reese and Wernick revealed in October that the idea for the new version of the film was raised by Reynolds during a general discussion about the character following the film's initial release, and that Reynolds also suggested the [[framing device]] for the story. Reese and Wernick wrote new scenes for the new version, and Leitch returned to direct them during a single day in August.<ref name="WritersPG13Oct2018" /><ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" /> Wernick said the version would not just be for children who were unable to watch the R-rated release, as "it's subversive enough and fun and creative and something that only ''Deadpool'' could do. So I think it's going to be a real joy for not only a whole new audience, but also an audience that has seen and loved the ''Deadpool'' movies." They added that the film's story would not change "appreciably" between versions.<ref name="WritersPG13Oct2018" /> The majority of the version is the same as the theatrical release, but edited to "meet PG-13 thresholds of violence and language".<ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" /> Despite the edits, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] rated ''Once Upon a Deadpool'' with a [[British Board of Film Classification#Current certificates|15 certificate]], the same as had been given to the original release of ''Deadpool 2''.<ref>{{cite web |author= British Board of Film Classification |title=Annual Report and Accounts: 1 January 2018 - 31 December 2018 |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/BBFC%20ANNUAL%20REPORT%20AND%20ACCOUNTS%202018%20.pdf |access-date= June 7, 2019 |page=34 |date=2019|author-link=British Board of Film Classification }}</ref>

Fox officially announced ''Once Upon a Deadpool'' in November, and changed the release schedule to run from December 12 to 24. The studio considered the release to be a chance of a "Christmas bonus", and it also had the potential to be released in China unlike the R-rated version. After spending the entire development process of both ''Deadpool'' and ''Deadpool 2'' insisting to Fox that the films must be R-rated, Reynolds only agreed to support a PG-13 version of the film if a portion of the release's profit went to charity; Fox agreed to donate $1 for every ticket purchased for the film to the [[Yael Cohen|Fuck Cancer]] charity campaign, which would be temporarily renamed "Fudge Cancer" for the fundraising tie-in.<ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" /> At the end of November, writer and artist Michael Vincent Bramley noted that he had pitched the exact framing device that was being used for this version of the film to Reynolds on Twitter in December 2017.<ref name="OUaDBramley" /> Within a day, Bramley had been contacted by Reynolds to discuss the issue and said, "It seems like this may all just have been a big, insane coincidence and I'm happy to leave it at that."<ref name="OUaDBramley2" />

===Critical response===
On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 411 reviews, with an average rating of 7.07/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Though it threatens to buckle under the weight of its meta gags, ''Deadpool 2'' is a gory, gleeful lampoon of the superhero genre buoyed by Ryan Reynolds' undeniable charm."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deadpool_2|title=Deadpool 2 (2018) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=September 3, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on reviews from 51 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/deadpool-2|title=Deadpool 2 Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=May 17, 2018}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film; audiences were 59% male and 41% female.<ref name="opening" />

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, jokingly calling it the best sequel since ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and saying: "''Deadpool 2'' is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements [and] terrific ensemble work."<ref>{{cite news |last=Roeper |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Roeper |date=May 14, 2018 |title='Deadpool 2' a dark, gruesome delight, from start to very funny finish|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/deadpool-2-a-dark-gruesome-delight-from-start-to-very-funny-finish/|website=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |access-date=May 14, 2018}}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' writer J.R.

[[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was critical of the [[cynical]] tone of the film, writing "something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. ''Deadpool 2'' dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/movies/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds.html |archive-date=May 15, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515065505/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/movies/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds.html |title=Review: 'Deadpool 2' Has More Slicing, Dicing and Swearing from Ryan Reynolds |work=The New York Times |first=A.

But a film that spits one-liners as mechanically as a tennis-ball launcher is even more tediously predictable than one with no sense of humor at all."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/05/deadpool-2-review.html|title=Deadpool 2 Is Tedious and Predictable|last=Edelstein|first=David|date=May 14, 2018|website=Vulture |access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref>

==Future==
By November 2016, with development underway on ''Deadpool 2'', Fox was also planning ''Deadpool 3'', which was said to include the X-Force team.<ref name="UniversePlans" /> With the confirmation that Leitch would direct ''Deadpool 2'', it was revealed that Fox was looking for a separate filmmaker to direct ''Deadpool 3''.<ref name="LeitchConfirmed" /> In March 2017, Reese clarified that though ''Deadpool 2'' sets up the X-Force team, a future film focused on the team would be separate from ''Deadpool 3'', "so I think we'll be able to take two paths. [''X-Force''] is where we're launching something bigger, but then [''Deadpool 3'' is] where we're contracting and staying personal and small."<ref name="ReeseMar2017" />

In May 2018, Reynolds stated that a third Deadpool film may not be made given the franchise's shift of focus to X-Force,<ref name="NoD3?" /> though Reese and Wernick felt a third film would "absolutely" be happening after Reynolds took a break from the character and ''X-Force'' was released, which they compared to the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' franchise having ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013) release after the crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012).<ref name="MidCredits" /> Also, Leitch expressed interest in returning to the franchise, saying, "I would be grateful to work on something [starring Reynolds' Deadpool] again. It just depends on time and place, so we'll see what happens."<ref name="LeitchDoGMay2018" />

After Disney's purchase of Fox was finalized in 2019, all ''X-Men'' films in development were cancelled, including ''X-Force'' and Fox's version of ''Deadpool 3'', with [[Marvel Studios]] taking control of the franchise.<ref name="MarvelStudiosDeadpool"/><ref name="XMenCanceled">{{cite web | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/x-men-fantastic-four-films-13852013 | title = X-Men and Fantastic Four films 'cancelled' at Fox after Disney acquisition | publisher =[[Daily Mirror]] | first = Lewis | last = Knight | date = January 13, 2019 | access-date = January 20, 2020}}</ref>

After the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of]] [[21st Century Fox]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]] was announced in December 2017 and completed in March 2019, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] said that Deadpool would be integrated with the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] under Disney,<ref name="DisneyFoxMCU" /> and that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Deadpool films<ref>https://screenrant.com/deadpool-3-movie-disney-marvel-studios-r-rated/?utm_source=SR-FB-P&utm_medium=Social-Distribution&utm_campaign=SR-FB-P</ref> "as long as we let the audiences know what's coming".<ref name="DisneyMarvelR" /> The ''Once Upon a Deadpool'' version of the film was being watched carefully by Disney and [[Marvel Studios]] to see whether it might inform how they could approach the character and integrate him into the PG-13 MCU.<ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" />

In October 2019, Reese and Wernick said that they have a script in development, but were waiting for approval from Marvel Studios to begin production on the third film. Reese said, "[Deadpool] will live in the R-rated universe that we've created, and hopefully we'll be allowed to play a little bit in the MCU sandbox as well and incorporate him into that."<ref name="ReeseWernickOct2019" /> It was also indicated the same month that Reynolds would continue to play Deadpool.<ref>https://www.inverse.com/amp/article/60135-deadpool-3-in-mcu-release-date-ryan-reynolds-marvel-instagram [[Inverse (website)]]</ref> In December 2019, Reynolds confirmed that a third  ''Deadpool'' film was in development at Marvel Studios.<ref name="MarvelStudiosDeadpool"/><ref name="KellyRyan" /> On November 20, 2020, it was announced that Marvel and Ryan Reynolds met with various writers and decided that [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]], who are known for their work on ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'', would write the script for the third film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/11/deadpool-3-marvel-ryan-reynolds-the-molyneux-sequel-1234617182/|title=‘Deadpool 3’: Marvel Studios And Ryan Reynolds Tap The Molyneux Sisters To Pen The Sequel|date=November 20, 2020|author=Justin Kroll|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=November 20, 2020}}</ref>
