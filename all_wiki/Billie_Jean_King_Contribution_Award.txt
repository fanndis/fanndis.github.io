 <!-- The link to the politician and actor Fred Dalton Thompson has been removed, as I believe that the winner is almost certainly Fred Delano Thompson, who taught track to girls and women for decades, he was even an assistant track coach at the Olympics in Seoul in 1988. There is no reason that I could find that indicated that Dalton might be under consideration for an award about teaching and mentoring female athletes. I added his middle name, as well as the year of birth and death, to distinguish between them. If anyone has an idea to make this all of this prettier, please go for it. You can see a NY Times article about him here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/obituaries/fred-thompson-dead.html -->
