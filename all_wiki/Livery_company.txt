There are 110 '''livery companies''', comprising London's ancient and modern [[trade association]]s and [[guild]]s, almost all of which are styled the 'Worshipful Company of...' their respective craft, trade or profession.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Local_history_and_heritage/Livery/linklist.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418190325/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Local_history_and_heritage/Livery/linklist.html |archivedate=18 April 2012 |title=Alphabetical list |publisher=City of London}}</ref><ref name=ft>{{cite news|last=Engel|first=Matthew|title=British institutions: livery companies|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/e42e19a0-47da-11e2-a899-00144feab49a.html#slide0|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=ft.com}}</ref> These livery companies play a significant part in the life of the [[City of London]] (i.e. the financial district and historic heart of the capital), not least by providing charitable-giving and networking opportunities. Liverymen retain voting rights for the senior civic offices, such as the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]], [[Sheriffs of London|Sheriffs]] and [[City of London Corporation|Corporation]], its ancient municipal authority with extensive local government powers.<ref name=ft/>

The term ''livery'' originated in the specific form of dress worn by [[Affinity (medieval)|retainer]]s of a [[nobleman]] and then by extension to special dress to denote status of belonging to a trade. Livery companies evolved from London's medieval [[guild]]s, becoming [[corporation]]s under [[Royal Charter]] responsible for training in their respective trades, as well as for the regulation of aspects such as wage control, labour conditions and industry standards. Early guilds often grew out of [[parish]] [[fraternal organization]]s, where large groups of members of the same trade lived in close proximity and gathered at the same church.<ref name="bowyers.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bowyers.com/liveryMovement.php|title=The Worshipful Company of Bowyers|website=www.bowyers.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>  Like most organisations during the [[Middle Ages]], these livery companies had close ties with the [[Catholic Church]] (before the [[Protestant Reformation]]), endowing religious establishments such as [[chantry]] [[chapel]]s and [[Church (building)|church]]es, observing religious festivals with hosting ceremonies and well-known [[mystery play]]s.  Most livery companies retain their historical religious associations, although nowadays members are free to follow any faith or none. Companies often established a guild or meeting hall, and though they faced destruction in the [[Great London Fire]] of 1666 and during [[the Blitz]] of [[World War II]], thirty-nine companies maintain their sometimes elaborate and historic halls.<ref name="bowyers.com"/>

Most livery companies still maintain contacts with their original trade, craft or professional roles. Some still exercise powers of regulation, inspection and enforcement, while others are awarding bodies for professional qualifications. The [[Worshipful Company of Scriveners|Scriveners' Company]] admits senior members of legal and associated professions, the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Apothecaries' Society]] awards post-graduate qualifications in some medical specialties, and the [[Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers|Hackney Carriage Drivers' Company]] comprises licensed taxi drivers who have passed the "[[The Knowledge|Knowledge of London]]" test. Several companies restrict membership to those holding relevant professional qualifications, ''e.g.'' the [[City of London Solicitors' Company]] and the [[Worshipful Company of Engineers]]. Other companies, whose trade died out long ago, such as the [[Worshipful Company of Bowyers|Longbow Makers' Company]], have evolved into being primarily [[charitable organization|charitable foundations]].<ref name=ft/>

After the [[Worshipful Company of Carmen|Carmen]] received City livery status in 1848 no new companies were established for 80 years until the [[Honourable Company of Master Mariners|Master Mariners]] in 1926 (granted livery in 1932).<ref name=ft/> Post-1926 creations are known as ''modern livery companies''. [[Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars|The Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars]], the newest, was granted livery status on 11 February 2014, making it the 110th City livery company in order of precedence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsscholars.org/|title=The Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars|first=ATG Media|last=Ltd|website=www.artsscholars.org|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> [[The Honourable Company of Air Pilots]] is exceptional among London's livery companies in having active overseas committees in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and North America.

==Purpose==

===Training and industry===
The companies were originally formed, starting in the 12th century, to guarantee that a member was trustworthy and fully qualified, and that the goods they produced were of reputable quality, the two-fold aim being to protect the public and to protect members from charlatans. Many were formed up until the 17th century, when political upheaval and the growth of London around the City meant the companies, which only controlled trade in the City itself, began to struggle to compete.

From the 1870s however, there was a revival, with the companies extending their original educational purpose to technical education, supporting new industries and providing the training necessary to them, most notably the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]].<ref name=citylivery>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/history/Pages/livery-companies.aspx |title=Livery companies |publisher=City of London}}</ref>

===Charity and education===
From the start, the companies cared for their members in sickness and old age. Today, they support both their members, and wider charitable aims and activities, including those supporting education and training.<ref name=citylivery/>

Several schools in the UK are associated with the livery companies such as [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School|Haberdashers']], [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors']] and [[The Skinners' School|Skinners']].

===Support to the armed forces===
Most livery companies have affiliations with regular and reserve units in the armed forces.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.steppingforwardlondon.org/livery-company-affiliations-with-the-armed-forces.html |title=Livery Company Affiliations with the Armed Forces (Regular and Reserve) |publisher=Stepping Forward London}}</ref>

===City of London governance===
Finally, the companies have always been essential to the [[#Governance|governance of the City of London]]. The senior members of the livery companies, i.e, the liverymen, elect the City's sheriffs, Bridge Masters, [[ale conner|Ale Conners]], auditors, the members of the City Livery Committee, and approve the aldermanic candidates for election to the office of Lord Mayor of London.<ref name=citylivery/>

==Entry==
Entry to a livery company may be by one of four routes:
* By [[Apprenticeship#United Kingdom|apprenticeship]]. This is now rare. In earlier days, someone wishing to enter such a trade would bind himself apprentice to a member of his chosen trade. As such, he was required to do precisely as he was instructed, and it was almost a form of slavery – but the apprentice did learn his trade, and his master was required to provide such training that, at the end of the apprenticeship (usually seven years) the apprentice would be sufficiently knowledgeable to become a member – and he became a free man of the [[City of London]] – free of the obligations of apprenticeship.  
* By patrimony. Generally, a member's sons born after he became a member were entitled to become members; most livery companies also allow the same privilege to daughters.
* By redemption. This is the path to the freedom for all others, and requires the payment of a fine, as well as an interview or other admission procedure.
* By invitation. This is rare, and is said to be a great honour.

Regardless of method of entry, membership carries the same duties and benefits. Membership of a livery company conveys the [[Freedom of the City of London]], now little more than a formality, though in the past the freedom carried benefits, such as being able to take a flock of sheep across [[London Bridge]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.farminguk.com/News/Mary-Berry-leads-flock-of-sheep-over-London-Bridge-_47479.html|title=Mary Berry leads flock of sheep over London Bridge to promote wool industry - Farming UK News|website=www.farminguk.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> at no charge.

==Governance==
Livery companies are governed by a master (alternatively styled prime warden in some companies, or Upper Bailiff of the Weavers' Company), a number of wardens (holding various titles such as the upper, middle, lower, or renter wardens), and a [[court of assistants]] (board of directors), responsible for company business and electing its master and wardens. The ''[[clerk]] to the company'' is invariably its most senior permanent member of staff, who as [[chief executive officer]] runs its day-to-day activities.

Membership generally falls into two categories: [[Freedom of the City|freemen]] and liverymen. One may become a freeman, or acquire the "freedom of the company", upon fulfilling certain criteria: traditionally, by "patrimony", if either parent were a liveryman of the company; by "servitude", if one has served a requisite number of years as an apprentice to a senior company member; or by "redemption", upon paying a fee. Most livery companies reserve the right to admit distinguished people, particularly in their sphere of influence, as [[List of Honorary Freemen of the City of London|honorary freemen]]. Freemen may advance to become liverymen, after obtaining the freedom of the City of London, and with their court of assistants' approval. Only liverymen are eligible to vote in the annual election of the [[Lord Mayor of London]], the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|sheriffs]] and various other City civic offices, including the [[Ale conner|Ale Conners]] and [[Tower Bridge#Bridge Master|Bridge Masters]].

The livery companies elect a majority of the members of the Livery Committee, a body administered at [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]]. The committee oversees the elections of sheriffs and the Lord Mayor, educates liverymen regarding the City and its activities, represents the livery companies in communications with the City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=383 |accessdate=2015-03-12 |title=Livery Committee |website=City of London}}</ref>

==Liverymen==
[[File:War Memorial to London's Liverymen.jpg|thumb|War Memorial to London's liverymen lost in WW1 (on Stationers Hall, west of Paternoster Square)]]
A '''liveryman''' is a full member of his respective company.

When a freeman becomes a liveryman, the candidate is said to be 'enclothed': indeed, a ''livery gown'' is placed on him at the court and he is seen at the next formal or social occasion wearing it. Thereafter only the master, wardens and assistants in companies are seen wearing these at company events. The masters wear them at the City's formal events, e.g. the two Common Halls and the United Guilds Service, and Lord Mayor's Show, wherever they may participate. Ordinarily, liverymen wear ties at formal functions and each company differs by allowing women to wear distinct items subject to the occasion, such as a scarf or brooch.

Freemen are expected to advance to become liverymen by a vote of the court of the company. Liverymen no longer have any local authority franchise in the City, but retain the exclusive right of voting in the election of the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] (Michaelmas 'Common Hall' 29 September) and for the sheriffs (Mid-Summer 'Common Hall' 24 June) held in Guildhall as a ceremonial occasion. The votes are made by 'acclamation' subject to a challenge/demand from the floor for a ballot which would be held a week later. Any two liverymen may nominate a candidate for the Freedom of the City.

===Former parliamentary election rights===
Before the [[Reform Act 1832]] the liverymen had the exclusive right to elect the four [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] representing the City. Between 1832 and 1918 being a liveryman was one of a number of possible franchises which could qualify a parliamentary elector in the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London constituency]], as it was a preserved ancient borough franchise under the terms of the 1832 Act.

See also [[City of London (elections to the Parliament of England)]] for further details of the history of the involvement of liverymen in parliamentary elections.

==Livery halls==
{{see also|Mottos and halls of the Livery Companies}}
[[File:Grocers' Hall, Prince's Street - geograph.org.uk - 1537101.jpg|thumb|250px|Grocers' Hall, in Princes Street, is home to the [[Worshipful Company of Grocers]].]]
Today 39 out of 110 City livery companies own premises in London, as well as the Watermen and Lightermen which although not strictly a livery company, retains headquarters still in regular use. Among the earliest companies known to have had halls are the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] and [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Goldsmiths]] in the 14th century, and, uniquely, the kitchen and the crypt of Merchant Taylors' Hall survived both the [[Great Fire of London]] and [[the Blitz]], the kitchen now having been in uninterrupted use for over 600 years.

Besides surviving parts of Merchant Taylors’ Hall, the oldest hall interiors now extant are those of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]], dating from 1668–71; significant portions of the fabric of this building are also medieval, from the 13th-century priory part of which became the Apothecaries’ Hall. Several companies that do not have a hall of their own share office premises within the hall of another company on a semi-permanent basis, examples being the [[Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers|Spectacle Makers' Company]], which uses part of Apothecaries' Hall, and the [[Worshipful Company of Shipwrights]], which co-habits with the [[Worshipful Company of Ironmongers|Ironmongers]].<ref name=ft/> Many livery halls can be hired for business and social functions, and are popular for weddings, commercial and society meetings, luncheons and dinners.

Three livery companies (the [[Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass|Glaziers and Painters of Glass]], [[Worshipful Company of Launderers|Launderers]], and [[Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers|Scientific Instrument Makers]]) share a hall in [[Southwark]], just south of and outside the City of London, while the [[Worshipful Company of Gunmakers]] has long been based at Proof House, in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] and the Master Mariners' "hall" is an historical ship, [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HQS ''Wellington'']], moored on the Thames which is shared by the [[Scriveners]]' Company.  Companies without halls customarily book use of another livery hall for their formal gatherings, giving members and guests the opportunity to visit and enjoy different City livery halls by rotation.<ref name=ft/>

[[Blue plaque]]s throughout the City of London indicate where companies formerly had halls.  Whilst several livery companies may aspire to owning or regaining their own hall it is appreciated that any increase in the overall number of livery halls would inevitably lead to some dilution of use of the existing halls. There is also attraction in belonging to a company which is [[wikt:peripatetic|peripatetic]].<ref name=ft/>

==Precedence==
In 1515, the [[Court of Aldermen]] of the City of London settled an [[order of precedence]] for the 48 livery companies then in existence, based on those companies' contemporary economic or political power.<ref name=ft/> The 12 highest-ranked companies remain known as the Great Twelve City Livery Companies. Today there are 110 City livery companies, all post-1515 companies being ranked by seniority of creation.<ref name=ft/>

The [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] and the [[Worshipful Company of Skinners|Skinners]] have long disputed their precedence, so once a year (at Easter) they swap between sixth and seventh places. This mix-up is a favourite theory for the origin of the phrase "[[at sixes and sevens]]", as has been pointed out by at least one Master Merchant Taylor; however, it is possible that the phrase may have been coined before these two companies (Taylors and Skinners) resolved their dispute,<ref>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-six1.htm "At Sixes and Sevens": ''Master Merchant Taylor'']</ref> which arose from their both receiving Charters in 1327 with no proof surviving as to which was granted first.

===<span id="Company without livery"></span> City companies without grant of livery===

''Companies without Livery'' is a status which applies during the period between when a [[Guild]] is recognised by the Court of Aldermen and when it is granted the rights of a livery. A guild initially applies to be a ''London Guild'', and may later apply to the Court to become ''A Company of the City of London''. After an indefinite period, such ''A Company of the City of London'' can apply to the Aldermen for livery status; if granted, they can thereafter use the honorific prefix ''Worshipful Company''.

* [[Guild of Nurses|Company of Nurses]] (recognised as a City Company in 2020)
* [[Guild of Entrepreneurs|Company of Entrepreneurs]] (recognised as a City Company in 2020)

====Guilds and companies aiming to obtain the grant of Livery====

* [[Guild of Human Resource Professionals]]
* [[Guild of Investment Managers]]
* [[Company of Communicators]]

===Other companies===

* [[Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks]]
* [[Company of Watermen and Lightermen]]

Neither the ''Company of Parish Clerks'' nor the ''Company of Watermen'' have applied or intend to apply for livery status, which remains a long-standing City tradition. This is granted by the City Corporation in effect to control a company. The Watermen and Parish Clerks are governed by statutes and Royal Charters with responsibilities outside the City. The Company of Watermen and Lightermen was established by [[Act of Parliament]] in 1555 to regulate the [[watermen]] on the [[River Thames]] responsible for the movement of goods and passengers and remains the only ancient City Guild to be formed and governed by Act of Parliament. They are then strictly not 'Companies without Livery' at all but simply 'companies'.

The ''City Livery Club'', ''The Guild of Young Freemen'' and the ''Guild of Freemen of the City of London'', whilst not being livery companies, are popular clubs amongst the City fraternity.

===The Southwark Manors===
The City Corporation of London remains [[Lord of the manor|lord]] of three [[manor]]s at [[Southwark]] ([[Guildable Manor|Guildable]], [[King's Manor, Southwark|King's]] and [[Great Liberty]]). These are membership organisations for those areas which are the jurors of their [[manor]]ial [[court]]s. They are not in any way ''Guilds'' as are not related to trading and occupational activities. These courts retain legal-standing under the [[Administration of Justice Act 1977]].
