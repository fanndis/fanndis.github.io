'''Clarence House''' is a [[List of British royal residences|British royal residence]] on [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] in the [[City of Westminster]], London. It is attached to [[St James's Palace]] and shares the palace's garden. From 1953 until 2002, it was home to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who lived in Clarence House?|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/clarencehouse/about/who-lived-in-the-house|publisher=royalcollection.org|accessdate=19 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619195612/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/clarencehouse/about/who-lived-in-the-house|archive-date=19 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has since been the official residence of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and his wife [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]].

Clarence House was also the official residence of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] from 2003 until April 2011, and of [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Prince Harry]] from 2003 until March 2012.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-57405780-10391698/prince-harry-moves-into-kensington-palace/ Prince Harry moves into Kensington Palace]</ref> It is open to visitors for approximately one month each summer, usually in August. The four-story house is faced in pale [[stucco]]. 

Over the years, it has undergone extensive remodelling and reconstruction, most notably after the [[Second World War]], and little remains of the original structure as designed by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]. Since 2003, the term ''Clarence House'' has been used as a [[metonym]] for the [[Prince of Wales]]'s private office. (The term ''St James's Palace'' had been used previously.) It is [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade I listed]] on the [[National Heritage List for England]].<ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1236580|desc=Clarence House|access-date=17 January 2017|mode=cs2}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Clarence House 1874 The Graphic.jpg|thumb|An old drawing of Clarence House (1874)]]
The house was built between 1825 and 1827 to a design by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]. It was commissioned by the [[William IV of the United Kingdom | Duke of Clarence]], who in 1830 became King [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] (reigned 1830–1837). He lived there in preference to the adjacent [[St James's Palace]], an ancient [[Tudor period|Tudor]] building which he found too cramped.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

From William IV, the house passed to his sister [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta Sophia]], and, following her death in 1840, to [[Queen Victoria]]'s mother, [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. <ref name="walford">{{cite web |last1=Walford |first1=Edward |title=St James's Palace Pages 100-122  Old and New London: Volume 4.

Alfred's younger brother [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], Queen Victoria's third son, used the house from 1900 until his death in 1942. During his tenure, for a brief period in the 1930s, it was the location of the library of the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]] until all universities in London were evacuated in 1939,<ref>University of London: An Illustrated History: 1836–1986 By N. B. p.255</ref> and the school temporarily relocated to [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].<ref>Nature, 1939, Vol.144(3659), pp. 1006–1007</ref> 

During [[World War II]], it suffered damage by enemy bombing during [[The Blitz]] (1940–41). Following the death of the Duke of Connaught in 1942, it was used by the [[Red Cross]] and the [[St John Ambulance]] Brigade as their headquarters during the rest of World War II. 

Following their marriage in 1947, it became the residence of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and her husband [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. Their daughter, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], was born there in 1950.

In 1953, after the death of her father [[George VI|King George VI]] (d. 6 February 1952), and her accession as Queen [[Elizabeth II]], she moved to [[Buckingham Palace]]. Her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] moved into Clarence House. Also at the start of her widowhood, the Queen Mother purchased the [[Castle of Mey]] in Scotland as a summer residence. 

Princess Margaret later moved into an apartment in [[Kensington Palace]],<ref name="house"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Palaces on the Periphery: Marlborough House and Clarence House|url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/articles/london/marlborough.shtml|accessdate=19 June 2015|author=Tori V.

In 2003, the Prince of Wales moved to Clarence House.{{cn|date=June 2020}}
