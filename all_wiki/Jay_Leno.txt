==Career==

===Early career===
Leno made his first appearance on ''The Tonight Show'' on March 2, 1977, performing a comedy routine.<ref>{{YouTube|rxmXpzcl4MI|Jay Leno's First Appearance on the Tonight Show}} March 2, 1977.

After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', he played more prominent roles in 1978 in ''[[American Hot Wax]]'' and ''[[Silver Bears]]''. Other films and television series from that period include ''Almost Heaven'' (1978), "Going Nowhere" (1979) from ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'' (1979), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), "The Wild One" (1981) from ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', and both "Feminine Mistake" (1979) and "Do the Carmine" (1983) from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]''. Leno's only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video ''[[Collision Course (1989 film)|Collision Course]]'', opposite [[Pat Morita]]. He also appeared numerous times on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.

In addition, Leno appeared on three weeks' worth of episodes of the short-lived [[NBC]] [[game show]] ''[[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]]'' in 1983 and 1984.<ref>https://markgoodson.fandom.com/wiki/The_Match_Game-Hollywood_Squares_Hour/Episode_Guide</ref>

===''The Tonight Show''===
[[File:Jay Leno (1993) by Alan Light.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|Leno in 1993, in the year after becoming host of ''The Tonight Show'']]
Starting in 1986, Leno was a regular substitute host for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host<ref>{{cite news|title=Carson cuts appearances|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQMIAAAAIBAJ&pg=5008,192179&dq=tonight+jay-leno+shandling|agency=Associated Press|work=Rome News-Tribune|location=Rome, Ga.|page=14|date=June 2, 1987|access-date=October 26, 2008}}</ref> amid controversy with [[David Letterman]], who had been hosting ''Late Night with David Letterman'' since 1982 (aired after ''The Tonight Show''), and whom many—including Carson himself—had expected to be Carson's successor. The story of this turbulent transition was later turned into [[The Late Shift (book)|a book]] and [[The Late Shift (film)|a movie]]. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his tenure on ''The Tonight Show''.

In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with [[NBC]] which would keep him as host of ''The Tonight Show'' until 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC signs Jay Leno to contract extension|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-30-leno-contract-extended_x.htm |agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2004|access-date=October 26, 2008}}</ref> Later in 2004, [[Conan O'Brien]] signed a contract with NBC under which O'Brien would become the host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Conan O'Brien to Succeed Jay Leno in 2009, NBC Announces|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html?pagewanted=print&position= |work=The New York Times|date=September 27, 2004|access-date=October 26, 2008}}</ref>

During the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]], Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for ''The Tonight Show''. While NBC and Leno claim there were private meetings with the WGA where there was a secret agreement allowing this, the WGA denied such a meeting.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/lenowga-whats-the-real-story-nbc-claims-jay-asked-for-received-wga-permission-to-write-monologue-at-monday-meeting-with-verrone-et-al/|title=LENO/WGA: WHAT'S THE REAL STORY?

On April 23, 2009, Leno checked himself into a hospital with an undisclosed illness.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/23/leno.hospitalized/index.html | title = Jay Leno hospitalized; 'Tonight Show' tapings canceled | first = Jack | last = Hannah | work = [[CNN.com]] | date = April 23, 2009 | publisher = [[Cable News Network]] | access-date = August 14, 2009 }}</ref> He was released the following day and returned to work on Monday, April 27.

====Michael Jackson trial====
During the [[Trial of Michael Jackson|2005 trial of Michael Jackson]] over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as a defense witness. In his testimony regarding a call by the accuser, Leno testified that he never called the police, no money was asked for, and there was no coaching – but the calls seemed unusual and scripted.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html|title=Comedians Jay Leno and Chris Tucker testify for Michael Jackson|publisher=[[Court TV]]|date=May 24, 2005|author=Sweetingham, Lisa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195750/http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html |archive-date= March 15, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:JayLeno.jpg|thumb|right|Leno in 2006]]
As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to tell jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of ''The Tonight Show''{{'}}s opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. Stand-ins included [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Brad Garrett]], and [[Dennis Miller]], among others.<ref>{{cite episode|access-date=May 11, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/08/sbt.01.html|title=Nemcova Speaks Out on Surviving Tsunami; Michael Jackson`s Trial Continues; Interview With Kevin Costner |series=[[Showbiz Tonight]]|publisher=CNN|airdate=March 8, 2005|first=Karyn|last=Bryant}}</ref> The gag order was challenged, and the court ruled that Leno could continue telling jokes about the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.

===Succession by Conan O'Brien and ''The Jay Leno Show''===
{{Main|The Jay Leno Show}}
Because Leno's show continued to lead all late-night programming in the [[Nielsen ratings]], the pending expiration of Leno's contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network after his commitment to NBC expired.<ref>{{cite news|first=Frazier |last=Moore |title=NBC's Jay Leno-Conan O'Brien swap prompts rumors |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216165209/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |work=Newsday |date=May 14, 2008 |access-date=June 28, 2013 }}</ref> Leno left ''The Tonight Show'' on Friday, May 29, 2009,<ref>{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Date Is Set for Leno's 'Tonight' Finale|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/television/22late.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/T/Television|work=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|access-date=October 26, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/arts/television/30leno.html?em|title=Jay Leno Takes Final Bow on 'Tonight Show' |date=May 30, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 30, 2009 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}</ref> and Conan O'Brien took over on June 1, 2009.

Jay Leno's new show, titled ''The Jay Leno Show'', debuted on September 14, 2009. It was announced at the [[Television Critics Association]] summer press tour that it would feature one or two celebrities, the occasional musical guest, and keep the popular "Headlines" segments, which would air near the end of the show. First guests included [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (via satellite), and a short sit-down with [[Kanye West]] discussing his controversy at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], which had occurred the night before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshark.com/read/?art=arc3888|title=Pop Minute - Jay Leno Reveals What To Expect From His New Primetime Show|work=tvshark.com}}</ref>

===Timeslot conflict and return to ''The Tonight Show''===
{{main|2010 Tonight Show conflict}}
In their new roles, neither O'Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35&nbsp;p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno's and O'Brien's poor ratings.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/01/future-for-nbcs-the-jay-leno-show-is-up-in-the-air.html |title= Future For NBC's Tonight Show Up In The Air| work= [[Los Angeles Times]] blog| date= January 2010}}</ref><ref name= access>{{cite news| url= http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/jay-leno-heading-back-to-late-night-conan-obrien-weighing-options-80698/ | website= accesshollywood.com| title= Jay Leno Heading Back To Late Night, Conan O'Brien Weighing Options| date= January 8, 2010| access-date= January 9, 2017}}</ref> Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would be preempted by the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] between February 15 and 26. This would move ''The Tonight Show'' to 12:05&nbsp; a.m., a post-midnight timeslot for the first time in its history. O'Brien's contract stipulated that NBC could move the show back to 12:05&nbsp;a.m. without penalty (a clause put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions).<ref>{{cite news| author-link= Nikki Finke| last= Finke| first= Nikki| date= January 7, 2010| work= Deadline.com | url= https://www.deadline.com/hollywood/nbc-indicates-changes-coming-to-jay-leno-show-due-to-affiliate-issues/ |title= NBC ON THE HOT SEAT: Will It Be Jay AND Conan In Late Night?

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien. It was decided that O'Brien would leave ''The Tonight Show''. The deal was made that O'Brien would receive a $33 million payout and his staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in the departure.

Leno also writes occasional "Motormouth" articles for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|access-date=May 11, 2008| url= http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/article1746609.ece|title= Jay Leno's million dollar garage |work= The Times|date=May 9, 2007 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Moran}}</ref> reviewing high-end sports cars and giving his humorous take on motoring matters.

Leno opened his garage to [[Team Bondi]], the company that developed the 2011 video game ''[[L.A. Noire]]'', which is set in Los Angeles in the late-1940s. Leno's collection contains almost one hundred cars from this period, and allowed the team to recreate their images as accurately as possible.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.giantbomb.com/la-noire/3030-21500/|title = L. A. Noire |work = Giantbomb}}</ref>

===Politics===
Hosting the 2014 [[Genesis Prize]] award ceremony in [[Jerusalem]], Leno made jokes mocking then-President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], accusing Obama of "trying to break" the U.S.'s relationship with [[Israel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-leno-takes-aim-at-obama-1.5249329|title=Jay Leno Takes Aim at Obama in Jerusalem Awards Ceremony|last=Sommer|first=Allison Kaplan|work=Haaretz|date=May 22, 2014|access-date=July 15, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180716042208/https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-leno-takes-aim-at-obama-1.5249329|archive-date=July 16, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In a 2015 interview with ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', Leno said, "I always considered [[Israel]] as not only the only democracy in the Middle East, I think it’s the purest, because every Israeli voter seems to have his own political party."<ref name=jpost>{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/I-like-Jews-but-Italian-food-is-better-406505|title=I like Jews, but Italian food is better|work=Jerusalem Post|date=June 18, 2015|access-date=July 15, 2018|last=Amouyal|first=Noa}}</ref> He also added about Israel's relations with other [[Middle East|Middle East countries]]: "Israel is so efficient in defending itself and so good at it, that to the rest of the world it looks like bullying."<ref name=jpost />
