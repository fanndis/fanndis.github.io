'''Cunninghame''' ({{lang-gd|Coineagan}}) is a former [[History of local government in Scotland#Provinces|comital district]] of [[Scotland]] and also a [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|district]] of the [[Strathclyde]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|Region]] from 1975â€“1996.

==Historic Cunninghame==
The origin of the name is uncertain. However a possible derivation (along with the surname ''[[Clan Cunningham|Cunningham]]'') is from {{lang|gd|coineanach}} which means 'rabbit' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] and the [[Anglo Saxon language|Saxon]] {{lang|ang|ham}} which means 'village'.  The rabbits, "coneys", in the coat of arms are a pun for "koenig", meaning "king."  Irvine, a former capital of Scotland, was the capital of Cunninghame, indicating its status as a royal burgh.  The family crest includes the unicorn, which is restricted to the Crown, and Clans Cunningham, Oliphant, and Ramsay.

Around 500 A.D. a group of Teutonic (German) peoples had spelled the name as {{lang|de|Konigheim}}; {{lang|de|Koening}} (king) with {{lang|de|Heim}} (home); properly signifying "Cunningham" or {{lang|de|Konigheim}} as the "King's Home."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.clancunningham.us/index.jsp?nav_id=17 | title=Clan Cunningham Society of America}}</ref>

The historic district of Cunninghame was bordered by the districts of Renfrew and [[Clydesdale]] to the north and east respectively, by the district of [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]] to the south over the River Irvine and by the [[Firth of Clyde]] to the west.

Cunninghame became one of the three districts  or [[bailie]]ries of [[Ayrshire]], the [[shire]] or [[sheriffdom]] of Ayr. Cunninghame was in the north, along the [[River Irvine]]; Kyle was in the centre, along the [[River Ayr]]; and [[Carrick, Ayrshire|Carrick]] was in the south, along the [[River Doon]]. By the eighteenth century Ayrshire had become one of the [[counties of Scotland]], with the three bailieries being described as "districts" or "divisions" of the county, although they had no formal administrative existence.

In the late nineteenth century the "territorial division" was described as comprising the [[list of civil parishes in Scotland|civil parishes]] of [[Ardrossan]], [[Beith]], [[Dalry, Ayrshire|Dalry]], [[Dreghorn]], [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]], [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]], [[Kilbirnie]], [[West Kilbride]], [[Kilmarnock]], [[Kilmaurs]], [[Kilwinning]], [[Largs]], [[Loudoun]], [[Stevenston]], [[Stewarton]] and part of [[Dunlop, East Ayrshire|Dunlop]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=102210 Frances Groome, ''Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland'', 1882-4, (Vision of Britain)]</ref>

The Cunninghame [[poor law]] combination was formed in the 1850s with a poorhouse at Irvine but had a different area from the ancient district.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~peter/workhouse/Cunninghame/ |title=Cunninghame Combination, Ayrshire (www.workhouses.org.uk) |access-date=2007-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322012909/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~peter/workhouse/Cunninghame/ |archive-date=2007-03-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The name was revived for one of nineteen districts of the Strathclyde region of Scotland, formed by the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] in 1975.<ref>[https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/areas/cunninghame.html Cunninghame], Undiscovered Scotland</ref> The district was formed from parts of the [[Counties of Scotland|counties]] of Ayr and [[County of Bute|Bute]], namely:
*From Ayrshire:
**The [[burgh]]s of [[Ardrossan]], [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], [[Kilwinning]], [[Largs]], [[Saltcoats]] and [[Stevenston]]
**The districts of Irvine, [[Kilbirnie]] and [[West Kilbride]]
**The parts of the districts of Ayr and Kilmarnock in the designated area of Irvine [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]]
*From Buteshire:
**The burgh of [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae|Millport]]
**The districts of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] and Cumbrae

The Cunninghame District Council was granted a [[coat of arms]] by [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] in 1979. The main feature of the arms was a black "shakefork" from the arms of [[Clan Cunningham]]. To the left was the arms of the former [[royal burgh]] of Irvine, based on the crest of the [[royal arms of Scotland]], and said to have been granted to the town by King [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. To the right was an ancient ship which had appeared in the arms of both Bute County Council and Arran District Council. Above the shakefork was a leopard's head holding in its mouth a weaver's shuttle. this represented the weaving industry of the inland parts of the district. Such an emblem appeared in Scottish arms grants to weaving societies and associations, and in the armorial bearings of the [[Worshipful Company of Weavers]] of the [[City of London]]. The motto was ''Sense and Worth'', and the arms were completed by a gold coronet of a design reserved by Lord Lyon to district councils, topped by thistle-heads.

The district was abolished in 1996 by the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]], when the system of regions and districts was replaced by [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council areas]]. The area of the Cunninghame district (including Arran) became [[North Ayrshire]] council area. The name Cunninghame still exists though as two constituencies in the [[Scottish Parliament]], namely [[Cunninghame North (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Cunninghame North]] and [[Cunninghame South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Cunninghame South]].
