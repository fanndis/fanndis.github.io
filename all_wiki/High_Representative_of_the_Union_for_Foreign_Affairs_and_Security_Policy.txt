The '''High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy''' ('''HR/VP''') is the chief co-ordinator and representative of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) within the [[European Union]] (EU). The position is currently held by [[Josep Borrell]].

The post was created under the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] as the '''High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy'''; it then was occupied by [[Javier Solana]] for ten years, until it was aggrandised following the [[Lisbon Treaty]], providing a seat on the [[European Commission]], and a chair of the [[Foreign Affairs Council|council of EU foreign ministers]]. Following the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], the post is assisted by the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS) that was set up in December 2010.<ref name="eeas">Gateway to the European Union, [http://eeas.europa.eu/background/index_en.htm European External Axis Service] – accessed 16 February 2011</ref>

==Titles==
The formal title of the '''High Representative''' is "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy". This post was previously styled as '''High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy''' and, under the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], had been designated to be titled the '''Union Minister for Foreign Affairs'''. This latter title, as '''EU Foreign Minister''' is still applied by commentators and sections of the media as a publicly recognisable shorthand for the post. The style '''High Representative''' equates to that of [[High Commissioner]] in diplomatic circles. Since the High Representative is ex officio a Vice-President of the European Commission, the office-holder is sometimes referred to as the '''HR/VP'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/24982/remarks-hrvp-mogherini-joint-press-conference-foreign-minister-russian-federation-sergey_en|title=Remarks by HR/VP Mogherini at the joint press conference with Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov  – EEAS – European External Action Service – European Commission|website=EEAS – European External Action Service}}</ref>

==Role==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
Where foreign matters are agreed between [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], the High Representative can speak for the EU in that area, such as negotiating on behalf of the member states. The Representative co-ordinates the work of the [[European Union Special Representative]]s as well as other appointments such as anti-terrorist co-ordinator.

Beside representing the EU at international fora and co-ordinating the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], the High Representative is:
* ''[[ex-officio]]'' [[Vice-President of the European Commission]]
* participant in the meetings of the [[European Council]]
* responsible of the European Union Special Representatives
* head of the [[European External Action Service|External Action Service]] and the [[Foreign relations of the European Union#Diplomatic representation|delegations]]
* President of the [[Foreign Affairs Council]]
* [[Secretary-general]] of the [[Western European Union]] (prior to the abolition of the WEU on 30 June 2011)
* Head of the [[European Defence Agency]]
* Chairperson of the board of the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]]

According to proposals made in 2009 by the Swedish EU presidency, the High Representative will control the staffing and budget of the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]], and propose the size of budget to be allocated. The High Representative is responsible for appointing EEAS staff and for controlling general foreign policy (outside of trade, development and enlargement which has to be made together with the Commission) including security initiatives and intelligence sharing. However, although the High Representative may prepare initiatives, decisions will still have to be taken by the member states in Council. The High Representative would also have to report to Parliament.<ref name="23Oct">Rettman, Andrew (23 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28878 EU states envisage new foreign policy giant], EU Observer</ref>

While there has been some criticism of the vague division of powers between the EU's top players, Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The [[President of the European Commission]] speaks as the EU's "government" while the [[President of the European Council]] is a "strategist". The High Representative specialises in "bilateral relations" while the [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]] deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine (here, Veselovsky makes a mistake, as [[free trade area|FTA]]s are actually part of the [[EU's common commercial policy]] for which the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] is responsible). The [[President of the European Parliament]] meanwhile articulates the EU's values.<ref>Rettman, Andrew (15 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29680 Ukraine gives positive appraisal of new-model EU], EU Observer</ref>

With the growth in role of the High Representative, and their exclusion from the European Council, the national foreign ministers are now uncertain of their role vs the High Representative. At an informal meeting in Finland it was mooted that they could serve as special envoys on the High Representative's behalf. This has been backed by Ashton who said that so long as the EU spoke with one voice, it didn't matter who was speaking.<ref>Mahony, Honor (15 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29676 EU foreign ministers ponder their post-Lisbon role], EU Observer</ref>

==History==
The post was introduced under the [[Amsterdam Treaty|Treaty of Amsterdam]]. The Treaty stated that the Secretary-General of the [[Council of the European Union]] should have "the function of the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/treaty/pdf/amst-en.pdf|title = Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty of the European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related acts|accessdate = 12 August 2015|website = }}</ref> Thus, [[Javier Solana]] became the first permanent High Representative. Initially the post was much more limited in scope than the present one created in 2009 by the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]].

===Lisbon Treaty===
[[File:Benita Ferrero Waldner and Cristina Kirchner.jpg|thumb|The External Relations Commissioner ([[Benita Ferrero-Waldner|Benita Ferrero Waldner]], left, with Argentinian President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Cristina Kirchner]] in 2006) was merged with the High Representative under the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]]]]

The [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] proposed to merge the [[European Commissioner for External Relations]] with the High Representative to create a ''Union Minister for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy''. Although the Constitution failed to be ratified, its replacement, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], retained the change under a different name. The new ''High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy'' would still merge the External Relations Commissioner with the High Representative and, like the Constitution, would have it backed up by an [[European External Action Service|External Action Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/minister_en.htm|title=The Minister for Foreign Affairs|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131065434/http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/minister_en.htm|archivedate=31 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="scrape">Honor Mahony: ''[http://euobserver.com/9/24343 EU leaders scrape treaty deal at 11th hour]'', EU Observer, 23 June 2007</ref> The new role also took over other foreign affairs roles, such as chairing the [[Foreign Affairs Council]] and representing the EU in international fora, roles which were previously exercised by the foreign minister of the country holding the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency of the European Union]] (along with the foreign minister of the country previously holding the presidency and the one to take it next).

Despite the name change, many parts of the media still referred to it as a foreign minister and in negotiations it was decided that the High Representative would no long also be the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Council's Secretary-General]] but would be a [[Vice-President of the European Commission]], filling the now merged Commission post.<ref name="scrape"/> The merger of the two posts has been seen as furthering the answer to Kissinger's question:
{{quote|The creation of a High Representative for foreign policy, or, better still, a Minister for foreign affairs would be a big change compared with the current situation. It would put an end to the double job which exists between the current function of Mr Javier Solana, and that carried out within the Commission by Mme Benita Ferrero-Waldner, in charge of the external aid of the EU. One and the same person would therefore deal with problems and respond to the famous telephone calls of Henry Kissinger: ‘&nbsp;I want to speak to Europe.'&nbsp;"|[[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] in his blog, 5 July 2007<ref>Valéry Giscard d'Estaing: ''[http://vge-europe.eu/index.php?post/2007/07/05/Quelques-reponses-4 Quelques réponses (4)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629174917/http://vge-europe.eu/index.php?post%2F2007%2F07%2F05%2FQuelques-reponses-4 |date=29 June 2017 }}'', in his blog, 5 July 2007</ref>}}

==Appointments==
The High Representative is appointed by the [[European Council]] acting by qualified majority. However to take up their role in the Commission, in particular as a vice-president, the High Representative has to appear before Parliament for questioning and then be subject to Parliament's vote of approval on the proposed Commission.

The basic monthly salary of the High Representative is fixed at 130%<ref name="High Rep Emp">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:322:0036:01:EN:HTML Council Decision of 1 December 2009 laying down the conditions of employment of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy], EurLex</ref> (higher than a vice-president but less than the Commission President) of the highest grade of the [[European Civil Service|EU civil service]] (grade 16, step 3),<ref name="Salaries">Base salary of grade 16, third step is €17,697.68: [http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/salary_officials_en.pdf European Commission: Officials' salaries] – accessed 19 March 2010</ref><ref name="Com Emp">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1967R0422:20040501:EN:PDF REGULATION No 422/67/EEC, 5/67/EURATOM OF THE COUNCIL], EurLex</ref> which works out at €23,006.98.

=== Javier Solana (1999–2009) ===
[[File:Javier Solana Colin Powell.jpg|thumb|[[Javier Solana]] with US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] in 2003]]
The [[Amsterdam Treaty]] introduced the post of ''High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy'' to represent the EU on the world stage. It was decided that the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Secretary-General of the Council]] would be the High Representative. This meant that the Secretary-General at the time, [[Jürgen Trumpf]] was the first High Representative, although he would only serve a few months.

The first permanent High Representative was [[Javier Solana]], former [[Secretary General of NATO]]. He was appointed on 4 July 1999 at the [[List of European Councils#Cologne 1999|Cologne European Council]] as Council Secretary-General and High Representative. He took up the post on 18 October 1999, shortly after standing down from NATO. The post had a budget of €40&nbsp;million, most of which goes to Balkan operations. During his tenure, the position was expanded rapidly, with several more functions combined into the function of High Representative. From 25 November 1999 he was also appointed Secretary-General of [[Western European Union]] (WEU), overseeing the transfer of responsibilities from that organisation to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]]. In 2004 his 5-year mandate was renewed. He has also become president of the [[European Defence Agency]].

The [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration claimed in May 2000 that Solana was the fulfilment of [[Henry Kissinger]]'s famous desire to have a phone number to talk to Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In December 2003 Solana released the [[European Security Strategy]], which sets out the main priorities and identifies the main threats to the security of the EU, including terrorism. On 25 March 2004 Solana appointed [[Gijs de Vries]] as the anti-terrorist co-ordinator for the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], and outlined his duties as being to streamline, organise and co-ordinate the EU's fight against terrorism.

He has negotiated numerous Treaties of Association between the European Union and various Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Colombia. Solana played a pivotal role in unifying the remainder of the former Yugoslavian federation. He proposed that Montenegro form a union with Serbia instead of having full independence, stating that this was done to avoid a [[domino effect]] from Kosovo and [[Vojvodina]] independence demands. Local media sarcastically named the new country "Solania".

[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Khanty-Mansiysk 26-27 June 2008-11.jpg|thumb|Javier Solana with the [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in 2008.]]

On 21 January 2002 Solana said that the detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] should be treated as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Convention]]. The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraqi invasion]] through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most difficult moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU [[Security Council]] members, were in [[Iraq disarmament crisis|disagreement]]. The so-called [[Vilnius letter]], a declaration of support by eastern European countries for the United States' aim of régime change in Iraq, and [[the letter of the eight]], a similar letter from the UK, Italy, and six-second-tier countries, are generally seen as a low-water mark of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]]. Solana operated as a quiet diplomat and found himself frequently pushed to the side in negotiations and sent on missions known to be impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/29069|title=EU's quiet diplomat steps aside after 10 years}}</ref>

Solana has played an important role working toward a resolution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and continues to be a primary architect of the "[[Road map for Peace]]", along with the UN, Russia, and the United States in the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. On 22 July 2004 he met [[Ariel Sharon]] in Israel. Sharon had originally refused to meet Solana, but eventually accepted that, whether he liked it or not, the EU was involved in the Road Map. He criticised Israel for obstructing the [[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential election]] of 9 January 2005, but then met Sharon again on 13 January.

In November 2004 he assisted the United Kingdom, France and Germany in negotiating a nuclear material enrichment freeze with Iran. In the same month he was involved in mediating between the two presidential candidates in the [[Timeline of the Orange Revolution|post-election developments]] in Ukraine, and on 21 January 2005 he invited Ukraine's new President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] to discuss future EU membership.<ref name=Waging>Clark, Wesley K. Waging Modern War. New York: Perseus Books Group, 2001–2002, p. 15</ref>

=== Catherine Ashton (2009–14) ===
[[File:AshtonClinton.jpg|thumb|Ashton with US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2009]]
Although Javier Solana was originally selected to be the first Foreign Minister the delays in introducing the post meant after 10 years of service he stood aside for a new candidate. After numerous candidates were put forward, EU leaders agreed on [[Catherine Ashton]] from the United Kingdom as the first merged High Representative. Ashton was previously the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] and otherwise had no foreign affairs experience. Ashton unexpectedly came to the top of the shortlist when she was nominated unanimously by the centre-left leaders who claimed the post.<ref>Rettman, Andrew [http://euobserver.com/9/29022 Little-known British peer emerges as top candidate for EU foreign minister], EU Observer 19 November 2009</ref><ref>Mahony, Honor [http://euobserver.com/9/29024 EU chooses unknowns for new top jobs], EU Observer 19 November 2009</ref> Ashton was confirmed by the European Parliament before she took up the post. In the same European Council meeting, [[Pierre de Boissieu]] was appointed [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union]], showing that the High Representative and the Secretary-General will no longer be the same person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111343.pdf|title=Press release, European Council 2009-11-19}}</ref>

In October 2010 most major appointments to the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]] were made, including [[Pierre Vimont]] (France) as Secretary General, Helga Schmid (Germany) and Maciej Popowski (Poland) as Deputy Secretary Generals and [[David O'Sullivan (civil servant)|David O'Sullivan]] (Ireland) as chief operating officer. Slowly other staff and ambassadors were appointed in cycles.<ref name="HS and MP">Rettman, Andrew (29 October 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/31162 German and Pole join roll-call of Ashton lieutenants], EU Observer</ref> Ashton formally launched the EEAS on 1 December 2010 at a low key event where she outlined her key priorities as relations with the US and China, climate change, poverty eradication, crisis management and counter-terrorism.<ref>Rettman, Andrew (2 December 2010) [http://euobserver.com/18/31413 Ashton names EU foreign-service priorities at low-key launch event], EU Observer. Retrieved 20 September 2011</ref>

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] Ashton chaired a meeting of the foreign relations, development and environment DGs and experts from the Council and the Situation Centre (the EU intelligence-gathering agency). There they agreed on €3&nbsp;million in aid, to look for further financial assistance, to send personnel to assess the situation and to co-ordinate pledges from member states. Ashton then chaired a meeting of member states' ambassadors and acted as a general co-ordinator; for example contacts from the UN went via Ashton. Although she refused to describe it as the first act of the external action service, Ashton did emphasise that it was the first time that such a co-ordination between all the various EU foreign policy actors had been accomplished before. Spain, which held the rotating Council presidency that would have taken charge before the Lisbon Treaty, took a back seat though assisted, for example by offering use of the Spanish base in Panama. However, the majority of aid relief was dealt with bilaterally between Haiti and individual member states<ref>Rettman, Andrew (14 January 2009) [http://euobserver.com/24/29266 EU foreign relations chief tests new powers in earthquake response], EU Observer</ref> and Ashton was criticised afterward for being one of the few foreign representatives not to travel to Haiti personally.<ref>Mahony, Honor (19 January 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29299 Ashton under fire for not going to Haiti], EU Observer</ref> Despite EU ministers then agreeing to deploy [[European Gendarmerie Force|European gendarmes]], criticism was levied at Ashton for failing to improve the EU's international profile during the crisis. Ashton replied stating that "There's been a recognition from the people of Haiti, the US, the UN and others of the extremely important role the EU has played. On the main issue, we should ask, have we tried to save lives, to support the people of Haiti? Yes we have."<ref>Rettman, Andrew (25 January 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29336 EU gendarmes to help build law and order in Haiti], EU Observer</ref>

Secretary General Pierre Vimont joined those defending Ashton from criticism; praising her work in opening the EEAS office in [[Benghazi]], Libya as making the EEAS very popular in Libya. He also supported her over Syria and has asked her to stand for a second term. Polish Minister for Europe, [[Mikołaj Dowgielewicz]], also stated criticism against Ashton was "a lot of hot air" and that "she has an impossible job to do and she is doing it well. At the end of her time in office, people will be more positive about what she has done. She will leave a real legacy."<ref name="PSE">Carroll, Dean (6 September 2011) [http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/811/catherine-ashton-for-a-second-term-at-the-eeas Catherine Ashton for a second term at the EEAS?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111350/http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/811/catherine-ashton-for-a-second-term-at-the-eeas |date=26 March 2012 }}, Public Service Europe.

However, Former European Commission adviser Dr Fraser Cameron argued that "the criticism one hears of Ashton is pretty strong and it will be difficult to overcome the bad press she has. It represents a problem for the EEAS, when it comes to public diplomacy, and reflects the system we have for choosing leaders. Too often, the EEAS is waiting until the last member state signs up to the position; they could set out a view much earlier. When you look at places like Egypt – Cathy has been five times, but people are still not quite sure what the EEAS does or who speaks for Europe. The glass is less than half full. I think the criticism of Ashton is down to style and morale in the EEAS is not as good as it should be."<ref name="PSE"/>

Ashton chaired the meetings between the [[E3/EU+3]] (P5+1 countries and the EU) and Iran in Geneva,<ref>{{cite news |author=James Reynolds |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24542216 |title=Iran nuclear checks most detailed ever – Ashton |publisher=BBC |date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> which led to an interim agreement on 24 November 2013, and the [[Joint Plan of Action]].<ref name=eeas-20140117/><ref name=cnn-20131124>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/24/world/meast/iran-deal-text/index.html |title=The Iran nuclear deal: full text |publisher=CNN |date=24 November 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref>

The tone of public comment on Aston's performance in office was subsequently to be influenced especially by her contributions to negotiations over Kosovo and the normalisation of its relationship with Serbia, and over Iran over its nuclear program.  In October 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote of her:

<blockquote>But now the 57-year-old baroness is suddenly at the center of world diplomacy.  And whenever she is mentioned, she earns praise for her hard-nosed negotiating skills, her stamina and her diplomatic talents.  It is said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has much faith in her.  "She is discrete and perceptive, but also tenacious.  That makes her an ideal negotiator", says Alexander Graf Lamsdorff, the head of Germany's business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament and a member of its Committee on Foreign Affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catherine-ashton-excells-in-western-talks-on-iran-nuclear-program-a-925514.html|title=Iran Nuclear Talks : Europe's Unsung Chief Diplomat|first1=Gregor Peter|last1=Schmitz|first2=Christoph|last2=Schult|date=1 October 2013|work=Der Spiegel}}</ref></blockquote>

A senior French diplomat was quoted as saying, "I tip my hat to her.... She truly played a decisive role".  The report continued that, after initially insisting on negotiating only with other foreign ministers, by the latter stages of the negotiations the Iranian foreign minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] "now... wanted to deal only with Lady Ashton".  Said a western diplomat, "That the others agreed to this was significant.  For China and Russia to be outside while she was in the room negotiating details was quite remarkable".<ref>Spiegeleisen, Peter.  "Ashton no longer the diplomatic dilettante".

In July 2014, given the large number of Italian MEPs belonging to the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|S&D group]] following the [[2014 European Parliament election|2014 election]], the [[European Council]] considered her as a candidate for the position of High Representative, in [[Jean-Claude Juncker]]'s new [[European Commission]]. On 13 July 2014, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' among other European newspapers reported that her nomination proposal had been opposed by some eastern European countries, including Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, where her stance towards Russia concerning the Ukrainian crisis was considered to be too soft. Nonetheless, on 2 August 2014, Italian Prime Minister [[Matteo Renzi]] formally nominated her by letter to EC President-elect [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], as Italy's official candidate for EU Commissioner.
On 30 August, Europe's socialist Prime Ministers met prior to the convening of the [[European Council]], at which she received the approval of the [[Party of European Socialists]]. On the same day the President [[Herman Van Rompuy]] announced that the European Council had decided to appoint the Italian Minister as its new High Representative, effective from 1 November 2014.

At her first press conference she declared her efforts will be devoted to establishing discussions between Russia and Ukraine to solve the crisis between the two countries.

In February 2015 the President of the European Commission [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] appointed [[Michel Barnier]], the former EU Internal Market Commissioner, as his special advisor on defence and security. Juncker stated that Barnier's role will be to advise the European Commission and particularly the EUHRVP [[Federica Mogherini]] on important defence and security issues.<ref name="EurActiv">{{cite news|title=Juncker appoints former rival Barnier as security advisor|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-priorities-2020/juncker-appoints-former-rival-barnier-security-advisor-312236|publisher=EurActiv|date=18 February 2015}}</ref> Barnier's appointment comes on the heels of the nomination of senior French diplomat [[Alain Le Roy]] as the new Secretary General of the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS or EAS).<ref>{{cite news|title=Press release on the nomination of Alain Le Roy as Secretary General of the EEAS|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2015/150107_04_en.htm|publisher=EEAS|date=7 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Josep Borrell (2019–present) ===
In 2020, EU Development Ministers have launched the Team Europe aid package to support partner countries to address the pandemic and its economic consequences by providing an overall financial support of over €20 billion.

“In this global pandemic, international solidarity is not just a matter of staying true to our values,” Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said. “It is also about making sure that we win the fight against the virus together.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Natalucci |first1=Matteo |title=EU promises €20 billion to help the vulnerable countries to fight against COVID-19 |url=https://internationalinsider.org/eu-promises-e20-billion-to-help-the-vulnerable-countries-to-fight-against-covid-19/ |website=International Insider |date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

“Unless the virus is defeated everywhere, it is not defeated. A global pandemic can only be solved globally, with united, swift and decisive global action, as we are presenting it today.” Borrell added.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Natalucci |first1=Matteo |title=EU promises €20 billion to help the vulnerable countries to fight against COVID-19 |url=https://internationalinsider.org/eu-promises-e20-billion-to-help-the-vulnerable-countries-to-fight-against-covid-19/ |website=International Insider |date=12 April 2020}}</ref>
