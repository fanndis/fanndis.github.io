A '''grammar school''' is one of several different types of [[school]] in the history of education in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries, originally a school teaching [[Latin]], but more recently an academically oriented [[secondary school]], differentiated in recent years from less academic [[secondary modern school]]s. The main difference is that a grammar school may select pupils based on academic achievement whereas a secondary modern may not.

The original purpose of [[medieval]] grammar schools was the teaching of Latin. Over time the [[curriculum]] was broadened, first to include [[Ancient Greek]], and later English and other [[languages of Europe|European languages]], [[natural sciences]], [[mathematics]], [[history]], [[geography]], and other subjects. In the late [[Victorian era]] grammar schools were reorganised to provide secondary education throughout England and Wales; Scotland had developed a different system. Grammar schools of these types were also established in British territories overseas, where they have evolved in different ways.

Grammar schools became the selective tier of the [[Tripartite System]] of state-funded secondary education operating in England and Wales from the mid-1940s to the late 1960s and continuing in Northern Ireland. With the move to non-selective [[comprehensive school]]s in the 1960s and 1970s, some grammar schools became fully [[independent school]]s and charged fees, while most others were abolished or became comprehensive (or sometimes merged with a [[secondary modern]] to form a new comprehensive school). In both cases, many of these schools kept "grammar school" in their names. More recently, a number of state grammar schools still retaining their selective intake gained [[Academy (English school)|academy]] status, meaning that they are independent of the [[Local education authority|Local Education Authority (LEA)]]. Some parts of England retain forms of the Tripartite System, and a few grammar schools survive in otherwise comprehensive areas. Some of the remaining grammar schools can trace their histories to before the 16th century.

==History==
===Medieval grammar schools ===
Although the term ''scolae grammaticales'' was not widely used until the 14th century, the earliest such schools appeared from the sixth century, e.g. the [[King's School, Canterbury]] (founded 597) and the [[King's School, Rochester]] (604).<ref>{{cite book

The schools were attached to cathedrals and monasteries, teaching Latin – the language of the church – to future priests and monks. Other subjects required for religious work were occasionally added, including music and verse (for liturgy), astronomy and mathematics (for the church calendar) and law (for administration).<ref name="Spens Report">{{cite book

[[File:Winchester College Chapel.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Winchester College Chapel]]
With the foundation of the [[ancient universities]] from the late 12th century, grammar schools became the entry point to a [[liberal arts]] education, with Latin seen as the foundation of the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]]. Pupils were usually educated in grammar schools up to the age of 14, after which they would look to universities and the church for further study. Three of the first schools independent of the church – [[Winchester College]] (1382), [[Oswestry School]] (1407) and [[Eton College]] (1440) – were closely tied to the universities; they were [[boarding school]]s, so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation.<ref name="Spens Report"/><ref>{{cite book

===Early Modern grammar schools===
An example of an early grammar school, founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church, or university, is [[Bridgnorth Grammar School]], founded in 1503 by Bridgnorth Borough Corporation.<ref>J. F. A. Mason, The Borough of Bridgnorth 1157–1957 (Bridgnorth, 1957), 12, 36</ref>

During the [[English Reformation]] in the 16th century, most cathedral schools were closed and replaced by new foundations funded from the [[dissolution of the monasteries]].<ref name="Spens Report"/> For example, the oldest extant schools in Wales – [[Christ College, Brecon]] (founded 1541) and the [[Friars School, Bangor]] (1557) – were established on the sites of former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monasteries. King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] made an important contribution to grammar schools, founding a series of schools during his reign (see [[King Edward's School (disambiguation)|King Edward's School]]). A few grammar schools were also established in the name of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth I. King [[James I of England|James I]] founded a series of "Royal Schools" in Ulster, beginning with [[The Royal School, Armagh]]. In theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees; however, few poor children attended school, because their labour was economically valuable to their families.

In the [[Scottish Reformation]] schools such as the [[High School of Glasgow|Choir School of Glasgow Cathedral]] (founded 1124) and the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Grammar School of the Church of Edinburgh]] (1128) passed from church control to [[burgh]] councils, and the burghs also founded new schools.

With the increased emphasis on studying the scriptures after the Reformation, many schools added Greek and, in a few cases, Hebrew. The teaching of these languages was hampered by a shortage of non-Latin type and of teachers fluent in the languages.

During the 16th and 17th centuries the setting-up of grammar schools became a common act of charity by nobles, wealthy merchants and [[guild]]s; for example [[The Crypt School]], Gloucester, founded by John and Joan Cook in 1539, [[Spalding Grammar School]], founded by John Gamlyn and John Blanche in 1588, and [[Blundell's School]], founded in 1604 by wealthy Tiverton merchant [[Peter Blundell]]. Many of these are still commemorated in annual "Founder's Day" services and ceremonies at surviving schools. The usual pattern was to create an endowment to pay the wages of a master to instruct local boys in Latin and sometimes Greek without charge.<ref name="Walford">{{cite book

The school day typically ran from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a two-hour break for lunch; in winter, school started at 7 a.m. and ended at 4 p.m.  Most of the day was spent in the [[rote learning]] of Latin. To encourage fluency, some schoolmasters recommended punishing any pupil who spoke in English. The younger boys learned the [[parts of speech]] and Latin words in the first year, learned to construct Latin sentences in the second year, and began translating English-Latin and Latin-English passages in the third year. By the end of their studies at age 14, they would be quite familiar with the great Latin authors, and with Latin drama and rhetoric.<ref>{{cite web

===Grammar schools in the 18th and 19th centuries===
In 1755 [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary'' defined a grammar school as ''a school in which the learned languages are grammatically taught'';<ref>{{cite book

However, by this time demand for these languages had fallen greatly. A new commercial class required modern languages and commercial subjects.<ref name="Walford"/> Most grammar schools founded in the 18th century also taught arithmetic and English.<ref name="Sutherland">{{cite book

In England, urban middle-class pressure for a commercial curriculum was often supported by the school's trustees (who would charge the new students fees), but resisted by the schoolmaster, supported by the terms of the original endowment. Very few schools were able to obtain special acts of Parliament to change their statutes; examples are the [[the King's School, Macclesfield|Macclesfield Grammar School]] Act 1774 and the [[Bolton School|Bolton Grammar School]] Act 1788.<ref name="Walford"/> Such a dispute between the trustees and master of [[Leeds Grammar School]] led to a celebrated case in the [[Court of Chancery]]. After 10 years, [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]], then [[Lord Chancellor]], ruled in 1805, "There is no authority for thus changing the nature of the Charity, and filling a School intended for the purpose of teaching Greek and Latin with Scholars learning the German and French languages, mathematics, and anything except Greek and Latin."<ref name="Matthews">{{cite book

===Victorian-era grammar schools===

[[File:Frances Mary Buss.jpg|right|upright|thumb|alt=sepia photograph of a seated woman in conservative Victorian dress|[[Frances Buss]], a pioneer of women's education and founding head of [[North London Collegiate School]]]]
The 19th century saw a series of reforms to grammar schools, culminating in the [[Endowed Schools Act 1869]].  Grammar schools were reinvented as academically oriented secondary schools following literary or scientific curricula, while often retaining classical subjects.

The Grammar Schools Act 1840 made it lawful to apply the income of grammar schools to purposes other than the teaching of classical languages, but change still required the consent of the schoolmaster. At the same time, the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of [[Thomas Arnold]]'s reforms at [[Rugby School]], and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum, such as [[Marlborough College]] (1843). The first girls' schools targeted at university entrance were [[North London Collegiate School]] (1850) and [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] (from the appointment of [[Dorothea Beale]] in 1858).<ref name="Walford"/><ref name="Sutherland"/>

Modelled on the [[Clarendon Commission]], which led to the [[Public Schools Act 1868]] which restructured the trusts of nine leading schools (including [[Eton College]], [[Harrow School]] and [[Shrewsbury School]]), the Taunton Commission was appointed to examine the remaining 782 endowed grammar schools. The commission reported that the distribution of schools did not match the current population, and that provision varied greatly in quality, with provision for girls being particularly limited.<ref name="Walford"/><ref name="Sutherland"/> The commission proposed the creation of a national system of secondary education by restructuring the endowments of these schools for modern purposes. The result was the [[Endowed Schools Act 1869]], which created the Endowed Schools Commission with extensive powers over endowments of individual schools. It was said that the commission "could turn a boys' school in Northumberland into a girls' school in Cornwall". Across England and Wales schools endowed to offer free classical instruction to boys were remodelled as fee-paying schools (with a few competitive scholarships) teaching broad curricula to boys or girls.<ref name="Walford"/><ref name="Sutherland"/><ref>{{cite book

[[File:Bournemouth School.jpg|thumb|[[Bournemouth School]] opened on 22 January 1901, the day Queen Victoria died.]]
In the [[Victorian era]] there was a great emphasis on the importance of [[self-improvement]], and parents keen for their children to receive a decent education organised the creation of new schools with modern curricula, though often retaining a classical core. These newer schools tended to emulate the great [[public school (UK)|public schools]], copying their curriculum, ethos and ambitions, and often took the title "grammar school" for historical reasons. A girls' grammar school established in a town with an older boys' grammar school would often be named a "high school".

Under the [[Education (Administrative Provisions) Act 1907]] all grant-aided secondary schools were required to provide at least 25 percent of their places as free scholarships for students from public elementary schools. Grammar schools thus emerged as one part of the highly varied education system of England and Wales before 1944.<ref name="Spens Report"/><ref name="Sutherland"/>

===In the Tripartite System===
{{main|Tripartite System}}

The 1944 [[Education Act 1944|Education Act]] created the first nationwide system of state-funded secondary education in England and Wales, echoed by the [[Education (Northern Ireland) Act 1947]]. One of the three types of school forming the [[Tripartite System]] was called the grammar school, which sought to spread the academic ethos of the existing grammar schools. Grammar schools were intended to teach an academic curriculum to the most intellectually able 25 percent of the school population as selected by the [[11-plus]] examination.

* There were more than 1,200 maintained grammar schools, which were fully state-funded. Though some were quite old, most were either newly created or built since the Victorian period, seeking to replicate the studious, aspirational atmosphere found in the older grammar schools.
* There were also 179 [[direct-grant grammar school]]s, which took between one quarter and one-half of their pupils from the state system, and the rest from fee-paying parents. They also exercised far greater freedom from local authorities, and were members of the [[Headmasters' Conference]]. These schools included some very old schools encouraged to participate in the Tripartite System. The most famous example of a direct-grant grammar was [[Manchester Grammar School]], whose headmaster, [[Eric James, Baron James of Rusholme|Lord James of Rusholme]], was one of the most outspoken advocates of the Tripartite System.<ref>Sampson (1971), p. 143.</ref>

Grammar school pupils were given the best opportunities of any schoolchildren in the state system. Initially, they studied for the [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] and [[Higher School Certificate (UK)|Higher School Certificate]], replaced in 1951 by [[General Certificate of Education]] examinations at [[GCE Ordinary Level (United Kingdom)|O-level]] (Ordinary level) and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] (Advanced level). In contrast, very few students at [[secondary modern school]]s took public examinations until the introduction of the less academic and less prestigious [[Certificate of Secondary Education]] (known as the CSE) in the 1960s.<ref>''[http://www.qcda.gov.uk/6210.aspx The story of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911091932/http://www.qcda.gov.uk/6210.aspx |date=11 September 2009 }}'', [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]].</ref> Until the implementation of the [[Robbins Report]] in the 1960s, children from [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]] and grammar schools effectively monopolised access to universities. These schools were also the only ones that offered an extra term of school to prepare pupils for the competitive entrance exams for [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

According to [[Anthony Sampson]], in his book ''[[Anatomy of Britain]]'' (1965), there were structural problems within the testing process that underpinned the eleven plus which meant it tended to result in secondary modern schools being overwhelmingly dominated by the children of poor and working-class parents, while grammar schools were dominated by the children of wealthier middle-class parents.<ref>Sampson, A. ''Anatomy of Britain Today,'' London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1965, p.195</ref>

The Tripartite System was largely abolished in England and Wales between 1965, with the issue of [[Circular 10/65]], and the [[Education Act 1976]]. Most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools, to form neighbourhood [[comprehensive school]]s, though a few were closed. This process proceeded quickly in Wales, with the closure of such schools as [[Cowbridge Grammar School]]. In England, implementation was less even, with some counties and individual schools successfully resisting conversion or closure.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jörn-Steffen |last=Pischke |first2=Alan |last2=Manning |title=Comprehensive versus Selective Schooling in England in Wales: What Do We Know? |date=April 2006 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 12176 |doi=10.3386/w12176 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

The Direct Grant Grammar Schools (Cessation of Grant) Regulations 1975 required direct grant schools to decide whether to convert into comprehensives under local authority control or become [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]] funded entirely by fees. Of the direct grant schools remaining at that time, 51 became comprehensive, 119 opted for independence, and five were "not accepted for the maintained system and expected to become independent schools or to close".<ref>{{cite hansard |title=Direct Grant Schools | url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons | date=22 March 1978 | column_start=582W | column_end=586W }}</ref> Some of these schools retained the name "grammar" in their title but are no longer free of charge for all but a few pupils. These schools normally select their pupils by an entrance examination and sometimes by interview.

By the end of the 1980s, all of the grammar schools in Wales and most of those in England had closed or converted. Selection also disappeared from state-funded schools in Scotland in the same period. While many former grammar schools ceased to be selective, many of these also retained the name "grammar".  Most of these schools remain comprehensive, though a few became [[partially selective school (England)|partially selective]] or fully selective in the 1990s. The tripartite system of grammar and secondary modern schools does survive in a few areas, such as Kent, where the eleven-plus examination to divide children into grammar and secondary modern schools is known as the [[Kent Test]].

==Current British grammar schools==
Today, "grammar school" commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully [[Selective school|selective]] [[State-funded schools (England)|state-funded schools]] in England and the 69 remaining in Northern Ireland.

In other areas, grammar schools survive mainly as very highly selective schools in an otherwise comprehensive county, for example in several of the outer boroughs of London. These schools are often heavily oversubscribed, and award places in rank order of performance in their entry tests. In some [[Local education authority|LEAs]], as many as 10–15% of 11-year-olds may attend grammar schools (for example in Gloucestershire), but in other LEAs it is as low as 2%. These very highly selective schools also tend to dominate the top positions in performance tables.<ref>{{cite news

Further radical change was opposed by both Conservative and Labour governments until September 2016.  Although many on the left argue that the existence of selective schools undermines the comprehensive structure, Labour governments have delegated decisions on grammar schools to local processes, which have not yet resulted in any changes.
Moreover, government education policy appears to accept the existence of some kind of hierarchy in secondary education, with [[specialist school]]s, [[beacon school]]s, [[academy (English school)|academies]] and similar initiatives proposed as ways of raising standards.
Many grammar schools have featured in these programmes, and a lower level of selection is permitted at specialist schools.<ref>{{cite news

{{see also|List of grammar schools in Northern Ireland}}
Attempts to move to a comprehensive system (as in the rest of the United Kingdom) have been delayed by shifts in the administration of [[Northern Ireland]].
As a result, Northern Ireland still maintains the grammar school system, with many pupils being entered for academic selection exams similar to the 11-plus.
Since the "open enrolment" reform of 1989, these schools (unlike those in England) have been required to accept pupils up to their capacity, which has also increased.<ref>{{cite journal

The 11-plus has long been controversial, and Northern Ireland's political parties have taken opposing positions. Unionists tend to lean towards preserving the grammar schools as they are, with academic selection at the age of 11, whereas nationalist politicians lean towards scrapping the 11-plus, despite vehement protestations from the majority of Catholic Grammar Schools, most notably by the board of governors at [[Rathmore Grammar School]] in Finaghy, (a South Belfast suburb) and Lumen Christi (although co-educational) in Derry.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2012}} The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] claimed to have ensured the continuation of the grammar school system in the Province as part of the [[St Andrews Agreement]] in October 2006.

[[File:Sydney Grammar School Big School.jpg|right|thumb|Sydney Grammar School]]
In the mid-19th century, private schools were established in the Australian colonies to spare the wealthy classes from sending their sons to schools in Britain.
These schools took their inspiration from English [[Public school (UK)|public schools]], and often called themselves "grammar schools".<ref>{{cite book

Early examples include [[Launceston Grammar School]] (1846), [[Pulteney Grammar School]] (1847), [[Geelong Grammar School]] (1855), [[Melbourne Grammar School]] (1858) and [[Hale School]] (1858).

With the exception of the non-denominational [[Sydney Grammar School]] (1857) and [[Queensland]] grammar schools, all the grammar schools established in the 19th century were attached to the [[Church of England]] (now the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]).
In Queensland, the [[Grammar Schools Act (Qld) 1860|Grammar Schools Act 1860]] provided for the state-assisted foundation of non-denominational grammar schools.
Beginning with [[Ipswich Grammar School]] (1863), ten schools were founded, of which eight still exist.<ref name="Grammar Schools Act 2016">[https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/act-2016-052 Grammar Schools Act 2016], Queensland Government.</ref>

In the 1920s grammar schools of other denominations were established, including members of the [[Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria]],<ref>McCallum (1990), p. 45.</ref> and the trend has continued to the present day.
Today, the term is defined only in Queensland legislation.<ref name="Grammar Schools Act 2016"/>
Throughout the country, "grammar schools" are generally high-cost private schools.

The nearest equivalents of contemporary English grammar schools are [[selective school]]s.
The New South Wales public education system operates 19 selective public schools which resemble the English grammar-school system insofar as they engage in academic selection by way of centralised examination, they do not charge tuition fees and they are recipients of a greater degree of public funding per pupil than is afforded to non-selective government schools.

===Canada===
Grammar schools provided secondary education in [[Ontario]] until 1871.

The first lieutenant-governor of [[Upper Canada]], [[John Graves Simcoe]], advocated grammar schools for the colony to save the wealthy from sending their sons to the United States to be educated, but was unable to convince his superiors in London.
He did however make a grant enabling John Stuart to set up [[Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute|Kingston Grammar School]] in 1795.<ref>{{cite book

After several abortive attempts to raise funding, the District Schools Act of 1807 provided support for one grammar school teacher in each district (of which there were then eight), but they were then left to their own devices.
Finding the grammar schools unsuitable as preparation for university,
lieutenant-governor [[Sir John Colborne]] founded [[Upper Canada College]]
as a superior grammar school.<ref>Gidney and Millar, pp. 82–84.</ref>

Legislation in 1839 allowed for more than one grammar school in a district, triggering a rapid but unstructured growth in numbers over the following two decades, rising to 86 in 1861.
The schools became more independent of the [[Church of England]], and also began to admit girls.
However, the schools were unsupervised, often underfunded and of varying standards.
Some, like [[Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School|Tassie's School]] in [[Galt, Ontario|Galt]] provided a traditional classical education, while many provided a basic education of poor quality.<ref>Gidney and Millar, pp. 86–114.</ref>
Chief Superintendent of Education [[Egerton Ryerson]] attempted to reform the schools in the 1850s and 1860s, moving control of the schools from counties (the former districts) to city authorities, securing their funding and introducing inspectors. However, his efforts to convert the schools into classical schools for only boys were unsuccessful.<ref>Gidney and Millar, pp. 150–174.</ref>

In recognition of the broad curricula offered, grammar schools were redesignated as [[secondary school]] by the Act to Improve the Common and Grammar Schools of the Province of Ontario of 1871.<ref>{{cite web

Grammar schools along the lines of those in Great Britain were set up for members of the [[Church of Ireland]] prior to its [[disestablishment]] in 1871.  Some schools remain, as private schools catering largely for Protestant students.  These are often fee-paying and accommodate boarders, given the scattered nature of the Protestant population in much of Ireland.  Such schools include [[Bandon Grammar School]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bandongrammar.ie/ |accessdate=15 April 2010 |title=Bandon Grammar School}}</ref> [[Drogheda Grammar School]], [[Dundalk Grammar School]] and [[Sligo Grammar School]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sligogrammarschool.org/about.htm |publisher=Sligo Grammar School |title= About the school |quote=The school is one of a small number of schools in the Republic of Ireland under Church of Ireland management |accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref>  Others are among the many former fee-paying schools absorbed into larger state-funded [[community school (Ireland)|community schools]] founded since the introduction of universal secondary education in the Republic by minister [[Donogh O'Malley]] in September 1967.

===Malaysia===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
[[Malaysia]] has a number of grammar schools, a majority of which were established when the country was under the British. They are generally not known as "grammar schools" but are similarly selective in their intake. Among the best known being the [[Penang Free School]], the [[Victoria Institution]] (Kuala Lumpur), [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]], the [[English College, Johor|English College]] (Johor Bahru), [[King George V School, Seremban|King George V School]] (Seremban) and [[St. George's Institution, Malaysia|St George's Institution]] (Taiping). Mission schools set up by various Christian denominations paralleled the selective state school albeit not with the same degree of selectivity. Notable mission schools include the [[La Sallian educational institutions#Malaysia|La Sallian family of schools]] and those set up by the [[Marist Brothers]] and [[Methodist]] missionaries. Before the 1970s when Malay was made the medium of instruction, many such selective schools became known for providing excellent English-medium education and have produced many notable alumni, including former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] [[Najib Tun Razak]] ([[St. John's Institution]]) and all five of his predecessors.

===Singapore===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Singapore was established as a Crown Colony, and the term "grammar school" was used since 1819 among the English community. The English, and later, the Scottish, set up cathedrals, churches, and elite grammar schools for the upper class. Initially, this was a racially segregated colonial system.

The British then opened up their schools to children from English mixed marriages, or to those with English descent. During the late colonial period, these schools expanded and also schooled descendants of the very few mixed English and Straits-Chinese families, and descendants of some rich Straits-born Chinese merchant class families, who were educated in Oxbridge or had London trade ties. Initially these schools were run exactly like their counterparts in England, and taught by the English.

The oldest of these, [[Raffles Institution]], was founded in 1823 by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] to educate sons born and living in the Crown Colony, often to fathers in Crown colonial service. Single-sex classes were set up for daughters of the British ruling class in 1844, and later became [[Raffles Girls' School]], officially founded in 1879. After independence it became the Raffles Girls' School (Primary School), distinct from the branch school established by the local government after independence, the Raffles Girls' School (Secondary School).

The French Roman Catholic Orders later opened up their ministries and boarding schools to children of mixed marriages, and racial segregation was also relaxed to some extent in the English schools. The French Catholic missions and schools, but not the English schools, also accepted orphans, foundlings, and illegitimate children abandoned by mothers ostracized for breaching racial purity laws.

The CHIJMES building has commemorative plaques for these abandoned babies. The children were termed "children of God" and raised as Catholics. When laws banning polygamy became strictly enforced in Singapore after 1965, these schools extended their English-speaking classes to girls from families of any socio-economic background.

The British grammar schools in Singapore imitated much of this education system, with Catholicism replaced by Anglicanism. Later the [[Anglican High School, Singapore|Anglican High School]] of Singapore was set up.

Australian Methodist missionaries started UK-style grammar schools with American and British Methodist church funds. They founded the [[Anglo-Chinese School]] (1886) and [[Methodist Girls' School, Singapore|Methodist Girls' School]] (1887).

When Singapore became independent from the [[United Kingdom]], the Singapore government established publicly funded bilingual schools based on the existing grammar school system. Since the 1960s their mission was to provide a high-quality elite education to the top 10% in national annual IQ tests, regardless of socio-economic background. These bilingual schools were influenced by the US educational system, and termed "high schools" rather than "grammar schools". Other, less elitist, state schools were called simply "secondary schools", similar to the UK equivalent of "comprehensive schools". High schools include [[Dunman High School]] (co-educational), [[Nanyang Girls' High School]], [[Maris Stella High School]] (for boys only) and [[Catholic High School, Singapore|Catholic High School]] (all-boys). Within these schools there are academically top classes, the very competitive Scholars' class or "A" class. Graduates tend to become part of the upper class. These schools recruit pupils worldwide, particularly from large emerging Asian economies. Recruitment is carried out under the auspices of the Special Assistant Plan Scholars programme, the ASEAN Scholars programme, and the India and China Scholars programmes. Gifted pupils, such as winners of Mathematical Olympiads, international violin and piano competitions, Physics Olympiads and child inventors are particularly sought after.

In addition to religious missions and the new high schools, the less selective [[Singapore Chinese Girls' School]] was set up by several [[Peranakan]] business and community leaders.

The Ministry of Education published annual rankings, but discontinued them after criticism of excessive academic stress placed on schoolchildren, some of whom committed suicide in response to perceived failure.

After the 1990s all schools were integrated into a unified national school system, but the elite schools distinguished themselves by descriptions such as "independent" or "autonomous".

In 1647 the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] enacted the [[Old Deluder Satan Law]], requiring any township of at least 100 households to establish a grammar school, and similar laws followed in the other [[New England]] colonies.

The name "grammar school" was adopted by public schools for children from 10 to 14 years of age, following a primary stage from 5 to 9 years of age. These types were gradually combined around 1900 to form [[elementary school (United States)|elementary school]]s, which were also known as "grammar schools".<ref name="Dorn"/><ref>See [http://www.onelook.com/?w=grammar+school definitions of grammar school] in most U.S. dictionaries.</ref>

===New Zealand===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{See also|Secondary education in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], a small number of schools are named "grammar schools" and follow the academic and cultural traditions established in the United Kingdom. Grammar schools were established only in [[Auckland]], and all originally came under the authority of the Auckland Grammar Schools' Board. Auckland's grammar schools share a common line of descent from the British grammar school system, with a strong focus on academics and traditional British sports. Originally these schools used entry assessments and selected academic students from across New Zealand. The schools mentioned below all share the school motto: "Per Angusta Ad Augusta". They also share the same icon/logo, the "Auckland Grammar Lion". Today, all grammar schools in New Zealand are non-selective state schools, although they use school donations to supplement their government funding. Within the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]], they are regarded as any other secondary institutions.

New Zealand did not establish a state education system until 1877. The absence of a national education system meant that the first sizeable secondary education providers were grammar schools and other private institutions. The first grammar school in New Zealand, [[Auckland Grammar School]], was established in 1850 and formally recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 through the Auckland Grammar School Appropriation Act. In 1888 [[Auckland Girls' Grammar School]] was established. In 1917 Auckland Grammar School's [[sister school]] was established—[[Epsom Girls' Grammar School]]. In 1922 [[Mount Albert Grammar School]] was established as part of Auckland Grammar School. Since then the two schools have become separate institutions. [[Takapuna Grammar School]] was established in 1927 and was the first co-educational grammar school to be established in New Zealand.
