A '''parliamentary election''' was held in [[Norway]] on 8 and 9 September 2013 to elect all 169 members of the unicameral [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]]. The centre-right coalition obtained 96 seats, while the incumbent [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|red–green coalition]] government obtained 72 seats and the [[Green Party (Norway)|Green Party]] obtained one. The [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] won the largest share (30.8%) of the votes cast, with the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservatives]] coming second (26.8%), after increasing its share by 9.6 percentage points.

Elections in Norway are held on a Monday in September, usually the second or third Monday, as determined by the king-in-council (i.e. the government). In 2013, the election was held on the second Monday. Each [[municipality]] was permitted to open some or all of its polling stations on the day before the nationwide election day. This option was exercised by 206 of the 428 municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-20020628-057-009.html#9 |title=Sender deg til riktig side... - Lovdata |publisher=Lovdata.no |date=2002-06-28 |access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/KRD/Kampanjer/valgportal/stortingsvalg/2013/todagers-valg2013bm.pdf|title=regjeringen.no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212234827/http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/KRD/Kampanjer/valgportal/stortingsvalg/2013/todagers-valg2013bm.pdf|archive-date=December 12, 2013|access-date=January 10, 2014}}</ref> The main period for [[early voting]] was 12 August to 6 September, it was also possible to make an even earlier vote after 1 July by contacting the municipal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dokumentarkiv/stoltenberg-ii/krd/Nyheter-og-pressemeldinger/pressemeldinger/2013/du-kan-stemme-fra-1-juli.html?id=732021|title=Du kan stemme fra 1. juli|publisher=regjeringen.no|language=no|access-date=5 December 2013|date=July 2013}}</ref>

The election was the fourth for incumbent [[Prime Minister of Norway]] [[Jens Stoltenberg]], whose party was previously defeated in the [[2001 Norwegian parliamentary election|2001 parliamentary election]], but who won both the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 parliamentary election]] and the [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|2009 parliamentary election]] (though in the latter election, the opposition narrowly received more votes than the coalition) leading the [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|red–green coalition]]. Had he been re-elected, Stoltenberg would have been the first prime minister in Norway to be elected for three consecutive terms.

The election ended with a victory for the four opposition right-of-center parties, which won a total of 96 seats out of 169 (85 needed for a majority). The biggest gain was by the Conservative Party, which took 26.8% of the vote, while the governing red–green coalition lost ground; following convention, Stoltenberg's government resigned and handed over power in October. The Labour Party, however, remained the largest party in parliament with 30.8% of the popular vote. The [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] also lost ground, but nevertheless became a participant in the new government.

Among the smaller parties, the centrist [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] emerged holding the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. Both had campaigned for a change in government. On 30 September the two parties announced that they would support a minority coalition of the Conservative and Progress parties, but they would not participate in the cabinet themselves. The two smaller members of the red–green coalition both lost ground. The [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] lost only one seat and maintained a sizable parliamentary delegation, while the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] only narrowly reached the [[election threshold]] of 4%. The Green Party, which had not declared support for either bloc, received its first ever member of parliament with a single seat from Oslo.

== System ==
The election used [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list]] [[proportional representation]] in nineteen [[Voting systems#Multiple-winner methods|multi-member]] constituencies, one for each of the [[counties of Norway]].

The number of members to be returned from each constituency varies between 4 and 19. To determine the apportionment of the 169 seats amongst the 19 counties, a two-tier formula is used, based on population and geographic size. Each inhabitant counts one point, while each square kilometer counts 1.8 points.<ref name="Regjeringenno">{{cite news|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/krd/kampanjer/election_portal/the-norwegian-electoral-system.html?id=456636 | title = The main features of the Norwegian electoral system | work = [[Dagbladet]] |access-date=November 29, 2009 }}</ref>

150 of the seats are regular district seats. These are awarded based on the election results in each county, and are unaffected by results in other counties. Nineteen of the seats (one for each county) are [[leveling seat]]s which are given to parties that win fewer seats than their share of the national popular vote entitles them to. A party must win 4% of the popular vote in order to win compensation seats, but may still win district seats even if it fails to reach this threshold. The system for apportioning seats is biased in favour of rural areas since the area of the county is a factor, but the system of compensation seats reduces the effect this has on final party strength.<ref>{{cite news | title = Rødgrønt flertall uansett valgordning | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = September 28, 2009  | language = no }}</ref>

The total number of seats in the parliament remained unchanged at 169, but population changes meant that some counties gained or lost seats. Hedmark, Sogn og Fjordane, Nord-Trøndelag, Nordland and Troms all lost one seat each. Akershus, Hordaland and Rogaland gained one each, whilst Oslo gained two.

[[Bjørnar Moxnes]] was elected as the new leader on May 6, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ingvil Teige Stiegler its@tv2.no |url=http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/politisk/bjoernar-moxnes-30-er-roedts-nye-leder-3774544.html |title=Bjørnar Moxnes (30) er Rødts nye leder |publisher=TV2.no |date=2014-10-13 |access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref>

==Campaign==
Going into the campaign, the governing [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|red–green coalition]] were far behind in the polls. Several polls had also shown that a "blue-blue" coalition of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative]] and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress]] parties might gain a majority.

The [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] continued to criticize the non-socialist opposition for being unable to propose a coalition that was endorsed by all parties. The Conservative Party desired a four-party coalition of all the opposition parties. The [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] wanted a coalition with the Conservatives, while the Progress Party declared that they would not support a government they were not participating in. The opposition parties criticized the sitting government for health care queues and not making more use of private providers, for failure to invest in infrastructure, and for high tax rates.

The [[Green Party (Norway)|Green Party]] had never been in parliament before, but performed strongly in several polls, some even showing them above the threshold which would give them a sizable delegation in parliament. The Greens did not declare support for either the red–green or non-socialist blocs, but the Conservative Party considered the Greens to be well on the left side of the political spectrum. As their showings in polling rose, they began to face criticism for highly radical proposals. Nonetheless, the environmentally oriented Liberal and [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left]] parties expressed worry that the Greens could become a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]] by taking votes from them.

The Conservative Party's image branding of its leader [[Erna Solberg]] tried to take a softer tone after she had been dubbed in the media as "Iron Erna" when she tightened immigration rules as local government minister about a decade ago. Instead, their election website had shown her with pictures of hearts and of her smiling. The party's campaign issues included for secure jobs, healthcare, education and better roads.<ref name="ire"/> It also campaigned for abolishing the inheritance tax, means-testing for welfare recipients, tax incentives for private savings, simplifying procurement rules to make it easier for smaller businesses to offer for government tenders and the deregulation of alcohol sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324549004579066780763830364 |title=Review & Outlook: Norway's Iron Lady - WSJ |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2013-09-12 |access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref>

The [[2011 Norway attacks]] were not a central issue of the campaign. All the main parties had strongly condemned both the attacks and the political ideology of the perpetrator. When Stoltenberg accused the Conservatives of poor leadership skills for failing to offer a united alternative to the red–green coalition, Solberg retorted by pointing out that the [[Gjørv Report]] had cited poor leadership prior to the attacks. The retort provoked a negative reaction and was described as legitimate but unwise by the political commentator [[Frank Aarebrot]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/politikk/article3663414.ece|title=- Uklokt av Erna|last=Lilleås|first=Heidi Schei|date=16 August 2013|publisher=Nettavisen|language=no|access-date=14 September 2013}}</ref> 33 survivors of the attacks ran for parliament on a Labour ticket, with four being elected,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/four-survivors-of-breivik-massacre-elected-to-norway27s-parlia/4949792 |title=Four survivors of Anders Breivik massacre elected to Norway's parliament - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= 2013-09-10|access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref> but their status as survivors was not a campaign issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24008612 |title=Norway election: Terror survivors run for parliament - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 2013-09-08|access-date=2015-05-14|work=BBC News |last1=Bevanger |first1=Lars }}</ref> The Progress Party focused less on this issue and more on healthcare and infrastructure.

==Opinion polls==
In the run up to the election, various organizations conducted opinion polls to gauge voting intentions. Below is a month by month average of all opinion polls.

For the smaller parties, the [[election threshold]] of 4% became a threat. Several opinion polls showed the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] below the threshold, and on August 18 the party called a press conference declaring that the future of a political force left of [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour]] was at stake.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/valg/SV---Na-gjelder-det-venstresidens-overlevelse-2949411.html#.Ui9XjMa9ySo|title=SV: - Nå gjelder det venstresidens overlevelse|date=18 August 2013|publisher=Bergens Tidende/NTB|language=no|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> In the lead-up  to the election, opinion polls consistently predicted a victory for the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative]]-led coalition.<ref name="pollofpolls1">{{cite web|url=http://www.pollofpolls.no/?cmd=Stortinget |title=Poll of polls |publisher=Pollofpolls.no |access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref><ref name="reut" />

===Seat predictions===
The total number of seats in the parliament will remain 169, but due to changes in the population, some counties will gain or lose seats. Hedmark, Sogn og Fjordane, Nord-Trøndelag, Nordland and Troms all lose one seat each. Akershus, Hordaland and Rogaland gain one each, whilst Oslo gains two.

Several commentators noted in half-jest that all the parties had won something from the election. The four parties on the right gained a majority and were as such the victors, but also, for the defeated [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|red–green coalition]], there was a silver lining. The Labour Party's numbers in the polls rose during the campaign and they retained their status as the largest party. The [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] had a historically bad election, but they succeeded at climbing over the election threshold and retained seven seats, as compared with a mere two seats had they fallen under. The [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] did better than expected, and emerged from eight years in government with about the same amount of support as before. Meanwhile, the [[Green Party (Norway)|Green Party]] could celebrate their first ever member of parliament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nyheter.radiohaugaland.no/les.aspx?artikkel=87699#.UjQnC8a9ySo|title=- Alle vant litt|date=10 September 2013|publisher=Radio Haugaland|language=no|access-date=14 September 2013}}</ref>

===Analysis===
[[University of Bergen]] politics professor [[Frank Aarebrot]] said of the election campaign that it was dominated by classical welfare issues such as better care for the elderly, improved hospitals and better schools. At the same time he pointed out that no party called for Norwegians to pay privately for such things as hospital visits, college education or elderly care.<ref name="ire" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Orange (richard.orange@thelocal.com) |url=http://www.thelocal.no/20130906/jens-stoltenberg-how-the-orator-of-utoya-lost-his-shine |title=Jens Stoltenberg: How the orator fell from glory - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.no |date= 2013-09-06|access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref>

The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] was said to be looking for coalition talks with the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]].<ref name="ire" /> [[Erna Solberg|Solberg]] said that while staying committed to cutting taxes, reducing the size of government and improving health care, she acknowledged a need to make policy concessions. "We will all have to give and take to get a policy stance that has a firm direction and will last over time. All three (other parties) will be tough negotiators in issues close to their hearts".<ref name="reut"/> Four-party talks involved the Conservatives, Progress Party (FrP), Christian Democrats (KrF) and Liberals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/news-in-brief/government-petty-claim-norway-conservatives/ |title=Government 'petty', claim Norway Conservatives / News in brief / The Foreigner — Norwegian News in English |publisher=Theforeigner.no |date=2013-09-20 |access-date=2015-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203215644/http://theforeigner.no/pages/news-in-brief/government-petty-claim-norway-conservatives/ |archive-date=2016-02-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> FrP demanded [[Siv Jensen]] become the new finance minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnp.no/norway/politics/3964-norwegians-are-skeptical-of-siv-jensen-as-finance-minister |title=Norwegians Are Skeptical of Siv Jensen as Finance Minister - The Nordic Page - Politics |publisher=Tnp.no |date=2013-09-12 |access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref>
