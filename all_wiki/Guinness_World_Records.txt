'''''Guinness World Records''''', known from its inception in 1955 until 2000 as '''''The Guinness Book of Records''''' and in previous United States editions as '''''The Guinness Book of World Records''''', is a [[reference book]] published annually, listing [[world record]]s both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The brainchild of Sir [[Hugh Beaver]], the book was co-founded by twin brothers [[Norris McWhirter|Norris]] and [[Ross McWhirter]] in [[Fleet Street]], [[London]], in August 1954.

The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Publication of the Guinness Book of World Records |url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/publication-guinness-book-world-records#:~:text=The%20Guinness%20Book%20of%20Records,published%20on%20August%2027th%2C%201955.&text=The%20book's%20story%20began%20at,was%20Europe's%20fastest%20game%20bird. |website=History Today |accessdate=19 July 2020}}</ref> As of the 2019 edition, it is now in its 64th  year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages, and maintains over 53,000 records in its database.

The popularity of the franchise has resulted in ''Guinness World Records'' becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lewandowski enters Guinness World Record Books |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/noblmd14-lewandowski-enters-guinness-world-record-books.jsp |accessdate=5 August 2020 |publisher=Bundesliga|quote=Guinness World Records is the world’s authority on record-breaking achievements.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Guinness World Records: How the Irish brewer became an authority on firsts, feats and pub trivia |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/guinness-world-records-new-edition-history-origins-brewer-ireland-a8523941.html |accessdate=5 August 2020 |newspaper=The Independent|quote=The book recounting record-breaking achievements from all manner of disciplines across the world is now in its 63rd edition and continues to be a bestseller, the place to go for anyone interested in finding out who is the world’s most tattooed man or who built the fastest jet-powered go-kart.}}</ref> The organisation employs record adjudicators to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.<ref name=faq>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faq.aspx |publisher=Guinness World Records |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=10 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124172127/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faq.aspx |archivedate=24 January 2012 }}</ref>

==History==
On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the [[Guinness]] Breweries,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://guinness.book-of-records.info/history.html |title=The History of the Book |work=Guinness Record Book Collecting |accessdate=10 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225172648/http://guinness.book-of-records.info/history.html |archive-date=25 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> went on a shooting party in the [[North Slob]], by the [[River Slaney]] in [[County Wexford]], Ireland. After missing a shot at a [[Eurasian Golden Plover|golden plover]], he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest [[Game (food)|game bird]] in Europe, the golden plover or the [[red grouse]] – it is the plover.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fionn Davenport|title=Ireland|year=2010|page=193|isbn=9781742203508|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfL3QnPMi9oC&pg=PA193|access-date=13 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513022833/https://books.google.com/books?id=RfL3QnPMi9oC&pg=PA193|archive-date=13 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> That evening at [[Castlebridge]] House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/james.robertson/history2.htm |title=Early history of Guinness World Records |page=2 |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701200438/http://freespace.virgin.net/james.robertson/history2.htm |archivedate=1 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Publication of the Guinness Book of Records: 27 August 1955|first=Richard|last=Cavendish|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=55|date=August 2005}}</ref> Beaver knew that there must have been numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2005|year=2004|page=6|isbn=1892051222|publisher=Guinness; 50th Anniversary edition}}</ref>

Beaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee [[Christopher Chataway]] recommended university friends Norris and Ross McWhirter, who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became ''The Guinness Book of Records,'' in August 1954. A thousand copies were printed and given away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spyhunter007.com/spy_guinness_book_history.htm|title=Guinness Book History 1950 - Present|work=spyhunter007.com|access-date=5 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513093133/http://spyhunter007.com/spy_guinness_book_history.htm|archive-date=13 May 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the founding of ''The Guinness Book of Records'' office at 107 [[Fleet Street]], London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British best seller lists by Christmas. The following year, it launched in the US, and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, ''Guinness World Records'' has gone on to become a record breaker in its own right. With sales of more than 100&nbsp;million copies in 100 countries and 37 languages, ''Guinness World Records'' is the world's best selling copyrighted book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.aspx|title=Guinness World Records Corporate - Home|work=guinnessworldrecords.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821044202/http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.aspx|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>

Because the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the TV series ''[[Record Breakers]]'', based upon the book, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. [[Ross McWhirter#Assassination|Ross McWhirter was assassinated]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3643039.stm |title=Record Breakers' McWhirter dies |date=20 April 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2014 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227122349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3643039.stm |archive-date=27 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Following Ross's assassination, the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called ''Norris on the Spot''.

Guinness Superlatives, later Guinness World Records Limited, was formed in 1954 to publish the first book. [[Sterling Publishing]] owned the rights to the ''Guinness'' book in the US for decades. The group was owned by Guinness PLC and subsequently [[Diageo]] until 2001, when it was purchased by [[Gullane Entertainment]] for $65&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010701/hssu011.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010820144727/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010701/hssu011.html|title=Gullane Entertainment to Acquire Guinness World Records|website=[[PRNewswire]]|via=[[Yahoo!

In 2006, [[Apax Partners]] purchased HIT and subsequently sold Guinness World Records in early 2008 to the [[Jim Pattison Group]], the parent company of [[Ripley Entertainment]], which is licensed to operate Guinness World Records' Attractions. With offices in New York City and Tokyo, Guinness World Records' global headquarters remain in London, while its museum attractions are based at Ripley headquarters in [[Orlando, Florida]], US.

Each edition contains a selection of the records from the Guinness World Records database, as well as select new records, with the criteria for inclusion changing from year to year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ppbdz/i_am_craig_glenday_editorinchief_at_guinness/cmywf2e|title=r/IAmA - I am Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief at Guinness World Records - the world’s best-selling annual book – AMA!|website=reddit|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref>

The retirement of Norris McWhirter from his consulting role in 1995 and the subsequent decision by Diageo Plc to sell The Guinness Book of Records brand have shifted the focus of the books from text-oriented to illustrated reference. A selection of records are curated for the book from the full archive but all existing Guinness World Records titles can be accessed by creating a login on the company's website. Applications made by individuals for existing record categories are free of charge.

For many records, ''Guinness World Records'' is the effective authority on the exact requirements for them and with whom records reside, the company providing adjudicators to events to determine the veracity of record attempts. The list of records which the ''Guinness World Records'' covers is not fixed, records may be added and also removed for various reasons. The public are invited to submit applications for records, which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record.<ref name="faq" /> The company also provides corporate services for companies to "harness the power of record-breaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses."<ref name="corporate">{{cite web |url=http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/ |title=Guinness World Records Corportate |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=10 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512021154/http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/ |archivedate=12 May 2012  }}</ref>

===Ethical and safety issues===
[[File:Guinness Beer Record 1977.jpg|right|thumb|Steven Petrosino drinking 1 litre of beer in 1.3 seconds in June 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerrecord.com|title=Guinness World Beer Record|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=10 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211213237/http://www.beerrecord.com/|archive-date=11 February 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbX33Zkl9Nw|title=Video clip|accessdate=29 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131051136/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbX33Zkl9Nw|archive-date=31 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Petrosino set record times for 250 ml, 500 ml and 1.5 litres as well, but Guinness accepted only the record for one litre. They later dropped all beer and alcohol records from their compendium in 1991, and reinstated the records in 2008.]]
''Guinness World Records'' states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons, such as those related to the killing or harming of animals.<ref name="isitarecord">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/is-it-a-record/ |title=IS YOUR PROPOSAL A POTENTIAL GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ ACHIEVEMENT? |publisher="Guinness World Records" |accessdate=10 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504015421/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/is-it-a-record/ |archive-date=4 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons, including concerns for the well being of potential record breakers. For example, following publication of the "heaviest fish" record, many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy, and therefore such entries were removed.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Guinness Book also dropped records within their "eating and drinking records" section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential [[lawsuit|litigation]].<ref name="discontinue"/> These changes included the removal of all [[distilled beverage|spirit]], wine and beer drinking records, along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees.<ref name="discontinue">{{cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records|year=1990|page=464}}</ref> Other records, such as [[sword swallowing]] and rally driving (on public roads), were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels.  
There have been instances of closed  categories being reopened. For example, the sword swallowing category was listed as closed in the 1990 ''Guinness Book of World Records'', but has since been reopened with [[Johnny Strange]] breaking a sword swallowing record on Guinness World Records Live.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/weird-wacky-surrey-guinness-world-17824947|title=Surrey's wackiest world records and how you can set your own|last=Pengelly|first=Emma|date=29 February 2020|website=getsurrey|access-date=1 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301215007/https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/weird-wacky-surrey-guinness-world-17824947|archive-date=1 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/1/daring-record-holder-johnny-strange-adds-to-his-collection-of-titles-460468|title=Daring record holder Johnny Strange adds to his collection of titles with scary sword swallowing feat|date=30 January 2017|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=1 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903200732/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/1/daring-record-holder-johnny-strange-adds-to-his-collection-of-titles-460468|archive-date=3 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, the speed beer drinking records which were dropped from the book in 1991, reappeared 17 years later in the 2008 edition, but were moved from the "Human Achievements" section of the older book<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook.htm |title=Guinness World Record Book Entry |work=Guinness World Beer Record |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=10 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112083811/http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook.htm |archive-date=12 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> to the "Modern Society" section of the newer edition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guinness World Record Book Entry 2008|url=http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook_2008.htm|work=Guinness World Beer Record|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112083947/http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook_2008.htm|archive-date=12 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the request of the [[U.S. Mint]], in 1984, the book stopped accepting claims of large hoardings of pennies or other currency.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records|year=1984|page=428}}</ref>

===Difficulty in defining records===
For some potential categories, ''Guinness World Records'' has declined to list some records that are too difficult or impossible to determine. For example, its website states: "We do not accept any claims for beauty as it is not [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] measurable."<ref name=isitarecord/> An example of this was the record for the Worlds Fastest Violinist, which was suspended as the Guinness World Records released a statement about this on one of the records on their Youtube Channel, due to pressure from Youtube personalities [[Brett Yang]] and [[Eddy Chen]], who are the heads of the channel [[TwoSet Violin|Twoset Violin]].  Guinness World Records stated that they could not determine if the Violinist in question was playing the notes correctly, and other attributes, such as clearness and articulation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Reasons applications are rejected|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/the-application-process/reasons-applications-are-rejected|access-date=14 November 2020|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB}}</ref>

However, other categories of human skill relating to measurable speed such as "Worlds Fastest Clapper" were instated. On 27 July 2010, Connor May (NSW, Australia) set the record for 743 claps in 1 minute. 

On 10 December 2010, ''Guinness World Records'' stopped its new "[[dreadlock]]" category after investigation of its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, determining it was impossible to judge this record accurately.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Longest-Dreadlock-Record-Rested/BLOG/3083932/7691.html |title=Longest Dreadlock Record&nbsp;– Rested&nbsp;– Guinness World Records Blog post&nbsp;– Home of the Longest, Shortest, Fastest, Tallest facts and feats |publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=4 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005033245/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Longest-Dreadlock-Record-Rested/BLOG/3083932/7691.html |archivedate=5 October 2011  }}</ref>

==Change in business model==
Traditionally, the company made a large amount of its revenue via book sales to interested readers, especially children.  The rise of the Internet began to cut into book sales in the 2000s and forward, part of a general decline in the book industry.  According to a 2017 story by [[Planet Money]] of [[NPR]], Guinness began to realise that a lucrative new revenue source to replace falling book sales was the would-be record-holders themselves.<ref name="planetmoney">{{cite AV media |last1=Smith |first1=Stacey Vanek |last2=Saakashvili |first2=Eduard |date=20 September 2017 |title=Is Record Breaking Broken? |medium= |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/09/20/552203402/episode-795-is-record-breaking-broken |access-date=17 September 2019 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013134317/https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/09/20/552203402/episode-795-is-record-breaking-broken |archive-date=13 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  While any person can theoretically send in a record to be verified for free, the process is slow and manual for this.  Would-be record breakers that paid fees ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 would be given advisors, adjudicators, help in finding good records to break as well as suggestions for how to do it, prompt service, and so on.  In particular, corporations and celebrities seeking a [[publicity stunt]] to launch a new product or draw attention to themselves began to hire Guinness World Records, paying them for finding a record to break or to create a new category just for them.<ref name="planetmoney" />

''Guinness World Records'' was criticised by television talk show host [[John Oliver]] on the program ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' in August 2019.<ref name="JohnOliver">{{cite news |title=John Oliver Bakes Very Large Cake to Annoy Turkmenistan |url=https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake |accessdate=16 August 2019 |work=Time |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814150445/https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/ |archive-date=14 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  While Oliver lightly mocked the corporate publicity side of Guinness's revenue model, such as [[General Mills|General Mills, Inc.]] being awarded a record for the construction of the world's longest line of tacos, he pointed more serious criticism at Guinness taking money from [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian governments]] for pointless vanity projects.  In particular, [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], the autocratic [[President of Turkmenistan]], paid Guinness for a number of world records earned by the Government of Turkmenistan, and has bragged about the records set by Turkmenistan.<ref name="JohnOliver"/>  Oliver mocked the resulting records such as the "Largest cycling awareness lesson"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/378333-largest-cycling-awareness-lesson |title=Largest cycling awareness lesson |website=Guinness World Records |access-date=17 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928225447/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/378333-largest-cycling-awareness-lesson |archive-date=28 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and "Highest density of white marble-clad buildings".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-density-of-white-marble-clad-buildings |title=Highest density of white marble-clad buildings |website=Guinness World Records |access-date=17 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101032416/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-density-of-white-marble-clad-buildings |archive-date=1 November 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Oliver asked for Guinness to work with ''Last Week Tonight'' to adjudicate a record for largest marble cake featuring an embarrassing picture of Berdimuhamedow, but according to Oliver, the offer did not work out after Guinness insisted on a non-disparagement clause.

==Museums==
[[File:6764 Guinness.JPG|thumb|Guinness Museum in Hollywood]]
In 1976, a ''Guinness Book of World Records'' museum opened in the [[Empire State Building]]. Speed shooter [[Bob Munden]] then went on tour promoting ''The Guinness Book of World Records'' by performing his record fast draws with a standard weight single-action revolver from a Western movie-type holster. His fastest time for a draw was 0.02 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmunden.com|title=Bob Munden • Six-Gun Magic Custom Gunsmithing - Bob & Becky Munden - Six-Gun Magic Gunwork|work=bobmunden.com|access-date=15 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509080154/http://www.bobmunden.com/|archive-date=9 May 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> Among exhibits were life-size statues of the world's tallest man, [[Robert Wadlow]], and world's largest earth worm, an X-ray photo of a sword swallower, repeated lightning strike victim [[Roy Sullivan]]'s hat complete with lightning holes and a pair of gem-studded golf shoes on sale for $6,500.<ref>''In Praise of Facts'', by John Leonard, the introduction to the New York Times Desk Reference</ref> The museum closed in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951231&slug=2160261|title=Travel & Outdoors - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly: A 1995 Travel Retrospective - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com|access-date=14 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114033446/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951231&slug=2160261|archive-date=14 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In more recent years, the Guinness company has permitted the [[franchising]] of small museums with displays based on the book, all currently ({{As of|2010|lc=y}}) located in towns popular with tourists: [[Tokyo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[San Antonio]].

Specials:
* ''Guinness World Records: 50 Years, 50 Records'' - on ITV (UK), 11 September 2004

With the popularity of reality television, Guinness World Records began to market itself as the originator of the television genre, with slogans such as ''we wrote the book on Reality TV''.
[[File:Ironing guinness 0357.JPG|right|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Suresh Joachim|Suresh Joachim Arulanantham]] is a Tamil Canadian film actor and producer and multiple-Guinness World Record holder who has broken over 50 world records set in several countries in attempts to benefit the underprivileged children around the world. Some world record attempts are more unusual than others: he is pictured here minutes away from breaking the [[ironing]] world record at 2 days, 7 hours and 5 minutes, at [[Shoppers World, Brampton]].]]

==Gamer's edition==
{{Distinguish|Guinness World Records: The Videogame}}
In 2008, Guinness World Records released its gamer's edition, a branch that keeps records for popular video game high scores, code and feats in association with [[Twin Galaxies]]. The Gamer's Edition contains 258 pages, over 1,236 video game related world records and four interviews including one with Twin Galaxies founder [[Walter Day]]. The most recent edition is the ''Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, 2020,'' which was released 5 September 2019.

==British pop music volume==
{{Main|British Hit Singles & Albums}}
The ''[[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' was published from 2003 to 2006, based on two earlier, separate HIT publications, ''British Hit Singles'' and ''British Hit Albums'', which began in 1977. It was effectively replaced (in singles part) by the ''Virgin Book of British Hit Singles'' from 2007 onward.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=18 February 2009|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Virgin-Book-British-Hit-Singles/dp/0753515377|title=Amazon page for VBBHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505205910/https://www.amazon.co.uk/Virgin-Book-British-Hit-Singles/dp/0753515377|archive-date=5 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Other media==

===Video games===
A [[video game]], ''[[Guinness World Records: The Video Game]]'', was developed by [[TT Fusion]] and released for [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]] and [[iOS]] in November 2008.

===Film===
In 2012, [[Warner Bros.]] announced the development of a live-action film version of ''Guinness World Records'' with [[Daniel Chun]] as scriptwriter. The film version will apparently use the heroic achievements of record holders as the basis for a narrative that should have global appeal.<ref name="GuinessFilm">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/08/guinness-book-world-records-film | title=Guinness Book of World Records could be next big brand name to hit cinemas | newspaper=Guardian | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=18 December 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715090535/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/08/guinness-book-world-records-film | archive-date=15 July 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>
