From 1910 to 1961 the [[Union of South Africa]] was a self-governing country that shared a monarch with the [[United Kingdom]], and other [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]]. The monarch's constitutional roles were mostly delegated to the [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]].

South Africa became a republic and left the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961.<ref>[https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01539/05lv01551/06lv01553.htm 1961 – The O'Malley Archives], Nelson Mandela Foundation</ref> On 31 May 1994, South Africa rejoined the [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth as a republic]], after the end of [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/south-africa-returns-to-the-commonwealth-fold-1419686.html South Africa returns to the Commonwealth fold], ''[[The Independent]]'', 31 May 1994</ref>

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The monarchy was created by the [[South Africa Act 1909]] which united four British colonies in southern Africa: [[British Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], [[Orange River Colony]] and [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The Act also made provisions for admitting [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Southern Rhodesia]] as a fifth [[Provinces of South Africa|province]] of the Union in the future, but Southern Rhodesian voters rejected this option in a [[1922 Southern Rhodesian government referendum|referendum held in 1922]]. [[South-West Africa]] became a [[League of Nations]] mandate of the Union in 1915. Following a [[1960 South African republic referendum|referendum]] on the subject, South Africa adopted a new constitution in 1961 which abolished the monarchy.
