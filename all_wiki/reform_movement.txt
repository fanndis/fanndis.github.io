A '''reform movement''' is a type of [[social movement]] that aims to bring a [[social system|social]] or [[political system]] closer to the community's ideal. A [[reform]] movement is distinguished from more [[Radicalism (politics)|radical]] social movements such as [[revolutionary movement]]s which reject those old ideals, in that the ideas are often grounded in [[liberalism]], although they may be rooted in [[socialist]] (specifically, [[social democratic]]) or [[religious]] concepts. Some rely on personal transformation; others rely on small collectives, such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[Noncooperation movement|spinning wheel]] and the self-sustaining village economy, as a mode of [[social change]]. [[Reactionary|Reactionary movements]], which can arise against any of these, attempt to put things back the way they were before any successes the new reform movement(s) enjoyed, or to prevent any such successes.

{{main|Radicalism (historical)}}
After two decades of intensely conservative rule, the logjam broke in the late 1820s with the repeal of obsolete restrictions on Nonconformists, followed by the dramatic removal of severe limitations on Catholics in Britain.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Age of Improvement: 1780-1870'' (1959)  pp 194-207, 236-85.</ref><ref>E.L. Woodward, ''The Age Of Reform 1815-1870'' (1938) pp 50-83. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.174966 online]</ref>

The [[Radicalism (historical)#Origins|Radical movement]] campaigned for [[electoral reform]], against child labour, [[Opposition to the Poor Law|for a reform of the Poor Laws]], [[free trade]], [[educational reform]], [[prison reform]], and [[sanitation|public sanitation]].<ref>Elie Halévy, ''The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism'' (1928)</ref> Originally this movement sought to replace the exclusive [[political power]] of the [[aristocracy]] with a more [[democratic system]] empowering [[urban area]]s and the [[Middle Class|middle]] and [[working class]]es. The energy of reform emerged from the religious fervour of the evangelical element in the established Church of England, and Evangelical workers in the Nonconformist churches, especially the Methodists.<ref>Ian C. Bradley, ''The Call to Seriousness: The Evangelical Impact on the Victorians'' (1976)</ref>

Reformers also used the scientific methodology of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and the utilitarians to design specific reforms, and especially to provide for government inspection to guarantee their successful operation.<ref>Philip Schofield, ''Bentham: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (2009).</ref> The greatest success of the Reformers was the [[Reform Act 1832]].<ref>Michael Brock, ''The Great Reform Act'' (1973) pp 15-85</ref> It gave the rising urban middle classes more political power, while sharply reducing the power of the low-population districts controlled by rich families.<ref>[[G. M. Trevelyan]], ''Lord Grey of the Reform Bill: Being the Life of Charles, Second Earl Grey'' (1913)</ref> Despite determined resistance from the [[House of Lords]] to the Bill, this Act gave more parliamentary power to the liberals, while reducing the political force of the working class, leaving them detached from the main body of middle class support on which they had relied. Having achieved the Reform Act of 1832, the Radical alliance was broken until the Liberal-Labour alliance of the Edwardian period.<ref>G. D. H. Cole, ''Short History of the British Working Class Movement, 1787-1947.'' London, George Allen & Unwin (1948), pp. 63-69. "The Reform Movement"</ref>

=== Chartist movement ===
{{main|Chartism}}
[[File:Chartist meeting on Kennington Common by William Edward Kilburn 1848 - restoration1.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Chartism|Chartist]] meeting, [[Kennington Common]], 1848]]
The [[Chartism|Chartist movement]] in nineteenth-century Britain sought [[universal suffrage]]. A historian of the Chartist movement observed that "The Chartist movement was essentially an economic movement with a purely political programme."<ref>G.D.H. Cole, ''Short History of the British Working Class Movement, 1787-1947.'' London, George Allen & Unwin (1948), p. 94 "The Rise of Chartism"</ref> A period of bad trade and high [[food prices]] set in, and the drastic restrictions on [[Poor Law]] relief were a source of acute distress. The [[London Working Men's Association]], under the guidance of [[Francis Place]], found itself in the midst of a great unrest. In the northern textile districts the Chartists, led by [[Feargus O'Connor]], a follower of [[Daniel O'Connell]], denounced the inadequate Poor Laws. This was basically a hunger revolt, springing from unemployment and despair. In Birmingham, the older [[Birmingham Political Union]] sprang to life under the leadership of [[Thomas Attwood (economist)|Thomas Attwood]]. The Chartist movement demanded basic economic reforms, higher wages and better conditions of work, and a repeal of the obnoxious Poor Law Act.<ref>Chartism (Pocket Histories)Asa Briggs, ''Chartism'' (1998).</ref>

The idea of universal male suffrage, an initial goal of the Chartist movement, was to include all males as voters regardless of their social standing. This later evolved into a campaign for universal suffrage. This movement sought to redraw the parliamentary districts within Great Britain and create a salary system for elected officials so workers could afford to represent their constituents without a burden on their families.

=== Women's rights movement ===
{{main|Women's suffrage}}
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]]]]
[[File:Wollstonecraft-right-of-woman.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'', 1792]]
Many consider [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) to be the source of the reformers' long-running campaign for feminist inclusion and the origin of the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement. [[Harriet Taylor]] was a significant influence on [[John Stuart Mill]]'s work and ideas, reinforcing Mill's advocacy of [[women's rights]]. Her essay, "Enfranchisement of Women," appeared in the ''Westminster Review'' in 1851 in response to a speech by [[Lucy Stone]] given at the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850, and it was reprinted in the United States.  Mill cites Taylor's influence in his final revision of ''On Liberty,'' (1859) which was published shortly after her death, and she appears to be obliquely referenced in Mill's ''The Subjection of Women.''<ref>[http://feminism.eserver.org/history/docs/subjection-of-women.txt John Stuart Mill, ''The Subjection of Women,'' The Feminism and Women's Studies site (e-text)]</ref>

A militant campaign to include women in the electorate originated in Victorian times. [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]'s husband, Richard Pankhurst, was a supporter of the women's suffrage movement and had been the author of the Married Women's Property Acts of 1870 and 1882. In 1889, Pankhurst founded the unsuccessful [[Women's Franchise League]], and in October 1903 she founded the better-known [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (later dubbed 'suffragettes' by the ''Daily Mail''),<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr. Balfour and the 'Suffragettes.' Hecklers Disarmed by the Ex-Premier's Patience |work=Daily Mail |date=10 January 1906 |page=5}}</ref> an organization famous for its militancy. Led by Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia, the campaign culminated in 1918, when the British Parliament the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who were householders, the wives of householders, occupiers of the property with an annual rent of £5, and graduates of British universities. There was also Warner's suffrage movement.

=== Reform in Parliament ===
[[File:Charles Grey - 2nd Earl Grey - atop the Grey Momument - Newcastle upon Tyne - England - 140804.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]] [[Grey's Monument|Monument]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]]]
[[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] and [[Robert Peel]] were leaders of Parliament during the earlier years of the British reform movement. Grey and Melbourne were of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party, and their governments saw [[Reform Bill of 1832|parliamentary reform]], the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] throughout the British Empire, and [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law reform]]. Peel was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], whose Ministry took an important step in the direction of [[protectionism|tariff reform]] with the abolition of the [[Corn Laws]].

[[File:Gladstone2.jpg|thumb|120px|[[William Ewart Gladstone]] as Palmerston's [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]]]
[[William Ewart Gladstone]] was a reformer. Among the reforms he helped Parliament pass was a system of public education in the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]].  In 1872, he saw the institution of a [[secret ballot]] to prevent voter coercion, trickery and bribery.  By 1885, Gladstone had readjusted the parliamentary district lines by making each district equal in population, preventing one MP from having greater influence than another.

** [[Oneida Community|Oneida Commune]] (founder: [[John Noyes]]), practiced [[eugenics]], [[complex marriage]], and [[communal living]]. The commune was supported through the manufacture of [[silver (household)|silverware]], and the corporation still exists today, producing spoons and forks for households of the world. The commune sold its assets when Noyes was jailed on numerous charges.
** [[Shakers]] – (founder: [[Mother Ann Lee]]) Stressed living and worship through dance, supported themselves through manufacture of [[furniture]]. The furniture is still popular today.

[[Noah Webster]]'s dictionary standardized English spelling and language; [[William McGuffey]]'s hugely successful children's books taught reading in incremental stages.
* Moral reform – Female movement that began in the 1830s to end prostitution and the sexual double standard. Groups, such as the [[New York Female Moral Reform Society]], were organized by women in the Northeast. These moral reform societies published magazines and journals to spread their message. By 1841 there were about 50,000 women in 616 local moral reform societies in the North.<ref>'''''Introduction'''''. Included in '''''What Was the Appeal of Moral Reform to Antebellum Northern Women, 1835-1841?''''', by Daniel Wright and Kathryn Kish Sklar.

Anthony]] joined the cause in 1851 and worked ceaselessly for [[women's suffrage]].
* [[Labor history of the United States|American labor movement]] – The campaign against excessive hours of work (and for the [[eight-hour day]]) was a central issue for the labor movement during the 19th century.  The [[Knights of Labor]], organized among the [[Skill (labor)|skilled trades]] in 1869 and led by [[Uriah Stephens]], [[Terence V.

{{main|La Reforma}}
[[File:Benito Juarez Presidente.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Benito Juárez]]]]
The Mexican Liberal Party, led by [[Benito Juárez]] and [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]], guided the emergence of [[Mexico]], as a [[nation state]], from [[colonialism]].  It envisioned a modern civil society and [[Capitalism|capitalist economy]]. All citizens were [[Equality before the law|equal before the law]], and Mexico's 1829 [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] was reaffirmed. The Liberal program, documented in the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]], was based on:<ref>Brian R. Hamnett, "Reform Laws" in Michael S. Werner, ed. Encyclopedia of Mexico: History, Society & Culture (1997) Volume: 2 pp 1239–41.</ref>
* Abolition of the ''[[fuero]]s'' which had granted civil immunity to members of the church and military
* Liquidation of traditional ''[[ejido]]'' communal land holdings and distribution of freehold titles to the peasantry (the Ley Lerdo)
* Expropriation and sale of concentrated church property holdings (beyond the clergy's religious needs)

== Ottoman Empire: 1840s–1870s ==
{{main|Tanzimat}}
The Tanzimat, meaning ''reorganization'' of the [[Ottoman Empire]], was a period of reformation that began in 1839 and ended with the [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional Era]] in 1876. The Tanzimat reform era was characterized by various attempts to modernize the [[Ottoman Empire]], to secure its territorial integrity against nationalist movements and aggressive powers. The reforms encouraged [[Ottomanism]] among the diverse ethnic groups of the Empire, attempting to stem the tide of [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire]]. The reforms attempted to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society by enhancing their civil liberties and granting them equality throughout the Empire. Peasants often opposed the reforms because they upset traditional relationships.<ref>E. Attıla Aytekın,  "Peasant protest in the late Ottoman Empire: Moral economy, revolt, and the Tanzimat reforms." International Review of Social History 57.2 (2012): 191-227.</ref>

== Russia 1860s ==
{{Main| Government reforms of Alexander II of Russia|Emancipation reform of 1861}}
[[File:Александр II.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] ]]
The [[Russian Empire]] in the 19th century was characterized by very conservative and reactionary policies issued by the autocratic tsars. The great exception came during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (1855–1881), especially the 1860s. By far the greatest and most unexpected was the abolition of serfdom, which affected 23 million of the Empire's population of 74 million. They belonged to the state, to monasteries and to 104,000 rich gentry landowners.<ref>Wayne Vucinich, ed. '' The Peasant in Nineteenth-Century Russia'' (1968) p 41.</ref>  `

===Emancipation of the serfs 1861===
The [[emancipation reform of 1861]] that freed the 23 million serfs was the single most important event in 19th-century Russian history, and the beginning of the end for the landed aristocracy's monopoly of power. Emancipation brought a supply of free labour to the cities, stimulating industry, and allowed the middle class to grow in number and influence. The freed peasants did not receive any free land. They had to pay a special tax for what amounted to their lifetime to the government, which in turn paid the landlords a generous price for the land that they had lost. All the property turned over to the peasants was owned collectively by the ''mir'', the village community, which divided the land among the peasants and supervised the various holdings. Although serfdom was abolished, since its abolition was achieved on terms unfavourable to the peasants, revolutionary tensions were not abated, despite Alexander II's intentions. Revolutionaries believed that the newly freed serfs were merely being sold into [[wage slavery]] in the onset of the industrial revolution, and that the [[bourgeoisie]] had effectively replaced landowners.<ref>David Moon, ''The abolition of serfdom in Russia 1762–1907'' (Longman, 2001)</ref>

===Judicial reforms===
{{Main|Judicial reform of Alexander II}}
The judicial reforms were among the most successful and consistent of all his reforms.<ref>Ben Eklof, John Bushnell, and Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, eds. ''Russia's great reforms, 1855-1881'' (Indiana UP, 1994) pp 214-46.</ref> A completely new court system and order of legal proceedings were established. The main results were the introduction of a unified [[judicial system of the Russian Empire|judicial system]] instead of a cumbersome set of [[estates of the realm]] courts, and fundamental changes in criminal trials. The latter included the establishment of the principle of [[Equality before the law|equality of the parties involved]], the introduction of public [[Hearing (law)|hearings]], the [[jury trial]], and a professional advocate that had never existed in Russia. However, there were also problems, as certain obsolete institutions were not covered by the reform. Also, the reform was hindered by [[extrajudicial punishment]], introduced on a widespread scale during the reigns of his successors – [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].<ref>Richard Wortman, "Russian monarchy and the rule of law: New considerations of the court reform of 1864." ''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'' 6.1 (2005): 145-170.</ref> One of the most important results of the reform was wide introduction of [[jury trial]]s. The jury trial included three professional judges and twelve jurors. A juror had to possess real estate of a certain value. Unlike in modern jury trials, jurors not only could decide whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty but also could decide that the defendant was guilty but not to be punished, as Alexander II believed that [[justice]] without [[morality]] is wrong. The sentence was rendered by professional judges.<ref>Samuel Kucherov,  "The Jury as Part of the Russian Judicial Reform of 1864." ''American Slavic and East European Review'' 9.2 (1950): 77-90.</ref>

===Additional reforms===
A host of new reforms followed in diverse areas.<ref>W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The great reforms: Autocracy, bureaucracy, and the politics of change in imperial Russia'' (Northern Illinois UP, 1990.</ref><ref>Ben Eklof, John Bushnell, and Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, eds.

Military reforms included universal conscription, introduced for all social classes on 1 January 1874.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'' p. 150.</ref>

A new judicial administration (1864), based on the French model, introduced security of tenure.<ref>An Introduction to Russian History (1976), edited by Robert Auty and Dimitri Obolensky, chapter by John Keep, p. 238</ref> A new [[penal code]] and [[judicial reform of Alexander II|a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure]] also came into operation.<ref>Wallace,   "Alexander II" (1910) pp. 559–61.</ref> Reorganisation of the judiciary occurred to include trial in open court, with judges appointed for life, a jury system and the creation of justices of the peace to deal with minor offences at local level.

Alexander's bureaucracy instituted an elaborate scheme of local self-government ([[zemstvo]]) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of taxation, and a new rural and municipal police under the direction of the [[MVD (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]].<ref>Wallace, "Alexander II" (1910) pp. 559–61.</ref>

The Alaska colony was losing money, and would be impossible to defend and wartime against Britain, so in 1867 Russia [[Alaska Purchase|sold Alaska]] to the United States for $7.2 million (equivalent to roughly $200 million in current dollars). The Russian administrators, soldiers, settlers, and some of the priests returned home. Others stayed to minister to their native parishioners, who remain members of the Russian Orthodox Church into the 21st century.<ref>James R. Gibson, "Why the Russians Sold Alaska." ''Wilson Quarterly'' 3.3 (1979): 179-188. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40255691 Online]</ref>

== Turkey: 1920s–1930s ==
{{main|Atatürk's Reforms}}
[[Atatürk's Reforms]] were a series of significant political, legal, cultural, social and economic changes that were implemented under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in the 1920s and 1930s in the new [[Republic of Turkey]]<ref>Robert Ward, and Dankwart Rustow, eds. ''Political Modernization in Japan and Turkey'' (1964).</ref>

In the years between 1919 and 1923 Mustafa Kemal was at the forefront of the Turkish War of Independence and involved with the eradication of the antiquated institutions of the Osmanic Empire and in laying the foundations of the new Turkish State. He approached the National Congresses of Erzurum and Sivas to organise and lift the morale of the people in its determined opposition to the Forces of the Entente who were occupying Anatolia. By the end of these conventions he had managed to convey the message that the idea and the ideals of outdated imperialism ought be dropped so that people within the national boundaries could make decisions in accordance with the principles and general guidelines of an effective national policy. After the occupation of Istanbul by the Forces of the Entente he laid the foundations for the new Turkish State when in 1920 he united the Great National Assembly in Ankara. With the government of the Great National Assembly, of which he was President, Mustafa Kemal fought the Forces of the Entente and the Sultan's army which had remained there in collaboration with the occupying forces. Finally, on 9 September 1922 he succeeded in driving the Allied Forces back to Izmir, along with the other forces which had managed to penetrate the heartland of Anatolia. By this action he saved the country from invasion by foreign forces.<ref>Ali Kazancigil and Ergun Özbudun, ''Ataturk: Founder of a Modern State'' (1982).</ref>
