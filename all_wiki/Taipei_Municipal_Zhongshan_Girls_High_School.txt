==History==

===Empire of Japan===
Initially named {{nihongo|'''First Girls' Affiliated Japanese School of the Governor-General of Taiwan'''|臺灣總督府國語學校第一附屬學校女子分教場|lead=yes}}, the school was first located in modern-day [[Shilin District]], Taipei in 1897 as the first public school for Taiwanese female students. In 1911, the school was relocated to ''Manka'' ([[Wanhua District]]) and underwent several name changes. During this early period, main subjects in the curriculum included Japanese language and handicraft art. More subjects were provided after the 1900s such as etiquette, home economics, arithmetic, music, calligraphy, painting and PE lessons.<ref name="Zhongshan History">{{Cite web|url=http://www.csghs.tp.edu.tw/Zhongshan/english/history.htm|website=Taipei Municipal Zhong-Shan Girls' Senior High School|title=Zhongshan History|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref>

In 1922, Japanese Government in Taiwan launched its second education reform {{nihongo4||臺灣教育令}} that encouraged to provide Japanese and Taiwanese students equal opportunity for secondary education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web1.hlhs.hlc.edu.tw/history1/ch2-1.htm#_ftn3|title=Education Policy and Establishment of HLHS (Mandarin)|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> The school was thus renamed as {{nihongo4|'''Taihoku Prefectural Taihoku Third Girls' High School'''|台北州立台北第三高等女學校}} and started a more formal secondary education structure targeting female students from grade 10 to 12. More academic subjects were also added into the curriculum during this period. In 1937, the school was relocated to the current address. The first building of the new campus (now Yat-Sen Building) was built in 1936 and is still in use today.<ref name="Zhongshan History"/>

===Republic of China===
In 1945, Taiwan was [[Retrocession Day|handed over from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Under the ruling of the new [[Government of the Republic of China|Republic of China government]], the school was renamed as '''Taiwan Provincial Taipei Second Girls' High School''' (臺灣省立臺北第二女子中學) on December 8, 1945. This date became the school's anniversary which is still celebrated today. Japanese and related lessons were deleted from the curriculum while subjects like civil rights, Chinese language and culture were added and emphasized. During this period the school's student union, Chinese drama club, Western drama club, and basketball team were famous national-wide.<ref name="Zhongshan History"/>

In 1968, the school was renamed after the revolutionary leader Sun Zhongshan as '''Taipei Municipal Zhongshan Girls High School''', commonly known in English as [[Sun Yat-sen]].
