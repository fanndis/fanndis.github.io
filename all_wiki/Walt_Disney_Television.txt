==History==

===ABC Group===
In 1996, Disney acquired [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.]], and initially re-branded the holding media conglomerate as ABC Group. The assets acquired at the time included ABC Television Network Group, CC/ABC Broadcasting Group ([[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio Network]], eight TV and 21 radio stations), ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group, CC/ABC Publishing Group and CC/ABC Multimedia Group to the fold. The Cable and International Broadcast Group contained ownership shares of [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN, Inc.]] (80%), [[A&E Networks|A&E Television Networks]] (37.5%), [[DIC Productions, L.P.]] (Limited Partnership stake), [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] (50%) and its international investments. These investments included [[Tele München Gruppe|Tele-München]] (50%, Germany; included 20% of [[RTL II]]), Hamster Productions. (33%, France) and [[Scandinavian Broadcasting System]] (23%, Luxembourg). ESPN also had international holdings: [[Eurosport]] (33.3%, England), TV Sport (10%, France; [[Eurosport]] affiliate) and The Japan Sports Channel (20%). The Publishing Group including [[Fairchild Publications]], [[Chilton Company|Chilton Publications]], multiple newspapers from a dozen dailies (including the [[Ft.

=== WDTT history===
On August 24, 1994, with [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]'s resignation, a reorganization of Disney took place in which [[Richard H. Frank]] became head of newly formed Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications, which was split from its filmed entertainment business, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |date=August 25, 1994 |title=Chairman of Disney Studios Resigns |work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/25/business/chairman-of-disney-studios-resigns.html |access-date=April 28, 2014}}</ref> On December 5, 1994, Walt Disney Computer Software was transferred within WDTT as [[Disney Interactive]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Polsson |first=Ken |title=July to December 1994 |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1994jul.htm |access-date=December 6, 2012 |website=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company |publisher=Ken Polsson}} sources:<br />*{{Cite book |last=Fisher |first=Maxine |title=Walt Disney |year=1988 |pages=A8}}<br />*{{Cite news |date=December 6, 1994 |pages=D5 |work=The New York Times}}<!--|accessdate=December 6, 2012|date=February 1995 |journal=CD-ROM Today |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=26}}<br />*{{Cite journal |date=March 1995 |journal=Windows Magazine |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=42}}</ref> At the end of his contract on April 30, 1995, Frank left Disney.<ref name="nyt">{{Cite news |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |date=March 7, 1995 |title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Top Disney TV Official May Leave |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/business/the-media-business-top-disney-tv-official-may-leave.html |access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> [[Dennis Hightower]], a marketing executive, was appointed by April 9 to succeed Frank.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |date=April 9, 1995 |title=Clouds Over Disneyland |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/business/clouds-over-disneyland.html |access-date=March 17, 2019 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
