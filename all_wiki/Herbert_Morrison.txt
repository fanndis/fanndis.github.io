'''Herbert Stanley Morrison, Baron Morrison of Lambeth''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|PC}} (3 January 1888 – 6 March 1965) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour politician]] who held a variety of senior positions in the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]]. During the inter-war period, he was Minister of Transport during the [[1929–1931 Labour Government]], then, after losing his seat in Parliament in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], became Leader of the [[London County Council]] in the 1930s. Returning to the Commons in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]], he was defeated by [[Clement Attlee]] in the [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election that year]], but later acted as [[Home Secretary]] in the wartime coalition.

Morrison organised Labour's victorious 1945 election campaign, and was appointed [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] in [[Attlee ministry|Attlee's governments of 1945–51]]. Attlee, Morrison, [[Ernest Bevin]], [[Stafford Cripps]] and (initially) [[Hugh Dalton]] formed the "Big Five" who dominated those governments. Morrison oversaw Labour's nationalisation programme, although he opposed [[Aneurin Bevan|Aneurin Bevan's]] proposals for a nationalised hospital service as part of the setting up of the [[National Health Service]]. Morrison developed his social views from his work in local politics and always emphasised the importance of public works to deal with unemployment. In the final year of Attlee's premiership, Morrison had an unhappy term as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. He was hailed as  "Lord Festival" for his successful leadership of the [[Festival of Britain]], a critical and popular success in 1951 that attracted millions of visitors to fun-filled educational exhibits and events in London and across the country.

Morrison was widely expected to succeed Attlee as Labour leader, but Attlee, who disliked him, postponed stepping down until 1955. Morrison, who was by then considered too old, came a poor third in the ensuing [[1955 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election]].<ref>Laybourn, Keith (2002) “Morrison, Herbert Stanley” in John Ramsden, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198601344}}. pp. 443–44</ref>

==Early life==
Morrison was born in Stockwell, [[Lambeth, London]], to Priscilla (née Lyon; died 1907) and Henry Morrison (died 1917), one of six children who survived infancy. Henry Morrison was a police constable, whose Conservative political opinions his son would later come to disagree with strongly.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

As a baby, he permanently lost the sight in his right eye due to infection. He attended Stockwell Road Primary School and, from the age of 11, St Andrew's Church of England School. He left school at 14 to become an errand boy. His early politics were radical, and he briefly flirted with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] over the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP). As a [[conscientious objector]], he worked in a market garden in [[Letchworth]] in World War One.<ref name="Howell"/>

==Political career==

===Early career===

Morrison eventually became a pioneer leader in the London Labour Party. He was elected to the [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney]] in 1919 when the Labour Party won control of the Borough, and he was Mayor in 1920–21. Morrison was a follower of [[Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient FC]] and became a shareholder in the club. He was elected to the [[London County Council]] (LCC) in 1922 and at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] he became [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hackney South (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South]], but lost that seat the following year when [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s first administration lost the general election.<ref name=Howell>Howell, David (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35121 "Morrison, Herbert Stanley, Baron Morrison of Lambeth (1888–1965)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press; {{DOI|10.1093/ref:odnb/35121}}</ref>

Morrison returned to Parliament in the 1929 general election, and MacDonald appointed him Minister of Transport. Morrison, like many others in the party, was deeply disheartened by MacDonald's national government, and he lost his seat again in 1931.

===London===
Morrison continued to sit on the London County Council and in 1933 was elected to lead the Labour Group. He wrote a book ''Socialisation and Transport : the Organisation of Socialised Industries with Particular Reference to the London Passenger Transport Bill'' which encapsulated his ideas on nationalisation. Managers would be appointed to run monopoly industries in the public interest. He did not, however, envisage democratic control by the workers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kynaston|first1=David|authorlink=David Kynaston|title=A World to Build|date=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747585404|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldtobuild0000kyna/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/worldtobuild0000kyna/page/24}}</ref>  Unexpectedly, Labour won the 1934 LCC election and Morrison became Leader of the council. This gave him control of almost all local government services in London. His main achievements here included the unification of bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (colloquially known as London Transport) in 1933, and creating the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] around the suburbs. He confronted the Government over its refusal to finance the replacement of [[Waterloo Bridge]], and eventually they agreed to pay 60% of the cost of the new bridge.<ref name=Howell/>

In the 1935 election, Morrison was once again elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and immediately [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|challenged Attlee for the leadership]] of the party. He was defeated by a wide margin in the final ballot, a defeat ascribed to his unfamiliarity with the MPs who had served in the previous Parliament. Both he and his supporter Hugh Dalton put some of the blame on the Masonic [[New Welcome Lodge]], who, they claimed, backed the third-place leadership candidate [[Arthur Greenwood]] and then switched their votes to Attlee.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Masons' Candidate: New Welcome Lodge No. 5139 and the Parliamentary Labour Party|journal=Labour History Review|volume =71|issue=1|date=April 2006 |pages=9–41(33)|doi=10.1179/174581806X103862 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233637409|last1=Hamill|first1=John|last2=Prescott|first2=Andrew}} This cites as note number 2 H. Morrison, ''Herbert Morrison: An Autobiography by Lord Morrison of Lambeth'', London, Odhams, 1960, p. 164</ref> After losing, Morrison concentrated on his LCC work. He convinced Labour to adopt the new electioneering techniques that opponents had been using, especially using advertising agencies in the 1937 local elections.<ref>Dominic Wring, "“Selling socialism”-The marketing of the “very old” British Labour Party." ''European Journal of Marketing'' 35#9/10 (2001): 1038-1046. [https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/1085/3/Wring06.pdf online]</ref>  For example, he stressed housing, education and his own leadership with posters featuring Morrison alongside children and with a backdrop of new LCC flats above slogans such as "Labour Puts Human Happiness First", "Labour Gets Things Done" and "Let Labour Finish the Job."<ref>Donoughue and Jones, 1972, pp. 209-11</ref>

In 1939, Conservative MPs defeated Herbert Morrison's bill introducing "site value rating", a tax on similar lines to [[Land Value Tax]], in the old London County Council area.<ref>Wetzel, Dave (20 September 2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205200141/http://www.newstatesman.com/200409200007 The case for taxing land]. ''New Statesman''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landvaluetax.org/government-papers/london-rating-site-values-a-bill.html|title=London Rating (Site Values) — A Bill|accessdate=22 December 2008|publisher=Land Value Taxation Campaign}}</ref>

By the late 1960s, long after Morrison had left the leadership of the London County Council, London Conservatives frequently accused him of seeking to "build the Tories out of London",<ref>[[Ken Young]], John Kramer, ''Strategy and conflict in metropolitan housing'' (Heinemann Educational, 1978), p. 262.</ref> the implication being that the LCC would deliberately build council houses in order to affect local voting patterns. His biographers, [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoghue]] and [[George William Jones|George W. Jones]], have written that "Morrison never said or wrote" the words attributed to him.<ref>Donoghue and Jones, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician''. p. xxxi</ref>

===Wartime Coalition===

In 1940, Morrison was appointed the first [[Minister of Supply]] by [[Winston Churchill]], but shortly afterwards succeeded Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] as Home Secretary. Morrison's London experience in local government was particularly useful during [[the Blitz]], and the [[Air-raid shelter#Morrison shelter|Morrison shelter]] was named after him. He made radio appeals for more fire guards in December 1940 ('Britain shall not burn').<ref>audiobook titled ''The Blitz''</ref>

Morrison had to take many potentially unpopular and controversial decisions by the nature of wartime circumstances. On 21 January 1941, he banned the [[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Daily Worker]] for opposing war with Germany and supporting the Soviet Union. The ban lasted for a total of 18 months before it was rescinded.

The arrival of black American troops caused concern in the government, leading Morrison, the Home Secretary, to comment "I am fully conscious that a difficult social problem might be created if there were a substantial number of sex relations between white women and coloured troops and the procreation of half-caste children." That was in a memorandum for the cabinet in 1942.<ref>[http://www.nickelinthemachine.com/2011/05/marc-blitzstein-roland-hayes-and-the-negro-chorus-at-the-royal-albert-hall-in-1943/ Marc Blitzstein, Roland Hayes and the ‘Negro Chorus’ at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943]. nickelinthemachine.com. May 2011</ref>  In 1942, Morrison was confronted with an appeal from the Central British Fund for German Jewry (now [[World Jewish Relief]]) to admit 350 Jewish children from [[Vichy France]].<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. ''Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945.'' London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, p.175</ref> Although [[Case Anton]] ensured the scheme's failure, Morrison had been reluctant to accept it beforehand, wanting to avoid provoking the ‘anti-foreign and anti-semitic feeling which was quite certainly latent in this country (and in some isolated cases not at all latent)’.<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. ''Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945.'' London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, p.17</ref>

In 1943, he ran for the post of [[Treasurer of the Labour Party]] but lost a close contest to [[Arthur Greenwood]].<ref>Whiting, R. C. (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/33/101033543/ "Greenwood, Arthur (1880–1954)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

===Deputy Prime Minister===

After the end of the war, Morrison was instrumental in drafting the Labour Party's 1945 manifesto ''Let us Face the Future''.<ref name=Howell/> He organised the general election campaign and enlisted the help of left-wing cartoonist [[Philip Zec]], with whom he had clashed during the early stages of the war when, as Minister of Supply, he took exception to an illustration commenting on the costs of supplying the country with petrol.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090924150056/http://www.politicalcartoon.co.uk/html/history/contentious-cartoon.html Contentious Cartoon by Dr Tim Benson ], PoliticalCartoon.co.uk</ref><ref>''Tabloid Nation: The Birth of the Daily Mirror to the Death of the Tabloid'', by Chris Horrie, André Deutsch (2003)</ref> Labour won a massive and unexpected victory, and Morrison was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the House of Commons, having switched his own seat to [[Lewisham East (UK Parliament constituency)|Lewisham East]]. He was the chief sponsor of the [[Festival of Britain]].

Morrison supervised the major Labour programme of nationalising large sectors of industry. As Lord President chaired the committee on the Socialization of Industries, he followed the model that was already in place of setting up public corporations, such as the [[BBC]] in broadcasting (1927). The owners of corporate stock were given government bonds, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, only now they became public servants working for the government. For the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a method to consolidate national planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure.<ref>Sked, Alan and Cook, Chris (1979) ''Post-War Britain: A Political History''. {{ISBN|0140179127}}. pp 31–34</ref><ref>Beer, Samuel H. (1965) ''British Politics in the Collectivist Age''. pp 188–216</ref>

In July 1946, Morrison, together with US ambassador [[Henry F. Grady]] proposed "The [[Morrison-Grady Plan]]", intended to resolve the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], calling for federalisation under overall British trusteeship. Ultimately, the plan was rejected by both [[Palestinians]] and [[Israelis]].

After Ernest Bevin's resignation as Foreign Secretary, Morrison took over his role, but did not feel at ease in the Foreign Office. He took an aggressive stance against [[Iran]]'s nationalist Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] and approved his overthrow.<ref>{{citation|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~simpson/Hist%20725%20Summer%202006/The%20US%20and%20Mossadegh%201951-1953.pdf |title=The United States, Great Britain, and Mossadegh |author=Painter, David S. |publisher=Georgetown University |isbn=1-56927-332-4 |year=1988 |accessdate=23 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117190807/http://userpages.umbc.edu/~simpson/Hist%20725%20Summer%202006/The%20US%20and%20Mossadegh%201951-1953.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His tenure there was cut short by Labour's defeat in the 1951 general election, and he was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] in November that year.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39396 |date=30 November 1951 |page=6235 |supp=y}}</ref>

===Festival of Britain===
{{Main|Festival of Britain}}
[[File:In16695.jpg|thumb|right|The 300-foot-tall [[Skylon (Festival of Britain)|Skylon]] at the [[Festival of Britain]], 1951]]
Morrison lacked a deep concern for foreign affairs, but he was an enthusiastic leader of a major domestic project, the [[Festival of Britain]].  Starting in 1947, he was the prime mover of the 1951 fair. The original goal was to celebrate the centennial of the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]].<ref>Bernard Donoughue, and G. W. Jones, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' (1973), pp 492-95.</ref>   However, the plans were changed. It was not to be another [[World Fair]], and international themes were absent; even the Commonwealth was ignored. Instead, the Festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of £12-million. The Conservatives gave little support. The Labour government was losing support, and the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war's devastation, as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts.<ref>F.M. Leventhal, "'A Tonic to the Nation': The Festival of Britain, 1951." Albion 27#3 (1995): 445-453.</ref> Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] says the Festival was a "triumphant success" as thousands:
:flocked to the South Bank site, to wander around the [[Dome of Discovery]], gaze at the [[Skylon (Festival of Britain)|Skylon]], and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration. Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm. A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom, showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself....Above all, the Festival made a spectacular setting as a showpiece for the inventiveness and genius of British scientists and technologists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth O.

===End of political career===

Although Morrison had effectively been Attlee's heir presumptive since the 1930s, Attlee had always distrusted him. Attlee remained as Leader through the early 1950s and fought the 1955 election, finally announcing his retirement after Labour's defeat. Morrison was then 67, and was seen to be too old to embark on a new leadership role. During the leadership election, he was the interim [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. Although he stood, he finished last, by a wide margin, of the three candidates, with many of his supporters switching to [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. Gaitskell won the election, and Morrison resigned as Deputy Leader.

During the [[Suez Crisis]], Morrison advocated unilateral action by the United Kingdom against Egypt, following Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal. Morrison stood down at the 1959 general election and was made a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Morrison of Lambeth''', of [[Lambeth]] in the [[County of London]] on 2 November 1959.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=41860 |date=3 November 1959 |page=6942 |nolink=y}}</ref> He was appointed President of the [[British Board of Film Censors]].

== Personal life ==
While working in a market garden in [[Letchworth]] during World War One, Morrison met his first wife, Margaret Kent (1896–1953), a secretary and daughter of a railway clerk. The couple married on 15 March 1919. His total involvement in politics, however, meant that theirs was not a happy marriage; his later autobiography made no mention of Kent or their daughter, Mary.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Following Kent's death in July 1953, Morrison married Edith Meadowcroft (''b''. ''c''.1908), a businesswoman of Conservative politics. The pair married on 6 January 1955 and their relationship appeared much more successful.<ref name="Howell" />

Morrison's grandson [[Peter Mandelson]] was a cabinet minister in the Labour governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]].

==Death==

He died on 6 March 1965, coincidentally in the same month as the London County Council was abolished.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==TV portrayal==

Morrison was Foreign Secretary at the time of the defection of the double agents [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]]. In the 1977 Granada TV play ''Philby, Burgess and Maclean'' by Iain Curteis, [[Arthur Lowe]] appeared as Morrison – glowering to the camera in his final shot to show the opaque right lens of his spectacles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/988625/index.html/ |title=Philby, Burgess and Maclean (1977) |last=Angelini |first=Sergio |website=BFI screenonline |access-date=19 January 2020}}</ref>
