Like many universities, the economic depression slowed construction and expansion on the campus. The university replaced the original university hall with Gregory Hall and the [[Illini Union]]. After World War II, the university experienced rapid growth. The enrollment doubled and the academic standing improved.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/07/obituaries/david-d-henry-89-president-of-illinois-u-in-time-of-tumult.html | work=The New York Times | title=David .

===University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign===
By 1967 the [[University of Illinois system]] consisted of a main campus in Champaign-Urbana and two Chicago campuses, Chicago Circle (UICC) and Medical Center (UIMC), and people began using "Urbana–Champaign" or the reverse to refer to the main campus specifically. The university name officially changed to the "University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign" around 1982. While this was a reversal of the commonly used designation for the metropolitan area, "[[Champaign-Urbana]]," most of the campus is located in Urbana. The name change established a separate identity for the main campus within the University of Illinois system, which today includes campuses in Springfield ([[University of Illinois at Springfield|UIS]]) and Chicago ([[University of Illinois at Chicago|UIC]]) (formed by the merger of UICC and UIMC).

In 1998, the Hallene Gateway Plaza was dedicated. The Plaza features the original sandstone portal of University Hall, which was originally the fourth building on campus.<ref name="UIHistories"/> In recent years, state support has declined from 4.5% of the state's tax appropriations in 1980 to 2.28% in 2011, a nearly 50% decline.<ref>{{cite web| title=University of Illinois FY2010 Budget Request| url=http://www.pb.uillinois.edu/Documents/budgetbook/FY2012Budgetbook.pdf| access-date=May 26, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616172334/http://www.pb.uillinois.edu/Documents/budgetbook/FY2012Budgetbook.pdf| archive-date=June 16, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>  As a result, the university's budget has shifted away from relying on state support with nearly 84% of the budget now coming from other sources.<ref name="illinois1">{{cite web |url=http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/budgetchart1.html |title=Budget by Source of Funds &#124; Stewarding Excellence @ Illinois |publisher=Oc.illinois.edu |access-date=July 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305234310/http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/budgetchart1.html |archive-date=March 5, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The main research and academic facilities are divided almost evenly between the twin cities of [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], which form part of the [[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area]]. The [[UIUC College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences|College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences']] research fields stretch south from Urbana and Champaign into [[Savoy, Illinois|Savoy]] and [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign County]]. The university maintains formal gardens and a conference center in nearby [[Monticello, Illinois|Monticello]] at [[Robert Allerton Park|Allerton Park]].
Four main quads compose the center of the university and are arranged from north to south. The Beckman Quadrangle and the [[John Bardeen]] Quadrangle occupy the center of the [[UIUC Engineering Campus|Engineering Campus]]. [[Boneyard Creek]] flows through the John Bardeen Quadrangle, paralleling Green Street. The Beckman Quadrangle, named after [[Arnold Orville Beckman]], is primarily composed of research units and laboratories, and features a large solar calendar consisting of an obelisk and several copper fountains. The Main Quadrangle and South Quadrangle follow immediately after the John Bardeen Quad. The former makes up a large part of the [[UIUC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences|Liberal Arts and Sciences]] portion of the campus, while the latter comprises many of the buildings of the [[UIUC College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences|College of ACES]] spread across the campus map.<ref>{{cite web| title=Campus map

=== Sustainability ===
In October 2011, the [[Sustainable Endowments Institute]] gave the campus a grade of B for sustainability in its 2011 College Sustainability Report Card. Strengths noted in the report included the campus's adoption of [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] gold standards for all new construction and major renovations and its public accessibility to endowment investment information. The university makes a list of endowment holdings and its shareholder voting record available to the public. The weaknesses are areas such as student involvement and investment priorities. The Student Sustainability Committee is empowered to allocate funding from a clean energy technology fee and a sustainable campus environment fee,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssc.sustainability.illinois.edu/?page_id=5 |title=Student Sustainability Committee |access-date=December 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122032652/http://ssc.sustainability.illinois.edu/?page_id=5 |archive-date=January 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> while the university aims to optimize investment return but has not made any public statements about investigating or investing in renewable energy funds or community development loan funds. However, the biggest weakness of the university's sustainability is its shareholder engagement, as the university has not made any public statements about active ownership or a proxy voting policy.<ref>{{cite web| title=University of Illinois| url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-illinois| access-date=December 9, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003065353/http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-illinois| archive-date=October 3, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>

Currently, the University of Illinois has 11 LEED certified buildings. Three of these are platinum certified (Business Instructional Facility, Lincoln Hall, and Bousfield Hall). Three are gold (National Petascale Computing Facility, Nugent Hall, Wassaja Hall). The rest are silver (Ikenberry Dining Hall, Evers Laboratory, Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory, Illinois Fire Service Institute, and Huff Hall).<ref>{{cite web| title=LEED Certifications| url=http://www.fs.illinois.edu/projects/leed-certifications| access-date=February 15, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214162934/http://fs.illinois.edu/projects/leed-certifications| archive-date=February 14, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref>

In his remarks on the creation of the Office of Sustainability in September 2008, Chancellor [[Richard Herman]] stated, "I want this institution to be the leader in sustainability."<ref>{{cite web | title=Chancellor directs trustees' attention to faculty salaries | url=http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2008/09/11/News/Updated.Chancellor.Directs.Trustees.Attention.To.Faculty.Salaries-3426224.shtml | access-date=October 15, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In February 2008, he signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, committing the University of Illinois to take steps "in pursuit of climate neutrality."<ref>{{cite web| title=American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment| url=http://sustainability.illinois.edu/images/Climate_Commitment.pdf| access-date=October 20, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301222156/http://sustainability.illinois.edu/images/Climate_Commitment.pdf| archive-date=March 1, 2013| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The university offers more than 150 undergraduate and 100 graduate and professional programs in over 15 academic units, among several online specializations such as Digital Marketing and an online MBA program launched in January 2016. In 2015, the university announced its expansion to include an engineering-based medical program, which would be the first new college created in Urbana–Champaign in 60 years.<ref name="chicagotribune.com" /><ref name="news.illinois.edu" /> The university also offers Undergraduate students the opportunity for graduation honors. University Honors is an academic distinction awarded to the highest achieving students. To earn the distinction, students must have a cumulative grade point average of a 3.5/4.0 within the academic year of their graduation and rank within the top 3% of their graduating class. Their names are inscribed on a Bronze Tablet that hangs in the Main Library.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://illinois.edu/academics/honors.html |title=University of Illinois Academics |access-date=February 15, 2017 |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210191126/http://illinois.edu/academics/honors.html |archive-date=February 10, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Several scholar opportunities include "James Scholars" where undergraduate students invited to pursue a specialized course of study for no less than two years of their undergraduate course work, "Chancellor's Scholars" where undergraduate students are invited to participate in the Campus Honors Program (only 125 members admitted per year), and "Senior 100 Honorary", which recognizes graduates for achievements in leadership, academics and campus involvement throughout their undergraduate education.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Leadership Certificate is a multi-semester structured program which aims to develop students' leadership skills through different kinds of curricula and programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoisleadership.uiuc.edu/certificate/ |title=Leadership Certificate |publisher=Illinois Leadership Center |access-date=December 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094825/http://www.illinoisleadership.uiuc.edu/certificate/ |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Student government ====
[[File:Foellinger Auditorium 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Foellinger Auditorium]]]]
U of I has an extensive history of past student governments. Two years after the university opened in 1868, John Milton Gregory and a group of students created a constitution for a student government. Their governance expanded to the entire university in 1873, having a legislative, executive, and judicial branch. For a period of time, this government had the ability to discipline students. In 1883, however, due to a combination of events from Gregory's resignation to student-faculty infighting, the government formally dissolved itself via [[plebiscite]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Solberg|first=Winton|title=The University of Illinois and the Reform of Discipline in the Modern University, 1868-1891|journal=AAUP Bulletin|date=September 1966|volume=52|issue=3|pages=305–314 |jstor=40224166|doi=10.2307/40224166}}</ref>

It wasn't until 1934, when the Student Senate, the next university-wide student government, was created. A year before, future U of I Dean of Students, Fred H. Turner and the university's Senate Committee on Student Affairs gave increased power to the Student Council, an organization primarily known for organizing dances. A year after, the Student Council created a constitution and became the Student Senate, under the oversight of the Committee on Student Affairs. This Student Senate would last for 35 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Student Council, Committee Hold Dinner Meeting|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=DIL19331116|newspaper=[[Daily Illini]]|date=November 16, 1933|access-date=October 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021332/http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=DIL19331116|archive-date=November 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Student Senate changed its purpose and name in 1969, when it became the Undergraduate Student Association (UGSA). It no longer was a representational government, instead becoming a [[collective bargaining agency]]. It often worked with the Graduate Student Association to work on various projects<ref>{{cite web|title=Graduate Student Association Subject File, 1967–71 |url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/archives/uasfa/4162015.pdf |publisher=University of Illinois|access-date=July 17, 2012}}</ref>

In 1967, [[Bruce A. Morrison]] and other U of I graduates founded the Graduate Student Association (GSA). GSA would last until 1978, when it merged with the UGSA to form the Champaign-Urbana Student Association (CUSA).<ref>{{cite news|last=Blan|first=Ken|title=First GSA Meeting Monday|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=DIL19670204|newspaper=Daily Illini|date=February 4, 1967|access-date=October 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127092644/http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=DIL19670204|archive-date=January 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="illinois1948">{{cite web|title=Student Senate Files, 1948–2008|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/archon/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=1370|publisher=University of Illinois|access-date=July 17, 2012}}</ref> CUSA lasted for only 2 years when it was replaced by the Student Government Association (SGA) in 1980.

The current university student government, created in 2004, is the Illinois Student Senate, a combined undergraduate and graduate student senate with 54 voting members. The student senators are elected by college and represent the students in the Urbana–Champaign Senate (which comprises both faculty and students), as well as on a variety of faculty and administrative committees, and are led by an internally elected executive board of a President, External Vice President, Internal Vice President, and Treasurer. {{as of|2012}}, the executive board is supported by an executive staff consisting of a Chief of Staff, Clerk of the Senate, Parliamentarian, Director of Communications, Intern Coordinator, and the Historian of the Senate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iss.illinois.edu/execboard.asp |title=ISS Executive Board |publisher=Iss.illinois.edu |access-date=July 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004063436/http://iss.illinois.edu/execboard.asp |archive-date=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

University housing for undergraduates is provided through twenty-four [[dormitory|residence halls]] in both Urbana and Champaign. Incoming freshmen are required to live in student housing (campus or certified) their first year on campus. Graduate housing is usually offered through two graduate residence halls, restricted to students who are sophomores or above, and through three university-owned apartment complexes. Some undergraduates choose to move into apartments or the Greek houses after their second year. There are a number of private dormitories around campus, as well as 15 private, certified residences that partner with the university to offer a variety of different housing options, including ones that are cooperatives, single-gender or religiously-affiliated.<ref name="PCH16">{{cite web |title=Private Certified Housing FAQ |date=2016 |publisher=Private Certified Housing University of Illinois |url=http://certified.housing.illinois.edu/pch-resources/faqs/ |access-date=November 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102202537/http://certified.housing.illinois.edu/pch-resources/faqs/ |archive-date=November 2, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The university is known for being one of the first universities to provide accommodations for students with disabilities.<ref name="Education secretary UI">{{cite news|last1=Wurth|first1=Julie|title=Education secretary visits UI as part of national tour|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-09-16/education-secretary-visits-ui-part-national-tour.html|access-date=September 21, 2015|publisher=The News Gazette|date=September 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919002550/http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-09-16/education-secretary-visits-ui-part-national-tour.html|archive-date=September 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Currently, most first-year students with disabilities will live in Nugent Hall, supported by the Beckwith Residential Support Services.<ref>{{cite web| title=Beckwith Residential Support Services at Nugent Hall| url=http://disability.illinois.edu/living-accommodations/beckwith-residential-support-services-nugent-hall| access-date=April 19, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402080656/http://www.disability.illinois.edu/living-accommodations/beckwith-residential-support-services-nugent-hall| archive-date=April 2, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, the University of Illinois announced that they would be naming its newest residence hall after [[Carlos Montezuma]] also known as Wassaja.

U of I's Division of Intercollegiate Athletics fields teams for ten men's and eleven women's varsity sports. The university participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I. The university's athletic teams are known as the Fighting Illini. The university operates a number of athletic facilities, including [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] for [[American football|football]], the [[State Farm Center]] for men's and women's basketball, and the Atkins Tennis Center for men's and women's tennis. The men's NCAA basketball team had a dream run in the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 season]], with [[Bruce Weber (coach)|Bruce Weber]]'s Fighting Illini tying the record for most victories in a season. Their run ended 37–2 with a loss to the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]] in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|national championship game]]. Illinois is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], and athletic games are: [[Illinois Loyalty]], the school song, [[Oskee Wow Wow]], the [[fight song]], and [[Marching Illini#Hail to the Orange|Hail to the Orange]], the alma mater.

On October 15, 1910, the Illinois football team defeated the [[University of Chicago]] Maroons with a score of 3–0 in a game that Illinois claims was the first [[homecoming]] game, though several other schools claim to have held the first homecoming as well.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://columbiamissourian.com/sports/story.php?ID=22348|archive-url= https://archive.today/20061024203049/http://columbiamissourian.com/sports/story.php?ID=22348|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2006-10-24|title= Columbia Missourian&nbsp;— Tradition's beginnings mysterious}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Origin of the University Homecoming| url=http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/homecoming/history.pdf| archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060219081820/http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/homecoming/history.pdf| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 19, 2006| access-date=December 13, 2005}}</ref> On November 10, 2007, the unranked Illinois football team defeated the No. 1 ranked [[Ohio State]] football team in [[Ohio Stadium]], the first time that the Illini beat a No. 1 ranked team on the road.

The [[University of Illinois Ice Arena]] is home to the university's club [[college ice hockey]] team competing at the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA Division I]] level and is also available for recreational use through the Division of Campus Recreation. It was built in 1931 and designed by Chicago architecture firm Holabird and Root, the same firm that designed the University of Illinois Memorial Stadium and Chicago's Soldier Field. It is located on Armory Drive across from the Armory. The structure features 4 rows of bleacher seating in an elevated balcony that runs the length of the ice rink on either side. These bleachers provide seating for roughly 1,200 fans, with standing room and bench seating available underneath. Because of this set-up the team benches are actually directly underneath the stands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.campusrec.uiuc.edu/facilities/ice_arena.html | title = Ice Arena Facility|access-date=August 22, 2006|author=Staff

===Chief Illiniwek===
{{Main|Chief Illiniwek}}
[[Chief Illiniwek]], also referred to as "The Chief," was from 1926 to 2007 the official symbol of the University of Illinois in university intercollegiate athletic programs. The Chief was typically portrayed by a student dressed in Sioux regalia. Several groups protested that the use of a Native American figure and indigenous customs in such a manner was inappropriate and promoted ethnic stereotypes. In August 2005 the National Collegiate Athletic Association expressed disapproval of the university's use of a "hostile or abusive" image.<ref name="LAT2005">{{cite news |title=NCAA to crack down on hostile nicknames |first=Robyn |last=Norwood |date=August 6, 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/06/sports/sp-ncaa6 |access-date=November 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105034336/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/06/sports/sp-ncaa6 |archive-date=November 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> While initially proposing a consensus approach to the decision about the Chief, the board in 2007 decided that the Chief, its name, image and regalia should be officially retired. Nevertheless, the controversy continues on campus with some students unofficially maintaining the Chief. Complaints continue that indigenous students feel insulted when images of the Chief continue to be present on campus.<ref>[http://www.aaup.org/report/UIUC Academic Freedom and Tenure: The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501070256/http://www.aaup.org/report/UIUC |date=May 1, 2015 }} AAUP, April 2015, pp. 5–6</ref> The effort to resolve the controversy by the current chancellor has included the work of a committee that issued a report of its "critical conversations" that included over 600 participants representing all sides, which remain sharply divided.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Exhaustion-Confusion-and/244513| title='Exhaustion, Confusion, and Anger': U. of Illinois Finds a Community at Odds Over Old Mascot| author=Chris Quintana| date=September 13, 2018| access-date=September 16, 2018| newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916202020/https://www.chronicle.com/article/Exhaustion-Confusion-and/244513| archive-date=September 16, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref>
