It has been noted that many undocumented youth experience a period of adapting to a new identity (being "illegal") that is stigmatized and unexpected. [[Coming of age]], many undocumented youth become negatively distinguished from their former peers because of their inability to work legally, obtain a [[driver's license]], or participate in [[post-secondary education]]. These limitations with regards to citizenship frequently prove to be obstacles to the youth's opportunity for social and civic engagement.<ref name="Gonzales">{{cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=Roberto G.|year=2011|title=Learning to Be Illegal:  Undocumented Youth and Shifting Legal Contexts in the Transition to Adulthood|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=76|issue=4|pages=602–619|doi=10.1177/0003122411411901|url=http://www.asanet.org/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Aug11ASRFeature.pdf|accessdate=September 2014}}</ref>

==Undocumented students==
Undocumented students may not know how to navigate the higher education system in their state and often leads to students not attending college.  Undocumented students might assume that it is out of their financial means or not available to them due to their residency status.  This leaves undocumented students in a vulnerable place because they are not gaining the educational experience and are not eligible for legal work.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Ibarra|first=Hugo|last2=Sherman|first2=Ross|date=2012|title=Higher Education Opportunities for Undocumented Students in the United States: What are the Policy Implications for Educators and Legislators|url=|journal=JEP: eJournal of Education Policy|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref> According to the US: The Human Rights of Dreamers, Also that Undocumented students should be secured while they live in the United States.

A lot of undocumented students have issues with certain people they can trust within their community. Based on their status of being considered an alien in the United States they feel secluded. Undocumented immigrants feel as though they don't belong in the United States that because of how people treat them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.undocuscholars.org/assets/undocuscholarsreport2015.pdf|title=In the Shadows of the Ivory Tower: Undocumented Unddergraduates tionand the Liminal States of Immigration Reform|last=Teranishi|first=Robert|date=2014}}</ref>

Undocumented immigrants, particularly students, are a difficult subgroup of the population to research; there is not much current statistical data available. As a result of their precarious legal and social situation, these people are hesitant to identify themselves as being unauthorized, and the process of estimating statistics and drawing conclusions can be lengthy and cumbersome. While exact numbers are not known, there has been an increased emphasis on the challenges facing undocumented students nationwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=23+Geo.+Immigr.+L.J.+403&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=f8bd301fa241168c5b4b4b16b5f35dff|title=Is Postsecondary Access for Undocumented Immigrants an Important Right?

==Demographics==
It is difficult to determine national statistics for the demographic makeup of undocumented students. However, it can be inferred that statistics for undocumented students would be very closely related to those for the [[unauthorized immigrant]] population as a whole. Since 2014, approximately 11.1 million such immigrants live in the United States, which has seen only a small increase since 2007.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_ill_pe_2012_2.pdf|title=Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2012|last=Baker|first=Bryan|last2=Rytina|first2=Nancy|publisher=Office of Immigration Statistics, Policy Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Approximately 17%, roughly two million, of these immigrants are under the age of 18,<ref name="Chen2010">{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Edith Wen-Chu|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Issues Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_t3yQiWKQEC&pg=PA254|accessdate=2 May 2012|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34751-1|page=254}}</ref> about 65 thousand graduate from high school each year, and only 5–10% of them continue to higher education.<ref name=":0" />

While the undocumented student population comes from all over the world, a majority come from Mexico and other Central American countries, with approximately 6.7 million came from Mexico.<ref name=":1" /> The second-largest sending region is Asia. In 2012, the Philippine undocumented population in the U.S. consisted of approximately 310,000 people and there were 260,000 such immigrants from India. Although often left out of the conversation, Asian and Pacific Islanders are a significant population in the undocumented community.  The cultural expectations of immigrants in these communities often influence a more silenced and hidden existence than other cultures. There tends to be a heavier stigma against those who are undocumented, even within the culture.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/professionals/young-lives-on-hold-undocumented-students.pdf|title=Young Lives on Hold: The College Dreams of Undocumented Students|last=Gonzales|first=Roberto|publisher=College Board Advocacy|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

==Education access==
Public schooling allows undocumented youth to assimilate into society.<ref name="Gonzales" /> Youth from K-12 are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. This specific act prevents schools from releasing any information from students' records to immigration authorities<ref name=":8" />.  [[Graduation]] for these youth serves as a traumatic change in status and identity from student to "illegal alien" and "illegal worker". This "state of shock" causes depressed motivation and financial anxiety causing youth to drop out of high school. 40 percent of undocumented adults ages 18–24 do not complete high school. Of those that complete high school, only 49 percent attend college. Many youths reported a feeling of falling through the cracks, instances where they were not able to get assistance from their educational institutions.<ref name="Gonzales" />  The inability to receive federal and state [[Student financial aid (United States)|student financial aid]], as well as low family incomes, limits access for undocumented youth to attend post secondary schooling.<ref>Greenman, Emily, and Matthew Hall. "Legal Status And Educational Transitions For Mexican And Central American Immigrant Youth". ''Social Forces'' 91.4 (2013): 1475–1498. ERIC. Web. 5 October 2013.</ref> In 2006, Hispanic youth had the lowest educational attainment out of any ethnic or racial group.<ref name=Kaushal>Kaushal, Neeraj.

Web. 11 December 2013.</ref> Parents can often not provide financial assistance and immigrant youths carry financial burden within their households.<ref name="Gonzales" />

Access to a college education can help improve the status of undocumented youth. Graduating college allows youth to improve labor market skills and makes them eligible for jobs where employers might potentially sponsor a temporary legal visa. A college education also increases youth marriageability increasing the chances for youth to marry a legal citizen and obtain legal status through familial relationship.<ref name="Kaushal" />
The majority of undocumented children are growing up with legal access to public education but face legal barriers to higher education (Abrogate, 2006). Abrogate interviewed a girl named Alisa who came to the United States at the age of five from Guatemala; she encountered the difficulties of higher education. She was a student who excelled academically in high school and was admitted to the University of California. Alisa became disheartened due to her status and was unable to be given financial aid. Some researchers explain that undocumented children face an economic barrier when pursuing a higher education and find that because of this they are unable to attend a University (Abrogate; Shields and Bergman, 2004; Gonzales, 2011; Crossness and Turkey, 2011). Due to this, The Dream Act was proposed to the Senate and the House of Representatives and was only 13 states that include California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin passed their state laws. These states allow undocumented children to pay in-state tuition based on their attendance and graduation from a state high school (Schmidt 2013).

==Higher education==
The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 1.5 million undocumented students currently reside in the United States.<ref>Passel, Cohn 2009, p. ii.</ref>  Of these students, about 765,000 arrived in the United States before turning sixteen.<ref name="UnauthorizedYouth">{{Cite journal

===Admission & enrollment===
There is no federal law that prohibits the admission of undocumented immigrants to U.S. colleges and universities, public or private, nor does federal law require students to prove citizenship in order to enter U.S. institutions of higher education.<ref name="AdvisingUndocumentedStudents">{{Cite web

===Tuition and financial aid===
As of 2015, there were 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, a small decline from the Pew Research Center's estimate of 11.3 million for 2009.<ref>Krogstad, J. M., Passel, J. S., & Cohn, D.  (2017, April 27).  ''5 facts about illegal immigration in the U.S.'' Retrieved from <nowiki>http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/27/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/</nowiki></ref>  In 2014, about 3.9 million students in kindergarten through 12th grade in U.S. public and private schools were children of unauthorized immigrants.  While 3.2 million of this population were U.S. born, approximately 725,000 or 1.3% were unauthorized students themselves and potentially not receiving the financial resources they need to pursue higher education in the United States.<ref>Passel, J. S., & Cohn, D. (2016, November 17).  ''Children of unauthorized immigrants represent rising share of K-12 students. ''Retrieved from <nowiki>http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/17/children-of-unauthorized-immigrants-represent-rising-share-of-k-12-students/</nowiki></ref>

Programs such as the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) create open space for undocumented students to qualify for post secondary education benefits discussed in policies such as IIRIRA.  The language in PRWORA, still bars DACA recipients to receive public benefits since they are not "qualified aliens".  The language in both PRWORA and IIRIRA are vague enough that they allow states to decide how to address tuition rates and state financial aid for their students.  Although many states use these statutes as the reason to deny federal and state financial aid many others argue that the definition of public benefits does not include offering in-state tuition to undocumented students.<ref name=":4" />

There is no federal or state law that prohibits the admission of these immigrants to U.S. colleges and universities, but instead, non permanent residents and undocumented students are treated differently from one state to the next, resulting in no cohesive process and potential confusion for undocumented students.<ref>Suarez-Orozco, C., Yoshikawa, Teranishi, & Suarez-Orozco, M.

In addition to these 16 states, Hawaii, Michigan, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island allow this through the school system, their Board of Regents. Virginia only allows in-state tuition for DACA students.<ref name=":5">National Conference of State Legislatures. (2015). Undocumented student tuition: Overview.  <nowiki>http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/undocumented-student-tuition-overview.aspx</nowiki></ref>

While some states opt to pass their own legislation allowing in-state tuition for undocumented students, it does not fully bridge the gap for financial aid. Some states, like Georgia, have worked against education for undocumented students by forbidding enrollment in some colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/246479454/Removing-Barriers-to-Higher-Education-for-Undocumented-Students|title=Removing Barriers to Higher Education for Undocumented Students|website=Scribd|publisher=Center for American Progress|last1=Perez|first1=Zenen|accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref>

Outside of the aforementioned states offering state financial aid, undocumented students are not eligible for federal financial aid,<ref name="SiSePuede">{{Cite book|title=Undocumented Immigrants and Higher Education: Si Se Puede!|last=Rincon|first=Alejandra|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing|year=2008|location=New York|pages=109–143}}</ref> which makes the cost of tuition and fees an even greater obstacle to higher education.  Undocumented students must rely primarily on private scholarships as a source of funding for their postsecondary education. There are a few private scholarships that do not require the student to be a U.S. citizen or resident or have a social security number in order to apply. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) maintains the most comprehensive listing of such scholarships.<ref name="SiSePuede" />

Private colleges and universities set their own financial aid policies. Some offer financial aid in the form of grants and scholarships to undocumented students.<ref name="SiSePuede" />

===Additional barriers===
Understanding how to navigate the higher education labyrinth is a learned social practice, a skill acquired through social networks, parent understanding, and access to the information.  The opportunities to learn about college access is inequitably taught to undocumented students.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Gildersleeve|first=Ryan Evely|last2=Ranero|first2=Jessica J.|date=2010-09-01|title=Precollege contexts of undocumented students: Implications for student affairs professionals|journal=New Directions for Student Services|language=en|volume=2010|issue=131|pages=19–33|doi=10.1002/ss.365|issn=1536-0695}}</ref> Undocumented students face many challenges in their pre-collegiate years that can inhibit their knowledge to access to higher education in the future.  Most undocumented students come from working class or working poor families, which often forces them to live in communities where they become vulnerable to crimes, poor housing conditions, high unemployment, and underperforming schools<ref name=":6" /> Many of the schools they attend face high teacher turnover, overcrowding, and inadequate teacher preparation.  Many of the students are placed into language development courses, which often do not provide the rigorous coursework needed for college preparation.<ref name=":6" /> These students also may struggle with their schoolwork due to the discontinuity in their education.  Some students arrive in the United States after attending schools in their country of birth.  Adjusting to the education system in the United States can be a challenge for students. Some may be behind because their previous schools were not teaching the same curriculum or if their schools were ahead of the curriculum, students might lose interest in their new schools. Undocumented students can also struggle with their need to contribute money to their household.  Some students work as migrant farmers alongside their parents, this economic need can set them back in their education and in their path to understanding the steps to higher education.<ref name=":6" /> All of these things can inhibit undocumented students from successfully preparing for higher education.

Another barrier undocumented students face in their access to higher education is the lack of resources and adequate support from school professionals.  Many school professionals—teachers, counselors, other personnel—are not always aware of their state's policies regarding admission, tuition and financial aid for undocumented students.  Some school professionals are even unaware which students on their campus are undocumented. School professionals, often, do not receive training about policies that affect students and some have acknowledged that they only learned because of interactions with students or what they have learned through the media.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Lad|first=Kaetlyn|last2=Braganza|first2=Desiree|title=Increasing Knowledge Related to the Experiences of Undocumented Immigrants in Public Schools|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ1013134|journal=Educational Leadership and Administration: Teaching and Program Development|language=en|volume=24|pages=1–15|issn=1064-4474|date=2012-12-31}}</ref> Some undocumented students, who have been surveyed regarding their educational experience, claimed to feel as if they "lucked out", having someone to mentor them in college access.<ref name=":7" /> Unfortunately, not all students feel this way.  Although some students do acknowledge having an influential teacher or college counselor, many students feel unsupported or feel as they were given incorrect information.<ref>Pérez, P. A., & Rodríguez, J. L. (2011). "Access and Opportunity for Latina/o Undocumented College Students: Familial and Institutional Support Factors". ''AMAE Journal'', ''5''(1), 14–21.</ref>

Having college access information available to support undocumented students is not only a tool that undocumented students can use for themselves, it is information that they can then pass down to others.  Many parents of undocumented students do not have the knowledge to help their child pursue higher education, but these families have strong family networks, and with accurate information, students will then be able to share it with the younger children in their networks.  If community groups and school professionals reach out to undocumented students in ways that work within their culture, these students can have in increased chance of attending higher education.<ref name=":7" />

==Employment and transitions into adulthood==
Youth brought to the United States as adolescents are at greater risk for adjustment difficulties. Many undergo acculturated distress; poor mental health, depression, anxiety, a feeling of alienation, and identity confusion.<ref>Ellis, Lauren M., and Eric C. Chen. "Negotiating Identity Development Among Undocumented Immigrant College Students: A Grounded Theory Study." Journal of Counseling Psychology 60.2 (2013): 251-264. PsycARTICLES. Web. 10 November 2013.</ref> Markers in the transition into adulthood, such as finding work, applying for college, and obtaining a driver's license, all require legal status to obtain. Youth undergo three transition periods as they enter into adulthood; discovery, learning to be undocumented, and coping. The first, discovery (ages 16–18) is the time where youth first discover that they are undocumented. Within this period, key transitional markers such as obtaining a driver's license and applying for college are experienced. These markers often become the first time many youth learn that they are undocumented.  The second period, learning to be undocumented (ages 18–24) is a series of life alterations in which youth learn to live as an undocumented immigrant. This includes finding work as an undocumented immigrant and postponing secondary education. The third, coping (ages 25–29) is adjusting to lower expectations and realizing the true limits of their rights. This leads many youth to follow into the same job pool as their undocumented parents.<ref name="Gonzales" />

This gap still exists between higher education and financial aid for undocumented students. Since undocumented students are not eligible for most forms of financial aid, merit scholarships are not feasible as they are most often restrict their eligibility to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Undocumented students are not eligible for federal aid, thus, benefits that come from FAFSA or Pell Grants do not apply to these students.  Most state-based aid is also out of reach for undocumented students so grants, work study and loans are not options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e4fc.org/images/Fact_Sheet.pdf|title=Fact Sheet: An Overview of College-Bound Undocumented Students|publisher=Educators for Fair Consideration|date=1 January 2012|access-date=21 April 2015}}</ref> States opt to pass their own legislation allowing in-state tuition for undocumented students; while this is an important step for undocumented students, it does not fully bridge the gap for financial aid.

Giving these groups the availability for higher education aid would only increase these benefits through their consumption and investment in the economy.<ref>Athanasiou, Joy.

==Engagement of Undocumented Students==
Even though there are several barriers undocumented students encounter in higher education, they continue to have high academic aspirations. A quantitative study described that Latino students see higher education as a road to better themselves. Their stories of aspirations are geared towards helping others and giving back to their community.<ref>Torres, R. M., & Wicks-Asbun, M. (2014). Undocumented Students' Narratives of Liminal Citizenship: High Aspirations, Exclusion, and “In-Between” Identities*. Professional Geographer, 66(2), 195–204. doi:10.1080/00330124.2012.735936</ref> Giving back helps to affirm their social citizenship, existence, and validites their access to higher education.<ref>Abrego, L. J. 2008. "Legitimacy, social identity, and the mobilization of law: The effects of Assembly Bill 540 on undocumented students". ''California Law & Social Inquiry'' 33 (3): 709–734.</ref>

Educational institutions play a role in promoting civic engagement among students. When schools provide volunteer opportunities and require community service to graduate, there's a higher chance that students will civically engaged after graduation.<ref name="Perez, W. 2010">Perez, W. , Espinoza, R. , Ramos, K. , Coronado, H. , & Cortes, R. (2010). ''Civic engagement patterns of undocumented Mexican students. Journal of Hispanic Higher Education'', 9(3), 245–265.</ref> In a qualitative study, Munoz<ref name="Munoz, S. M. 2008">Munoz, S. M. (2008). ''Understanding issues of college persistence for undocumented Mexican Immigrant women from the new Latino Diaspora: A case study'' (Unpublished doctoral Dissertation). Iowa State University, Ames, IA.</ref>{{better source|date=January 2019}}<!-- need something *published* --> found that undocumented female Mexican college students expressed frustration, helplessness, and fear because of their lack of legal status. However, they also disclosed being very involved in college extracurricular activities to feel a sense of belonging and validation. Munoz's <ref name="Munoz, S. M. 2008"/> qualitative study also indicates that 40% of undocumented students chose to be involved by participating in community service or mentoring activities to assist undocumented youth like themselves.

Due to their unclear legal status, some youth do generate feelings of being an outsider and dissociate from civic engagement.<ref name="Perez, W. 2010"/> Through an online survey of open-ended questions, Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, and Cortes <ref name="Perez, W. 2010"/> reported that in elementary school, 38% of undocumented students were civically engaged. In middle school, rates increased to 41%. In high school, 73% participated in civic engagement with 34% reporting spending more than 40 hours per year doing volunteer work. Also, 7% participated in social services, 3% were engaged in activism, 29% tutored other students, and 55% operated administrative work. In general, 86% of all respondents also participated in extracurricular activities during high school. In addition to college, 55% participated in some form of civic engagement. Even though undocumented Latino students had a high percentage in civic engagement, they also reported higher levels of feeling rejection because of their undocumented status. Ultimately, Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, and Cortes <ref name="Perez, W. 2010"/> identified feelings of rejection were not correlated with lack of involvement and that most undocumented Latino youth going to college are engaging in U.S. civic life.

Undocumented youth change and acculturate to multiple circumstances that surround them by studying hard, following the codes of conduct, and acting as good citizens of the United States. Chang, Torrez, Ferguson, and Sagar <ref name="Chang, A. 2017">Chang, A. , Torrez, M. , Ferguson, K. , & Sagar, A. (2017). Figured worlds and american dreams: An exploration of agency and identity among latinx undocumented students. The Urban Review, .</ref> conducted a qualitative study of 18 students, ages 18 and above, who identified as undocumented or were once undocumented, They found that students often had to be involved ad engaged in the community to feel accepted. Undocumented students navigate the best they could between social and cultural intrusions.<ref name="Chang, A. 2017"/> Students often create a foundation to keep moving forward and not give up by taking advantage of their community cultural wealth as a mechanism to keep hope.

Even though there are political restrictions for undocumented students to self-advocate, multiple students remained hopeful because they stood by the ideal cultural citizenship even if it seemed unattainable.<ref name="Chang, A. 2017"/> Chang, Torrez, Ferguson, and Sagar's <ref name="Chang, A. 2017"/> study showed that participants' process of interpreting, integrating, and interjecting themselves as valuable objects with hope that even from their socially and social positions they strongly engaged in different cultural worlds to achieve the American dream. Undocumented students keep high aspirations and participate in civil engagement, disregarding the barriers they may face due to their undocumented status in the United States.

==Youth activism==
[[File:Dreamers AZ Sit-in 5-17-10.jpg|thumb|Students protesting on behalf of the DREAM Act in Senator John McCain's office, May 2010]]

In recent years,{{when|date=December 2016}} undocumented youth have gathered to lobby for legislative action. Organizations such as the Education Not Deportation (END) Our Pain Organization have been established to demand moratorium for youth eligible for the Development, Relief, Education for Alien Minors ([[DREAM Act]]) Act which would grant conditional legal status to those brought here under the age of 16 if they attend college or join the military.  Throughout 2009 and 2010, a number of sit-ins, hunger strikes, marches, and social media campaigns were conducted by many activist organizations. United We Dream organized 500 youth to participate in a National DREAM Act graduation in Washington combined with 15 more ceremonies nationwide.<ref>Zimmerman, Arely M. 2011.

==Legislation affecting undocumented students==

===''Plyler v. Doe''===
{{Main|Plyler v. Doe}}

In the United States, children are given the right to an elementary and secondary education (K-12) regardless of their immigration status.

Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a state statute denying funding for education to undocumented immigrant children. The case simultaneously struck down a municipal school district's attempt to charge such immigrants an annual $1,000 tuition fee to compensate for state funding.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Court found that where states limit the rights afforded to people (specifically children) based on their status as immigrants, this limitation must be examined under an intermediate scrutiny standard to determine whether it furthers a substantial goal of the State.

Prior to 1975, all students in Texas were able to attend public elementary and secondary school. The state government provided funding to schools based on the number of students enrolled. In May 1975, the state legislature amended the Texas Education Code to provide that only U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted non citizens would be counted for financial aid purposes.<ref>Lopez, Lopez 2010, p. 16.</ref>  Schools were given the option to allow or reject undocumented students and to charge tuition if they chose to accept them. School officials in Tyler, Texas, under the direction of Superintendent James Plyler, began charging $1,000 annual tuition to all undocumented students—about 60 from a student body of 1,600.<ref>{{Cite court
  |litigants = Doe v. Plyler

  |opinion = 575
  |date = 1978}}</ref>  In September 1977, the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF) filed a class action on behalf of sixteen Mexican undocumented students of the Tyler district.

The trial court found that the Texas law violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] because it amounted to a total deprivation of education without a rational basis.<ref name="DoePlyer585">{{Cite court
  |litigants = Doe v. Plyer
  |vol = 458
  |reporter = E. D. Tex.
  |opinion = 585
  |date = 1978}}</ref> The court rejected the state's arguments regarding the cost of educating undocumented children, finding that the federal government largely subsidized the additional costs that the education of these children entailed and that "it is not sufficient justification that a law saves money".<ref name= "DoePlyer585"/>

In order to comply with Plyler, education policy analysts have suggested that schools may not:
*deny admission to a student on the basis of undocumented status;
*treat a student fundamentally differently from others when determining residency;
*engage in practices that frighten undocumented students and their families away from school access;
*require students or parents to disclose or document immigration status;
*make inquiries of students or parents that may expose their undocumented status;
*require [[Social Security numbers]] from any student.<ref>Lopez, Lopez 2010, p. 40.</ref>

Plyler does not extend to post secondary education, but at least guarantees undocumented students the opportunity to receive a high school degree.

===Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)===
{{Main|Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals }}

On June 15, 2012, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) announced the executive (President Obama and his administration) decision to defer immigration enforcement for undocumented youth who meet specific requirements set under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) plan. This order provided temporary relief from immigration enforcement and deportation proceedings, as well as the authorization to work.<ref>Obama, B. (2012). Remarks by the President on immigration. Rose Garden, White House, Washington, DC. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-president-immigration</nowiki></ref>  In Janet Napolitano's memorandum to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secretary of Homeland Security stated that immigration laws should be enforced sensibly and with consideration to the individual situation. In the case for these young people living in the U.S, she stated that they had no intent on breaking any law and should have the opportunity to be productive people in this country.<ref>Napolitano, J. (2012).

Individuals may request DACA if they meet the following requirements:<ref name=":2">Department of Homeland Security. (2016). [https://www.uscis.gov/daca Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)].</ref><ref>[http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-process Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Process]</ref>

#Have continuously lived in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time;
#Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making your request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS;
#Had no lawful status on June 15, 2012;

#Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.

Applicants who meet the guidelines are granted a two-year reprieve and are granted work authorization.<ref name=Fiflis>Fiflis, Christina A. "Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals." Gpsolo 30.5 (2013): 28-32. Academic Search Complete.

The majority of states announced that they would grant driver's licenses to recipients along with Michigan and Iowa who reversed their decisions to deny state benefits.<ref>D'OTTAVIO, KARI E.

Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 December 2013.</ref> Without permanent residence, youth granted deferred action still cannot receive federal financial aid. Access to secondary education is still limited, but youth who are granted the ability to work have the potential for increased wages and the ability to pay tuition costs.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, approximately two million people are eligible for the DACA program, as the programs rules currently stand.<ref name=":3">Hooker, Sarah, Margie McHugh, and Angelo Mathay (2015). [http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/lessons-local-level-dacas-implementation-and-impact-education-and-training-success Lessons from the Local Level: DACA’s Implementation and Impact on Education and Training Success]. Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute.</ref>  In 2014 President Obama announced an expansion of DACA; removing the maximum age limit, changing the entry date to 2010, and extending the deferment period to three years.<ref name=":3" /> This extended program could potentially allow an additional 300 thousand people eligibility.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Angela|last2=Boyne|first2=Kerry S.|date=2015-04-25|title=Access to Higher Education for Undocumented and "Dacamented" Students: The Current State of Affairs|url=https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/iiclr/article/view/18586|journal=Indiana International & Comparative Law Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=47–62|doi=10.18060/7909.0004|issn=2169-3226|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2016, the expansion was placed on hold due to a court injunction, in ''United States v. Texas''.<ref name=":2" />

DACA is sometimes seen as legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship or as a way of receiving lawful immigration status. Neither is true, the deferment only provides the qualified recipients to have a lawful presence, meaning the authorities cannot force them to leave the country although they still lack legal immigration status.  DACA statuses can be terminated or not renewed based on the discretion of DHS, as it is not a law.  DACA is a presidential executive authority, which also means that it can change based on future presidents.  DACA, therefore, creates open space for undocumented students to qualify for post secondary education benefits.<ref name=":4" />

===Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA)===
In 1996, Congress approved the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) to improve immigration law in the United States. Section 505 of IIRIRA prohibits public higher education institutions from giving those who are unlawfully present in the United States post secondary education benefits, on the basis of residency in a State, that are not being given to U.S. citizens or nationals.<ref>Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-206, 110 Stat. 3009.</ref>

===Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA)===
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) was President Bill Clinton's major welfare reform.  PRWORA is most known for the creation of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) program.  Additionally, PRWORA set the standards for how courts and institutions determined the eligibility of federal, state, and local benefits and services.<ref>"Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996", ''Pub. L.''{{clarify|reason=Please fully spell out publication names on Wikipedia—WP is not a specialists' publication|date=January 2019}} No. 104–193, 110 Stat. 2105.</ref>  The reform states those who are not "qualified aliens" are ineligible for federal public benefits.  The act also gives states the discretionary power to determine the tuition rates publicly funded schools and the authority to provide state financial aid.  If states do not pass specific legislation regarding these matters then federal legislation superseded and inherently prohibits state financial aid for unauthorized immigrants.<ref name=":4" />

===DREAM Act===
{{main|DREAM Act}}
The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is a federal bill that would permit states to determine state residency for higher education or military purposes.<ref name="BillSummary">{{Cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S3992|title=Bill Summary and Status 111th Congress (2009-2010) S. 3992}}</ref> This bill was first introduced in the Senate on August 1, 2001, and was most recently re-introduced in Congress on March 26, 2009. A Senate filibuster blocked it on December 18, 2010.<ref name="BillSummary" />  It would provide a mechanism for undocumented students of good moral character to become legal permanent residents. The DREAM Act initially allowed beneficiaries to qualify for federal student aid but was changed in the 2010 version of the bill. In order to be eligible, individuals must have come to the U.S. as children (under the age of 16), graduated from a U.S. high school and be a long-term resident (at least 5 years). An age cap of 35 was also set. The latest version of the DREAM Act does not grant legal immigrant status to anyone for at least two years. Previous versions of the Act would have immediately granted legal immigrant status to eligible individuals. Many other limitations were also included in this latest version, among them the removal of access to healthcare benefits and limits to [[chain migration]].
