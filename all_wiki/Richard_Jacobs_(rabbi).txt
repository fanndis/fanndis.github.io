Jacobs was a member of the Union of Reform Judaism′s board of trustees from 1994 through 1998 and served as the Secretary of the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] (CCAR) and on the board of the World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ), which, in 2000, rewarded him with its “International Humanitarian Award” for his commitment to human rights and social and economic justice. In 2005 he visited the [[Chad]]–[[Darfur]] border area with an international humanitarian mission, and raised more than $250,000 to aid Darfur refugees. He delivered the opening prayer for the [[Save Darfur Coalition#Initiatives|2006 Darfur rally in Washington, D.C.]] He was the only rabbi who participated in the 2009 [[Brookings Institution|Brookings]] [[U.S.-Islamic World Forum]] in [[Doha, Qatar]],<ref name="Brookings"/> an annual conference designed to bring together key leaders in the worlds of politics, business, media, academia, and civil society from across the Muslim world and the United States.

{{quote|“Unless we change our approach, there is little chance that Jews in their twenties and thirties will even enter the revolving door of synagogue affiliation. Hoping is not a strategy; the Jewish world needs new approaches for engaging the future. ... Everywhere we look, there are dramatic challenges facing our people; yet each is a phenomenal opportunity to revitalize Jewish life. Only very rarely has Jewish history known an era of so much creativity or innovation; no previous generation has possessed our resources and potential. For two centuries, Reform Judaism has pointed the way forward. For the past forty years, our religious ingenuity has made us the fastest growing theologically liberal denomination in America. And yet we've become bogged down. Too many Jewish leaders seem paralyzed by fear of the future. This moment in Jewish history demands bold thinking with big ideas; this is not a time for staying the course. It's time to reinvent the architecture of Jewish life. It's a time to cast a broad net, to explore options rather than to rule things out, and to recreate a Movement which will be as meaningful in the future as it has been in the past.”<ref>{{cite web| url= http://blogs.rj.org/reform/2011/06/rabbi-rick-jacobs.html?syspage=article&item_id=65240| title=Rabbi Richard Jacobs' Remarks to Board of Trustees Upon His Election as President of the URJ| date=June 12, 2011 | author=Rabbi Rick Jacobs| publisher=RJ.org| accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref>}}

Jacobs' formal installation, the first in 16 years, was held at [[Congregation Beit Elohim]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on June 9, 2012. In his address, Jacobs promised to turn the Reform Jewish movement into a “movement undergoing renovation that will renew Jewish life.” He called on Reform Jews to “stand up for Israel” against its critics while fighting to ensure that Israel preserves the democratic and liberal ideals dear to the Reform Movement at the same time, and expressed the hope that “one day soon the State of Israel will live in peace side by side with the State of Palestine.”<ref>{{cite web| title= With prayer and gospel, Reform movement anoints Rabbi Rick Jacobs as its new leader| author=Chemi Shalev | date= June 10, 2012| website=Haaretz| accessdate=June 11, 2012| url= http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/with-prayer-and-gospel-reform-movement-anoints-rabbi-rick-jacobs-as-its-new-leader.premium-1.435457}}</ref>

Rabbi Jacobs visits and speaks frequently throughout the Jewish world.  In September 2012, he was named as the scholar-in- residence for The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA)'s 2012 General Assembly, the largest annual gathering of the North American Jewish community.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://urj.org/about/union/pr/2012/?syspage=article&item_id=94120# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113230115/http://urj.org/about/union/pr/2012/?syspage=article&item_id=94120# |archive-date=2014-01-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  At the URJ 2013 Biennial convention, he spoke extensively about key themes in the organization's work to re-imagine Jewish life:  youth engagement, partnerships, inclusion, Israel-Diaspora relations, and religious pluralism.<ref>http://urj.org/about/union/leadership/rabbijacobs/?syspage=article&item_id=109240</ref>

In 2016, Jacobs led an effort to encourage efforts to accommodate multi-denominational Judaism in Israel. In 2016 at government hearings on non-Orthodox prayer space at the [[Western Wall]],  MK And tourism Minister [[Yariv Levin]] slammed [[Reform Judaism]], a small denomination in Israel but the largest Jewish movement in the United States, saying egalitarian prayer space at the Wall is unnecessary based on his opinion that Reform Jews will "be all but gone in three generations."<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.700589 Israeli Tourism Minister Blasts U.S. Reform Jews, Says Chelsea Clinton's Wedding Shows Extent of Assimilation] Haaretz, Jan 31, 2013</ref> Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] condemned Levin’s remarks and the Reform movement in the U.S. has decided to shun him. Rabbi [[Gilad Kariv]], head of the progressive movement in Israel, called on his American partners to refuse access to Levin. Rabbi Jacobs agreed to cancel all meetings between Levin and Reform leaders. Jacobs told Israeli Army Radio: "There’s no reason to give him a platform in Jewish communities and organizations in the United States. Minister Levin will not teach us what support for Israel is.”<ref>[http://www.jta.org/2016/02/11/news-opinion/united-states/reform-jews-to-boycott-israeli-tourism-minister-following-insult Reform Jews to shun Israeli tourism minister following insult] JTA, Feb 11, 2016</ref> The [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] protested Levin's comments, saying "Minister Levin is entitled to his private beliefs. However, as a minister in the government of all Israel, he has an obligation to support the religious practice of all Israelis. His remarks on the supposed waning presence of U.S. Reform Jews reveal a bias against a religious movement that includes over a million and a half people."<ref>[http://ccarnet.org/about-us/news-and-events/ccar-condemns-israel-tourism-minister-yariv-levins-comments-refo/ Central Conference of American Rabbis Condemns Israel Tourism Minister Yariv Levin’s Comments on Reform Judaism] CCARNET, Feb 3, 2016</ref> Informed of Netanyahu's criticism of his comments, Levin refused to backtrack.
