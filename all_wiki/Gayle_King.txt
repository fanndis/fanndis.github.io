Before joining [[CBS News]], King worked as a special correspondent for ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name="WWD" /> On November 10, 2011, King secured a deal with CBS to co-anchor ''CBS This Morning'', beginning on January 9, 2012.<ref name="TVGuide" /> She publicly called for CBS to have full transparency when it was learned CBS planned on keeping the findings of [[sexual abuse]] and [[harassment]] at the network private.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/gayle-king-leslie-moonves-cbs-investigation-1202936424/|title=Gayle King calls for CBS to release results of Leslie Moonves investigation |last=Baldoni |first=John |date=September 12, 2018 |magazine=Variety |access-date=January 9, 2019 |quote='I'm sick and sick of the story and sickened ... by everything that we keep hearing,' King said. Regarding the plan to keep the report private, she said: 'How can we have this investigation and not know how it comes out? Les Moonves has been on the record, he says, listen, he didn't do these things, that it was consensual, that he hasnâ€™t hurt anybody's career. I would think it would be in his best interests for us to hear what the report finds out.' King said noted, as have many others, that the women who have come forward with claims about Moonves have little motivation to fabricate or exaggerate past incidents with Moonves. 'You have women who are coming forward, very credibly talking about something that's so painful and so humiliating. It's been my experience that women don't come out and speak this way for no reason. They just don't,' King said. 'And so I don't know how we move forward if we don't â€” we at CBS â€“ don't have full transparency about what we find. â€¦. In our own house we must have transparency.'}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-2018-cbs-gayle-king-says-after-moonves-in-1536699465-htmlstory.html |title=Gayle King says CBS 'must have transparency' after Moonves' departure |last=Saad |first=Nardine |date=September 11, 2018 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref>  She received recognition for remaining stoic during an interview with [[R.
