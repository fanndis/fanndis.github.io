The Keystone Pipeline system consists of the operational Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III, the Gulf Coast Pipeline Project. A fourth, proposed pipeline expansion segment Phase IV, Keystone XL, failed to receive necessary permits from the United States federal government in 2015. Construction of Phase III, from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Nederland, Texas, in the Gulf Coast area, began in August 2012 as an independent economic utility.<ref group=notes>It was presented to the United States State Department as an independent economic utility in February 2012, sidestepping the requirement for a Presidential Permit because it does not cross an international border (United States Department of State SEIS March 1, 2013 p.

Cushing is a major crude oil marketing/refining and pipeline hub.<ref name="NYTKeystoneXL" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Keystone XL Pipeline |date=February 28, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/k/keystone_pipeline/index.html |first1=John M. |last1=Broder |first2=Clifford |last2=Krauss}}</ref>

Operating since 2010, the original Keystone Pipeline System is a {{convert|3461|km|adj=on}} pipeline delivering Canadian crude oil to U.S. Midwest markets and Cushing, Oklahoma. In Canada, the first phase of Keystone involved the conversion of approximately {{convert|864|km}} of existing {{convert|36|in|adj=on}} natural gas pipeline in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to crude oil pipeline service. It also included approximately {{convert|373|km}} of new {{convert|30|in|adj=on}} diameter pipeline, 16&nbsp;pump stations and the Keystone Hardisty Terminal.<ref name="barrelfull"/>

The U.S. portion of the Keystone Pipeline included {{convert|1744|km}} of new, {{convert|30|in|adj=on}} diameter pipeline in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois.<ref name="barrelfull"/> The pipeline has a minimum ground cover of {{convert|4|ft}}.<ref name=downstream4/> It also involved construction of 23&nbsp;pump stations and delivery facilities at Wood River and Patoka, Illinois. In 2011, the second phase of Keystone included a {{convert|480|km|0|adj=on}} extension from Steele City, Nebraska, to Cushing, Oklahoma, and 11&nbsp;new pump stations to increase the capacity of the pipeline from {{convert|435000|to|591000|oilbbl/d|lk=in}}.<ref name="barrelfull">{{cite news | url = http://abarrelfull.wikidot.com/keystone-pipeline | title = Keystone Pipeline | newspaper = A Barrel Full | date = March 2, 2012 | access-date = July 19, 2012}}</ref>

Additional phases (III, completed in 2014, and IV, rejected in 2015) have been in construction or discussion since 2011. If completed, the Keystone XL would have added {{convert|510000|oilbbl/d}} increasing the total capacity up to {{convert|1.1|Moilbbl/d}}.<ref name=downstream2/>

The original Keystone Pipeline cost US$5.2&nbsp;billion with the Keystone XL expansion slated to cost approximately US$7&nbsp;billion. The Keystone XL had been expected to be completed by 2012–2013, however construction was ultimately overtaken by events{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}}.<ref name=downstream2/>

From January 2018 through December 31, 2019, Keystone XL development costs were $1.5 billion.<ref name="TC_Energy_Annual_Report_2019"/>{{rp|147}}

On March 2, 2014, approximately 1000–1200 protesters marched from Georgetown University to the White House to stage a protest against the Keystone Pipeline. 398 arrests were made of people tying themselves to the White House fence with zip-ties and lying on a black tarp in front of the fence. The tarp represented an oil spill, and many protesters dressed in white jumpsuits covered in black ink, symbolizing oil-covered HazMat suits, laid down upon the tarp.

====Potential for oil spills====
University of Nebraska professor John Stansbury conducted an independent analysis which provides more detail on the potential risks for the Ogallala Aquifer.<ref name="unl.edu">{{cite web |url=http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117101558/http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2015 }}</ref> Stansbury concludes that safety assessments provided by TransCanada are misleading: "We can expect no fewer than 2 major spills per state during the 50-year projected lifetime of the pipeline. These spills could release as much as 180 thousand barrels of oil each."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desmogblog.com/expert-warns-transcanada-s-keystone-xl-pipeline-assessments-are-misleading|title=Expert Warns That TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline Assessments Are Misleading|work=DeSmogBlog}}</ref>

Other items of note in Stansbury's analysis:
* "While TransCanada estimates that the Keystone XL will have 11 significant spills (more than 50 barrels of crude oil) over 50 years, a more realistic assessment is 91 significant spills over the pipeline's operational lifetime. TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)"
* "Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than {{convert|800,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, an Enbridge tar sands pipeline – a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=on}} pipe compared to the {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} Keystone XL – was not completely shut down for 12 hours.)"
* "Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more than {{convert|180000|oilbbl|USgal L}} in the Nebraska Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than {{convert|160000|oilbbl|USgal L}} of crude oil at the Yellowstone River crossings, more than {{convert|140000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Platte River crossing and more than {{convert|120000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Missouri River crossing."
* "Contaminants from a release at the Missouri or Yellowstone River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would adversely affect drinking water intakes, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river."
* "The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface. This aquifer is the well-known Ogallala Aquifer that is one of the most productive and important aquifers in the world."<ref name="unl.edu"/>

Portions of the pipeline will also cross an active [[seismic zone]] that had a 4.3 magnitude [[earthquake]] as recently as 2002.<ref name="thetyee-20100707"/> Opponents claim that TransCanada applied to the U.S. government to use thinner steel and pump at higher pressures than normal.<ref name="thetyee-20100621"/> 

TransCanada CEO Russ Girling has described the Keystone Pipeline as "routine", noting that TransCanada has been building similar pipelines in North America for half a century and that there are {{convert|200,000|mi}} of similar oil pipelines in the United States today.

TransCanada claims that they will take 100% responsibility for any potential environmental problems. According to their website, "It's our responsibility – as a good company and under law. If anything happens on the Keystone XL Pipeline, rapid response is key. That's why our Emergency Response plans are approved by state and federal agencies, and why we practice them regularly. We conduct regular emergency exercises, and aerial surveys every two weeks. We're ready to respond with a highly-trained response team standing by."

===Leaks and spills===
In 2016, about 400 barrels were released from the original Keystone pipe network via leaks, which federal investigators said resulted from a "weld anomaly."<ref name="UPI"/>

On November 17, 2017, the pipeline leaked around 407,000 gallons<ref name="TRIBUNE"/> onto farmland near [[Amherst, South Dakota]]. The oil leak is the largest seen from the Keystone pipeline in the state. The leak lasted for several minutes, with no initial reports of damage to water sources or wildlife. Although the spill did not happen on Sioux property, it was in close enough proximity to potentially contaminate the aquifer used for water.<ref name="WASHINGPOST">{{cite news |last1=Mufson|first1=Steven|last2=Mooney|first2=Chris |date=November 16, 2017|title=Keystone pipeline spills 210,000 gallons of oil on eve of permitting decision for TransCanada|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/11/16/keystone-pipeline-spills-210000-gallons-of-oil-on-eve-of-key-permitting-decision/|work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=November 18, 2017}}</ref><ref name="FOX">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/us/keystone-pipeline-leak/index.html|title=Keystone Pipeline leaks 210,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota|author=Mayra Cuevas |author2=Steve Almasy|work=CNN|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> The pipeline was immediately shut down,<ref name="DOUBLE">[https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1HE0T7 "Keystone pipeline leak in South Dakota about double previous estimate: paper"], Reuters, April 7, 2018</ref> and TransCanada began using the pipe again 12 days after the leak.<ref name="TRIBUNE">[https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/04/07/keystone-pipeline-spill-south-dakota-twice-big-first-thought/496679002/ "Keystone Pipeline spill in South Dakota twice as big as first thought"], Associated Press, April 7, 2018</ref> For much of late 2017, the Keystone pipeline operated at reduced pressure during remediation efforts.

In September 2011, [[Joe Oliver (politician)|Joe Oliver]], [[Minister of Natural Resources (Canada)|Canada's Minister of Natural Resources]], sharply criticized opponents of oil sands development in a speech to the [[Canadian Club of Toronto]], arguing that oil sands account for about 0.1% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, coal power plants powered in the U.S. generate almost 40 times more greenhouse-gas emissions than Canada's oil sands and California bitumen is more GHG-intensive than the oil sands.<ref>{{cite news |title=NOTA Bene |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/NOTA+Bene/5452294/story.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110924221506/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/NOTA+Bene/5452294/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 24, 2011 |newspaper=National Post |date=September 24, 2011 |access-date=August 10, 2013 }}</ref>

As of 2013 however, producing and processing tar sands oil results in roughly 14 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the average oil used in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=tar-sands-and-keystone-xl-pipeline-impact-on-global-warming | title = How Much Will Tar Sands Oil Add to Global Warming? | work = [[Scientific American]] | first = Davied | last = Biello | date = January 23, 2013 | access-date = April 24, 2013}}</ref> 
The State Department's 2012 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Final SEIS) estimated that producing and transporting oil to the pipeline's capacity would increase greenhouse-gas emissions compared to alternative sources of oil, if the denial of the pipeline project meant that the oil would stay in the ground. "However, ... such a change is not likely to occur. [A]pproval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed Project, is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands, or the continued demand for heavy crude oil."<ref name="feis">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://2012-keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221190.pdf |title=Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, Keystone XL Project |publisher=State Department |year=2012 |chapter=4.14: Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change}}</ref> To the extent that the oil would be extracted in any case, the relevant comparison would be to alternative means of transporting it; the Final SEIS considered three alternative scenarios and found that "total GHG emissions associated with construction and operation (direct and indirect) combined would be higher for each of the three scenarios than for the entire route encompassing the proposed Project."<ref>{{cite web|title=Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, Keystone XL Project, 5.3: Comparison of Alternatives|url=https://2012-keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221198.pdf}}</ref> The Final SEIS made no estimate of the net effect of the project on greenhouse-gas emissions, considering both the amount of oil that would likely replace other sources (increasing emissions) and the amount of oil for which the pipeline would merely replace alternate means of transportation (decreasing emissions).

In a February 2015, the US EPA responded to the U.S. Department of State's Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Final SEIS)] for the Keystone XL Pipeline Project,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.state.gov/keystone-pipeline-xl/ |title=Keystone XL Pipeline Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement |access-date=November 9, 2019 |language=en-US}}</ref> that the pipeline will significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions because it will lead to the expansion of Alberta's carbon intensive oilsands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/business/slams+Keystone+significant+emissions+climate+change+impact/10784258/story.html|title=EPA slams Keystone for 'significant' emissions and climate change impact|work=www.canada.com|access-date=February 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209031742/http://www.canada.com/business/slams+Keystone+significant+emissions+climate+change+impact/10784258/story.html|archive-date=February 9, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and that over the proposed 50-year timeline of the pipeline, this could mean releasing as much as "1.37 billion more tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/03/epa-keystone-xl-pipeline-will-impact-global-warming|title=EPA: Keystone XL Pipeline Will Impact Global Warming – US News|author=Alan Neuhauser|work=US News & World Report}}</ref> EPA concluded that due to the current relatively cheap cost of oil, companies might be less likely to set up their own developments in the oil sands.

TransCanada Corporation responded with a letter by President and CEO Russel K.

==Conflicts of interest==
In October 2011, ''The New York Times'' questioned the impartiality of the environmental analysis of the pipeline done by [[Cardno Entrix]], an environmental contractor based in Houston. The study found that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impacts, but was authored by a firm that had "previously worked on projects with TransCanada and describes the pipeline company as a 'major client' in its marketing materials".<ref name = "Question of Conflict">

It also states that the project will increase the heavy crude oil price in the [[Midwestern United States]] by diverting oil sands oil from the Midwest refineries to the Gulf Coast and export markets.<ref name="ILR Cornell Study">{{cite journal |url= http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/globallaborinstitute/research/upload/GLI_KeystoneXL_Reportpdf.pdf |title= Pipe dreams?

The US Gulf Coast has a large concentration of refineries designed to process very heavy crude oil. At present, the refineries are dependent on heavy crude from [[Venezuela]], including crude from Venezuela's own massive [[Orinoco oil sands]]. The United States is the number one buyer of crude oil exported from Venezuela.<ref>US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ve Venezuela], June 20, 2014.</ref> The large trade relationship between the US and Venezuela has persisted despite political tensions between the two countries. However, the volume of oil imported into the US from Venezuela dropped in half from 2007 to 2014, as overall Venezuelan exports have dropped, and also as Venezuela seeks to become less dependent on US purchases of its crude oil. The Keystone pipeline is seen as a way to replace imports of heavy oil-sand crude from Venezuela with more reliable Canadian heavy oil.<ref>Jorge R.

TransCanada's Girling has also argued that if Canadian oil doesn't reach the Gulf through an environmentally friendly buried pipeline, that the alternative is oil that will be brought in by tanker, a mode of transportation that produces higher greenhouse-gas emissions and that puts the environment at greater risk.<ref name='cattaneo'>{{cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/09/08/transcanada-in-eye-of-the-storm/|title=TransCanada in eye of the storm|first=Claudia |last=Cattaneo |newspaper=Financial Post |date=September 9, 2011}}</ref> [[Diane Francis]] has argued that much of the opposition to the oil sands actually comes from foreign countries such as Nigeria, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia, all of whom supply oil to the United States and who could be affected if the price of oil drops due to the new availability of oil from the pipeline.

In January 2012, Greenpeace Executive Director [[Phil Radford]] appealed to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] to review TransCanada's claims that the Keystone Pipeline would create 20,000 jobs. Stating that the company had "consistently used public statements and information it knows are false in a concerted effort to secure permitting approval" of the pipeline, Radford argued that TransCanada had "misled investors, U.S. and Canadian officials, the media, and the public at large in order to bolster its balance sheets and share price".<ref>{{Cite news | author = Radford, Phil |title=Greenpeace Letter to Securities and Exchange Commission | url = https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/287168-gp-sec-transcanada-letter.html | access-date = March 4, 2014|date=January 26, 2012}}</ref>

In July 2013, President Obama stated "The most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two, and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people."

In 2010 Glen Perry, a petroleum engineer for Adira Energy, warned that including the [[Alberta Clipper pipeline]] owned by TransCanada's competitor Enbridge, there is an extensive overcapacity of oil pipelines from Canada.<ref name = "theglobeandmail-1543726">{{Cite news | last = Vanderklippe | first = Nathan | title = Oil sands awash in excess pipeline capacity | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = April 23, 2010 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/oil-sands-awash-in-excess-pipeline-capacity/article1543726/ | access-date = February 22, 2012 | location=Toronto}}</ref> After completion of the Keystone XL line, oil pipelines to the U.S. may run nearly half-empty. The expected lack of volume combined with extensive construction cost overruns has prompted several petroleum refining companies to sue TransCanada. Suncor Energy hoped to recoup significant construction-related tolls, though the U.S. Energy Regulatory Commission did not rule in their favor. According to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'',

<blockquote>The refiners argue that construction overruns have raised the cost of shipping on the Canadian portion of Keystone by 145 per cent while the U.S. portion has run 92 per cent over budget. They accuse TransCanada of misleading them when they signed shipping contracts in the summer of 2007.

==Public opinion polls==

===United States===
[[File:Tar Sands Blockade Oct 15 day of action.jpg|thumb|Protest near construction work for the Keystone XL pipeline in [[Winnsboro, Texas]]]]
Public opinion polls taken by independent national polling organizations toward the beginning of the dispute showed majority support for the proposed pipeline in the US. 
A September 2013 poll by the Pew Center found 65% favored the project and 30% opposed. The same poll found the pipeline favored by majorities of men (69%), women (61%), Democrats (51%), Republicans (82%), independents (64%), as well as by those in every division of age, education, economic status, and geographic region. The only group identified by the Pew poll with less than majority support for the pipeline was among those Democrats who identified themselves as liberal (41% in favor versus 54% opposed).<ref name="people-press.org">Pew Center, [http://www.people-press.org/2013/09/26/continued-support-for-keystone-xl-pipeline/ Continued Support for Keystone XL Pipeline], September 26, 2013.</ref>

In contrast, Pew's February 2017 poll showed that support for the pipeline had fallen to only 42%, with 48% of polled respondents opposing the pipeline, a 17 percentage point drop in support since 2014, with the majority of the shift due to a sharp decline in support among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents. At the time of the poll, only 17% of Democrats favored the pipeline. Support among Republicans had also fallen (to 76%) but not as steeply as among Democrats.<ref name="Public Divided Over Keystone XL" >Pew Center, [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/21/public-divided-over-keystone-xl-dakota-pipelines-democrats-turn-decisively-against-keystone/, February 21, 2017.]</ref>

In April 2013, it was learned that the government of Alberta was investigating, as an alternative to the pipeline south through the United States, a shorter all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast, from where the oil would be taken by tanker ships through the [[Arctic Ocean]] to markets in Asia and Europe<ref>Jill Burke, [http://alaskadispatch.com/article/20130425/alaska-watches-canadians-consider-shipping-tar-sands-oil-across-arctic-ocean Alaska watches Canadians consider shipping tar sands oil across Arctic Ocean], Alaska Dispatch, April 30, 2013</ref> and in August, TransCanada announced a new proposal to create a longer all-Canada pipeline, called [[Energy East pipeline|Energy East]], that would extend as far east as the port city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], at the same time providing feedstock to refineries in Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John.<ref>TransCanada, [http://www.transcanada.com/news-releases-article.html?id=1746092 Energy East News Release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213235625/http://www.transcanada.com/news-releases-article.html?id=1746092 |date=December 13, 2014 }}, August 1, 2013</ref>

==Lawsuits==
In September 2009, independent refiner CVR sued TransCanada for Keystone Pipeline tolls seeking $250&nbsp;million damage compensation or release from transportation agreements. CVR alleged that the final tolls for the Canadian segment of the pipeline were 146% higher than initially presented, while the tolls for the U.S. segment were 92% higher.<ref name=oildaily>{{cite news | title= Independent refiner CVR sues TransCanada's Keystone Pipeline | url= http://www.allbusiness.com/transportation/pipeline-transportation-oil-gas/13114806-1.html | date= September 18, 2009 | work = The Oil Daily | first = Barbara | last = Shook | publisher= AllBusiness.com, Inc | access-date= August 1, 2010}}</ref> In April 2010, three smaller refineries sued TransCanada to break Keystone transportation contracts, saying the new pipeline has been beset with cost overruns.<ref name = "theglobeandmail-1548807"/>

In October 2009, a suit was filed by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] that challenged the pipeline on the grounds that its permit was based on a deficient environmental impact statement. The suit was thrown out by a federal judge on procedural grounds, ruling that the NRDC lacked the authority to bring it.<ref>{{cite news | title= NRDC's Suit to Block Canada-US Oil Pipeline Thrown Out | url= http://www.heatingoil.com/blog/nrdcs-suit-to-block-canada-us-oil-pipeline-thrown-out102/ | date= October 2, 2009 | agency= [[Associated Press]] | access-date= July 22, 2010 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418200508/http://www.heatingoil.com/blog/nrdcs-suit-to-block-canada-us-oil-pipeline-thrown-out102/ | archive-date= April 18, 2010 }}</ref>

In June 2012, [[Sierra Club]], Inc., Clean Energy Future Oklahoma, and the East Texas Sub Regional Planning Commission filed a joint complaint in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma]] seeking injunctive relief and petitioning for a review of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]' action in issuing Nationwide Permit 12 permits for the Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast portion of the pipeline. The suit alleges that, contrary to the federal [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], 5 U.S.C. § 701 et. seq., the Corps' issuance of the permits was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion.<ref>{{cite news | title=Enviros Sue to Stop Keystone Pipeline Project | url= http://www.cnsenvironmentallaw.com/2012/07/03/1014.htm | agency = Courthouse News Service |access-date= July 18, 2012}}</ref>

In early January 2016, TransCanada announced it would initiate an [[ISDS]] claim under [[NAFTA]] against the United States, seeking $15 billion in damages and calling the denial of a permit for Keystone XL "arbitrary and unjustified."<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/transcanada-files-lawsuit-over-keystone-pipeline-rejection/article28038526/ TransCanada to launch NAFTA claim over Keystone rejection], The Globe and Mail, January 6, 2016</ref>
