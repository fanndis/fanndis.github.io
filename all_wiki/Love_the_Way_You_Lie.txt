"'''Love the Way You Lie'''" is a song recorded by the American rapper [[Eminem]], featuring the [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]], from Eminem's seventh studio album ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' (2010). The singer and songwriter [[Skylar Grey]] wrote and recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song alongside the producer [[Alex da Kid]] when she felt she was in an abusive romantic relationship with the music industry. Eminem wrote the verses and chose Rihanna to sing the chorus, resulting in a collaboration influenced by their past experiences in difficult relationships. Recording sessions were held in [[Ferndale, Michigan]], and Dublin, Ireland. Backed by guitar, piano and violin, the track is a [[tempo|midtempo]] hip-hop [[ballad]] with a [[Pop music|pop]] refrain, sung by Rihanna, and describes two lovers who refuse to separate despite being in a dangerous [[love–hate relationship]].

[[Interscope Records]] released the song on June 25, 2010 as the second single from ''Recovery''. Critics praised its melody but were divided into thematic aspects such as poignancy and accuracy. Eminem promoted the single with performances at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo]], the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]] and [[music festival|festivals]]. The music video, directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], stars [[Dominic Monaghan]] and [[Megan Fox]] in a violent relationship and shows Eminem and Rihanna in front of a burning house. The clip had a mixed reception due to scenes of [[domestic violence]]. Reporters suggested that the song and its accompanying video were influenced by Eminem's and Rihanna's abusive relationships with their respective ex-lovers Kimberly Scott and [[Chris Brown]].

Critics listed "Love the Way You Lie" among the best tracks of 2010 and of Eminem's career. The song won many awards and received five [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations. It is Eminem's best-selling single and ranked number one on several [[record chart]]s, including the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|'' Billboard'' Hot 100]] for seven weeks. The single sold over 12 million copies in the US and 1.5 million in the UK. <!--As of January 17, 2016, the music video for the single has achieved one billion views on [[Vevo]] and [[Youtube]].--> Musical acts such as [[Cher Lloyd]] and [[the Band Perry]] have performed [[cover versions]]. Rihanna has said that the theme of domestic violence, a topic on which she claims many people do not have insight, is what makes the song impactful. She later recorded "[[Love the Way You Lie (Part II)]]", narrated mostly from her perspective.

He preferred to make few changes; for "Love the Way You Lie" he almost exclusively used board [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and console [[equalization (audio)|equalization]]. Strange used the Bricasti and Eventide Reverb 2016 mixing tools for "brighter" reverberation. Detroit musician [[Luis Resto (musician)|Luis Resto]] has contributed to the arrangement on many of Eminem's songs, but did not do so for "Love the Way You Lie".

Rihanna's recording sessions took place at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland, and were engineered by Marcos Tovar. The American songwriter [[Makeba Riddick]] provided additional vocal production.<ref name="notes" /> Strange used equalization, compression and reverberation but left the vocal balance. He assumed that Rihanna was satisfied with her recorded vocals and did not make major changes on her seven stereo vocal tracks.<ref name=sos />

Marjorie Gilberg, executive director of the anti-teenage violence group Break the Cycle, commented that "Love the Way You Lie" can teach listeners about the dangers of abusive relationships if interpreted correctly. She believed that because popular culture often depicts what is socially acceptable, people may accept such violence more easily. She added, "One problem, though,&nbsp;... is that the song reflects myths about domestic violence—myths that lead to [[blaming the victim]]."<ref name=asspress /> Gilberg said the victim is often accused of being as guilty as the partner but wants to be loved, not abused. [[Terry O'Neill (feminist)|Terry O'Neill]], a feminist and the president of the [[National Organization for Women]], criticized the lyric, "But your temper's just as bad as mine is / You're the same as me", saying it is a typical excuse used by abusive men for aggression and that "it's only 2-year-olds and violent men who use violence to get what they want."<ref name=asspress /> She added that Rihanna unintentionally glorifies domestic violence in the song despite attempting to fight it.<ref name=asspress />
