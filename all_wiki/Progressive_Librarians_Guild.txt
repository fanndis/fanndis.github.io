The Progressive Librarians Guild publishes the journal ''The Progressive Librarian'', a forum for critical perspectives in librarianship and information studies.<ref>[http://progressivelibrariansguild.org/PL_Jnl/jnl_contents.shtml The Progressive Librarian]</ref> The journal features articles, book reviews, bibliographies, reports, and documents. The first issue of ''Progressive Librarian'' (PL), published in the summer of 1990 on the heels of the founding of PLG, was given its title by [[Sanford Berman]] who exclaimed that the journal of PLG could have no other title than ''Progressive Librarian'' (the subtitle, ''A Journal of Critical Studies and Progressive Politics in Librarianship'', came later in 1998 with issue #14). The first issue was to be a contribution to the debate taking place within the American Library Association (ALA) in which the upper ranks of power in ALA were attempting to overturn the association's official support of the cultural boycott against apartheid institutions in South Africa.<ref>Harger, Elaine. 2010.

==United States Social Forum 2007==
In 2007 members of the Progressive Librarians Guild participated in the [[United States Social Forum]] (USSF) in Atlanta. In homage to the USSF's statement on language accessibility, PLG's new banner read "Library" on one side and "Biblioteca" on the other for the Opening March that launched the first ever regional social forum in the United States. The Librarians program was held at the Auburn Avenue Research Library, the second largest collection of African-American materials in the U.S., located on the very street that is home to the Ebenezer Baptist Church and the gravesites of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mrs. Coretta Scott King.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harger|first1=Elaine|last2=de la Pena McCook|first2=Kathleen|title=Report from the United States Social Forum: PLG – ¡presenté!|url=http://www.wsflibrary.org/index.php/User:Eharger/BlogEntry:_2007_August_18_18:25:34_EAT|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> PLG members collected materials from the USSF for the Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan.<ref>Harger, Elaine and Kathleen de la Peña McCook.
