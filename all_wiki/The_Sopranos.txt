'''''The Sopranos''''' is an American [[crime drama]] television series created by [[David Chase]]. The story revolves around [[Tony Soprano]] ([[James Gandolfini]]), a New Jersey-based [[American Mafia|Italian-American mobster]], portraying the difficulties that he faces as he tries to balance his family life with his role as the leader of a criminal organization. These are explored during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist [[Jennifer Melfi]] ([[Lorraine Bracco]]). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues, and rivals in prominent roles—most notably his wife [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] ([[Edie Falco]]) and his protégé/distant cousin [[Christopher Moltisanti]] ([[Michael Imperioli]]). 

The pilot was ordered in 1997, and the show premiered on [[HBO]] on January 10, 1999. The series ran for six seasons totaling [[List of The Sopranos episodes|86 episodes]] until June 10, 2007.

====''Baer v. Chase''====

North Jersey prosecutor and municipal judge Robert Baer filed a [[breach of contract]] lawsuit against Chase in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] federal court, alleging that he helped to create the show. Baer lost the suit, but he won a ruling that a jury should decide how much he should be paid for services as a location scout, researcher, and story consultant. Baer argued that he had introduced Chase to Tony Spirito, a restaurateur and gambler with alleged mob ties, and Thomas Koczur, a homicide detective for the Elizabeth, New Jersey Police Department. Chase had conducted interviews and tours with both, which strongly inspired some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in ''The Sopranos''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2007/12/trial_hears_from_alleged_reall.html |title=Jury hears from alleged real-life model for Tony Soprano |work=New Jersey Star Ledger |author=Whelan, Jeff S. |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Chapter 9: ''Baer v.

===Title sequence===
Tony Soprano is seen emerging from the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] and passes through the tollbooth for the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Numerous landmarks in and around [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], are then shown passing by the camera as Tony drives down the highway.<ref name="openingcredits">

In the first three seasons, between Tony leaving the tunnel and passing through the toll plaza, the show had a shot of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers in Tony's right side-view mirror. After the [[September 11 attacks]], this shot was removed and replaced with a more generic shot, beginning with the show's fourth season.<ref name="Jewish">

A parody of the opening sequence was used in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In "[[Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge]]", a variation on the sequence is used, with Fat Tony seen leaving a Springfield tunnel instead of Tony. Fat Tony then continues to drive through Springfield to the same soundtrack as the original.

==Cast and characters==
{{Further|List of The Sopranos characters}}
''The Sopranos'' features a large cast of characters, many of whom get significant amounts of character development. Some only appear in certain seasons, while others appear (sporadically or constantly) throughout the entire series. All characters were created by [[David Chase]] unless otherwise noted.

[[Tony Soprano]] ([[James Gandolfini]]) is the series' [[protagonist]]. Tony is one of the [[caporegime|capos]] (and the unofficial [[underboss]]) of the [[New Jersey]]-based [[DiMeo crime family]], at the beginning of the series; he eventually becomes its undisputed boss. He is also the patriarch of the Soprano household. Throughout the series, Tony struggles to balance the conflicting requirements of his [[family]] with those of the [[criminal organization|Mafia family]] he controls.<ref name="Character: Tony Soprano">

Because he is prone to bouts of [[clinical depression]], after a fainting spell (triggered by a [[panic attack]]), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist [[Dr. Jennifer Melfi]] ([[Lorraine Bracco]]), in the show's [[The Sopranos (episode)|first episode]]. She treats Tony to the best of her ability even though they routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational, and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.<ref name="Character: Jennifer Melfi">

The single-mindedly ambitious Uncle Junior is chronically frustrated by having not been made boss of the DiMeo family, despite old-school mob traditions entitling him to the position by seniority. He feels his authority is perpetually undermined by Tony's greater influence in the organization, and barely contains his seething jealousy at having to watch both his younger brother (Tony's father) and now Tony leapfrog him in the organization. As their professional tensions escalate, Uncle Junior employs increasingly desperate, behind-the-scenes measures to solve his problems with Tony, who still idolizes his uncle, and wants to retain Junior's affection and approval. Uncle Junior and Christopher are fixtures in Tony's real family, as well as his crime family, so their actions in one realm often create further conflicts in the other. Christopher, an entitled, insecure DiMeo associate who is as ambitious as he is insubordinate and incompetent, is also a chronic substance abuser. Tony Blundetto is a well-respected DiMeo family soldier who returns after completing a lengthy prison sentence; he leaves prison committed to "going straight" (to Tony's dismay), but also has an intense violent streak.

Those in Tony's closest circle within the DiMeo crime family include [[Silvio Dante]] ([[Steven Van Zandt]]). Silvio is Tony's [[consigliere]] and best friend. He runs the family's strip club headquarters, and other businesses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Silvio Dante |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/silvio_dante.shtml}}</ref> [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie "Walnuts" Gualtieri]] ([[Tony Sirico]]), a tough, short-tempered, aging soldier who is fiercely loyal to Tony<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Paulie Walnuts |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/paulie_walnuts.shtml}}</ref> and [[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero]] ([[Vincent Pastore]]), a veteran gangster who runs an automotive [[Automobile repair shop|body shop]]. Paulie "Walnuts" and "Big Pussy" (often called just, "Pussy") have worked with Tony and his father.<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Big Pussy |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/big_pussy.shtml}}</ref> Also in Tony's criminal organization are: [[Patsy Parisi]] ([[Dan Grimaldi]]),<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Patsy Parisi |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/patsy_parisi.shtml}}</ref> and [[Furio Giunta]] ([[Federico Castelluccio]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Furio Giunta |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/furio_giunta.shtml}}</ref> Patsy is a soft-spoken soldier with a head for figures; Furio, an Italian national who joins the family later in the series, serves as Tony's violent enforcer and bodyguard.

Other significant characters in the DiMeo family include: [[Bobby Baccalieri|Bobby "Bacala" Baccalieri]] ([[Steven R. Schirripa]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Bobby Baccala |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/bobby_baccala.shtml}}</ref> [[Richie Aprile]] ([[David Proval]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Richie Aprile |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/richie_aprile.shtml}}</ref> [[Ralph Cifaretto]] ([[Joe Pantoliano]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Ralph Cifaretto |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/ralph_cifaretto.shtml}}</ref> [[Eugene Pontecorvo]] ([[Robert Funaro]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Eugene Pontecorvo |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/eugene_pentacorvo.shtml}}</ref> and [[Vito Spatafore]] ([[Joseph R.

Ralph is a clever, ambitious top-earner; but his arrogant, obnoxious, disrespectful, and unpredictably violent tendencies turn Tony resentful. Richie Aprile is released from prison in season 2, and quickly makes waves. Pontecorvo is a young soldier who becomes a "made" man alongside Christopher. Spatafore works his way up through the ranks to become top earner of the Aprile crew but is secretly homosexual.

Friends of the Soprano family include: [[Herman "Hesh" Rabkin]] ([[Jerry Adler]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Hesh Rabkin |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/hesh_rabkin.shtml}}</ref> [[Adriana La Cerva]] ([[Drea de Matteo]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Adriana La Cerva |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/adriana_lacerva.shtml}}</ref> [[Rosalie Aprile]] ([[Sharon Angela]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Rosalie Aprile |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/rosalie_aprile.shtml}}</ref> [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Angie Bonpensiero|Angie Bonpensiero]] ([[Toni Kalem]]), along with [[Artie Bucco|Artie]] ([[John Ventimiglia]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Artie Bucco |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/artie_bucco.shtml}}</ref> and [[Charmaine Bucco]] ([[Kathrine Narducci]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Charmaine Bucco |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/charmaine_bucco.shtml}}</ref> Hesh is an invaluable adviser and friend to Tony, as he was when Tony's father ran things. Adriana is Christopher's loyal and long-suffering girlfriend; the two have a volatile relationship but appear destined to stay together. Christopher often ignores Adriana's advice and winds up regretting it. Rosalie is the widow of previous DiMeo boss [[Jackie Aprile Sr.]] and a very close friend of Carmela. Angie is Salvatore Bonpensiero's wife; she later goes into "business" for herself, and quite successfully. Artie & Charmaine are childhood friends of the Sopranos, and owners of the popular restaurant, Vesuvio. Charmaine wishes to have no association with Tony and his crew due to fears that Tony's criminal ways will ultimately ruin everything she and Artie have achieved. Artie, however—a law-abiding, hard-working man—is drawn to his childhood friend Tony's glamorous, seemingly carefree lifestyle. Charmaine bitterly resents Artie's chronic tendency to disregard her wishes while catering to Tony's; their marriage suffers greatly as a result. Charmaine also had a brief sexual encounter with Tony (when he and Carmela had temporarily broken-up) when all four were teenagers.

[[John Sacramoni|John "Johnny Sack" Sacramoni]] ([[Vince Curatola]]),<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Johnny Sack |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/johnny_sack.shtml}}</ref> [[Phil Leotardo]] ([[Frank Vincent]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Phil Leotardo |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/phil_leotardo.shtml}}</ref> and [[Little Carmine|"Little" Carmine Lupertazzi Jr.]] ([[Ray Abruzzo]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Character profile – Little Carmine |publisher=HBO |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/cast/character/little_carmine.shtml}}</ref> are all significant characters from the New York City-based [[Lupertazzi crime family]], which shares a good amount of its business with the Soprano organization. Although the Lupertazzis' and DiMeos' interests are often at odds, Tony maintains a cordial, business-like relationship with "Johnny Sack", preferring to make mutually beneficial deals, not war. Johnny Sack's second-in-command and eventual successor, Phil Leotardo, is less friendly and harder for Tony to do business with. Little Carmine is the son of the family's first boss and vies for power with its other members.

===Season 1 (1999)===
{{main|The Sopranos (season 1)}}
When [[Tony Soprano]] collapses after suffering a [[panic attack]], he begins [[psychotherapy|therapy]] with [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Jennifer Melfi]]. Details of Tony's upbringing - with his father's influence looming large on his development as a gangster, but more so that Tony's mother, [[Livia Soprano|Livia]], was vengeful and possibly [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] - are revealed. His complicated relationship with his wife [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] is also explored, as well as her feelings regarding her husband's ''[[American Mafia|cosa nostra]]'' ties. [[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]] and [[Anthony Soprano Jr.|Anthony Jr.]], Tony's children, gain increasing knowledge of their father's mob dealings. Later, federal indictments are brought as a result of someone in his organization talking to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].

Tony's uncle [[Junior Soprano|Corrado "Junior" Soprano]] orders the murder of [[Brendan Filone]] and the mock execution of [[Chris Moltisanti]], associates of Tony, as a reprisal for repeated hijackings of trucks under Corrado's protection. Tony defuses the situation by allowing his uncle to be installed as boss of the family (following the death of previous boss [[Jackie Aprile Sr.]] from cancer), while Tony retains actual control of most things from behind the scenes. Corrado discovers the artifice, however, and orders an attempt on Tony's life. The assassination is botched and Tony responds violently, before confronting his mother for her role in plotting his downfall; she appears to have a psychologically-triggered [[stroke]]. "Junior" is arrested by the FBI on unrelated charges.

===Season 2 (2000)===
{{main|The Sopranos (season 2)}}
Jackie's brother [[Richie Aprile]] is released from prison, proving to be uncontrollable in the business arena. He starts a relationship with [[Janice Soprano|Janice]], Tony's sister, who has arrived from Seattle. [[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|"Big Pussy"]] returns to New Jersey after a conspicuous absence.

[[Christopher Moltisanti]] becomes engaged to his girlfriend [[Adriana La Cerva]]. [[Matthew Bevilaqua]] and [[Sean Gismonte]], two low-level associates dissatisfied with their perceived lack of success in the Soprano crew, try to make a name for themselves by attempting to kill Christopher. Their plan fails and Christopher kills Sean, but is critically wounded. Tony and Big Pussy locate Matthew and kill him. A witness goes to the FBI and identifies Tony.

Junior is placed under [[house arrest]] as he awaits trial. Richie, frustrated with Tony's authority over him, entreats Junior to have Tony killed. Junior feigns interest, then informs Tony of Richie's intentions, leaving Tony with another problem to address. However, the situation is defused unexpectedly when Janice kills Richie in a violent argument; Tony and his men conceal all evidence of the murder, and Janice returns to Seattle.

Tony, realizing Big Pussy is an FBI informant, kills him on board a boat (with assistance from [[Silvio Dante]] and [[Paulie Gualtieri]]), disposing of his body at sea.

===Season 3 (2001)===
{{main|The Sopranos (season 3)}}
Following the "disappearance" of [[Richie Aprile]], the return of the ambitious [[Ralph Cifaretto]], having spent an extended period of leisure time in [[Miami]], marks the [[List of The Sopranos episodes#Season 3: 2001|third season]]. He renews a relationship with [[Rosalie Aprile]], the widow of [[Jackie Aprile Sr.]] With Richie assumed to have joined the Witness Protection Program, Ralph unofficially usurps control over the Aprile crew, proving to be an exceptionally dexterous earner for the crew. While Ralph's competitive merit would seemingly have him next in line to ascend to capo, his insubordination inclines Tony not to promote him and he instead gives the promotion to the unqualified but complacent [[Gigi Cestone]], causing much resentment and tension between him and Ralph. Livia dies of a stroke.

Rosalie's son [[Jackie Aprile Jr.]] becomes involved with Meadow and then descends into a downward spiral of recklessness, drugs and crime. Tony initially attempts to act as a mentor to Jackie but becomes increasingly impatient with his escalating misbehavior, particularly as Jackie's relationship with Meadow begins to become serious. Inspired by a story from Ralph about how Tony, Jackie Sr., and [[Silvio Dante]] got made, Jackie and his friends [[Dino Zerilli]] and [[Carlo Renzi]] make a similar move and attempt to rob [[Eugene Pontecorvo]]'s Saturday night card game so they can gain recognition from the family. The plan takes a turn for the worse when Jackie panics and kills the card dealer, provoking a shoot-out. Dino and Carlo are killed, but Jackie manages to escape. Tony decides to give Ralph the decision regarding Jackie Jr.'s punishment. Despite his role as a surrogate father, Ralph decides to have Jackie Jr. killed.

Ralph ultimately crosses the line when, in a cocaine-induced rage, he gets into a confrontation with his (possibly pregnant) girlfriend Tracee and beats her to death. This infuriates Tony to the point where he violates traditional mafia code by striking him repeatedly in front of the entire family. Bad blood temporarily surfaces between the two but is shortly resolved after Cestone suffers a fatal [[heart attack]], thereby forcing Tony to reluctantly promote Ralph to capo.

Tony begins an affair with [[Gloria Trillo]], who is also a patient of Dr. Melfi. Their relationship is brief and tumultuous. Meanwhile, Dr. Melfi is raped by a stranger in a parking complex. Junior is diagnosed with stomach cancer; following chemotherapy, it goes into remission. A.J. continues to get in trouble at school — despite success on the football team — which culminates in his expulsion.

===Season 4 (2002)===
{{main|The Sopranos (season 4)}}
New York underboss [[Johnny Sack]] becomes enraged after learning [[Ralph Cifaretto]] made an inappropriate joke about his wife's weight. He seeks permission from boss [[Carmine Lupertazzi]] to have Ralph clipped, but is denied. Johnny orders the hit anyway. Tony receives the okay from Carmine to hit Johnny Sack for insubordination. Junior Soprano tips Tony to use an old outfit in Providence for the work. After catching his wife eating sweets secretly, instead of following the diet plan, Johnny Sack calls off the hit on Ralph, and bloodshed is averted.

Tony and Ralph invest in a racehorse named [[Pie-O-My]], who wins several races and makes them both a great deal of money. However, when Ralph's 12-year-old son Justin is severely injured in an archery accident, Tony comes to believe Ralph burned Pie-O-My in a stable fire to collect $200,000 in insurance money. Tony confronts Ralph and Ralph denies setting the fire. The two engage in a violent brawl, culminating in Tony strangling Ralph to death. Tony and Christopher dispose of the body.

While he is leaving court, Junior is hit in the head with a [[boom mic]] and falls down several steps. Tony advises him to take advantage of the opportunity, act mentally incompetent, and employ it as a ruse for not continuing the trial. Later, [[Eugene Pontecorvo]] intimidates a juror, resulting in a deadlocked jury, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial.

Following the death of [[Bobby Baccalieri]]'s wife, Janice pursues a romantic relationship with him. Christopher's addiction to heroin deepens, prompting his associates and family to organize an intervention, after which he enters a [[drug rehabilitation]] center. Adriana's friend Danielle Ciccolella is revealed to be undercover FBI agent [[Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrup]], who tells Adriana the only way for her to stay out of prison is to become an informant. Adriana agrees and starts sharing information with the FBI.

Carmela, whose relationship with Tony is tense due to financial worries and Tony's infidelities, develops a mutual infatuation with [[Furio Giunta]]. Furio, incapable of breaking his moral codes and that of the Neapolitan mafia, clandestinely returns home to Italy. After Tony's former mistress calls their home, Carmela throws Tony out. Tony is approached by Johnny Sack with a proposal to murder Carmine, which Tony turns down.

===Season 5 (2004)===
{{main|The Sopranos (season 5)}}
A string of new characters are introduced, including Tony's cousin [[Tony Blundetto]], who simultaneously along with other mafiosi, is released from prison. Among the others released are former [[DiMeo crime family]] capo [[Feech La Manna|Michele "Feech" La Manna]], Lupertazzi family capo [[Phil Leotardo]], and semi-retired Lupertazzi [[consigliere]] [[Angelo Garepe]]. Tony offers Tony B a job, but he respectfully declines, as he is determined to lead a straight life. He initially begins to take courses to earn a degree in [[massage therapy]] and aspires to open up a massage parlor. After [[Carmine Lupertazzi]] dies of a stroke, his death leaves a vacancy for the boss of the Lupertazzi family, which will soon be fought over by underboss [[Johnny Sack]] and Carmine's son Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. After Feech proves to be an insubordinate presence, Tony arranges for him to be sent back to prison by setting him up with stolen property, violating his parole.

The war between Johnny Sack and Carmine Jr. begins when Johnny has Phil kill "lady shylock" [[Lorraine Calluzzo]]. Tony B's attempt to stay straight comes to a head when he gets into a brawl with his employer. Angelo, who was a good friend to Tony B in prison, and Lupertazzi capo [[Rusty Millio]] offer Tony B the job of taking out Joey Peeps in retaliation for Lorraine's death. Tony B initially declines but, desperate to earn, accepts the job. He catches Joey outside a bordello, shoots him, and quickly flees the scene. Johnny believes Tony B is involved and retaliates by having Phil and his brother [[Billy Leotardo]] kill Angelo. Tony B finds the Leotardo brothers and opens fire, killing Billy and wounding Phil.

Separated from Carmela, Tony is living at his parents' house. Carmela, the sole authority figure in the home, becomes frustrated as her rules lead A.J. to resent her so she allows him to live with his father. She has a brief relationship with Robert Wegler, A.J.'s guidance counselor; he breaks it off abruptly when he suspects that she is manipulating him to improve A.J.'s grades. Tony and Carmela reconcile; Tony promises to be more loyal and agrees to pay for a piece of real estate Carmela wishes to develop.

Tony gets Meadow's boyfriend [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Finn DeTrolio|Finn De Trolio]] a summer job at a construction site, which is run by Aprile crew capo [[Vito Spatafore]]. Finn comes in early one morning and catches Vito performing [[fellatio]] on a security guard. Vito tries to buddy up to Finn so that he keeps quiet, but Finn soon quits the job out of fear.

After covering up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI to wear a wire to avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she may be able to persuade Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but he instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana's betrayal and subsequent execution are too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.

Phil Leotardo and his henchmen beat [[Benny Fazio]] while trying to acquire the whereabouts of Tony B; Phil also threatens to have Christopher taken out if Tony B's whereabouts are not disclosed soon. To avoid anymore of his guys getting hurt and to pacify New York, Tony tracks Tony B to their Uncle Pat's farm and shoots him. Phil is furious that he did not get the opportunity to do it himself. Tony and Johnny meet at Johnny's house in a reconciliatory manner, but Johnny is arrested by Federal agents, while Tony escapes.

===Season 6 (2006–07)===
{{main|The Sopranos (season 6)}}
A senile and confused Uncle Junior shoots Tony. Rendered comatose, Tony dreams he is a salesman on a business trip who mistakenly exchanges his briefcase and identification with a man named Kevin Finnerty. Tony's recovery from the shooting changes his outlook and he tries to mend his ways. However, he is faced with more problems in his business life.

Once out of the hospital, Johnny Sack's daughter gets married and the Soprano family attends. Johnny Sack is approved to leave prison for six hours to see his daughter get married but has to pay for the metal detectors and the presence of the U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about to drive away, the SUV that was escorting Johnny to the wedding blocks the car from leaving and an altercation begins in the driveway. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny Sack cries as he is put back into handcuffs and driven back to prison, greatly diminishing the respect his crew and Tony's crew have for him.

[[Vito Spatafore]] is outed as gay after running into a friend making collections at a New York gay night club. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito with the security guard. Finn is forced to tell Tony's entire crew what happened with the guard, solidifying their thoughts on Vito's sexuality. Tony is urged to deal with the problem by the intensely homophobic Phil Leotardo, now the acting boss of New York. Once Vito is outed, he flees to a New Hampshire town, where he poses as an author and starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Eventually, Vito returns to New Jersey and asks Tony to allow him to return to work, albeit in Atlantic City. He continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual. Tony mulls over the decision to let him work, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. When one of the members of the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won't stop making jokes about Vito and his death, Silvio and Carlo kill Fat Dom out of anger at his disrespect. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.

During the first half of the season Chris and Carmine head to Los Angeles in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to try to sign [[Ben Kingsley]] for a film they are trying to make called ''Cleaver'', which is a mix of ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]''. While in Los Angeles, Chris goes back to using cocaine for a short period.

Tony considers killing several of his associates for relatively minor infractions. Christopher is unable to leave the mob, deflecting his problems by relapsing into drug addiction and kills his friend from Narcotics Anonymous, J. T. Dolan. He is then seriously injured in a car accident while driving under the influence of narcotics. Tony, the sole passenger, finally loses patience with Christopher's failings and suffocates him. A.J. is dumped by his fiancée and slips into depression, culminating in a [[suicide attempt]] in the backyard pool. Dr. Melfi is convinced by colleagues that Tony is making no progress and may even be using talk therapy for his sociopathic benefit. She drops him as a patient.

Johnny Sack dies from lung cancer while imprisoned, and Leotardo consolidates his position in the Lupertazzi family by having his rivals for the leadership killed. Phil then officially takes over, igniting a resumption of the past feud with Tony and refusing to compromise with Tony on a garbage deal. When Tony assaults a Lupertazzi soldier for harassing Meadow while she is on a date, Phil decides it's time to decapitate the Soprano crew. He orders the executions of Bobby Baccalieri, who is shot to death; Silvio, who ends up comatose; and Tony, who goes into hiding. A deal is brokered whereby the rest of the Lupertazzi family agrees to ignore the order to kill Tony, allowing Tony to go after Phil. FBI agent Dwight Harris informs Tony of Phil's location, allowing Tony to have him killed. Tony suspects that Carlo Gervasi, a capo from New Jersey, has become an informant in an attempt to help out his son, who has recently been caught for dealing ecstasy. Tony meets his lawyer, who informs him that subpoenas are being given to New Jersey and New York crews alike.

Tony plans to have dinner at a diner with his family. As Meadow arrives at the door, the screen goes to Tony. The diner door opens with a bell ringing, Tony looks up and the show [[smash cut]]s to black and after a few seconds, the credits roll in silence.

Chase's decision to end the last episode abruptly with just a black screen was controversial. While Chase has insisted that it was not his intention to stir controversy, the ambiguity over the ending and question of whether Tony was murdered has continued for years after the finale's original broadcast and has spawned numerous websites devoted to finding out his true intention.<ref name="EWchase">

===Influence on television industry===
''The Sopranos'' had a significant effect on the shape of the American television industry. It has been characterized by critics as one of the most influential artistic works of the 2000s and has been cited as helping to turn serial television into a legitimate art form on the same level as feature films, literature, and theater.<ref name="popmatters"/><ref name="Time"/><ref name="popmatters2"/> ''[[Time Magazine]]'' editor James Poniewozik wrote in 2007, "This mafia saga showed just how complex and involving TV storytelling could be, inspiring an explosion of ambitious dramas on cable and off."<ref name="Time">

Maureen Ryan of PopMatters described ''The Sopranos'' as the most influential television drama ever. "No one-hour drama series has had a bigger impact on how stories are told on the small screen, or more influence on what kind of fare we've been offered by an ever-growing array of television networks."<ref name="popmatters">

Hal Boedeker stated in PopMatters in 2007 that the series was "widely influential for revealing that cable would accommodate complex series about dark characters. ''The Sopranos'' ushered in ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[The Shield]]'', ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'', and ''[[Big Love]]''."<ref name="popmatters2">

Weiner said that when he became a writer for ''The Sopranos'' after having written the ''Mad Men'' pilot, "Whatever I had intended [''Mad Men''] to be ... was very different after seeing how seriously David Chase took human behavior. Real human behavior", giving "[[Maidenform (Mad Men)|Maidenform]]" and how [[Peggy Olson]]'s baby affects her as examples.<ref name="nyt20190110">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/arts/television/best-drama-series.html |title=The 20 Best TV Dramas Since 'The Sopranos' |date=January 10, 2019 |work=The New York Times |access-date=January 10, 2019 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The series helped establish HBO as producers of critically acclaimed and commercially successful original television series. Michael Flaherty of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has stated that ''The Sopranos'' "helped launch [HBO's] reputation as a destination for talent looking for cutting-edge original series work."<ref name="hollywoodreporter"/>

===Depiction of stereotypes===

The show has frequently been criticized for perpetuating negative stereotypes about [[Italian American]]s. Several major organizations have voiced their concern that ''The Sopranos'' presents a very distorted and harmful stereotype of Italian Americans and their cultural values, including the National Italian American Foundation, [[Order Sons of Italy in America]], [[Unico National]], and the Italic Institute of America.<ref>{{cite press |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-italian-american-foundation-condemns-the-sopranos-72034917.html |title=National Italian American Foundation Condemns 'The Sopranos' |publisher=National Italian American Foundation |date=January 12, 2000 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite press |url=http://www.niaf.org/niaf_event/official-statement-on-the-newyork-columbus-day-parade-with-oprano-cast-and-mayor-bloombergs-inappropriate-choice-of-guests/ |title=Official Statement on the New York Columbus Day Parade with Soprano Cast and Mayor Bloomberg's Inappropriate Choice of Guests |publisher=National Italian American Foundation |date=October 10, 2002 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite press |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/italian-american-coalition-applauds-sopranos-dis-invite-73314987.html |title=Italian American Coalition Applauds 'Sopranos Dis-Invite' |publisher=The National Italian American Foundation |date=September 18, 2000 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}</ref>

In 2000, officials in [[Essex County, New Jersey]], denied producers permission to film on county-owned property, arguing that the show depicts Italian Americans in a "less than favorable light."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/sopranos/ledger/index.ssf?/sopranos/stories/121600essex.html |title=Essex officials tell 'The Sopranos': Fuhgeddabout filming around here |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |last=Schuppe |first=Jonathan |date=December 16, 2000 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]]}}</ref> In 2002, organizers of the New York City Columbus Day Parade won an injunction preventing Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] from inviting cast members of ''The Sopranos'' to participate in the parade.<ref>{{cite news |last=Susman |first=Gary |title=Marching Banned |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,364447,00.html |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |date=October 14, 2002}}</ref>

[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s [[Fairleigh Dickinson University#PublicMind|PublicMind]] conducted a national survey in August 2001 which polled 800 people. 37% said that they watched the show regularly, and 65% of this group (192 people, or 24% of the total) disagreed that the show negatively portrayed Italian Americans. Professor William Roberts was associated with the poll, and is the author of several books on modern Italian history; he commented that: "The show's inflated image of organized crime casts a shadow over both the state and its Italian American community."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] |url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/badabing/ |title=New Jersey and The Sopranos: Perfect Together? |date=August 15, 2001 |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref>

At the end of the series, the PublicMind conducted a second national survey on ''The Sopranos''. In this poll, 41% of the 776 people polled said that they watched the show regularly, and 61% of this group (194 people, or 25% of the total) disagreed with the idea that the show portrayed Italian Americans in a negative light. Professor Roberts stated: "The show helped to perpetuate one of the more problematic and stereotypical images of Italian Americans. Both Italian and Italian American cultures have much more diverse and interesting heritages than the American public generally realizes."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/intune/ |title=New Jersey and Nation in Tune with The Sopranos |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref> Humanities professor [[Camille Paglia]], herself an Italian American, has spoken negatively about ''The Sopranos'', arguing that its depiction of Italian Americans was inaccurate, inauthentic, and dated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/10/camille_paglias_glittering_images/ |title=In "Glittering" return, Paglia lets loose |work=Salon.com |first=Kerry |last=Lauerman |date=October 10, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}</ref>
