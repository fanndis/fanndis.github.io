'''Spotify''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|p|Q|t|I|f|ai}}; {{IPA-sv|ˈspɔ̂tːɪfaj|lang}}) is a Swedish [[Streaming media|audio streaming]] and media services provider, launched in October 2008. The platform is owned by '''Spotify AB''', a [[public company|publicly traded company]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] since 2018 through its [[holding company]] '''Spotify Technology S.A.''' based in [[Luxembourg]]. Spotify's global headquarters are in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=https://www.spotify.com/us/about-us/contact/ |title=About us |work=www.spotify.com |publisher=Spotify AB |accessdate=5 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/15/spotify-adding-more-than-1000-jobs-in-new-york-moving-to-world-trade-center.html|title=Spotify adding more than 1,000 jobs in New York, moving to World Trade Center|first=Lauren|last=Thomas|date=15 February 2017|website=CNBC}}</ref>

Spotify offers [[Digital rights management|digital copyright restricted]] recorded music and [[podcast]]s, including more than 60 million songs, from record labels and media companies.<ref name="Spotify company info" /> As a [[freemium]] service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share [[playlist]]s.

Spotify is available in most of Europe and the Americas, Oceania, and parts of Africa and Asia, and on most modern devices, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] computers, and [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones and tablets and AI enabled smart speakers such as Amazon Alexa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://channelstore.roku.com/details/19977/spotify|title=Spotify Music |website=Roku Channel Store |publisher=Roku |access-date=12 November 2018}}</ref> As of October 2020, the platform has 320 million monthly [[active users]], including 144 million paying subscribers.<ref name="Spotify company info" />

Unlike physical or download sales, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays [[royalties]] based on the number of artist streams as a proportion of total songs streamed. It distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights holders (often [[Record label|record labels]]), who then pay artists based on individual agreements.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/how-spotify-apple-music-can-pay-musicians-more-commentary.html|title=Spotify and Apple Music should become record labels so musicians can make a fair living|last=Sehgal|first=Kabir|date=26 January 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=21 November 2018}}</ref> [[Criticism of Spotify|Spotify has faced criticism]] from artists and producers including [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Thom Yorke]], who have argued that it does not compensate musicians fairly. In 2017, as part of its efforts to renegotiate license deals for an interest in [[Initial public offering|going public]], Spotify announced that artists would be able to make albums temporarily exclusive to paid subscribers if the albums are part of [[Universal Music Group]] or the [[Merlin Network]].

=== Early international launches ===
[[File:Spotify HQ.jpg|thumb|Former Spotify headquarters in Stockholm]]
In February 2009, Spotify opened public registration for the free service tier in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Parsons"/> Registrations surged following the release of the mobile service, leading Spotify to halt registration for the free service in September, returning the UK to an invitation-only policy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spotify reintroduces waiting list, nudges you to paying|url=https://www.theregister.com/2009/09/11/spotify_signups/|website=www.theregister.com|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>

Spotify launched in the United States in July 2011 and offered a six-month ad-supported trial period, where new users could listen to an unlimited amount of music for free. In January 2012, the free trial periods began to expire, and limited users to ten hours of streaming each month and five plays per song.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spotify early adopters will soon lose unlimited listening on free accounts|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/6/2688250/spotify-free-account-restriction-10-hours-per-month|last=D'Orazio|first=Dante|date=6 January 2012|website=The Verge|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref> In March, Spotify removed all limits on the free service tier indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spotify to continue to let US users stream music for free|url=https://nypost.com/2012/03/29/spotify-to-continue-to-let-us-users-stream-music-for-free/|last=Report|first=Post Staff|date=29 March 2012|website=New York Post|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>

In April 2016, Ek and Lorentzon wrote an open letter to Swedish politicians demanding action in three areas that they claimed hindered the company's ability to recruit top talent as Spotify grows, including access to flexible housing, better education in the programming and development fields, and stock options. Ek and Lorentzon wrote that to continue competing in a global economy, politicians needed to respond with new policies, or else thousands of Spotify jobs would be moved from Sweden to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |first=Hazel |last=Sheffield |title=Spotify's threats to leave Sweden spur startup protest in Stockholm |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/spotifys-threats-to-leave-sweden-spur-startup-protest-in-stockholm-a6986431.html |website=[[The Independent]] |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>

In late 2016, the company launched its "largest [marketing] campaign to date", by placing large-scale billboards in major cities around the world that humorously mocked users' listening habits. Spotify's Chief Marketing Officer [[Seth Farbman]] told ''Creativity'' that "there has been some debate about whether big data is muting creativity in marketing, but we have turned that on its head ... For us, data inspires and gives an insight into the emotion that people are expressing."<ref>{{cite web |first=Alexandra |last=Jardine |title='Thanks 2016, It's Been Weird,' Says Spotify in Biggest-Ever Global Campaign |url=http://creativity-online.com/work/spotify-thanks-2016/50063 |website=[[Creativity (magazine)|Creativity]] |publisher=[[Crain Communications]] |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>

In February 2017, Spotify announced a major expansion of its United States operations in [[Lower Manhattan]], New York City, at [[4 World Trade Center]], adding approximately 1,000 new jobs and retaining 832 existing positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/02/16/17/spotify-expands-with-world-trade-center-move|title=Spotify expands with World Trade Center move|publisher=Agence France-Presse via ABS-CBN|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> The company's US headquarters are located in New York City's [[Flatiron District]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Tanza |last=Loudenback |title=Step inside Spotify's New York City office, where you'll find an airy roof deck, cold brew coffee, and a secret recording studio |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-office-tour-2016-7 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=25 July 2016 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>

On 14 November 2018, the company announced a total of 13 new markets in the [[MENA]] region, including the creation of a new Arabic hub and several playlists, while supporting right-to-left text in their apps.

====Initial public offering====
According to ''[[TechCrunch]]'', Spotify was planning to become public on the [[stock market]] in 2017, but instead used an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in 2018 to "build up a better balance sheet and work on shifting its business model to improve its margins".<ref name="tc-ipo"/> The value of its IPO is estimated to be in a range of $6.3 billion to $23 billion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43235317|title=Is Spotify really worth $23bn?|date=1 March 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref> The latter figure would make Spotify's IPO one of the biggest in the tech sector since 2012.<ref name=":0" /> However, unlike in an ordinary public offering, Spotify would not issue new shares, but the company's existing shareholders would be taking their shares directly to the market.

''[[Financial Times]]'' reported in March 2017 that, as part of its efforts to renegotiate new licensing deals with music labels, Spotify and major record labels had agreed that Spotify would restrict some newly released albums to its Premium tier, with Spotify receiving a reduction in royalty fees to do so. Select albums would be available only on the Premium tier for a period of time, before general release. The deal "may be months away from being finalized, but Spotify is said to have cleared this particular clause with major record labels".<ref>{{cite web |first1=Nick |last1=Statt |first2=Micah |last2=Singleton |title=Spotify will restrict some albums to its paid tier |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/16/14950492/spotify-premium-free-tier-restricting-album-releases-ipo |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Parker |last=Wilhelm |title=Spotify may soon require a Premium account to listen to certain albums |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/spotify-may-soon-require-a-premium-account-to-listen-to-certain-albums |website=[[TechRadar]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Summers |title=Spotify might delay album releases for 'free' users |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/16/spotify-might-delay-album-releases-for-free-users/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=AOL |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref> New reports in April confirmed that Spotify and [[Universal Music Group]] had reached an agreement to allow artists part of Universal to limit their new album releases to the Premium service tier for a maximum of two weeks.

==== Dispute with Apple ====
{{See also|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Spotify}}
In July 2015, Spotify launched an email campaign to urge its [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] subscribers to cancel their subscriptions and start new ones through its website, bypassing the 30% transaction fee for in-app purchases required for [[iOS]] applications by technology company [[Apple Inc.]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Spotify urges iPhone customers to stop paying through Apple's App Store |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8913105/spotify-apple-app-store-email |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> A later update to the Spotify app on iOS was rejected by Apple, prompting Spotify's general counsel Horacio Gutierrez to write a letter to Apple's then-general counsel Bruce Sewell, stating: "This latest episode raises serious concerns under both U.S. and EU competition law. It continues a troubling pattern of behavior by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to [[Apple Music]], particularly when seen against the backdrop of Apple's previous anticompetitive conduct aimed at Spotify … we cannot stand by as Apple uses the App Store approval process as a weapon to harm competitors."<ref>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Kafka |title=Spotify says Apple won't approve a new version of its app because it doesn't want competition for Apple Music |url=http://www.recode.net/2016/6/30/12067578/spotify-apple-app-store-rejection |website=[[Recode]] |publisher=Vox Media |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>

Sewell responded to the letter: "We find it troubling that you are asking for exemptions to the rules we apply to all developers and are publicly resorting to rumors and half-truths about our service." He also elaborated that "Our guidelines apply equally to all app developers, whether they are game developers, e-book sellers, video-streaming services or digital music distributors; and regardless of whether or not they compete against Apple. We did not alter our behavior or our rules when we introduced our own music streaming service or when Spotify became a competitor". Furthermore, he stated that "There is nothing in Apple’s conduct that ‘amounts to a violation of applicable antitrust laws.’ Far from it. ... I would be happy to facilitate an expeditious review and approval of your app as soon as you provide us with something that is compliant with the App Store's rules".<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Paczkowski |title=Apple Slams Spotify For Asking For "Preferential Treatment" |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-fires-back-at-spotify-for-asking-for-preferential-trea |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701215735/https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-fires-back-at-spotify-for-asking-for-preferential-trea |website=[[BuzzFeed]] |date=1 July 2016 |archive-date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Oscar |last=Raymundo |title=Apple slams Spotify for criticizing the App Store as anti-competitive |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/3090219/ios/spotify-lawyers-up-against-apple-for-rejecting-its-updated-ios-app.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>

In the following months, Spotify joined several other companies in filing a letter with the [[European Union]]'s [[antitrust]] body indirectly accusing Apple and [[Google]] of "abusing their 'privileged position' at the top of the market", by referring to "some" companies as having "transformed into 'gatekeepers' rather than 'gateways'".<ref>{{cite web |first=Mikey |last=Campbell |title=Spotify, others file EU complaint over Apple and Google app store practices |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/05/spotify-others-file-eu-complaint-over-apple-and-google-app-store-practices |website=AppleInsider |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Spotify again accuses Apple of abusing its size & acting as a 'gatekeeper' |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/06/spotify-again-accuses-apple-of-abusing-its-size-acting-as-a-gatekeeper/ |website=9to5Mac |date=6 May 2017 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> The complaint led to the European Union announcing that it would prepare an initiative by the end of 2017 for a possible law addressing unfair competition practices.<ref>{{cite web |first=Julia |last=Fioretti |title=EU to tackle complaints over tech companies' trading practices |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-digital-idUSKBN18614K |agency=Reuters |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=10 May 2017 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Lovejoy |title=EU planning a new law addressing 'unfair contractual clauses' following Spotify's complaint against Apple |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/10/eu-apple-spotify-complaint/ |website=9to5Mac |date=10 May 2017 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>

Two days later Apple responded stating that the claim was misleading rhetoric and that Spotify wanted benefits of a free app without being a free app. Spotify responded with a statement calling Apple a monopolist and stated that they had only filed the complaint as Apple's actions hurt competition and consumers, and was in clear violation of the law.

Apple responded to Spotify's claims by counter-claiming that without the Apple App Store platform, Spotify's market reach and user base would not have been possible. Additionally, Apple stated that they have attempted to work with Spotify to integrate the service better with Apple's products, such as [[Siri]] and Apple Watch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/addressing-spotifys-claims/|title=Addressing Spotify's Claims|website=Apple Newsroom|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref> In 2019, under [[iOS 13]], it became possible to play Spotify music using Siri commands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bgr.com/2019/10/07/apple-vs-spotify-siri-integration-ios-13/|title=Apple just finally added Spotify integration to Siri in iOS 13|last=Meek|first=Andy|date=7 October 2019|website=BGR|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref> In September 2020, Spotify joined [[The Coalition for App Fairness]] which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in [[App store|app stores]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2020-09-24|title=Epic, Spotify, and others take on Apple with "Coalition for App Fairness"|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/epic-spotify-and-others-take-on-apple-with-coalition-for-app-fairness/|access-date=2020-09-26|website=Ars Technica}}</ref>

== Business model ==
Spotify operates under a [[freemium]] business model (basic services are free, while additional features are offered via paid subscriptions). Spotify generates revenues by selling premium streaming subscriptions to users and advertising placements to third parties.

In December 2013, the company launched a new website, "Spotify for Artists", that explained its business model and revenue data. Spotify gets its content from major record labels as well as [[independent artist]]s and pays [[copyright]] holders [[royalties]] for streamed music. The company pays 70% of its total revenue to rights holders. Spotify for Artists states that the company does not have a fixed per-play rate; instead it considers factors such as the user's home country and the individual artist's royalty rate. Rightsholders received an average per-play payout between $.006 and $.0084.<ref name="Spotify business">{{cite web |title=How is Spotify contributing to the music business? |url=http://www.spotifyartists.com/spotify-explained/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141103193456/http://www.spotifyartists.com/spotify-explained/ |publisher=Spotify |archive-date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2008, just after launch, the company made a loss of 31.8 million Swedish kronor ($4.4 million).<ref>{{cite web |first=Johan |last=Nylander |title=Spotify doubled its loss last year |url=http://www.swedishwire.com/business/751-spotify-doubled-its-loss-last-year |website=The Swedish Wire |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181238/http://www.swedishwire.com/business/751-spotify-doubled-its-loss-last-year|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> In October 2010, ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' reported that Spotify was making more money for labels in Sweden than any other retailer "online or off".<ref>{{cite web |first=Duncan |last=Geere |title=Spotify now top-tier music revenue source in Sweden |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-10/29/spotify-swedish-revenue |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030230717/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-10/29/spotify-swedish-revenue |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=29 October 2010 |archive-date=30 October 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> Years after growth and expansion, a November 2012 report suggested strong momentum for the company.

==== Funding ====
In February 2010, Spotify received a small investment from [[Founders Fund]], where board member [[Sean Parker]] was recruited to assist Spotify in "winning the labels over in the world's largest music market".<ref>{{cite web |first1=Tim |last1=Bradshaw |first2=Joseph |last2=Menn |title=Spotify-MOG battle heats up |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7a289b4e-249b-11df-8be0-00144feab49a |website=[[Financial Times]] |publisher=[[The Nikkei]] |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> In June 2011, Spotify secured $100 million of funding and planned to use this to support its US launch.

In April 2015, Spotify began another round of fundraising, with a report from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' stating it was seeking $400 million, which would value the company at $8.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Douglas |last1=MacMillan |first2=Telis |last2=Demos |title=Spotify Nears Deal to Raise $400 Million at $8.4 Billion Valuation |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-nears-deal-to-raise-400-million-at-8-4-billion-valuation-1428700668 |website=The Wall Street Journal |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref> The financing was closed in June 2015, with Spotify raising $526 million, at a value of $8.53 billion.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Douglas |last1=MacMillan |first2=Juhana |last2=Rossi |title=Spotify Raises $526 Million Amid Battle With Apple |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-scores-investment-from-teliasonera-in-multimillion-dollar-funding-round-1433918944 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=10 June 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref> In January 2016, Spotify raised another $500 million through convertible bonds.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |title=Spotify Is Raising Another $500M In Convertible Notes With Discounts On IPO Shares |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/27/spotify-500-million/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=27 January 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref>

=== Downloads ===
In March 2009, Spotify began offering [[music download]]s in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. Users could purchase tracks from Spotify, which partnered with [[7digital]] to incorporate the feature. The ability to purchase and download music tracks via the app was removed on 4 January 2013.<ref name="No purchase"/>

=== Spotify for Artists ===
In November 2015, Spotify introduced a "Fan Insights" panel in limited [[Software release life cycle|beta]] form, letting artists and managers access data on monthly listeners, geographical data, demographic information, music preferences and more.<ref>{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillett |title=Spotify Bets On Data To Lure Artists To Its Platform |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/spotify-bets-on-data-to-lure-artists-to-its-platform/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=17 November 2015 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> In April 2017, the panel was upgraded to leave beta status, renamed as "Spotify for Artists", and opened to all artists and managers. Additional features include the ability to get "verified" status with a blue checkmark on an artist's profile, receiving artist support from Spotify, customising the profile page with photos and promoting a certain song as their "pick".<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Spotify's artist dashboard exits beta, offering streaming insights, profile management & more |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/spotifys-artist-dashboard-exits-beta-offering-streaming-insights-profile-management-more/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL |date=18 April 2017 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Rys |title=Spotify Upgrades Fan Insights Feature to 'Spotify for Artists': Exclusive |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7761970/spotify-upgrades-fan-insights-spotify-for-artists-exclusive |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]] |date=18 April 2017 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

In September 2018, Spotify announced "Upload Beta", allowing artists to upload directly to the platform instead of going through a [[music industry|distributor]] or [[record label]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17879840/spotify-artist-direct-upload-independent-music|title=Spotify will now let artists directly upload their music to the platform|last=Deahl|first=Dani|date=20 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref> The feature was rolled out to a small number of US-based artists by invitation only. Uploading was free and artists received 100% of the revenue from songs they uploaded; artists were able to control when their release went public. On 1 July 2019, Spotify deprecated the program and announced plans to stop accepting direct uploads by the end of that month, and eventually remove all content uploaded in this manner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/spotify-independent-artists-upload-music-streaming/|title=Spotify shuts down direct music uploading for independent artists|last=Darus|first=Alex|date=2 July 2019|website=Alternative Press|access-date=3 July 2019}}</ref>

=== Industry initiatives ===
In June 2017, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Spotify would announce "Secret Genius", a new initiative aimed at highlighting songwriters and producers, and the effect those people have to the music industry and the artists' careers. The project, which would feature awards, "Songshops" songwriting workshops, curated playlists, and podcasts, is an effort to "shine a light on these people behind the scenes who play such a big role in some of the most important moments of our lives. When the general public hears a song they automatically associate it with the artist who sings it, not the people behind the scenes who make it happen, so we thought the title Secret Genius was appropriate", Spotify's Global Head of Creator Services Troy Carter told ''Variety'' the first awards ceremony would take place in late 2017,{{update inline|date=March 2019}} and was intended to honour "the top songwriters, producers and publishers in the industry as well as up-and-coming talent". Additionally, as part of "The Ambassador Program", 13 songwriters would each host a Songshop workshop, in which their peers would collaboratively attempt to create a hit song, with the first workshop taking place in Los Angeles in June 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jem |last=Aswad |title=Spotify Launches 'Secret Genius' Program to Celebrate Songwriters (EXCLUSIVE) |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/exclusive-spotify-launches-secret-genius-for-songwriters-1202458229/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=8 June 2017 |accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref>

In October 2017, Spotify launched "Rise", a program aimed at promoting emerging artists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Spotify launches RISE, a new emerging artist program |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/20/spotify-launches-a-rise-a-new-emerging-artist-program/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=20 October 2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Swapna |last=Krishna |title=Spotify's RISE program will try to find future music superstars |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/20/spotify-rise-emerging-artists/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=Oath Inc. |date=20 October 2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref> In February 2020, Spotify announced it would be featuring new songwriter pages and 'written by' playlists. This was aimed at giving fans a behind the scenes look at the process of some of their favorite songwirters. Initial pages added included Justin Trantor, Meghan Trainor, and Missy Elliott. Spotify thereafter announced it was planning to add more of these pages and playlists to highlight songwriters.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spotify rolls out Written By playlists as it expands support for songwriters and publishers|url=https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/spotify-rolls-out-written-by-playlists-as-it-expands-support-for-songwriters-and-publishers/080354|access-date=21 July 2020|website=www.musicweek.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=9 July 2020|title=Spotify Adds Hundreds More Songwriter Pages and 'Written By' Playlists|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9415812/spotify-adds-songwriter-pages-written-by-playlists|access-date=21 July 2020|website=Billboard}}</ref>

=== Stations by Spotify ===
On 31 January 2018, Spotify started testing a new [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]]-styled standalone app called Stations by Spotify for Australian Android users.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.alphr.com/spotify/1008362/spotify-stations-app-playlists|title=Spotify's new Stations app is all about playlists without any of the faff|work=Alphr|access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref> It features 62 music channels, each devoted to a particular genre. Spotify itself has two channels named after its playlists that link directly to the users' profile: "Release Radar" and "Discover Weekly". The aim is to help users to listen to the music they want without [[information overload]] or spending time building their own playlists. At launch, the skipping feature was not featured to "reinforce the feel of radio", but it was quietly added later, and with no limits. Songs can be "loved" but can't be "hated". If a song is "loved", a custom radio channel will be created based on it, and when there are at least 15 of these songs, a "My Favourites" channel is unlocked.

Spotify also offers an official, although unsupported (developed as a "labour of love" by Spotify engineers; support is offered through the Spotify Community), version of Spotify for Linux clients. Spotify also offers a proprietary protocol known as "Spotify Connect", which lets users listen to music through a wide range of entertainment systems, including speakers, receivers, TVs, cars, and smartwatches. Spotify also has a web player.<ref name="Web player"/> Unlike the apps, the web player does not have the ability to download music for offline listening.

===Features===
In Spotify's apps, music can be browsed or searched for via various parameters, such as artist, album, genre, [[playlist]], or record label. Users can create, edit and share playlists, share tracks on [[social media]], and make playlists with other users. Spotify provides access to over 60 million songs, 450,000 podcasts and 3 billion playlists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spotify vs. Apple Music: Which service is the streaming king? |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/music/apple-music-vs-spotify/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Russell |title=Spotify reaches 50 million paying users |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/spotify-50-million/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=2 March 2017 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="Spotify company info" />

In November 2011, Spotify introduced a Spotify Apps service that made it possible for third-party developers to design applications that could be hosted within the Spotify computer software. The applications provided features such as synchronised lyrics, music reviews, and song recommendations.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Dredge |title=Spotify amps up iTunes rivalry with its own apps platform |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/nov/30/spotify-apps-platform |website=The Guardian |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref> In June 2012, Soundrop became the first Spotify app to attract major funding, receiving $3 million from Spotify investor Northzone.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Cheredar |title=Even Spotify apps are getting funded: Soundrop raises $3M to turn music social |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/06/12/soundrop/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |title=Spotify App Soundrop Tunes Into First Investment: $3M From Spotify Lead Backer Northzone |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/spotify-app-soundrop-tunes-into-first-investment-3m-from-spotify-lead-backer-northzone/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref> However, after the June 2014 announcement of a Web [[API]] that allowed third-party developers to integrate Spotify content in their own web applications,the company discontinued its Spotify Apps platform in October, stating that its new development tools for the Spotify web player fulfilled many of the advantages of the former Spotify Apps service, but "would ensure the Spotify platform remained relevant and easy to develop on, as well as enabling you to build innovative and engaging music experiences".<ref>{{cite web |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |title=Spotify Axes App Finder, Kills Soundrop And Its Listening Rooms |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/rip-spotify-apps-rip-soundrop/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL |date=13 November 2014 |accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>

In April 2012, Spotify introduced a "Spotify Play Button", an embeddable music player that can be added to blogs, websites, or social media profiles, that lets visitors listen to a specific song, playlist, or album without leaving the page.<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Spotify's New Embeddable Play Button Lets Any Site Turn You On To Legal Tunes |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/11/spotify-play-button/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref> The following November, the company began rolling out a web player, with a similar design to its computer programs, but without the requirement of any installation.<ref name="Web player">{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Spotify to begin rolling out browser-based music app in beta today |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/15/3649068/spotify-browser-player-web-app |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=15 November 2012 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref>

In December 2012, Spotify introduced a "Follow" tab and a "Discover" tab, along with a "Collection" section. "Follow" lets users follow artists and friends to see what they are listening to, while "Discover" gives users new releases from their favourite artists, as well as music, review, and concert recommendations based on listening history. Users can add tracks to a "Collection" section of the app, rather than adding them to a specific playlist.<ref name="verge-collection">{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Spotify debuts new Discovery engine, Collection, and Follow, which lets users follow friends and celebrities |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/6/3736018/spotify-debuts-new-discovery-engine-collection-and-follow-which-lets |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Christina |last=Warren |title=Spotify Wants to Make Music Discovery Truly Social |url=http://mashable.com/2012/12/06/spotify-social-discovery/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> The features were announced by CEO Daniel Ek at a press conference, with Ek saying that a common user complaint about the service was that "Spotify is great when you know what music you want to listen to, but not when you don't".<ref>{{cite web |first=Nate |last=Lanxon |title=Spotify announces major updates to service, gets Metallica catalogue |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-12/06/spotify |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209203636/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-12/06/spotify |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=6 December 2012 |archive-date=9 December 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref>

In May 2015, Spotify announced a new "Home" start-page that could recommend music. The company also introduced "Spotify Running", a feature aimed at improving music while running with music matched to running tempo, and announced that [[podcast]]s and videos ("entertainment, news and clips") would be coming to Spotify, along with "Spotify Originals" content.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Spotify now does videos and podcasts |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/20/8629335/spotify-adds-podcasts-videos |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/new-features-packed-inside-spotify/|title=Here are all the new features packed inside Spotify|last=Moynihan|first=Tim|date=20 May 2017|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Crook |title=Spotify Introduces Video Clips, Podcasts, And Activity-Based Playlists |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/spotify-introduces-video-clips-podcasts-and-activity-based-playlists/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>

In January 2016, Spotify and music annotation service [[Genius (website)|Genius]] formed a partnership, bringing annotation information from Genius into infocards presented while songs are playing in Spotify. The functionality is limited to selected playlists and was only available on Spotify's iOS app at launch,<ref>{{cite web |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |title=Spotify And Genius Team To Stream The Backstory On Music Tracks |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/12/spotify-teams-with-genius-to-annotate-music-tracks/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Noah |last=Kulwin |title=Spotify Adds 'Behind the Lyrics' Playlists, Powered by Lyrics Site Genius |url=https://www.recode.net/2016/1/12/11588702/spotify-adds-behind-the-lyrics-playlists-powered-by-lyrics-site-genius |website=[[Recode]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jamieson |last=Cox |title=Spotify and Genius are collaborating on info-rich Behind the Lyrics playlists |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/12/10750990/spotify-genius-behind-the-lyrics-playlists-iphone |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=Vox Media |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> being expanded to the Android app in April 2017.

In May 2017, Spotify introduced Spotify Codes for its mobile apps, a way for users to share specific artists, tracks, playlists or albums with other people. Users find the relevant content to share and press a "soundwave-style barcode" on the display. A camera icon in the apps' search fields lets other users point their device's camera at the code, which takes them to the same content.<ref>{{cite web |first=Natt |last=Garun |title=Spotify adds QR-like codes for quick music sharing |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15562198/spotify-scannable-codes-music-sharing-mobile |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Scan these new QR-style Spotify Codes to instantly play a song |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/spotify-codes/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Bryan |last=Clark |title=Spotify Codes bring Snapchat-like QR codes to music streaming |url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/05/05/spotify-codes-bring-snapchat-like-qr-codes-to-music-streaming/ |website=The Next Web |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>

In January 2019, Spotify introduced Car View for Android, allowing devices running Android to have a compact Now Playing screen when the device is connected to a car's Bluetooth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/spotify-safety-mode-ui-bluetooth/|title=[Update: Rolling out as 'Car View'] Spotify tests stripped-down "Safety Mode" UI when connected to Bluetooth devices|date=18 January 2019|website=xda-developers|accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185644/spotify-car-view-now-testing-android-simple-controls|title=Spotify launches a simplified Car View for controlling your music while driving|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=16 January 2019|website=The Verge|accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref> Also in January 2019, Spotify beta-tested its Canvas feature, where artists and/or labels can upload looping 3 to 8-second moving visuals to their tracks, replacing album covers in the "Now Playing" view; users have the option to turn off this feature.

====Playlists and discovery====
In July 2015, Spotify launched Discover Weekly, a weekly generated playlist, updated on Mondays, that brings users two hours of custom-made music recommendations, mixing a user's personal taste with songs enjoyed by similar listeners.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kia |last=Kokalitcheva |title=Spotify's new feature will help you fight the Monday blues |url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/20/spotify-discovery-playlists/ |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Dredge |title=Spotify bites back at Apple Music with weekly 'mixtape' playlist for each user |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/20/spotify-apple-music-weekly-mixtape-playlist |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> In December 2015, ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' reported that songs in Discover Weekly playlists had been streamed 1.7 billion times,<ref>{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Pasick |title=The magic that makes Spotify's Discover Weekly playlists so damn good |url=http://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/ |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=21 December 2015 |accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref> and Spotify wrote in May 2016 that Discover Weekly had reached "nearly" 5 billion tracks streamed since the July 2015 launch.

In March 2016, building on Discover Weekly's success, Spotify launched six newly generated playlists branded as Fresh Finds including the main playlist and Fire Emoji, Basement, Hiptronix, Six Strings, and Cyclone (hip-hop, electronic, pop, guitar-driven, and experimental music respectively). The playlists spotlight lesser-known musicians and their songs which are listened to by 100,000 randomly chosen users and are talked about on 10 to 20,000 music blogs. They are updated every Wednesday, and can contain a maximum of up to 50 songs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-introduces-fresh-finds-playlists-2016-3|title=Spotify now has even more playlists to help you find hot new music|work=Business Insider|accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>

In August 2016, Spotify launched Release Radar, a personalised playlist that allows users to stay up-to-date on new music released by artists they listen to the most. It also helps users discover new music, by mixing in other artists' music. The playlist is updated every Friday, and can be a maximum of up to two hours in length.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Popper |title=Spotify's Release Radar is a personalized playlist of brand-new music |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/5/12380816/spotify-release-radar-personalized-discovery-curation |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=5 August 2016 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Spotify follows Discover Weekly with personalized new releases playlist |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/spotify-release-radar/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=5 August 2016 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref>

In September 2016, Spotify introduced Daily Mix, a series of (up to six) playlists that have "near endless playback" and mix the user's favourite tracks with new, recommended songs. New users can access Daily Mix after approximately two weeks of listening to music through Spotify. Daily Mixes were only available on the Android and iOS mobile apps at launch, but the feature was later expanded to Spotify's computer app in December 2016.

In 2017, Spotify introduced RapCaviar, one of the most influential playlists in the hip-hop industry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-takes-on-spotifys-influential-rapcaviar-with-rap-life-playlist-and-weekly-show/|title=Apple Music takes on Spotify's influential RapCaviar brand with Rap Life playlist and weekly show|date=19 July 2019|website=Music Business Worldwide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/spotify-rapcaviar-most-influential-playlist-in-music.html |title=How a Hit Happens Now |first=Craig |last=Marks |publisher=Vulture |date=September 2017 |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref> which gained over 10.9 million followers by 2019, becoming one of Spotify's Top 5 playlists worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://routenote.com/blog/rap-caviar-spotify/|title=What is Rap Caviar on Spotify?|date=9 February 2018}}</ref> RapCaviar was originally curated by Tuma Basa,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/meet-tuma-basa-the-mastermind-behind-spotify-s-rap-caviar-playlist|title=Meet Tuma Basa, The Mastermind Behind Spotify's 'Rap Caviar' Playlist|website=Genius}}</ref> and as of 2019, was relaunched by Carl Chery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketingdive.com/news/spotify-sculpts-cardi-b-other-hip-hop-stars-for-latest-rapcaviar-pantheon/551795/|title=Spotify sculpts Cardi B, other hip-hop stars for latest RapCaviar pantheon|website=Marketing Dive}}</ref>

In July 2018, Spotify introduced a new beta feature that gives artists, labels and teams an easy way to submit unreleased music directly to Spotify's editorial team for playlist consideration.

In June 2019, Spotify launched a custom playlist titled "Your Daily Drive" that closely replicates the [[drive time]] format of many traditional radio stations. It combines short-form podcast news updates from [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[NPR]], and [[Public Radio International|PRI]] with a mix of a user's favorite songs and artists interspersed with tracks the listener has yet to discover. "Your Daily Drive", which is found in a user's library under the "Made For You" section, updates throughout the day to keep both the music and news fresh.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/177736/spotify-launches-your-daily-drive-with-custom-music-and-news-updates/ Spotify Launches Your Daily Drive With Custom Music And News Updates] – ''Radio Insight'' (published 12 June 2019; accessed 13 June 2019)</ref>

In May 2020, Spotify introduced the 'Group Session' feature. This feature allows two or more Premium users in the same location to share control over the music that's being played.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clover |first1=Juli |title=Spotify Gains New 'Group Session' Feature With Shared Listening Queue |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/11/spotify-adds-group-session-feature/ |website=Mac Rumors |accessdate=12 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Listening limitations ===
Spotify has experimented with different limitations to users' listening on the Free service tier.

In April 2011, Spotify announced via a blog post that they would drastically cut the amount of music that free members could access, effective 1 May 2011. The post stated that all free members would be limited to ten hours of music streaming per month, and in addition, individual tracks were limited to five plays. New users were exempt from these changes for six months.<ref>{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Butcher |title=Spotify takes the axe to its free service – can it now claim to slash music piracy? |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/spotify-takes-the-axe-to-its-free-service-can-it-now-claim-to-slash-music-piracy/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> In March 2013, the five-play individual track limit was removed for users in the United Kingdom, and media reports stated that users in the United States, Australia and New Zealand never had the limit in the first place.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=O'Hear |title=Spotify Ditches Its 5 Play Limit For Spotify Free Users In The UK |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/spotify-freetards/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Shane |last=Richmond |title=Spotify removes five-play song cap |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9940432/Spotify-removes-five-play-song-cap.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref>

In December 2013, CEO Daniel Ek announced that Android and iOS smartphone users with the free service tier could listen to music in Shuffle mode, a feature in which users can stream music by specific artists and playlists without being able to pick which songs to hear. Mobile listening previously was not allowed in Spotify Free accounts. Ek stated that "We're giving people the best free music experience in the history of the smartphone."<ref>{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Spotify announces free streaming on Android and iPhone, but only in Shuffle mode |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5199692/spotify-announces-free-streaming-on-android-and-iphone-but-only-in |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=11 December 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Crook |title=Spotify Goes Freemium On Tablets, Launches Free Shuffle Product On Smartphones |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/11/spotify-launches-spotify-free-for-tablets/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date= 11 December 2013 |accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> This shuffle feature is not available on Android and iOS tablets, or computers.

In January 2014, Spotify removed all time limits for Free users on all platforms, including on computers, which previously had a 10-hour monthly listening limit after a 6-month grace period.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sophie |last=Murray-Morris |title=Spotify removes time restrictions on free desktop player |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/spotify-removes-time-restrictions-for-desktop-listening-9062361.html |website=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Spotify Drops Free Web Listening Time Limit Everywhere – A Big Scalability Milestone |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/spotify-limits/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=AOL |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref>

In April 2018, Spotify began to allow Free users to listen on-demand to whatever songs they want for an unlimited number of times, as long as the song is on one of the user's 15 personalized discovery playlists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/spotify-beefs-up-its-free-tier-as-apple-music-gains-traction/|title=Spotify beefs up its free tier – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref>

Before April 2020, all service users were limited to 10,000 songs in their library, after which they would receive an "Epic collection, friend" notification, and would not be able to save more music to their library. Adding playlists at this point also arbitrarily removed older playlists from the users' library. Spotify later removed this limit.

Spotify allows users to add local audio files for music not in its catalogue into the user's library through Spotify's desktop application, and then allows users to synchronise those music files to Spotify's mobile apps or other computers over the same [[Wi-Fi]] network as the primary computer by creating a Spotify playlist, and adding those local audio files to the playlist. Audio files must either be in the .mp3, .mp4 (.mp4 files that have video streams are not supported), or .m4p media formats. This feature is available only for Premium subscribers.

Spotify has a median playback latency of 265 ms (including local [[cache (computing)|cache]]).<ref>{{cite web |first1=Gunnar |last1=Kreitz |first2=Fredrik |last2=Niemelä |title=Spotify – Large Scale, Low Latency, P2P Music-on-Demand Streaming |url=http://www.csc.kth.se/~gkreitz/spotify-p2p10/spotify-p2p10.pdf |publisher=[[Royal Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref>

In April 2014, Spotify moved away from the [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer (P2P)]] system they had used to distribute music to users. Previously, a desktop user would listen to music from one of three sources: a cached file on the computer, one of Spotify's servers, or from other subscribers through the P2P system. P2P, a well-established Internet distribution system, served as an alternative that reduced Spotify's server resources and costs. However, Spotify ended the P2P setup in 2014, with Spotify's Alison Bonny telling [[TorrentFreak]]: "We’re gradually phasing out the use of our desktop P2P technology which has helped our users enjoy their music both speedily and seamlessly. We’re now at a stage where we can power music delivery through our growing number of servers and ensure our users continue to receive a best-in-class service."<ref>{{cite web |author=Ernesto |title=Spotify Starts Shutting Down Its Massive P2P Network |url=https://torrentfreak.com/spotify-starts-shutting-down-its-massive-p2p-network-140416/ |publisher=[[TorrentFreak]] |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2016}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
{{Main|Criticism of Spotify}}

{{Merge from|Criticism of Spotify|date=October 2020|discuss=Talk:Spotify#Proposed merge of Criticism of Spotify into Spotify#Criticism|section=yes}}

Spotify has attracted significant criticism since its 2008 launch.<ref name="Launch">{{cite web|title=We've only just begun!|url=https://news.spotify.com/us/2008/10/07/weve-only-just-begun/|date=7 October 2008|publisher=Spotify|accessdate=7 November 2016}}</ref> The primary point of criticism centres around what artists, music creators, and the media have described as "unsustainable" compensation.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lizzie |last=Plaugic |title=Spotify's Year in Music shows just how little we pay artists for their music |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/7/9861372/spotify-year-in-review-artist-payment-royalties |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=7 December 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> Unlike physical sales or legal downloads (both of which were the main medium of listening to music at the time), which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays royalties based on their "market share"—the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service. Spotify distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights-holders, who will then pay artists based on their individual agreements.<ref name="Spotify business" />

Spotify has been criticized by artists including [[Thom Yorke]] and [[Taylor Swift]], who withdrew their music from the service.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thom Yorke pulls albums from Spotify |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23313445 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Charlotte |last=Alter |title=Taylor Swift Just Removed Her Music From Spotify |url=http://time.com/3554438/taylor-swift-spotify/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref> Their catalogues returned to the service in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Derrick |last=Rossignol |title=Thom Yorke's Solo Albums Are Finally Streaming On Spotify, Which He Famously Hates |url=http://uproxx.com/music/thom-yorke-spotify-streaming/ |website=[[Uproxx]] |publisher=[[Uproxx Media Group]] |date=8 December 2017 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Taylor Swift's Music Returning to Spotify & Other Streaming Services Tonight |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7825570/taylor-swift-spotify-streaming-again |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]] |date=8 June 2017 |accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> While the streaming music industry in general faces the same critique about inadequate payments,<ref>{{cite web |title=What Streaming Music Services Pay |url=http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/spotify-apple-music-tidal-music-streaming-services-royalty-rates-compared/ |website=[[David McCandless|Information is Beautiful]] |accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> Spotify, being the leading service,<ref>{{cite web |first=Micah |last=Singleton |title=Spotify now has 140 million active users |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15807826/spotify-140-million-active-users |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=15 June 2017 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref> faces particular scrutiny due to its free service tier, allowing users to listen to music for free, though with advertisements between tracks. The free service tier has led to a variety of major album releases being delayed or withdrawn from the service.<ref>{{cite web |first=Hannah |last=Karp |title=Coldplay to Headline Super Bowl Halftime Show |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/coldplay-to-headline-super-bowl-halftime-show-1449174658 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=3 December 2015 |accessdate=24 December 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Victor |last=Luckerson |title=Beyoncé's Latest Album Is Finally on Spotify |url=http://time.com/3602610/beyonce-spotify/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=24 November 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Austin |last=Carr |title=Why Spotify Turned Down Adele's ''21'' |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1816582/why-spotify-turned-down-adeles-21 |website=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |publisher=Mansueto Ventures |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref> In response to the allegations about unfair compensation, Spotify claims that it is benefitting the industry by migrating users away from [[Copyright infringement|unauthorized copying]] and less monetised platforms to its free service tier, and then encouraging them to upgrade to paid accounts.<ref name="Spotify business" /> A study has shown that [[record label]]s keep a high amount of the money earned from Spotify,<ref>{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Ingham |title=Major labels keep 73% of Spotify Premium payouts – Report |url=http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/artists-get-7-of-streaming-cash-labels-take-46/ |website=Music Business Worldwide |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Masnick |title=Yes, Major Record Labels Are Keeping Nearly All The Money They Get From Spotify, Rather Than Giving It To Artists |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150204/07310329906/yes-major-record-labels-are-keeping-nearly-all-money-they-get-spotify-rather-than-giving-it-to-artists.shtml |publisher=Techdirt |date=5 February 2015 |accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref> and the CEO of [[Merlin Network]], a representative body for over 10,000 independent labels, has also observed significant yearly growth rates in earnings from Spotify, while clarifying that Spotify pays labels, not artists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eliot Van |last=Buskirk |title=David Lowery Might Be Right About Some Things, But He's Wrong About Streaming, Money, and Artists |url=http://evolver.fm/2012/06/21/david-lowery-might-be-right-about-some-things-but-hes-wrong-about-streaming-money-and-artists/ |publisher=Evolver.fm |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>

In May 2018, Spotify attracted criticism for its "Hate Content & Hateful Conduct policy" that removed the music of [[R. Kelly]] and [[XXXTentacion]] from its editorial and algorithmic playlists because "When we look at promotion, we look at issues around hateful conduct, where you have an artist or another creator who has done something off-platform that is so particularly out of line with our values, egregious, in a way that it becomes something that we don't want to associate ourselves with". R. Kelly has faced accusations of sexual abuse, while XXXTentacion was on trial for domestic abuse in a case that did not reach a judgement before [[Murder of XXXTentacion|his death]] that June.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Strauss |first1=Matthew |title=Spotify Removes R. Kelly and XXXTentacion From Its Playlists |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/spotify-removes-r-kelly-from-its-playlists/ |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=Pitchfork |date=10 May 2018}}</ref> This policy was revoked in June because the company deemed the original wording to be too "vague"; they stated that "Across all genres, our role is not to regulate artists. Therefore, we are moving away from implementing a policy around artist conduct".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Minsker |first1=Evan |last2=Yoo |first2=Noah |title=Spotify Walks Back Controversial "Hateful Conduct" Policy, Adds XXXTentacion to Major Playlist |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/spotify-walks-back-controversial-hateful-conduct-policy/ |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=Pitchfork |date=1 June 2018}}</ref> However, artists such as [[Gary Glitter]] and [[Lostprophets]] are still hidden from Spotify's radio stations and search results.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/spotify-hateful-conduct-axl-rose-r-kelly-jimmy-page-and-eminem-w890kwc3l|title=Where will Spotify's censorship end?|first=Dan Cairns and Jonathan|last=Dean|date=27 May 2018|work=The Times}}</ref>

According to some computer science and music experts, various music communities are often ignored or overlooked by music streaming services, such as Spotify.<ref name="Rolling Stone 2019">{{cite web | title=Spotify Pivots on Global Cultures Initiative, Alarming Music Industry | website=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=4 October 2019 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/spotify-global-cultures-initiative-892762/ | access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="Hepworth 2020">{{cite web | last=Hepworth | first=Shelley | title=Streaming spells the end of the 'ownership' era of music, but are we ready to let go? | website=[[The Guardian]] | date=1 January 2020 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/streaming-spells-the-end-of-the-ownership-era-of-music-but-are-we-ready-to-let-go | access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="Lucero 2020">{{cite web | last=Lucero | first=Mario J. | title=The problem with how the music streaming industry handles data | website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] | date=3 January 2020 | url=https://qz.com/1773480/the-problem-with-how-the-music-streaming-industry-handles-data/ | access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="RouteNote Blog 2020">{{cite web | title=Spotify and streaming services are breaking cultural music on a worldwide stage | website=RouteNote Blog | date=6 February 2020 | url=http://routenote.com/blog/spotify-and-streaming-services-are-breaking-cultural-music-on-a-worldwide-stage/ | access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> The most commonly perceived error is said to be caused by a lack of diverse scope within curation staffs, including overlooking mainstay artists in large genres, potentially causing a categorical homogenization of musical styles; even impacting mainline artists like within [[hip hop]] with [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name="Hepworth 2020"/> This can potentially even have a negative impact on heritage styles, amongst both popular and traditional genres of [[New Mexico music]] and [[folk music]], even harming the growth of popular styles like [[country rap]] and [[contemporary Christian music]].<ref name="Lucero 2020"/>

In 2016, Spotify was also the centre of criticism for allegedly making certain artists' music harder to find than others as these artists would release their music to the rival streaming service [[Apple Music]] before releasing it to Spotify.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-08-26|title=Spotify Is Burying Musicians for Their Apple Deals|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/spotify-said-to-retaliate-against-artists-with-apple-exclusives|access-date=22 July 2020|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref>

In 2020, Spotify received criticism from anti-misinformation groups when conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] appeared on [[The Joe Rogan Experience]] podcast.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-10-29|title=Spotify and Joe Rogan under fire over Alex Jones role|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54733252|access-date=2020-10-29}}</ref> Spotify's own employees raised concerns about Jones' appearance on the show.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-10-28|title=Spotify’s Own Employees Fret About Alex Jones Appearing on Joe Rogan Show|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-28/spotify-draws-fire-over-alex-jones-s-claims-in-joe-rogan-podcast|access-date=2020-10-29}}</ref>
