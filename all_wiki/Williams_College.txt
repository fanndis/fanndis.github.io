'''Williams College''' is a [[Private college|private]] [[liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]]. It was established in 1793 with funds from the estate of [[Ephraim Williams]], a colonist from the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] who was killed in the [[French and Indian War]] in 1755, and it is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]]. Although the bequest from the estate of [[Ephraim Williams]] intended to establish a "free school," the exact meaning of which is ambiguous, the college quickly outgrew its initial ambitions and positioned itself as a "Western counterpart" to [[Yale]] and [[Harvard]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Fred |title=Reflections on the Founding of Williams College |journal=Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society |date=1993 |volume=105 |pages=124–164}}</ref>

Williams is on a {{convert|450|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus in Williamstown, in the [[Berkshires]] in rural northwestern Massachusetts. The campus contains more than 100 academic, athletic, and residential buildings.<ref name=fastfacts/> There are 357 voting faculty members, with a [[student-teacher ratio|student-to-faculty ratio]] of 7:1. {{As of|2019||df=}}, the school has an enrollment of 2,078 undergraduate students and 56 graduate students.<ref name=CDS2019/> The college competes in the [[NCAA Division III]] [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]], and competes in the conference as the [[Williams Ephs|Ephs]]. The athletic program has been highly successful, as Williams College has won 22 of the last 24 College [[Directors Cup|Directors' Cups]] for NCAA Division III.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ephsports.williams.edu/general/2018-19/releases/20190611witdaj|title=Williams College Wins 22nd Learfield IMG College Directors' Cup in 24-Year History of National Award|date=2019-06-11|access-date=June 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628224301/https://ephsports.williams.edu/general/2018-19/releases/20190611witdaj|archive-date=June 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following a [[liberal arts]] curriculum, Williams College provides undergraduate instruction in 25 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 36 majors in the [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[social sciences]], and [[natural sciences]]. Williams offers an almost entirely undergraduate instruction, though there are two graduate programs in [[development economics]] and [[art history]]. The college maintains affiliations with the nearby [[Clark Art Institute]] and [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]], and has a close relationship with [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oxford University]].

==History==
Colonel [[Ephraim Williams]] was an officer in the Massachusetts militia and a member of a prominent landowning family. His [[Will (law)|will]] included a bequest to support and maintain a free school to be established in the town of West Hoosac, Massachusetts, provided the town change its name to Williamstown. Williams was killed at the [[Battle of Lake George]] on September 8, 1755.<ref>{{cite web| last =Heyes| first =Michael| title =Cycling in the Berkshires| url =http://3rvs.com/features/berkshires/berkshires.html| accessdate =2007-09-13| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071020061141/http://3rvs.com/features/berkshires/berkshires.html| archive-date =2007-10-20| url-status =dead}}</ref>

After [[Shays' Rebellion]], the Williamstown Free School opened with 15 students on October 26, 1791. The first president was [[Ebenezer Fitch]]. Not long after its founding, the school's trustees petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to convert the free school to a tuition-based college. The legislature agreed and on June 22, 1793, Williams College was [[charter]]ed. It was the second college to be founded in Massachusetts.[[File:West College (Williamstown, MA).jpg|thumb|Depiction of West College, which composed the entire college in its early years.|alt=]]At its founding, the college maintained a policy of racial segregation, refusing admission to black applicants. This policy was challenged by [[Lucy Terry Prince]], who is credited as the first black American poet,<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Edward T.|title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950, Vol. III|year=1971|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0674627345|page=573}}</ref> when her son Festus was refused admission on account of his race.<ref name="Phelps 1888 79">{{cite book|last=Phelps|first=John Wolcott and Rodney B.

More recent scholarship, however, has highlighted there are no records within the college to confirm this event occurred, and Festus Prince may have been refused entry for an insufficient mastery of Latin, Greek, and French, all of which were necessary for successful completion of the entrance exam at the time, and which would most likely not have been available in the local schools of [[Guilford, Vermont]], where Festus was raised.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Proper|first=David R.|title=Lucy Terry Prince: "Singer of History"|journal=Contributions in Black Studies: A Journal of African and Afro-American Studies|date=January 1992|volume=9|series=15|page=14|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cibs/vol9/iss1/15|accessdate=17 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919171358/http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cibs/vol9/iss1/15/|archive-date=September 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1806, a student [[prayer meeting]] gave rise to the American Foreign Mission Movement. In August of that year, five students met in the maple grove of Sloan's Meadow to pray. A thunderstorm drove them to the shelter of a haystack, and the fervor of the ensuing meeting inspired them to take the [[Gospel]] abroad. The students went on to build the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the first American organization to send [[missionary|missionaries]] overseas. The Haystack Monument near Mission Park on the Williams Campus commemorates the historic "[[Haystack Prayer Meeting]]".

By 1815, Williams had only two buildings and 58 students and was in financial trouble, so the board voted to move the college to [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. In 1821, the president of the college, [[Zephaniah Swift Moore]], who had accepted his position believing the college would move east, decided to proceed with the move. He took 15 students with him, and re-founded the college under the name of [[Amherst College]]. Some students and professors decided to stay at Williams and were allowed to keep the land, which was at the time relatively worthless. According to legend, Moore also took portions of the Williams College library. Although plausible, the transfer of books is unsubstantiated. Moore died just two years later after founding Amherst, and was succeeded by [[Heman Humphrey]], a trustee of Williams College.<ref>{{cite web| title =Williams College Presidents| publisher =Williams College| url =http://www.williams.edu/home/presidents/| accessdate =2007-09-15| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070823052737/http://www.williams.edu/home/presidents/| archive-date =2007-08-23| url-status =dead}}</ref>

[[Edward Dorr Griffin]] was appointed President of Williams and is widely credited with saving Williams during his 15-year tenure. A Williams student, [[Gardner Cotrell Leonard]], of Albany, NY, whose family owned that city's [[Cotrell & Leonard]] department store, designed the gowns he and his classmates wore to graduation in 1887.<ref name="Academic Garb">{{cite web|title=Academic Garb |publisher=Williams College |url=http://www.williams.edu/home/focus/robes/ |accessdate=2009-04-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521102435/http://www.williams.edu/home/focus/robes/ |archive-date=May 21, 2009 }}</ref> Seven years later he advised the Inter-Collegiate Commission on Academic Costume, which met at [[Columbia University]], and established the current system of U.S. [[academic dress]].<ref>Walters, Helen. "The Story of Caps and Gowns," p. 9. Chicago: E. R. Moore, 1939.</ref> One reason gowns were adopted in the late nineteenth century was to eliminate the differences in apparel between rich and poor students.<ref>Leonard, Gardner Cotrell. "The Cap and Gown in America; Reprinted from the University Magazine of 1893; To Which is Added: An Illustrated Sketch of the Intercollegiate System of Academic Costume," p. 9. Albany, New York: Cotrell & Leonard, 1896.</ref> Gardner Cotrell Leonard went on to edit the book "The Songs of Williams", a collection of songs sung at the college. During [[World War II]], Williams College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.williams.edu/files/HistSci00/chapter3_3.html |title=The V-12 Program |publisher=[[Williamstown, Massachusetts]]: Williams College |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122083715/http://science.williams.edu/files/HistSci00/chapter3_3.html |archive-date=November 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Originally a [[men's college]], Williams became [[co-educational]] in 1970. [[Fraternity|Fraternities]] were also phased out during this period, beginning in 1962.<ref name=fastfacts>{{cite web |title=Fast Facts About Williams |url=https://communications.williams.edu/media-relations/fast-facts/ |website=williams.edu |accessdate=5 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905102104/https://communications.williams.edu/media-relations/fast-facts/ |archive-date=September 5, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Construction and expansion===

In the last decade, construction has changed the look of the college. The addition of the $38 million Unified Science Center to the campus in 2001 set a tone of style and comprehensiveness for renovations and additions to campus buildings in the 21st century. This building unifies the formerly separate lab spaces of the [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biology]] departments. In addition, it houses Schow Science Library, notable for its unified science materials holdings and architecture. It features vaulted ceilings and an [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] with windows into laboratories on the second through fourth floors of the science center.

In 2003, Williams began the first of three massive construction projects. The $60 million '62 Center for Theatre and Dance was the first project to be successfully completed in the spring of 2005. The $44 million student center, called [[David Paresky|Paresky]] Center, opened in February 2007.

Construction had already begun on the third project, called the Stetson-Sawyer project, when economic uncertainty stemming from the 2007 financial crisis led to its delay. College trustees initially balked at the Stetson-Sawyer project's cost, and revisited the idea of renovating Sawyer in its current location, an idea which proved not to be cost-effective.<ref>{{cite web| author = Richardson, Chris| title = Costs are still a concern, but project gains support| publisher = Williams Record Archive| url = http://www.williamsrecord.com/wr/?sawContrib=yes&view=article&section=news&id=7423| accessdate = 2007-09-20| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143555/http://www.williamsrecord.com/wr/?sawContrib=yes&view=article&section=news&id=7423| archive-date = 2011-07-16| url-status = dead}}</ref> The entire project includes construction of two new academic buildings, the removal of Sawyer Library from its current location, and the construction of a new library at the rear of a renovated Stetson Hall (which served as the college library prior to Sawyer's construction). The academic buildings, temporarily named North Academic Building and South Academic Building, were completed in fall of 2008. In the spring of 2009, South Academic Building was renamed Schapiro Hall in honor of former President [[Morton O. Schapiro]]. In the spring of 2010 the North Academic Building was renamed Hollander Hall. Construction of the new Sawyer Library was completed in 2014, after which the old Sawyer Library was razed.

After several years of planning, the college decided to group undergraduates starting with the Class of 2010 into four geographically coherent clusters, or "Neighborhoods".<ref>{{cite web | title =Williams College: Neighborhood System 2006–2007 | publisher =Williams College | url =http://www.williams.edu/dean/campus_life/neighborhoodsystem.html | accessdate =2007-09-20 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070526220804/http://www.williams.edu/dean/campus_life/neighborhoodsystem.html | archive-date =2007-05-26 | url-status =dead }}</ref> Since the fall of 2006, first-years have been housed in Sage Hall, Williams Hall and Mission Park, while the former first-year [[dormitories]] East College, Lehman Hall, Fayerweather, and Morgan, joined the remaining residential buildings as upperclass housing.

The college reached $400 million at the end of June 2007. By the close of the campaign, Williams had raised $500.2 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climb Far: The Williams Campaign |publisher=Williams College |url=http://www.williams.edu/alumni/campaign/ |accessdate=2009-10-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135249/http://www.williams.edu/alumni/campaign/ |archive-date=October 27, 2009 }}</ref>

As of the 2008/09 school year, the college eliminated [[student loan]]s from all [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] packages in favor of grants. The college was the fourth institution in the United States to do so, following Princeton University, Amherst College, and [[Davidson College]].<ref>{{cite web|title =Letters from the President|publisher =Office of the President, Williams College|url =http://www.williams.edu/admin/president/letters/071101_no_loans.php|accessdate =2007-11-02|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071116071908/http://www.williams.edu/admin/president/letters/071101_no_loans.php|archive-date =2007-11-16|url-status =dead}}</ref> However, in February 2010, the college announced it would re-introduce loans to its financial aid packages beginning with the Class of 2015 due to the college's changed financial situation.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/education/02loans.html | work=The New York Times | title=Williams College Will Bring Loans Back to Aid Packages | first=Jacques | last=Steinberg | date=February 2, 2010 | access-date=February 23, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221215839/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/education/02loans.html | archive-date=February 21, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2010/04/09/pf/college/no-loan_financial_aid/ | work=CNN | title=No loans!

Students may also concentrate in 12 additional academic areas that are not offered as majors (e.g., [[environmental studies]]). The [[academic year]] follows a 4–1–4 schedule of two four-course [[semester]]s plus a one-course "winter study" term in January. During the winter study term, students study one of various courses outside of typical curriculum for 3 weeks. Students typically take this course on a pass/fail basis. Past course offerings have included: Ski patrol, Learn to Play Chess, Accounting, Inside Jury Deliberations, and Creating a Life: Shaping Your Life After Williams, among many others. Williams students often take the winter study term to study abroad or work on intensive research projects.

The college's 2019-20 Comprehensive Fee was $72,270, including tuition ($56,970) and board, room, and fees ($15,300).<ref name=fastfacts/> 53% of students were given [[Student financial aid (United States)|need-based financial aid]], which averaged $46,006.<ref name="WCFF">{{cite web|url=http://provost.williams.edu/files/williams_cds_1516_w_tuition.pdf|title=Williams College Common Data Set|publisher=Williams College|accessdate=2011-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417205514/http://provost.williams.edu/files/williams_cds_1516_w_tuition.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Winter Study===
Williams follows a 4-1-4 schedule with the month of January dedicated to "Winter Study," a time where students take at least one course at Williams or engage in an international program, an internship, or independent research project. A significant number of courses are taught by [[List of Williams College people|Williams College alumni]] and Winter Study feature courses in topics otherwise not covered in a traditional liberal arts curriculum such as financial accounting, entrepreneurship, journalism, and yoga. Winter Study courses change yearly, the catalog features international programs in public health (where students travel to Nicaragua or Liberia), cultural immersion (for example, programs in Morocco and France), and political work (for example, a three-week internship program in the government of the Republic of Georgia).

===Oxbridge tutorials===
Certain portions of the Williams education are modeled after the [[tutorial system]]s at the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Although tutorials at Williams were originally aimed at upperclassmen, the faculty voted in 2001 to expand the tutorial program.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.williams.edu/admin/news/strategicplanning/curricularinnovation/facultyvote.html |title=Williams Curricular Innovation Faculty Vote May 16 2001 |access-date=2018-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022075730/http://williams.edu/admin/news/strategicplanning/curricularinnovation/facultyvote.html |archive-date=2007-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There is now a diverse offering of tutorials, spanning many disciplines, including math and the sciences, that cater to students of all class years. In 2009–2010 alone, 62 tutorials were offered in 21 departments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.williams.edu/registrar/catalog/ |title=Course Catalog 2009–2010 (PDF) |accessdate=2009-10-05 |publisher=Williams College |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926064216/http://www.williams.edu/registrar/catalog/ |archive-date=2009-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Enrollment for tutorials is capped at 10 students, who are then divided into five pairs that meet separately with the professor once a week. Each week, one of the students writes and presents a 5–7-page paper while the other student critiques it. The same pair reverses roles for the next week. The professor takes a more limited role than in a traditional lecture class, and usually allows students to steer and guide the direction of the conversation. Professor (and former Dean and English Department Chair) Stephen E. Fix was one of the early advocates for expanding the tutorial system at Williams and worked to increase support for the concept and the number of tutorial classes offered to students.

Student course evaluations for tutorials are typically very high. In a survey of alumni who had taken tutorials, more than 80% found their tutorials to be "the most valuable of my courses" at Williams.<ref>{{cite web| title =The Williams College Difference| publisher =Williams College| url =https://www.williams.edu/admission/academics_difference.php| accessdate =2007-07-15| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071011052924/http://williams.edu/admission/academics_difference.php| archive-date =2007-10-11| url-status =dead}}</ref>

==Organization and administration==
The [[Board of Trustees]] of Williams College has 25 members and is the governing authority of the college.<ref name="Employee Handbook">{{cite web |url=http://wiki.williams.edu/display/handbooks/Administration |title=Williams College Employee Handbook |accessdate=2008-10-15 |publisher=Williams College |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111002351/http://wiki.williams.edu/display/handbooks/Administration |archive-date=January 11, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The President of the college serves on the Board ''[[ex officio]].'' There are five Alumni Trustees, each of whom serves for a five-year term. There are five Term Trustees, each elected by the Board for five-year terms. The remaining 14 members are Regular Trustees, also elected by the Board but serving up 15 years, although not beyond their seventieth birthday. The current Chair of the Board of Trustees is Liz Robinson.

The Board appoints as senior executive officer of the college a President who is also a member of and the presiding officer of the faculty. Nine senior administrators report to the President including the [[Dean of the Faculty]], [[provost (education)|Provost]], and Dean of the College. Adam F. Falk is the 17th president of Williams, and took office on April 1, 2010.

College Council (CC) is the student government of Williams College. Its members are elected to represent each class year, the first-year dorms, and the student body at large. CC allocates funds from the [[student activity fee|Student Activities Fee]], appoints students to the faculty-student-administration committees that oversee most aspects of College life, and debates issues of concern to the entire campus community. College Council is the forum through which students address concerns and make changes around campus. CC is led by two co-Presidents.

To manage its [[Financial endowment|endowment]] the college started the [[Williams College Investment Office]] in 2006. The Investment Office is located in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. As of 2020, the endowment-per-student ratio is currently $1.40 million, without adjusting for [[inflation]], while in 1990 it was $151,000. Adjusting for inflation, the endowment-per-student ratio has still increased to almost $600,000.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Williams College's financial muscle grows with impressive endowment return - Boston Business Journal|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2015/11/10/williams-colleges-financial-muscle-grows-with.html|website = Boston Business Journal|accessdate = 2016-01-07|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160203045527/http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2015/11/10/williams-colleges-financial-muscle-grows-with.html|archive-date = February 3, 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> The Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Office is [[Collette Chilton]].<!-- Does not need verification.

==Campus==
[[File:Williams_College_-_West_College_(cropped).jpg|thumb|West College- the oldest building of Williams' Campus.]]
Williams is on a {{convert|450|acre|ha|adj=on|abbr=off}} campus in Williamstown, Massachusetts in the [[Berkshires]] in rural northwestern Massachusetts. The campus contains more than 100 academic, athletic, and residential buildings.<ref name=fastfacts/>

The early planners of Williams College eschewed the traditional collegiate quadrangle organization, choosing to freely site buildings among the hills. Later construction, including East and West Colleges and Griffin Hall, tended to cluster around Main Street in Williamstown. The first campus quadrangle was formed with East College, South College, and the Hopkins Observatory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Williams College|url=http://tclf.org/landscapes/williams-college|website=The Cultural Landscape Foundation|publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation|accessdate=16 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102035857/http://tclf.org/landscapes/williams-college|archive-date=January 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Olmsted Brothers]] design firm played a large part in shaping the campus design and architecture. In 1902, the firm was commissioned to renovate a large part of campus, including the President's House, the cemetery, and South College; as well as incorporating the George A. Cluett estate into the campus acreage. Although these campus renovations were completed in 1912, the Olmsted Brothers would advise the gradual transformation of campus design for six decades. The present-day grounds layout reflects much of the design intent of the Olmsted Brothers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bishop|first1=Karina|title=The Olmsted Firm in the Berkshires|url=http://tclf.org/news/features/olmsted-firm-berkshires|website=The Cultural Landscape Foundation|publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation|accessdate=16 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313142527/http://tclf.org/news/features/olmsted-firm-berkshires|archive-date=March 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

There is a [[Newman Center]] on campus.

The Chapin Library supports the liberal arts curriculum of the college by allowing students close access to a number of rare books and documents of interest. The library opened on June 18, 1923, with an initial collection of 9,000 volumes contributed by alumnus [[Alfred Clark Chapin]], Class of 1869. Over the years, Chapin Library has grown to include over 50,000 volumes (including 3,000 more given by Chapin) as well as 100,000 other artifacts such as [[Printmaking|prints]], photographs, [[map]]s, and [[bookplates]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Chapin Library |publisher=Williams College |url=http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/history/history.html |access-date=2007-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826151117/http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/history/history.html |archive-date=2007-08-26 |url-status =dead}}</ref> The library is currently located on the fourth floor of the recently reopened Sawyer Library.

The Chapin Library's Americana collection includes original printings of all four founding documents of the United States: the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Articles of Confederation]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

Although often overshadowed by the neighboring and much larger [[Clark Art Institute]] and [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]], WCMA remains one of the premier attractions of the Berkshires. Because the museum is intended primarily for educational purposes, admission is free for all students.<ref name = "WCMA" />

Located in front of the West College dormitory, the Hopkins gate serves as a memorial to brothers [[Mark Hopkins (educator)|Mark]] and Albert Hopkins. Both made lasting contributions to the Williams College community. Mark was appointed as president of the college in 1836,<ref>{{cite web| title = Biographical Chronology of Mark Hopkins| publisher = Williams College Archives and Special Collections| url = http://archives.williams.edu/manuscriptguides/hopkins/bio1.php| accessdate = 2008-03-18| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150917084220/http://archives.williams.edu/manuscriptguides/hopkins/bio1.php| archive-date = September 17, 2015| url-status = live}}</ref> while Albert was elected a professor in 1829.<ref>{{cite web| title = Biographical Chronology of Albert Hopkins| publisher = Williams College Archives and Special Collections| url = http://archives.williams.edu/manuscriptguides/hopkins/bio2.php| accessdate = 2008-03-18| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150917091704/http://archives.williams.edu/manuscriptguides/hopkins/bio2.php| archive-date = September 17, 2015| url-status = live}}</ref>
The Hopkins gate is inscribed with an inspirational motto that is familiar to all in the Williams College community.
<blockquote>Climb High, Climb Far<br>Your Goal the Sky, Your Aim the Star.<br></blockquote>

==Student activities and traditions==

===Student media===
The longest-running student newspaper at Williams is the ''Williams Record'', a weekly [[broadsheet]] paper published on Wednesdays. The newspaper was founded in 1887, and now has a weekly [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 3,000 copies distributed in Williamstown, in addition to more than 600 subscribers across the country. The newspaper formerly received no financial support from the college or from the student government and relied on revenue generated by local and national ad sales, subscriptions, and voluntary contributions for use of its website, but the paper went into debt in 2004 and is now subsidized by the Student Activities Tax. Both Sawyer Library and the College Archives maintain more than a century's worth of publicly accessible, bound volumes of the ''Record''. The newspaper provides access free of charge to a searchable database of articles stretching back to 1998 on its website.

The student yearbook is called ''The Gulielmensian'', which means "Williamsian" in Latin. It was published irregularly in the 1990s, but has been annual for the past several years and dates back to the mid-19th century.<ref name="Gulielmensian">{{cite web| title =35th Semi-Annual Williams College Trivia Contest| publisher =Williams Students Online| date =December 5, 1983| url =http://wso.williams.edu/orgs/trivia/phaser83/questions.html| accessdate =2007-09-19| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071016104106/http://wso.williams.edu/orgs/trivia/phaser83/questions.html| archive-date =October 16, 2007| url-status =live}}</ref>

Numerous smaller campus publications are also produced each year, including ''The Telos'', a journal of Christian thought; ''The Haystack'', a humor magazine; the ''Williams College Law Journal'', a collection of undergraduate articles; the ''Literary Review'', a literary magazine; and ''Monkeys With Typewriters'', a magazine of non-fiction essays.

=== Trivia contest ===

At the end of every semester but one since 1966, WCFM has hosted an all-night, eight-hour [[trivia]] contest. Teams of students, alumni, professors, friends, and others compete to answer questions on a variety of subjects, while simultaneously identifying songs and performing designated tasks. The winning team's only prize is the obligation to create and host the following semester's contest.<ref name="trivia rules">{{cite web| title =Contest Rules (and Rules of Thumb) for the semi-annual Williams College Trivia Contest| url =https://wso.williams.edu/orgs/trivia/rules.html| accessdate =2020-01-30| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160529032442/http://wso.williams.edu/orgs/trivia/rules.html| archive-date =May 29, 2016| url-status =live}}</ref>

The precise date of the debut contest is uncertain. Most spring contests occur in early May, but during its first decade, Williams Trivia was sometimes held in March or February. Assuming a May date, [[Lawrence University]]'s 50-hour-long [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]], first held on April 29, 1966, would be the oldest continuous competition of its sort in the United States, but if the first Williams contest was held earlier, it would be the oldest. The distinction is, appropriately, trivial.<ref>{{cite web| title =The Williams Trivia Contest| url =https://wso.williams.edu/orgs/trivia/| accessdate =2020-01-30| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161022171441/http://wso.williams.edu/orgs/trivia/| archive-date =October 22, 2016| url-status =live}}</ref>

While other college-based trivia contests in the United States emphasize marathon endurance and revel in the obscurity of their arcana, the aim of the Williams contest is to cram as much evocative and entertaining material into as concentrated a space as possible. Lasting just eight hours, a typical Williams Trivia contest will demand between 900 and 1,200 separate "bits" of trivial information,<ref name="trivia rules" /> delivering twice as much content as its "competitors" in a fraction of the time. No discernible rivalry exists between any of the various contests. The contest has occasionally received outside media coverage, including in the [[New York Times]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/06/weekinreview/word-for-word-trivia-marathon-pulling-all-nighter-this-college-means-acting.html?scp=1&sq=WCFM%20%20Trivia&st=cse |title=Word for Word/Trivia Marathon; Pulling an All-Nighter at This College Means Acting Out 'Nietzsche in Love' |author=Thomas Vinciguerra |work=New York Times |date=June 6, 1999 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |author-link=Thomas Vinciguerra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510010657/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/06/weekinreview/word-for-word-trivia-marathon-pulling-all-nighter-this-college-means-acting.html?scp=1&sq=WCFM%20%20Trivia&st=cse |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===School colors and mascot===

Williams's [[school colors]] are purple and gold, with purple as the primary school color.<ref>{{cite web| title =Williams College Campus Life| publisher =CollegeData| url =https://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg05_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=229| accessdate =2007-09-15| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110724204252/https://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg05_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=229| archive-date =July 24, 2011| url-status =live}}</ref> A story explaining the origin of purple as a school color says that at the Williams-Harvard baseball game in 1869, spectators watching from carriages had trouble telling the teams apart because there were no uniforms. One of the onlookers bought ribbons from a nearby millinery store to pin on Williams' players, and the only color available was purple. The buyer was [[Jennie Jerome]] (later [[Winston Churchill]]'s mother) whose family summered in Williamstown.<ref name="joProctor">{{cite web| last =Proctor| first =Jo| title =Frequently Asked Questions| publisher =Williams College| url =http://www.williams.edu/home/parents/faq.php| accessdate =2007-09-15| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071022075807/http://williams.edu/home/parents/faq.php| archive-date =2007-10-22| url-status =dead}}</ref>

The Williams [[college mascot]] is a [[purple cow]].<ref name="joProctor" /> The mascot's name, Ephelia, was submitted in a radio contest in October 1952 by [[Theodore Friend|Theodore W. Friend]], a senior at Williams.<ref name="purple cow">{{cite web| title =The Purple Cow Mascot| publisher =Williams College Archives and Special Collections| url =http://archives.williams.edu/?n=Purple+cow+mascot| accessdate =2007-09-15| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070826121642/http://archives.williams.edu/?n=Purple+cow+mascot| archive-date =August 26, 2007| url-status =live}}</ref> The origins of the cow mascot are unknown, but one possibility is that it was inspired by the ''Purple Cow'' humor magazine, a student publication begun in 1907, which used the college color along with a cow.<ref name="purple cow" /> The title of the humor magazine was in reference to [[Gelett Burgess]]'s nonsense poem known as the "[[Purple Cow]]":
<blockquote>I never saw a purple cow <br>I never hope to see one; <br>But I can tell you, anyhow, <br>I'd rather see than be one! <br></blockquote>

The Williams College athletic teams are referred to as the Ephs (rhymes with chiefs) in honor of Colonel Ephraim Williams.

===Alma mater===
Williams claims the first ''alma mater'' song written by an undergraduate, "The Mountains," was by [[Washington Gladden]] of the class of 1859.<ref>{{cite web| title =Washington Gladden (1836–1918)| publisher =Williams College Archives and Special Collections| url =http://archives.williams.edu/williamshistory/greylock/wgladden.php| accessdate =2007-09-20| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070825195804/http://archives.williams.edu/williamshistory/greylock/wgladden.php| archive-date =August 25, 2007| url-status =live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book

{{Wikisource|The Mountains}}
In 2016, a college-wide contest was held for a new official Williams song. The winner was "Echo of Williams," music by Kevin Weist, class of 1981, and lyrics by [[Bruce Leddy]], class of 1983.<ref>{{cite web| title = Williams Magazine| url = https://magazine.williams.edu/2016/summer/notice/echo-of-williams/| access-date = January 15, 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191013070130/https://magazine.williams.edu/2016/summer/notice/echo-of-williams/| archive-date = October 13, 2019| url-status = live}}</ref>

===Mountain Day===
On one of the first three Fridays in October, the president of the college cancels classes and declares it [[Mountain Day]]. The bells ring, announcing the event, members of the Outing Club unfurl a banner from the roof of Chapin Hall and students hike up [[Stony Ledge]]. At Stony Ledge, they celebrate with donuts, cider and ''a cappella'' performances.

The first known mention of Mountain Day was made in 1827 by Williams president [[Edward Dorr Griffin]] in his notebook on college business. He wrote, under 'Holidays': "About the 24th of June a day to go to the mountain. If not then about the 14th of July. Prayers at night."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williams.edu/home/traditions/|title=About Williams – Williams Traditions|publisher=Williams College|accessdate=2009-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125084139/http://williams.edu/home/traditions|archive-date=2009-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2009, with the threat of bad weather for each of the first three Fridays of the month, Interim-president Wagner declared "Siberian Mountain Day." Festivities were relocated from Stony Ledge to the much more accessible Stone Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://record.williams.edu/wp/?p=552/|title=Wagner declares 'Siberian' Mountain Day|publisher=Williams Record|accessdate=2009-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003181001/http://record.williams.edu/wp/?p=552%2F|archive-date=October 3, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Athletics==
{{main|Williams Ephs}}

The school's athletic teams (except for the men's rugby team, [[Williams College Rugby Football|the White Dawgs]]) are called the Ephs (rhymes with "chiefs"), a shortening of the first name of founder [[Ephraim Williams]]. The mascot is a [[Purple Cow]]. They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]]. Williams also competes in [[skiing]] and [[squash (sport)|squash]] at the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level. Williams is ranked first among Division III schools for athletic spending per student.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/main.asp |title=Equity in Athletics |access-date=2007-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216050342/http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/main.asp |archive-date=2007-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Williams has a traditional rivalry with Amherst College and Wesleyan University. The "Little Three", a subset of [[NESCAC]], comprises the three schools<ref>{{cite web | author =Reynolds, Lauren | title =Sibling rivalry: Williams-Amherst remains heated | publisher =ESPN | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2945751&type=story | accessdate =2007-09-20 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071113060734/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2945751&type=story | archive-date =November 13, 2007 | url-status =live }}</ref> Although Williams College typically sports purple and gold as their school colors, purple is in fact the only school color. The gold was added in order to differentiate its colors from that of rival school Amherst's purple and white uniforms. On May 3, 2009, Williams and Amherst alumni played a game of [[vintage baseball]] at [[Wahconah Park]] according to 1859-rules to commemorate the 150th-anniversary of the first [[college baseball]] game, which was played on July 2, 1859, between the two schools.

Until 1994, Williams was not permitted, by NESCAC rules, to compete in team NCAA competition. The Williams women's swimming and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] team won the school's first national title in 1981, and claimed the title in 1982 as well. Williams played in the 2003, 2004, 2010, and 2014 men's basketball Division III national championship games, winning the title in March 2003. Men's basketball also played in the 1997, 1998, 2011, and 2017 Final Fours. Williams was the first New England basketball team to win a Division III championship, and since they have been eligible to compete in the NCAA tournament, no team in the country has played in more Final Fours.

Williams teams to win national titles since Williams began participating in NCAA tournaments in 1994 include women's crew (nine titles, including eight straight from 2006–2013), men's tennis (four), women's tennis (nine, including six straight from 2008–2013), women's soccer (three, 2015, 2017–18), men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] (two), women's cross country (three), [[men's basketball]], women's indoor track and field (two), women's golf (2015), and men's soccer (1995).

Williams has won the NACDA Director's Cup 22 of the 24 years since its inception, including 13 years in a row from 1999 through 2011.

Williams also has an active club and intramural sports program, offering 14 club sports including [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[Williams College Rugby Football|rugby]], [[horseback riding]], cycling, fencing, volleyball, gymnastics, sailing, and [[water polo]]. Approximately 50% of Williams' students compete on at least one varsity, junior varsity, or formal club team.

==Athletic facilities==
[[File:Williams College - Towne Field House.JPG|thumb|right|275px|The Towne Field House]]

Williams College has had major updates or renovations of its athletic facilities during the past several decades.

The Lansing Chapman hockey rink, built in 1953 and originally uncovered, was canopied in 1963, enclosed in 1969 and has been periodically upgraded to the present (2014) with rink, roof, locker room and lighting improvements.

The Towne Field House, constructed in 1970, is a multipurpose facility, which includes an indoor track, tennis courts and a climbing wall. The last was initially constructed in 1974 and updated to a state of the art climbing wall in 1995.  Towne Field House's track was resurfaced in 2019. The field house also accommodates pre-season baseball, softball and lacrosse.

[[File:Weston Field in January.JPG|left|thumb|Renovation of [[Weston Field (Williamstown)|Weston Field]] Athletic Complex - January 2014. The wooden grandstand behind the excavator was built in 1902. It was moved in 1987 to the new Plansky Track and football field and was moved again during the renovations that were completed in September 2014.|291x291px]]

The Lasell Gym built in 1886 was renovated and expanded with the addition of the Chandler Athletic Center in 1987. It provides a state of the art 50-meter swimming pool, a gymnasium primarily for basketball, squash facilities, wrestling rooms, various fitness centers and administrative offices.

In 1987, the [[Weston Field (Williamstown)|Weston Field]] cinder running track and baseball field were replaced: the [[Tony Plansky|Anthony Plansky]] 400-meter track was built around the refurbished football field and the Bobby Coombs baseball field was re-located at Cole Field. The Renzi Lamb Field for lacrosse and field hockey, built with artificial turf, was added to Weston Field in 2004.

In November 2013 Williams College began its $22 million renovation of the Weston Field complex. This upgrade includes an artificial turf football field, relocation of the Plansky Track and Lamb Field, new bleachers, improved lighting and the addition of support buildings for the athletes. The completed facility, which reopened in September 2014, allows year round athletic events and practice.<ref>[http://facilities.williams.edu/properties Properties | Williams College Facilities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203160020/http://facilities.williams.edu/properties/ |date=February 3, 2014 }}.

===Alumni===
{{main|List of Williams College people}}
The Society of Alumni of Williams College is the oldest existing alumni society of any academic institution in the United States.<ref>{{cite web| title =History of The Williams Club| publisher =The Williams Club of New York| url =http://www.williamsclub.org/about/index.html| accessdate =2007-09-20| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071013051619/http://www.williamsclub.org/about/index.html| archive-date =2007-10-13| url-status =dead}}</ref> The Society of Alumni was founded during the "Amherst crisis" in 1821, when Williams College President [[Zephaniah Swift Moore]] left Williams. Graduates of Williams formed the Society to ensure that Williams would not have to close, and raised enough money to ensure the future survival of the school. This fund formed by alumni served as the first college endowment in the United States, and as a result, Williams has maintained a legacy of high alumni involvement.

There are 30,699 living alumni of record, and 69 regional alumni associations nationwide and overseas. Alumni participation in the 2018-19 Alumni Fund was 54.1%. More than 61% of the alumni from the classes of 1980 to 2000 have earned at least one graduate or professional degree. The most popular graduate disciplines for alumni are management, education, law, and health care.<ref name=fastfacts/>
