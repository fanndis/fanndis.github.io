During the colonial era, prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim, [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] represented the bulk of America's then-small Jewish population, and while their descendants are a [[Minority group|minority]] today, they, along with an array of other Jewish communities, represent the remainder of American Jews, including other more recent [[Sephardi Jews]], [[Mizrahi Jews]], [[Jewish ethnic divisions|various other ethnically Jewish communities]], as well as a smaller number of [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]]. The American Jewish community manifests a wide range of [[Jewish culture|Jewish cultural traditions]], encompassing the [[Jewish religious movements#Modern movements or denominations|full spectrum of Jewish religious observance]].

Depending on religious definitions and varying population data, the United States has the largest or second largest Jewish community in the world, after [[Israel]]. In 2012, the American Jewish population was estimated at between 5.5 million and 8 million, depending on the [[Who is a Jew?|definition of the term]], which constitutes between 1.7% and 2.6% of the total U.S. population.<ref name="Jewish American Population"/>

The English [[Plantation Act 1740]] for the first time permitted Jews to become British citizens and emigrate to [[British America|the colonies]].

[[File:Welcome to the land of freedom.png|thumb|250px|Eastern European Jewish immigrants arriving in New York]]
Jewish migration to the United States increased dramatically in the early 1880s, as a result of persecution and economic difficulties in parts of Eastern Europe. Most of these new immigrants were [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom arrived from poor diaspora communities of the [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Empire]] and the [[Pale of Settlement]], located in modern-day [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]]. During the same period, great numbers of Ashkenazic Jews also arrived from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], at that time the most impoverished region of the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] with a heavy Jewish urban population, driven out mainly by economic reasons. Many Jews also emigrated from [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania]]. Over 2,000,000 Jews landed between the late 19th century and 1924, when the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] restricted immigration. Most settled in the [[New York metropolitan area]], establishing the world's major concentrations of Jewish population. In 1915 the circulation of the daily [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly papers and the many magazines.<ref>Yiddish is a dialect of German written in the Hebrew alphabet and based entirely in the East European Jewish population. {{cite book|author=Robert Moses Shapiro|title=Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American & International Journalism During the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3lItIwOzCkC&pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=KTAV|page=18|isbn=9780881257755}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 20th century, these newly arrived Jews built support networks consisting of many small [[Synagogue|synagogues]] and ''[[Landsmanshaft]]en'' (German and Yiddish for "Countryman Associations") for Jews from the same town or village. American Jewish writers of the time urged [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and integration into the wider [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], and Jews quickly became part of American life. 500,000 American Jews (or half of all Jewish males between 18 and 50) fought in [[World War II]], and after the war younger families joined the new trend of [[suburbanization]]. There, Jews became increasingly assimilated and demonstrated rising [[Interfaith marriage|intermarriage]]. The suburbs facilitated the formation of new centers, as Jewish school enrollment more than doubled between the end of World War II and the mid-1950s, while synagogue affiliation jumped from 20% in 1930 to 60% in 1960; the fastest growth came in Reform and, especially, Conservative congregations.<ref>Sarna, ''American Judaism'' (2004) pp. 284–5</ref> More recent waves of Jewish emigration from Russia and other regions have largely joined the mainstream American Jewish community.

===Self identity===
Scholars debate whether the historical experience for Jews in the United States has been such a unique experience as to validate [[American exceptionalism]].<ref>Tony Michels, "Is America 'Different'? A Critique of American Jewish Exceptionalism," ''American Jewish History'', 96 (Sept. 2010), 201–24; David Sorkin, "Is American Jewry Exceptional? Comparing Jewish Emancipation in Europe and America," ''American Jewish History'', 96 (Sept. 2010), 175–200.</ref> 

Korelitz (1996) shows how American Jews during the late 19th and early 20th centuries abandoned a [[Racial identity|racial definition]] of Jewishness in favor of one that embraced ethnicity. The key to understanding this transition from a racial self-definition to a cultural or ethnic one can be found in the ''[[Menorah Journal]]'' between 1915 and 1925. During this time contributors to the Menorah promoted a [[Culture|cultural]], rather than a racial, religious, or other view of Jewishness as a means to define Jews in a world that threatened to overwhelm and absorb Jewish uniqueness. The journal represented the ideals of the menorah movement established by [[Horace M. Kallen]] and others to promote a revival in Jewish cultural identity and combat the idea of race as a means to define or identify peoples.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |first=Seth |last=Korelitz |title=The Menorah Idea: From Religion to Culture, From Race to Ethnicity |journal=American Jewish History |year=1997 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=75–100 |issn=0164-0178}}</ref>

Siporin (1990) uses the family [[folklore]] of [[ethnic Jews]] to their collective history and its transformation into an historical art form. They tell us how Jews have survived being uprooted and transformed. Many immigrant narratives bear a theme of the arbitrary nature of fate and the reduced state of immigrants in a new culture. By contrast, ethnic family narratives tend to show the ethnic more in charge of his life, and perhaps in danger of losing his Jewishness altogether. Some stories show how a family member successfully negotiated the conflict between ethnic and American identities.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Siporin |title=Immigrant and Ethnic Family Folklore |journal=Western States Jewish History |year=1990 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=230–242 |issn=0749-5471}}</ref>

After 1960, memories of [[the Holocaust]], together with the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 had major impacts on fashioning Jewish [[ethnic identity]]. Some have argued that the Holocaust highlighted for Jews the importance of their ethnic identity at a time when other minorities were asserting their own.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Novick |title=The Holocaust in American Life |url=https://archive.org/details/holocaustinameri00novi |url-access=registration |year=1999 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Hilene |editor-last=Flanzbaum |title=The Americanization of the Holocaust |year=1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Monty Noam |last=Penkower |title=Shaping Holocaust Memory |journal=American Jewish History |year=2000 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=127–132 |issn=0164-0178 |doi=10.1353/ajh.2000.0021|s2cid=161364396 }}</ref>

In New York City, while the German Jewish community was well established 'uptown', the more numerous Jews who migrated from Eastern Europe faced tension 'downtown' with Irish and German Catholic neighbors, especially the Irish Catholics who controlled Democratic Party Politics<ref>Ronald H. Bayor, ''Neighbors in Conflict: The Irish, Germans, Jews and Italians of New York City, 1929–1941'' (1978)</ref> [[Tammany Hall|at the time]]. Jews successfully established themselves in the garment trades and in the needle unions in New York. By the 1930s they were a major political factor in New York, with strong support for the most liberal programs of the [[New Deal]]. They continued as a major element of the [[New Deal Coalition]], giving special support to the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. By the mid-1960s, however, the [[Black Power movement]] caused a growing separation between blacks and Jews, though both groups remained solidly in the Democratic camp.<ref>See Murray Friedman, ''What Went Wrong? The Creation and Collapse of the Black-Jewish Alliance''. (1995)</ref>

While earlier Jewish immigrants from Germany tended to be politically [[Conservatism|conservative]], the wave of Jews from Eastern Europe starting in the early 1880s, were generally more liberal or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and became the political majority.<ref name="Hasia Diner 2004">[[Hasia Diner]], ''The Jews of the United States. 1654 to 2000'' (2004), ch 5</ref> Many came to America with experience in the socialist, [[Jewish Anarchism|anarchist]] and communist movements as well as the [[General Jewish Labor Union|Labor Bund]], emanating from Eastern Europe. Many Jews rose to leadership positions in the early 20th century [[American labor movement]] and helped to found unions that played a major role in left-wing politics and, after 1936, in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics.<ref name="Hasia Diner 2004"/>

Although American Jews generally leaned Republican in the second half of the 19th century, the majority has voted Democratic since at least 1916, when they voted 55% for [[Woodrow Wilson]].<ref name=JVLvote>{{cite web |title=Jewish Vote In Presidential Elections |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/jewvote.html |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}}</ref>

With the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], American Jews voted more solidly Democratic. They voted 90% for Roosevelt in the elections of 1940, and 1944, representing the highest of support, equaled only once since. In the election of 1948, Jewish support for Democrat [[Harry S. Truman]] dropped to 75%, with 15% supporting the new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]].<ref name=JVLvote/> As a result of lobbying, and hoping to better compete for the Jewish vote, both major party platforms had included a pro-Zionist plank since 1944,<ref>{{cite web |title=Democratic Party Platform of 1944 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29598 |publisher=American Presidency Project |accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Republican Party Platform of 1944 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25835 |publisher=American Presidency Project |accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> and supported the creation of a Jewish state; it had little apparent effect however, with 90% still voting other-than-Republican. In every election since, except for 1980, no Democratic presidential candidate has won with less than 67% of the Jewish vote. (In 1980, Carter obtained 45% of the Jewish vote. See below.)

During the 1952 and 1956 elections they voted 60% or more for Democrat [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], while [[Dwight Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] garnered 40% for his reelection, the best showing to date for the Republicans since [[Warren G. Harding]]'s 43% in 1920.<ref name=JVLvote/> In 1960, 83% voted for Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] against [[Richard Nixon]], and in 1964, 90% of American Jews voted for [[Lyndon Johnson]], over his Republican opponent, arch-conservative [[Barry Goldwater]].

===Participation in civil rights movements===
Members of the American Jewish community have included prominent participants in [[civil rights]] movements. In the mid-20th century, there were American Jews who were among the most active participants in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[feminist]] movements. A number of American Jews have also been active figures in the struggle for [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights in America]].

[[Joachim Prinz]], president of the [[American Jewish Congress]], stated the following when he spoke from the podium at the Lincoln Memorial during the famous [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963: "As Jews we bring to this great demonstration, in which thousands of us proudly participate, a twofold experience—one of the spirit and one of our history.{{nbsp}}... From our Jewish historic experience of three and a half thousand years we say: Our ancient history began with [[slavery]] and the yearning for freedom. During the Middle Ages my people lived for a thousand years in the ghettos of Europe.{{nbsp}}... It is for these reasons that it is not merely sympathy and compassion for the black people of America that motivates us. It is, above all and beyond all such sympathies and emotions, a sense of complete identification and solidarity born of our own painful historic experience."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joachimprinz.com/civilrights.htm|title=Joachim Prinz March on Washington Speech|publisher=joachimprinz.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/info/mowprog.htm|title=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement – March on Washington|publisher=Civil Rights Movement Veterans}}</ref>

===The Holocaust===
During the [[World War II]] period, the American Jewish community was bitterly and deeply divided and was unable to form a common front. Most Jews from Eastern Europe favored [[Zionism]], which saw a return to their ancestral homeland as the only solution given the persecution and genocide occurring across Europe. One important development was the sudden conversion of many American Jewish leaders to Zionism late in the war.<ref>Henry L. Feingold, ''A Time for Searching: Entering the Mainstream, 1920–1945'' (1992), pp. 225–65</ref> [[The Holocaust]] was largely ignored by American media as it was happening. Reporters and editors largely did not believe the stories of atrocities coming out of Europe.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Korman | first1 = Gerd | year = 1987 | title = Mass Murder Hides Holocaust: Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933–1945 by Deborah E. Lipstadt | journal = Reviews in American History | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 474–479 | jstor=2702047 | doi=10.2307/2702047}}</ref>

[[The Holocaust]] had a profound impact on the Jewish community in the United States, especially after 1960 as Holocaust education improved, as Jews tried to comprehend what had happened, and especially to commemorate and grapple with it when looking to the future. [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] summarized this dilemma when he attempted to understand [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]: "To try to answer is to commit a supreme blasphemy. Israel enables us to bear the agony of Auschwitz without radical despair, to sense a ray [of] God's radiance in the jungles of history."<ref>Staub (2004) p. 80</ref>

===International affairs===
[[File:Winston Churchill and Bernard Baruch talk in car in front of Baruch's home, 14 April 1961.jpg|thumb|[[Winston Churchill]] and [[Bernard Baruch]] converse in the back seat of a car in front of Baruch's home.]]

[[Zionism]] became a well-organized movement in the U.S. with the involvement of leaders such as [[Louis Brandeis]] and the promise of a reconstituted homeland in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]].<ref>Melvin I. Urofsky, ''Louis D. Brandeis: A Life'' (2009) p. 515</ref> Jewish Americans organized large-scale boycotts of German merchandise during the 1930s to protest [[Nazi Germany]]. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s leftist domestic policies received strong Jewish support in the 1930s and 1940s, as did his anti-Nazi foreign policy and his promotion of the [[United Nations]]. Support for political Zionism in this period, although growing in influence, remained a distinctly minority opinion among Jews in the United States until about 1944–45, when the early rumors and reports of the systematic mass murder of the Jews in [[Nazi-occupied countries]] became publicly known with the liberation of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. The founding of the modern State of [[Israel]] in 1948 and recognition thereof by the American government (following objections by American isolationists) was an indication of both its intrinsic support and its response to learning the horrors of the Holocaust.

This attention was based on a natural affinity toward and support for Israel in the Jewish community. The attention is also because of the ensuing and unresolved conflicts regarding the founding of Israel and the role for the Zionist movement going forward. A lively internal debate commenced, following the [[Six-Day War]]. The American Jewish community was divided over whether or not they agreed with the Israeli response; the great majority came to accept the war as necessary. A tension existed especially for some Jews on the left who saw Israel as too anti-Soviet and [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|anti-Palestinian]].<ref>Staub (2004)</ref> Similar tensions were aroused by the 1977 election of [[Menachem Begin]] and the rise of [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] policies, the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the continuing administrative governance of portions of the [[West Bank]] territory.<ref>Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht.

Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin's handshake with Yasir Arafat during the September 13 White House ceremony elicited dramatically opposed reactions among American Jews. To the liberal universalists the accord was highly welcome news. As one commentator put it, after a year of tension between Israel and the United States, "there was an audible sigh of relief from American and Jewish liberals. Once again, they could support Israel as good Jews, committed liberals, and loyal Americans." The community "could embrace the Jewish state, without compromising either its liberalism or its patriotism". <br>However, to some right wing Jews, the peace treaty was worrisome. From their perspective, Oslo was not just an affront to the sanctity of how they interpreted their culture, but also a personal threat to the lives and livelihood in the West Bank and Gaza, territory which was historically known as "Judea and Samaria". For these Jews, such as Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist organization of America, and Norman Podhoretz, the editor of ''Commentary'', the peace treaty amounted to an appeasement of Palestinian terrorism. They and others repeatedly warned that the newly established Palestinian Authority (PA) would pose a serious security threat to Israel.|url=https://archive.org/details/israeldiasporaje0000unse/page/126}}</ref> this mirrored a similar split among Israelis and led to a parallel rift within the [[Israel lobby in the United States|pro-Israel lobby]], and even ultimately to the United States for its "blind" support of Israel.<ref name="Ben-Moshe2007"/> Abandoning any pretense of unity, both segments began to develop separate advocacy and lobbying organizations. The liberal supporters of the [[Oslo Accord]] worked through [[Americans for Peace Now]] (APN), [[Israel Policy Forum]] (IPF) and other groups friendly to the Labour government in Israel. They tried to assure Congress that American Jewry was behind the Accord and defended the efforts of the administration to help the fledgling [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA), including promises of financial aid. In a battle for public opinion, IPF commissioned a number of polls showing widespread support for Oslo among the community.

In opposition to Oslo, an alliance of conservative groups, such as the [[Zionist Organization of America]] (ZOA), [[Americans For a Safe Israel]] (AFSI), and the [[Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs]] (JINSA) tried to counterbalance the power of the liberal Jews. On October 10, 1993, the opponents of the Palestinian-Israeli accord organized at the [[American Leadership Conference for a Safe Israel]], where they warned that Israel was prostrating itself before "an armed thug", and predicted and that the "thirteenth of September is a date that will live in infamy". Some Zionists also criticized, often in harsh language, Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Shimon Peres]], his foreign minister and chief architect of the peace accord. With the community so strongly divided, AIPAC and the Presidents Conference, which was tasked with representing the national Jewish consensus, struggled to keep the increasingly antagonistic discourse civil. Reflecting these tensions, [[Abraham Foxman]] from the [[Anti-Defamation League]] was asked by the conference to apologize for bad mouthing ZOA's [[Morton Klein]]. The conference, which under its organizational guidelines was in charge of moderating communal discourse, reluctantly censured some Orthodox spokespeople for attacking [[Colette Avital]], the Labor-appointed Israeli [[Consul General]] in New York and an ardent supporter of that version of a peace process.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Scott|last=Lasensky|editor=Barry Rubin|url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/jv6n1a7.html|title=Underwriting Peace in the Middle East: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Limits of Economic Inducements|journal=Middle East Review of International Affairs|volume=6|issue=1|date=March 2002|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510071636/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/jv6n1a7.html|archive-date=May 10, 2009|quote=The Palestinian aid effort was certainly not helped by the heated debate that quickly developed inside the Beltway. Not only was the Israeli electorate divided on the Oslo accords, but so, too, was the American Jewish community, particularly at the leadership level and among the major New York and Washington-based public interest groups. U.S. Jews opposed to Oslo teamed up with Israelis "who brought their domestic issues to Washington" and together they pursued a campaign that focused most of its attention on Congress and the aid program. The dynamic was new to Washington. The Administration, the Rabin-Peres government, and some American Jewish groups teamed on one side while Israeli opposition groups and anti-Oslo American Jewish organizations pulled Congress in the other direction.}}</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:Jewish population in the USA in 2000.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Percentage of Jewish population in the United States, 2000]]

As of 2011, the Jewish population of the United States is the second largest in the world, having been surpassed by that of Israel.

Precise population figures vary depending on whether Jews are accounted for based on [[halakha|halakhic]] considerations, or secular, [[Law of return|political]] and [[Who is a Jew?#Non-religious definitions|ancestral identification]] factors. There were about four million adherents of Judaism in the U.S. as of 2001, approximately 1.4% of the US population. According to the [[Jewish Agency]], for the year 2017 Israel was home to 6.5 million Jews (49.3% of the world's Jewish population), while the United States contained 5.3 million (40.2%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/903585.html |publisher=Haaretz Daily Newspaper Israel |title=Jewish Agency: 13.2 million Jews worldwide on eve of Rosh Hashanah, 5768 |last=Pfeffer |first=Anshel |accessdate=October 18, 2017| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011130459/http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/903585.html| archive-date= October 11, 2007 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

According to Gallup and Pew Research Center findings, "at maximum 2.2% of the U.S. adult population has some basis for Jewish self-identification."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/265898/american-jews-politics-israel.aspx |title=American Jews, Politics and Israel |last=Newport |first=Frank |date=2019-08-27 |website=gallup.com |access-date=2019-09-09 |quote=A 2013 Pew Research Center analysis of Jewish identification showed that in addition to the 1.8% of U.S. adults who identified their religion as Jewish (very similar to Gallup's estimate), another small percentage of Americans who did not initially say their religion was Jewish identified their secular heritage as Jewish. According to this research, at maximum 2.2% of the U.S. adult population has some basis for Jewish self-identification.}}</ref>

In 2012, demographers estimated the core American Jewish population (including religious and non-religious) to be 5,425,000 (or 1.73% of the US population in 2012), citing methodological failures in the previous higher estimates.<ref name="Sergio DellaPergola 2012. pp. 212–283">Sergio DellaPergola. "World Jewish Population, 2012." The American Jewish Year Book (2012) (Dordrecht: Springer) pp. 212–283</ref> Other sources say the number is around 6.5 million.

The ''American Jewish Yearbook population survey'' had placed the number of American Jews at 6.4 million, or approximately 2.1% of the total population. This figure is significantly higher than the previous large scale survey estimate, conducted by the 2000–2001 National Jewish Population estimates, which estimated 5.2 million Jews. A 2007 study released by the [[Steinhardt Social Research Institute]] (SSRI) at [[Brandeis University]] presents evidence to suggest that both these figures may be underestimations with a potential 7.0–7.4 million Americans of Jewish descent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brandeis University Study Finds that American-Jewish Population is Significantly Larger than Previously Thought|url=http://download.2164.net/PDF-newsletters/jewishpopulation.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> Those higher estimates were however arrived at by including all non-Jewish family members and household members, rather than surveyed individuals.<ref name="Sergio DellaPergola 2012. pp. 212–283"/>

Although the [[New York metropolitan area|New York City metropolitan area]] is the second largest Jewish population center in the world (after the [[Tel Aviv metropolitan area]] in Israel),<ref name=metroareas/> the [[Miami metropolitan area]] has a slightly greater Jewish population on a per-capita basis (9.9% compared to metropolitan New York's 9.3%). Several other major cities have large Jewish communities, including [[Los Angeles]], [[History of the Jews in Baltimore|Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Philadelphia]]. In many metropolitan areas, the majority of Jewish families live in suburban areas. The [[Greater Phoenix]] area was home to about 83,000 Jews in 2002, and has been rapidly growing.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jewishphoenix.org/local_includes/downloads/9038.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120513181517/http://www.jewishphoenix.org/local_includes/downloads/9038.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-05-13 |title=2002 Greater Phoenix Jewish Community Study }}</ref> The greatest Jewish population on a per-capita basis for incorporated areas in the U.S. is [[Kiryas Joel]] Village, New York (greater than 93% based on language spoken in home),<ref name="MLA">{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/census_data_results&state_id=36&place_id=39853 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923112824/http://www.mla.org/census_data_results%26state_id%3D36%26place_id%3D39853 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 23, 2006 |title=Kiryas Joel, New York |publisher=Modern Language Association |accessdate=December 14, 2006 }}</ref> City of [[Beverly Hills, California]] (61%),<ref>{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Pini|title=Needs of the Community: A Classification of Needs & Services for the L.A.

===Assimilation and population changes===
These parallel themes have facilitated the extraordinary economic, political, and social success of the American Jewish community, but also have contributed to widespread [[cultural assimilation]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Postrel|first=Virginia|title=Uncommon Culture |magazine=Reason Magazine|date=May 1993| url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/29368.html |accessdate=October 5, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010033730/http://reason.com/news/show/29368.html| archive-date= October 10, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> More recently however, the propriety and degree of [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] has also become a significant and controversial issue within the modern American Jewish community, with both [[Zionism|political]] and religious skeptics.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marsha L.

While not all Jews disapprove of [[Interreligious marriage|intermarriage]], many members of the Jewish community have become concerned that the high rate of [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|interfaith marriage]] will result in the eventual disappearance of the American Jewish community.

In addition to this, when compared with the general American population, the American Jewish community is slightly older.

A third of intermarried couples provide their children with a Jewish upbringing, and doing so is more common among intermarried families raising their children in areas with high Jewish populations.<ref name=jewglobe>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/11/10/jewish_population_in_region_rises/|work=Boston Globe|title=Jewish population in region rises|accessdate=November 29, 2009|author=Michael Paulson | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> The Boston area, for example, is exceptional in that an estimated 60% of children of intermarriages are being raised Jewish, meaning that intermarriage would actually be contributing to a net ''increase'' in the number of Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjp.org/local_includes/downloads/16072.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213074021/http://www.cjp.org/local_includes/downloads/16072.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|date=December 13, 2006}}</ref> As well, some children raised through intermarriage [[Baal teshuva movement|rediscover and embrace their Jewish roots]] when they themselves marry and have children.

In contrast to the ongoing trends of assimilation, some communities within American Jewry, such as [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], have significantly higher birth rates and lower intermarriage rates, and are growing rapidly. The proportion of Jewish synagogue members who were Orthodox rose from 11% in 1971 to 21% in 2000, while the overall Jewish community declined in number.&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/future-of-judaism/8189/|title=The Future of Judaism|work=nysun.com}}</ref> In 2000, there were 360,000 so-called "ultra-orthodox" ([[Haredi]]) Jews in USA (7.2%).<ref name="manchester">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2932|title=Majority of Jews will be Ultra-Orthodox by 2050|work=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref> The figure for 2006 is estimated at 468,000 (9.4%).<ref name="manchester"/> Data from the Pew Center shows that, as of 2013, 27% of American Jews under the age of 18 live in Orthodox households, a dramatic increase from Jews aged 18 to 29, only 11% of whom are Orthodox. The UJA-Federation of New York reports that 60% of Jewish children in the New York City area live in Orthodox homes. In addition to economizing and sharing, many Ultra Orthodox communities depend on government aid to support their high birth rate and large families. The Hasidic village of [[New Square, New York]] receives Section{{nbsp}}8 housing subsidies at a higher rate than the rest of the region, and half of the population in the Hasidic village of [[Kiryas Joel, New York]] receive food stamps, while a third receive Medicaid.<ref>[https://forward.com/articles/187429/orthodox-population-grows-faster-than-first-figure/?p=all Orthodox Population Grows Faster Than First Figures in Pew #JewishAmerica Study], ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', 15 November 2013</ref>

About half of the American Jews are considered to be religious. Out of this 2,831,000 religious Jewish population, 92% are [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic white]], 5% [[Hispanic]] (Most commonly from Argentina, Venezuela, or Cuba), 1% [[Asian people|Asian]] (Mostly [[Bukharan Jews|Bukharian]] and [[Persian Jews]]), 1% [[Black people|black]] and 1% [[Other races (U.S. Census)|Other]] (mixed race etc.).

Jewish Women's Archive. Accessed December 12, 2015. "Today, many American Jews retain an ambivalence about whiteness, despite the fact that the vast majority have benefited and continue to benefit from white privilege. This ambivalence stems from many different places: a deep connection to a Jewish history of discrimination and otherness; a moral imperative to identify with the stranger; an anti-universalist impulse that does not want Jews to be among the "melted" in the proverbial melting pot; an experience of prejudice and awareness of the contingency of whiteness; a feeling that Jewish identity is not fully described by religion but has some ethnic/tribal component that feels more accurately described by race; and a discomfort with contemporary Jewish power and privilege."</ref> Karen Brodkin explains this ambivalence as rooted in anxieties about the potential loss of [[Jewish identity]], especially outside of intellectual elites.<ref>{{cite book |title=How Jews Became White Folks and what that Says about Race in America |url=https://archive.org/details/howjewsbecamewhi00brod |url-access=registration |author=Karen Brodkin |date=1998 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]}} : "Ambivalence was expressed in the counterpoint between Jewish intellectuals' embrace of whiteness and the more ambivalent responses to whiteness in Jewish popular culture" (p. 182).</ref> Similarly, Kenneth Marcus observes a number of ambivalent cultural phenomena noted by other scholars, and concludes that "the veneer of whiteness has not established conclusively the racial construction of American Jews".<ref>{{cite book |title=Jewish Identity and Civil Rights in America|author=Kenneth L.

Relations between American Jews of African descent and other Jewish Americans are generally cordial.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} There are, however, disagreements with a specific minority of Black Hebrew Israelites community from among African-Americans who consider themselves, but not other Jews, to be the true descendants of the ancient [[Israelites]]. Black Hebrew Israelites are generally not considered to be members of the mainstream Jewish community, since they have not formally converted to Judaism, nor are they ethnically related to other Jews. One such group, the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]], emigrated to Israel and was granted [[permanent residency]] status there.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Village of Peace (2014) - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2124190/|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

The great majority of school-age Jewish students attend public schools, although Jewish day schools and yeshivas are to be found throughout the country. [[Jewish culture|Jewish cultural studies]] and [[Hebrew language]] instruction is also commonly offered at synagogues in the form of supplementary Hebrew schools or Sunday schools.

From the early 1900s until the 1950s, [[Numerus clausus|quota systems]] were imposed at elite colleges and universities particularly in the Northeast, as a response to the growing number of children of recent Jewish immigrants; these limited the number of Jewish students accepted, and greatly reduced their previous attendance.

==Religion==
Jewishness in the United States is considered an [[ethnic Jew|ethnic identity]] as well as a religious one. See [[Ethnoreligious group]].

[[File:US_Navy_091211-N-6003P-067_Lt._Zac_Stang,_operations_administrator_and_Jewish_lay_leader_of_the_Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier_USS_Harry_S._Truman_(CVN_75).jpg|thumb|left|US serviceman lighting a Menorah in observance of the first day of [[Hanukkah]]]]

===Observances and engagement===
Jewish religious practice in America is quite varied. Among the 4.3 million American Jews described as "strongly connected" to Judaism, over 80% report some sort of active engagement with Judaism,<ref>{{cite web|title=A PORTRAIT OF JEWISH AMERICANS – Chapter 3: Jewish Identity|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-3-jewish-identity/|work=[[Pew Research]]|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref> ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum to as little as attendance [[Passover Seder]]s or lighting [[Hanukkah]] candles on the other.

A 2003 [[Harris Poll]] found that 16% of American Jews go to the synagogue at least once a month, 42% go less frequently but at least once a year, and 42% go less frequently than once a year.<ref name=Harris2003>{{cite web|author=Humphrey Taylor|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf|title=While Most Americans Believe in God, Only 36% Attend a Religious Service Once a Month or More Often|work=The Harris Poll #59|date=October 15, 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206042041/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf|archive-date=December 6, 2010}}</ref>

The survey found that of the 4.3 million strongly connected Jews, 46% belong to a synagogue. Among those households who belong to a synagogue, 38% are members of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] synagogues, 33% [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], 22% [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], 2% [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and 5% other types. Traditionally, [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]] do not have different branches (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, etc.) but usually remain observant and religious. The survey discovered that Jews in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwest]] are generally more observant than Jews in the South or West. Reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups, Jews in the Northwestern United States are typically the least observant.

In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend of secular American Jews returning to a more observant, in most cases, Orthodox, lifestyle. Such Jews are called [[Baal teshuva movement|baalei teshuva]] ("returners", see also [[Repentance in Judaism]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The 2008 [[American Religious Identification Survey]] found that around 3.4 million American Jews call themselves [[Religous Jews|religious]] – out of a general Jewish population of about 5.4 million. The number of Jews who identify themselves as only culturally Jewish has risen from 20% in 1990 to 37% in 2008, according to the study. In the same period, the number of all US adults who said they had no religion rose from 8% to 15%. Jews are more likely to be secular than Americans in general, the researchers said. About half of all US Jews – including those who consider themselves religiously observant – claim in the survey that they have a secular worldview and see no contradiction between that outlook and their faith, according to the study's authors. Researchers attribute the trends among American Jews to the high rate of intermarriage and "disaffection from Judaism" in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3759000,00.html|title=US survey: Number of religious Jews drops sharply|work=ynet|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

About one-sixth of American Jews maintain [[kosher]] dietary standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kosher-carbon-footprint/|title=Is Keeping Kosher Good for the Environment?|author=Emily Gertz|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

===Religious beliefs===
American Jews are more likely to be [[Atheism|atheist]] or [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] than most Americans, especially so compared with [[Protestantism|Protestants]] or [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. A 2003 poll found that while 79% of Americans [[Belief in God|believe in God]], only 48% of American Jews do, compared with 79% and 90% for Catholics and Protestants respectively. While 66% of Americans said they were "absolutely certain" of God's existence, 24% of American Jews said the same. And though 9% of Americans believe there is [[Atheism|no God]] (8% [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and 4% [[Protestantism|Protestant]]), 19% of American Jews believe God does not exist.<ref name=Harris2003/>

A 2009 Harris Poll showed American Jews as the religious group most accepting of [[evolution]], with 80% believing in evolution, compared to 51% for Catholics, 32% for Protestants, and 16% of born-again Christians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/12/evolution-new-harris-poll-005232 |title=Evolution in a new Harris poll |publisher=NCSE |accessdate=March 14, 2012|date=2009-12-16 }}</ref> They were also less likely to believe in supernatural phenomena such as [[Miracle|miracles]], [[Angel|angels]], or [[heaven]].

A 2013 Pew Research Center report found that 1.7 million American Jewish adults, 1.6 million of whom were raised in Jewish homes or had Jewish ancestry, identified as [[Christians]] or [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]] but also consider themselves ethnically Jewish. Another 700,000 American Christian adults considered themselves "Jews by affinity" or "grafted-in" Jews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycreligion.info/national-survey-shows-jews-leaving-judaism-assimilating-christians-nones/|title=National survey shows Jews leaving Judaism, assimilating, becoming Christians or "Nones"|date=October 1, 2013|website=A Journey through NYC religions}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/02/how-many-jews-are-there-in-the-united-states/ How many Jews are there in the United States?] ''Pew Research Center''</ref>

Today, American Jews are a distinctive and influential group in the nation's politics. Jeffrey S. Helmreich writes that the ability of American Jews to effect this through political or financial clout is overestimated,<ref>Steven L. Spiegel, ''The Other Arab-Israeli Conflict'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985), pp. 150–165.</ref> that the primary influence lies in the group's voting patterns.<ref name=voting>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp446.htm|title=The Israel swing factor: how the American Jewish vote influences U.S. elections |author=Jeffrey S.

"Jews have devoted themselves to politics with almost religious fervor," writes [[Mitchell Bard]], who adds that Jews have the highest percentage [[voter turnout]] of any ethnic group (84% reported being registered to vote<ref>{{cite web|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |title=Pugh Forum findings Page 81 |accessdate=March 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309205034/http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf|archive-date=March 9, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>).

Though the majority (60–70%) of the country's Jews identify as Democratic, Jews span the political spectrum, with those at higher levels of observance being far more likely to vote Republican than their less observant and secular counterparts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andrewgelman.com/2008/05/23/voting_patterns/|title=Voting patterns of Jews and other religious groups – Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|work=Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

In 2019, after the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump]], poll data from the Jewish Electorate Institute showed that 73% of Jewish voters felt less secure as Jews than before, 71% disapproved of Trump's handling of anti-Semitism (54% strongly disapprove), 59% felt that he bears "at least some responsibility" for the shootings in Pittsburgh and Poway, and 38% were concerned that Trump was encouraging right-wing extremism. Views of the Democratic and Republican parties were milder: 28% were concerned that Republicans were making alliances with white nationalists and tolerating anti-Semitism within their ranks, while 27% were concerned that Democrats were tolerating [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] within their ranks.<ref>Jewish Electorate Institute.

===Foreign policy===
American Jews have displayed a very strong interest in [[Foreign policy|foreign affairs]], especially regarding [[Germany]] in the 1930s, and [[Israel]] since 1945.<ref>Michael N. Barnett, ''The Star and the Stripes: A History of the Foreign Policies of American Jews'' (2016)</ref> Both major parties have made strong commitments in support of Israel. Dr. Eric Uslaner of the [[University of Maryland]] argues, with regard to the 2004 election: "Only 15% of Jews said that Israel was a key voting issue. Among those voters, 55% voted for Kerry (compared to 83% of Jewish voters not concerned with Israel)." Uslander goes on to point out that negative views of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]] had a distinctly negative impact for Republicans among Jewish voters, while [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], traditionally more conservative in outlook as to social issues, favored the Republican Party.<ref>Eric M. Uslaner, {{cite web |url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/uslaner/uslanerlichbachjewishvotingbehaviorsummary.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615202225/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/uslaner/uslanerlichbachjewishvotingbehaviorsummary.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date= 2010-06-15 |title=Two Front War: Jews, Identity, Liberalism, and Voting}}&nbsp;{{small|(59.6&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> A ''New York Times'' article suggests that the Jewish movement to the Republican party is focused heavily on faith-based issues, similar to the Catholic vote, which is credited for helping [[George W.

Though some critics charged that Jewish interests were partially responsible for the push to [[Iraq War|war with Iraq]], Jewish Americans were actually more strongly opposed to the [[Iraq War]] from its onset than any other religious group, or even most Americans. The greater opposition to the war was not simply a result of high Democratic identification among U.S. Jews, as Jews of all political persuasions were more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who shared the same political leanings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26677/Among-Religious-Groups-Jewish-Americans-Most-Strongly-Oppose-War.aspx|title=Among Religious Groups, Jewish Americans Most Strongly Oppose War|publisher=Gallup, Inc. |author=Jeffrey M.

===Domestic issues===
A 2013 Pew Research Center survey suggests that American Jews' views on domestic politics are intertwined with the community's self-definition as a persecuted minority who benefited from the liberties and societal shifts in the United States and feel obligated to help other minorities enjoy the same benefits. American Jews across age and gender lines tend to vote for and support politicians and policies supported by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. On the other hand, Orthodox American Jews have domestic political views that are more similar to their religious Christian neighbors.<ref>Boyarsky, Bill.

==Jewish American culture==
{{See also|Secular Jewish culture}}

Since the time of the last major wave of Jewish immigration to America (over 2,000,000 Jews from Eastern Europe who arrived between 1890 and 1924), Jewish secular culture in the United States has become integrated in almost every important way with the broader American culture. Many aspects of Jewish American culture have, in turn, become part of the wider culture of the United States.

Most American Jews today are native [[English language|English speakers]]. A variety of other languages are still spoken within some American Jewish communities, communities that are representative of the various [[Jewish ethnic divisions]] from around the world that have come together to make up America's Jewish population.

Many of America's [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]], being exclusively of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] descent, are raised speaking [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. Yiddish was once spoken as the primary language by most of the several million Ashkenazi Jews who immigrated to the United States. It was, in fact, the original language in which ''[[The Forward]]'' was published. Yiddish has had an influence on [[American English]], and words borrowed from it include ''[[chutzpah]]'' ("effrontery", "gall"), ''nosh'' ("snack"), ''schlep'' ("drag"), ''schmuck'' ("an obnoxious, contemptible person", euphemism for "penis"), and, depending on [[idiolect]], hundreds of other terms. (See also [[Yinglish]].)

The [[Persian Jews|Persian Jewish]] community in the United States, notably the large community in and around Los Angeles and [[Beverly Hills, California]], primarily speak [[Persian language|Persian]] (see also [[Dzhidi language|Judeo-Persian]]) in the home and synagogue. They also support their own Persian language newspapers. Persian Jews also reside in eastern parts of New York such as [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]] and [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck, Long Island]].

Many recent Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union]] speak primarily Russian at home, and there are several notable communities where public life and business are carried out mainly in Russian, such as in [[Brighton Beach]] in New York City and [[Sunny Isles Beach]] in Florida. 2010 estimates of the number of Jewish Russian-speaking households in the New York city area are around 92,000, and the number of individuals are somewhere between 223,000 and 350,000.<ref>Kliger, Sam. [http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=8002 "Russian Jews in America: Status, Identity and Integration]". International Conference "Russian-speaking Jewry in Global Perspective: Assimilation, Integration and Community-building". American Jewish Committee (AJC). June 2004</ref> Another high population of Russian Jews can be found in the [[Richmond District, San Francisco, California|Richmond District]] of San Francisco where Russian markets stand alongside the numerous Asian businesses.

[[File:Brooklyn Posters 1.jpg|thumb|left|A typical poster-hung wall in Jewish [[Brooklyn]], New York]]

American [[Bukharan Jews]] speak [[Bukhori]], a dialect of Tajik Persian. They publish their own newspapers such as the ''Bukharian Times'' and a large portion live in [[Queens]], New York. [[Forest Hills, Queens, New York|Forest Hills]] in the New York City borough of Queens is home to 108th Street, which is called by some "Bukharian Broadway",<ref>{{cite news |last=Moskin |first=Julia |title=The Silk Road Leads to Queens |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/01/18/dining/18rego.html |work=The New York Times |date=January 18, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> a reference to the many stores and restaurants found on and around the street that have Bukharian influences. Many Bukharians are also represented in parts of [[Arizona]], Miami, Florida, and areas of [[Southern California]] such as San Diego.

[[Classical Hebrew]] is the language of most Jewish religious literature, such as the [[Tanakh]] (Bible) and [[Siddur]] (prayerbook). [[Modern Hebrew]] is also the primary official language of the modern State of [[Israel]], which further encourages many to learn it as a second language. Some recent Israeli immigrants to America speak Hebrew as their primary language.

There are a diversity of Hispanic Jews living in America. The oldest community is that of the Sephardi Jews of New Netherland. Their ancestors had fled Spain or Portugal during the Inquisition for the Netherlands, and then came to New Netherland. Though there is dispute over whether they should be considered Hispanic. Some Hispanic Jews, particularly in Miami and Los Angeles, immigrated from Latin America. The largest groups are those that fled Cuba after the communist revolution (known as Jewbans), Argentine Jews, and more recently, Venezuelan Jews. Argentina is the Latin American country with the largest Jewish population. There are a large number of synagogues in the Miami area that give services in Spanish. The last Hispanic Jewish community would be those that recently came from Portugal or Spain, after Spain and Portugal granted citizenship to the descendants of Jews who fled during the Inquisition. All the above listed Hispanic Jewish groups speak either Spanish or Ladino.

===Jewish American literature===
{{Main|Jewish American literature}}

Although American Jews have contributed greatly to American arts overall, there remains a distinctly Jewish American literature. Jewish American literature often explores the experience of being a Jew in America, and the conflicting pulls of secular society and history.

Yiddish theater was very well attended, and provided a training ground for performers and producers who moved to Hollywood in the 1920s. Many of the early Hollywood moguls and pioneers were Jewish.<ref>{{cite book|editor=[[Sarah Blacher Cohen]]|title=From Hester Street to Hollywood: The Jewish-American Stage and Screen|url=https://archive.org/details/fromhesterstreet00cohe|url-access=registration|year=1983|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|author-link=Neal Gabler|title=An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood|year=1988|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]]|title-link=An Empire of Their Own}}</ref> They played roles in the development of radio and television networks, typified by [[William S. Paley]] who ran [[CBS]].<ref>Sally Bedell Smith, ''In All His Glory: the Life and Times of William S. Paley and the Birth of Modern Broadcasting'' (1990).</ref> Stephen J. Whitfield states that "The Sarnoff family was long dominant at NBC."<ref>Stephen J. Whitfield, "The Jewish contribution to American journalism." ''American Journalism'' 3.2 (1986): 99–112, quote p 102.</ref>

Many individual Jews have made significant contributions to American popular culture.<ref>Paul Buhle, ''From the Lower East Side to Hollywood: Jews in American Popular Culture'' (Verso, 2004).</ref> There have been many Jewish American actors and performers, ranging from early 1900s actors, to classic Hollywood film stars, and culminating in many currently known actors. The field of American comedy includes many Jews. The legacy also includes songwriters and authors, for example the author of the song "Viva Las Vegas" [[Doc Pomus]], or ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' composer [[Aaron Copland]]. Many Jews have been at the forefront of women's issues.

There were 110 Jewish players in [[Major League Baseball]] between 1870 and 1881.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Patterson|first=Alan Owen|date=February 2008|title=The Eastern European Jewish Immigrant Experience with Baseball in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century|journal=Modern Judaism|volume=28|issue=1|pages=79–104|jstor=30130936|doi=10.1093/mj/kjm019|s2cid=161807444}}</ref> The first generation of Jewish Americans who immigrated during the 1880–1924 peak period were not interested in baseball, and in some cases tried to prevent their children from watching or participating in baseball-related activities. Most were focused on making sure they and their children took advantage of education and employment opportunities. Despite the efforts of parents, Jewish children became interested in baseball quickly since it was already embedded in the broader American culture. The second generation of immigrants saw baseball as a means to celebrate American culture without abandoning their broader religious community. After 1924, many Yiddish newspapers began covering baseball, which they had not done previously.<ref name=":0" />

===Government and military===

{{Main|List of Jewish American politicians|List of Jewish Americans in the military}}
{{see also|Military history of Jewish Americans}}

Since 1845, a total of 34 Jews have served in the Senate, including the 14 present-day senators noted [[#Politics|above]]. [[Judah P. Benjamin]] was the first practicing Jewish Senator, and would later serve as [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Secretary of War]] and Secretary of State during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. [[Rahm Emanuel]] served as Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama. The number of Jews elected to the House rose to an all-time high of 30. [[List of Jewish United States Supreme Court justices|Eight]] Jews have been appointed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], of which two ([[Stephen Breyer]] and [[Elena Kagan]]) are currently serving. Had [[Merrick Garland]]'s 2016 nomination been accepted, that number would have risen to four out of nine since [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] was also serving at that time.

The Civil War marked a transition for American Jews. It killed off the antisemitic canard, widespread in Europe, to the effect that Jews are cowardly, preferring to run from war rather than serve alongside their fellow citizens in battle.<ref>Adam Mendelsohn, "Beyond the Battlefield: Reevaluating the Legacy of the Civil War for American Jews," ''American Jewish Archives Journal'' 64 (nos. 1–2, 2012), 82–111 [http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/2012_64_01_00_mendelsohn.pdf online].</ref><ref>Howard B. Rock, "Upheaval, Innovation, and Transformation: New York City Jews and the Civil War," ''American Jewish Archives Journal'' 64 (nos. 1–2, 2012), 1–26.</ref>

At least twenty eight American Jews have been awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

===World War II===
More than 550,000 Jews served in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] during [[World War II]]; about 11,000 were killed and more than 40,000 were wounded. There were three recipients of the Medal of Honor; 157 recipients of the [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]], [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], or [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]; and about 1600 recipients of the [[Silver Star]]. About 50,000 other decorations and awards were given to Jewish military personnel, for a total of 52,000 decorations. During this period, Jews were approximately 3.3 percent of the total U.S. population but constituted about 4.23 percent of the U.S. armed forces. About 60 percent of all Jewish physicians in the United States under 45 years of age were in service as military physicians and [[medic]]s.<ref>Brody, Seymour. "[http://seymourbrody.com/index.htm Jewish Heroes and Heroines in America: World War II to the Present, A Judaica Collection Exhibit]."</ref>

Many{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Jewish [[physicist]]s, including project lead [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], were involved in the [[Manhattan Project]], the secret World War II effort to develop the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]]. Many of these were refugees from [[Nazi Germany]] or from [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] persecution elsewhere in Europe.

===American folk music===
Jews have been involved in the American folk music scene since the late 19th century;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Union-Hymnal-Prayers-Jewish-Worship/dp/B00157OXGY|title=Union Hymnal: Songs and Prayers for Jewish Worship: Central Conference of American Rabbis, Committee on Synagogue Music }}</ref> these tended to be refugees from Central and Eastern Europe, and significantly more economically disadvantaged than their established Western European Sephardic coreligionists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.library.jhu.edu/collections/specialcollections/sheetmusic/musictours/text/jewishmusic.html|title=The Jew and American Popular Music|author=Margaret Burri|date=July 18, 2007|publisher=jhu.edu|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116072128/http://old.library.jhu.edu/collections/specialcollections/sheetmusic/musictours/text/jewishmusic.html|archive-date=January 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Historians see it as a legacy of the secular Yiddish theater, cantorial traditions and a desire to assimilate. By the 1940s Jews had become established in the American folk music scene.

Examples of the major impact Jews have had in the American folk music arena include, but are not limited to: [[Moe Asch]] the first to record and release much of the music of [[Woody Guthrie]], including "[[This Land is Your Land]]" (see [[The Asch Recordings]]) in response to [[Irving Berlin]]'s "God Bless America", and Guthrie wrote [[Woody Guthrie#Jewish songs|Jewish songs]]. Guthrie married a [[Marjorie Guthrie|Jew]] and their son [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]] became influential in his own right. Asch's one-man corporation Folkways Records also released much of the music of Leadbelly and Pete Seeger from the '40s and '50s. Asch's large music catalog was voluntarily donated to the [[Smithsonian]].

Three of the four creators of the [[Newport Folk Festival]], Wein, Bikel and Grossman (Seeger is not) were Jewish. Albert Grossman put together [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], of which Yarrow is Jewish. [[Oscar Brand]], from a Canadian Jewish family, has the longest running radio program "Oscar Brand's Folksong Festival" which has been on air consecutively since 1945 from New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/folksong-festival/|title=Folksong Festival |publisher=WNYC}}</ref> And is the first American broadcast where the host himself will answer any personal correspondence.

The influential group [[The Weavers]], successor to the Almanac Singers, led by Pete Seeger, had a Jewish manager, and two of the four members of the group were Jewish (Gilbert and Hellerman). The B-side of "Good Night Irene" had the Hebrew folk song personally chosen for the record by Pete Seeger "[[Tzena, Tzena, Tzena]]".

The influential folk music magazine ''Sing Out!'' was co-founded and edited by [[Irwin Silber]] in 1951, and edited by him until 1967, when the magazine stopped publication for decades. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's first music critic [[Jon Landau]] is of German Jewish descent. Izzy Young who created the legendary<ref>Dylan, Seeger, Lomax, Cohen all either write whole songs about it, or spend considerable time praising it</ref> Folklore Center in New York, and currently the Folklore Centrum near Mariatorget in Södermalm, Sweden, which relates to American and Swedish folk music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Izzy Young: A folk man in Sweden defined by Dylan|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20100215/24996|website=The Local|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=2010-02-15}}</ref>

Dave Van Ronk observed that the behind the scenes 1950s folk scene "was at the very least 50 percent Jewish, and they adopted the music as part of their assimilation into the Anglo-American tradition which itself was largely an artificial construct but none the less provided us with some common ground".<ref>Dave von Ronk, ''The Mayor of Macdougal Street, A Folk Memoir'' p. 29</ref>
Nobel Prize winner [[Bob Dylan]] is also Jewish.

===Finance and law===
Jews have been involved in financial services since the colonial era. They received rights to trade fur, from the Dutch and Swedish colonies. British governors honored these rights after taking over. During the Revolutionary War, Haym Solomon helped create America's first semi-central bank, and advised Alexander Hamilton on the building of America's financial system.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

American Jews in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries played a major role in developing America's financial services industry, both at investment banks and with investment funds.<ref>"Banking and Bankers," '' Encyclopaedia Judaica. '' (2nd ed. 2008) [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_01978.html online]</ref> German Jewish bankers began to assume a major role in American finance in the 1830s when government and private borrowing to pay for canals, railroads and other [[internal improvements]] increased rapidly and significantly. Men such as [[August Belmont]] (Rothschild's agent in New York and a leading Democrat), Philip Speyer, [[Jacob Schiff]] (at Kuhn, Loeb & Company), [[Joseph Seligman]], [[Philip Lehman]] (of [[Lehman Brothers]]), [[Jules Bache]], and [[Marcus Goldman]] (of [[Goldman Sachs]]) illustrate this financial elite.<ref>[[Stephen Birmingham]], ''[[Our Crowd]]: The Great Jewish Families of New York'' (1967) pp. 8–9, 96–108, 128–42, 233–36, 331–37, 343,</ref> As was true of their non-Jewish counterparts, family, personal, and business connections, a reputation for honesty and integrity, ability, and a willingness to take calculated risks were essential to recruit capital from widely scattered sources. The families and the firms which they controlled were bound together by religious and social factors, and by the prevalence of intermarriage. These personal ties fulfilled real business functions before the advent of institutional organization in the 20th century.<ref>Vincent P.

Since the late 20th century, Jews have played a major role in the hedge fund industry, according to Zuckerman (2009).<ref>Bruce Zuckerman, ''The Jewish Role In American Life'' (2009) pp. 64, 70</ref> Thus [[SAC Capital Advisors]],<ref>Led by Steven Cohen; Bruce Zuckerman, ''The Jewish Role In American Life'' (2009) p. 71</ref> [[Soros Fund Management]],<ref>Bruce Zuckerman, ''The Jewish Role In American Life'' (2009) p. 72</ref> [[Och-Ziff Capital Management]],<ref>"Schechter school mourns founder Golda Och, 74" ''New Jersey Jewish News'' January 13, 2010</ref> [[GLG Partners]]<ref>"The 400 Richest Americans: No. 355 Noam Gottesman" ''Forbes'' Sept 17. 1008</ref> [[Renaissance Technologies]]<ref>Steven L.

Very few Jewish lawyers were hired by [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] ("WASP") upscale [[White-shoe firm|white-shoe law firms]], but they started their own. The WASP dominance in law ended when a number of major Jewish law firms attained elite status in dealing with top-ranked corporations. As late as 1950 there was not a single large Jewish law firm in New York City. However, by 1965 six of the 20 largest firms were Jewish; by 1980 four of the ten largest were Jewish.<ref>Eli Wald, "The rise and fall of the WASP and Jewish law firms."

====Federal Reserve====
[[Paul Warburg]], one of the leading advocates of the establishment of a [[central bank]] in the United States and one of the first governors of the newly established [[Federal Reserve System]], came from a prominent Jewish family in Germany.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''The Warburgs'' (1994) p. 26</ref> Since then, several Jews have served as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|chairmen]] of the Fed, including [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], [[Arthur F. Burns]], [[Alan Greenspan]], [[Ben Bernanke]] and [[Janet Yellen]].

===Science, business, and academia===
{{main|List of Jewish American scientists|List of Jewish American businesspeople|List of Jewish American academics}}

With the Jewish penchant to be drawn to white collar professional jobs and having excelled at intellectual pursuits, many Jews have also become been remarkably successful as an entrepreneurial and professional minority in the United States.<ref name="Frum, David"/>  Many Jewish [[family business]]es that are passed down from one generation to the next serve as an [[financial asset|asset]], source of income and layer a strong financial groundwork for the family's overall socioeconomic prosperity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/CHIN-01-100114.html| title=Common traits bind Jews and Chinese |publisher=Asia Times Online |date=January 10, 2014 | accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/2015/08/03/1483091/misconceptions-and-lessons-about-chinese-and-jewish-entrepreneurs |title=Misconceptions and lessons about Chinese and Jewish entrepreneurs |publisher=Lifestyle |date=August 3, 2015 |accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/the-chosen-few-a-new-explanati/ |title=The Chosen Few: A New Explanation of Jewish Success |publisher=PBS Newshour |date=April 18, 2013 |accessdate=4 July 2015 |author=Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4099803,00.html |title=How did American Jews get so rich? |publisher=YNetNews |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=4 July 2015 |author=Tani Goldstein}}</ref> Within the Jewish American cultural sphere, Jewish Americans have also developed a strong culture of entrepreneurship, for excellence in entrepreneurship and engagement in business and commerce is highly prized in Jewish culture.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/197643/why-are-so-many-pro-basketball-owners-jewish-like/?p=all |title=Why Are So Many Pro Basketball Owners Jewish (Like Donald Sterling)? |publisher=Forward |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=5 April 2015 |author=Josh Nathan-Kazis}}</ref> American Jews have also been drawn to various disciplines within academia such as physics, sociology, economics, psychology, mathematics, philosophy and linguistics (see [[Secular Jewish culture#Science and technology|Secular Jewish culture]] for some of the causes), and have played a disproportionate role in numerous academic domains. Jewish American intellectuals such as [[Saul Bellow]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Thomas Friedman]], and [[Elie Wiesel]] have made a major impact within mainstream American public life.

In the business world, it was found in 1995 that while Jewish Americans constituted less than 2.5 percent of the U.S. population, they occupied 7.7 percent of board seats at various U.S. [[corporations]].<ref name="Mother Jones, the Changing Power Elite, 1998">{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1998/03/new-power-elite |title=Mother Jones, the Changing Power Elite, 1998 |accessdate=January 20, 2007}}</ref> American Jews also have a strong presence in [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] ownership. Of the 30 teams in the NBA, there are 14 Jewish principal owners. Several Jews have served as NBA commissioners including prior NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] and current commissioner [[Adam Silver]].<ref name="auto1"/>

Since many careers in science, business, and academia generally pay well, Jewish Americans also tend to have a somewhat higher average income than most Americans. The 2000–2001 National Jewish Population Survey shows that the median income of a Jewish family is $54,000 a year ($5,000 more than the average family) and 34% of Jewish households report income over $75,000 a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46193|title=NJPS: Demography: Education, Employment and Income|work=jewishfederations.org|date=2001|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720145138/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46193|archive-date=July 20, 2013}}</ref>
