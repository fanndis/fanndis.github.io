'''HGTV''' (originally an [[initialism]] for '''Home & Garden Television''') is an American [[pay television]] channel that is owned by [[Discovery, Inc.]] The network primarily broadcasts [[reality television|reality]] programming related to [[home improvement]] and [[real estate]]. As of February 2015, approximately 95,628,000 American households (82.2% of households with television) receive HGTV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223220414/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2015|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref> In 2016, HGTV overtook [[CNN]] as the third most-watched cable channel in the United States, behind [[Fox News]] and [[ESPN]].<ref name="adage-hgtvupset">{{cite web|title=HGTV Will Never Upset You: How the Network Beat CNN in 2016|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-28/hgtv-will-never-upset-you-how-the-network-beat-cnn-in-2016|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>

==History==
Kenneth W. Lowe (then a radio executive with The [[E. W. Scripps Company]] and, subsequently, the [[chief executive officer]] of Scripps Networks Interactive) envisioned the concept of HGTV in 1992. With modest financial support from the E.W. Scripps corporate board, he purchased Cinetel, a small video production company in Knoxville, as the base and production hub of the new network. Lowe cofounded the channel with [[Susan Packard]].<ref name=Mink>{{cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/susan-packard-drove-home-hgtvs-culture-while-ratings-sprouted/|title=Susan Packard Drove Home HGTV's Culture While Ratings Sprouted|date=24 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2016/03/louisville-why-working-women-need-to-think-like.html|title=Susan Packard of HGTV and Scripps Networks Interactive shares advice at Business Women First event - Bizwomen|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>

Cinetel became Scripps Productions, but it found producing more than thirty programs simultaneously daunting. The organization brought in former [[CBS]] television executive Ed Spray, who implemented a system of producing (nearly all) programming through independent production houses around the United States. Burton Jablin, as Vice President of Programming, set the tone and oversaw the production of the early series. About 90 percent of the channel's programming consisted of original productions at launch, with ten percent licensed and rerun from Canadian channels, [[PBS]], and other sources.

Using local Scripps cable franchises (since divested), the [[Federal Communications Commission]] "[[must carry]]" provisions of Scripps medium-market television stations, and other small television operators to gain cable carriage, the channel launched on December 30, 1994. The major programming themes, unchanged since the beginning, were home building and remodeling, landscaping and gardening, decorating and design, and crafts and hobbies.

[[Image:HGTV Logo.svg|thumb|175px|left|HGTV logo used from December 30, 1994 to February 28, 2010.]]
During its development, the channel was originally named the '''Home, Lawn, and Garden Channel'''. The name was later shortened and a logo was developed. The logo was amended in 2010, with this version debuting on March 1 of that year. The square with the "G" in it was removed, the roof was increased in size and the "HGTV" letters are now set in [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham Black]] (from the original mixture of [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] and [[Times New Roman]]), with the other Gotham fonts being used around the network. The network debuted with a skeletal staff, but with gradual acceptance by other cable operators, it now reaches 94 million households in the United States and has either partner networks, or network interests, internationally elsewhere. It is now referred to simply as "HGTV"; the full name of the channel is de-emphasized.

In July 2008, the E.W. Scripps Company [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] the channel and the other Scripps cable channels and web-based properties into a separate company, [[Scripps Networks Interactive]]; E.W. Scripps broadcast television and newspaper properties remain as part of the original company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In December 2011, the channel began broadcasting all of its programming in [[16:9]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] format on its primary [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HGTV%20Goes%20HD,%20Makes%20Teranex%20Video%20Processors%20Its%20Standard.-a0144575823|title=HGTV Goes HD, Makes Teranex Video Processors Its Standard. - Free Online Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027055235/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HGTV%20Goes%20HD,%20Makes%20Teranex%20Video%20Processors%20Its%20Standard.-a0144575823|archive-date=27 October 2016|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> This results in the appearance of black bars on the top and bottom of the screen on 4:3 aspect ratio televisions; its [[high-definition television|high-definition]] channel displays the channel's programming in its native aspect ratio.

On March 6, 2018, [[Discovery Communications]] completed its merger with Scripps Networks Interactive and assumed control of HGTV, [[Food Network]] and [[Travel Channel]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Meg James |title=Discovery completes $12-billion takeover of Scripps Networks' Food, HGTV and Travel channels |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-discovery-scripps-merger-20180306-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Dade Hayes |title=Discovery Closes $14.6B Acquisition Of Scripps Networks Interactive |url=https://deadline.com/2018/03/discovery-closes-14-6b-acquisition-of-scripps-networks-interactive-1202312478/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{category see also|HGTV original programming}}
[[File:Peyton Lambton and Chris Lambton.jpg|thumb|right|At the February 23–25, 2018, Capital Remodel and Garden Show at the Dulles Expo Center, (l to r) Chris Lambton and Peyton Lambton]]
HGTV's current programming focuses primarily on home-buying, renovation, and [[reality show]]s following the business of house [[flipping]]. SNI CEO Ken Lowe stated of the programming strategy that "We're not going to surprise you. We're not going to throw you a curve ball. It's not easy to create content that people are passionate about and somewhat addicted to that is somewhat repetitive." As of 2016, HGTV has invested at least $400 million annually on original programming.<ref name="adage-hgtvupset" />

An annual promotion held by the network is the ''HGTV Dream Home'', a sweepstakes which awards a custom-built house as its grand prize.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.myplainview.com/news/article/HGTV-dream-homes-can-become-nightmares-for-winners-8614467.php|title=HGTV dream homes can become nightmares for winners|date=2005-06-23|work=Plainview Daily Herald|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>

=== High definition ===
The [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[simulcast]] feed of HGTV launched on March 31, 2008. Originally, the HD channel did not simulcast the standard definition feed of HGTV. Instead, the HD channel featured programming separate from the standard channel. The standard definition feed of the channel began to carry the full [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] downgraded from the HD feed in a [[letterbox]]ed format in early 2013.

==Carrier disputes==

===Cablevision===
On December 31, 2009, Scripps Networks Interactive removed the [[Food Network]] and HGTV from [[New York metropolitan area|New York City-area]] cable provider [[Cablevision]], on the day that its carriage contract was set to expire. After months of negotiations, an agreement between Scripps and Cablevision was not reached, prompting the removal of the two channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/01/cablevision-vs-scripps-battle-over-food-networkhgtv-could-last-weeks/|title=Cablevision vs Scripps Fight Over Food Network/HGTV Could Last Weeks Longer|first=Nikki|last=Finke|date=4 January 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> On January 21, 2010, Cablevision and Scripps reached a deal and the channels were restored to Cablevision's systems in the New York City area on the same day and by the next day in other areas.

===AT&T U-verse===
On November 5, 2010, [[AT&T U-verse]] dropped the [[DIY Network]], [[Cooking Channel]], Food Network, [[Great American Country]] and HGTV, due to a carriage dispute with Scripps Networks.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101108072805/http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/thestew/2010/11/atts-u-verse-drops-food-network-hgtv-and-other-scripps-networks.html "AT&T's U-verse Drops Food Network, HGTV and Other Scrippy-s Networks"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

== Controversies ==
On June 13, 2012, representatives for HGTV admitted that scenes featured in the original series ''[[House Hunters]]'' are mostly re-creations of prior events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/51277/nothing-gold-can-stay-hgtv-admits-house-hunters-is-partially-staged|title=Nothing Gold Can Stay: HGTV Admits House Hunters Is Partially Staged|first=Amos|last=Barshad|date=13 June 2012|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> In many cases, the final decision and purchase were made prior to filming. In some cases, homes visited were not even on the market.

In May 2014, HGTV decided not to premiere the [[The Benham Brothers|Benham Brothers]]' series ''Flip It Forward'' (which was created for the channel), due to a controversy regarding the Brothers' beliefs concerning homosexuality and [[Opposition to abortion|anti-abortion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/08/showbiz/tv/benham-brothers-hgtv/index.html|title=Benham brothers lose HGTV show after 'anti-gay' remarks|first=Lisa|last=Respers France|publisher=CNN|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-hgtv-drops-flip-it-forward-anti-gay-david-jason-benham-20140508-story.html|title=HGTV drops reality show starring anti-gay-marriage Christian activist|first=Meredith|last=Blake|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>
