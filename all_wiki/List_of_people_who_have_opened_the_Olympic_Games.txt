The [[Olympic Games]] are an international [[multi-sport event]] featuring both summer and winter sports, held every two years with Summer and Winter Olympic Games alternating. During [[Olympic Games ceremony#Opening|Olympic Games opening ceremonies]], the sitting president of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) will make a speech before inviting a representative from the host country to officially declare that particular Games open. The current [[Olympic Charter]] requires this person to be the [[head of state]] of the host country,<ref name="charter">
{{cite book|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Olympic%20Charter/Charter_en_2010.pdf|title=Olympic Charter|author=[[International Olympic Committee]]|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=6 November 2010|page=103}}</ref> although this has not always been the case. This article lists the people who have had the ceremonial duty to declare each Olympic Games open.

==Opening ceremony==
The IOC factsheet on the opening ceremony  states: "According to the Olympic Charter protocol, the duty of declaring the Games officially open falls to the head of state of the host country. Those who have performed this task are royalty and presidents, or their representatives, whether it was a vice-president, a member of the royal family, or a governor-general".<ref>[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Opening_ceremony_of_the_Games_of_the_Olympiad.pdf IOC Factsheet]</ref> Rule 56 of Chapter 5 of the Olympic Charter sets out the exact words that are to be declared by the person opening the Games. If at a [[Summer Olympic Games]], the words to be said are: <blockquote>I declare open the Games of [name of host city] celebrating the [number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era.<ref name="charter"/> </blockquote> When at a [[Winter Olympic Games]], the dignitary opening the Games is to proclaim: <blockquote>I declare open the [number of the Olympic Winter Games] Olympic Winter Games of [name of host city].<ref name="charter"/> </blockquote> However, this has not always been followed strictly; at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] the [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Michaëlle Jean]], used the format of a Summer Games declaration to open the Games by saying in French and English "I declare open the Games of Vancouver, celebrating the 21st Winter Olympic Games."<ref>{{cite news | title=Opening Ceremony: 2010 Winter Games declared open  |work=[[Agence France-Presse]]| date=12 February 2010|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/afp-news/opening-ceremony--2010-winter-games-declared-open_274384BS.html| accessdate=6 November 2010 }}</ref>
