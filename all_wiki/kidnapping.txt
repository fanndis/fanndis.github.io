{{Kidnapping}}
In [[criminal law]], '''kidnapping''' is the unlawful transportation, [[asportation]] and confinement of a person against their will. Thus, it is a composite crime. It can also be defined as false imprisonment by means of abduction, both of which are separate crimes that when committed simultaneously upon the same person merge as the single crime of kidnapping. The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear. That is, the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle, but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly, e.g., in the belief it is a taxicab.

Kidnapping may be done to demand for [[ransom]] in exchange for releasing the victim, or for other illegal purposes. Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping.<ref name="kidnapping">{{cite web |title=Definition of kidnapping    |id=''Sources:'' [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/kidnapping Cornell University Law School.] [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/kidnap Cambridge English Dictionary.] [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/kidnapping English Oxford Living Dictionaries.] [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kidnap Merriam-Webster Dictionary] |year=2017}}</ref>

Kidnapping of a child is also known as [[child abduction]], and these are sometimes separate legal categories.

Kidnapping of children is usually by one parent against the wishes of a parent or guardian. Kidnapping of adults is often for ransom or to force someone to withdraw money from an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], but may also be for the purpose of sexual assault.

In the past, and presently in some parts of the world (such as southern [[Sudan]]), kidnapping is a common means used to obtain [[slavery|slave]]s and money through ransom. In less recent times, kidnapping in the form of [[shanghai (verb)|shanghai]]ing (or "[[Impressment|pressganging]]") men was used to supply merchant ships in the 19th century with [[sailor]]s, whom the law considered [[unfree labour]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

* [[Bride kidnapping]] is a term often applied loosely, to include any bride "abducted" against the will of her parents, even if she is willing to marry the "abductor". It still is traditional amongst certain [[nomad]]ic peoples of [[Central Asia]]. It has seen a resurgence in [[Kyrgyzstan]] since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the subsequent erosion of women's rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/more4/documentaries/doc-feature.jsp?id=6&pageParam=2 |title=Bride Kidnapping - a Channel 4 documentary |publisher=Channel4.com}}</ref>

* [[Tiger kidnapping]] is taking a [[hostage]] to make a loved one or associate of the victim do something: e.g. a child is taken hostage to force the shopkeeper to open the safe. The term originates from the usually long preceding observation, like a tiger does on the prowl.

Kidnapping has sometimes been used by the family and friends of a member of an alleged [[Cult|cult]] as a method to remove the member from the alleged cult and begin a [[Deprogramming|deprogramming]] process. Deprogramming and [[Deprogramming#Exit counseling|exit counseling]] have been used with the purpose of getting alleged cult members to abandon their groups' beliefs. The danger presented by cult groups has been used by deprogrammers to justify using the extreme act of kidnapping to get alleged members to change their allegiance away from the group.<ref name="patrick-deprogramming">{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=Douglas|title=Tort Liability for Cult Deprogramming: ''Peterson v.

===Australia===
In Australia, kidnapping is a criminal offence, as defined by either the State crimes act, or the Commonwealth Criminal Code. It is a serious indictable offence, and is punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s86.html|title=CRIMES ACT 1900 - SECT 86 Kidnapping|website=www5.austlii.edu.au}}</ref>

===Canada===
[[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Kidnapping and Unlawful Confinement|Kidnapping]] that does not result in a [[Murder (Canadian law)|homicide]] is a [[hybrid offence]] that comes with a maximum possible penalty of [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]] (18 months if tried summarily). A murder that results from kidnapping is classified as 1st-degree, with a sentence of life imprisonment that results from conviction (the mandatory penalty for [[murder under Canadian law]]).

In all cases of kidnapping of children, where it is alleged that a child has been kidnapped, it is the absence of the consent of that child which is material. This is the case regardless of the age of the child. A very small child will not have the understanding or intelligence to consent. This means that absence of consent will be a necessary inference from the age of the child. It is a question of fact for the jury whether an older child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to consent.<ref name="R v D 1984 AC 778, HL">R v D [1984] AC 778, HL</ref> Lord Brandon said: "I should not expect a jury to find at all frequently that a child under fourteen had sufficient understanding and intelligence to give its consent."<ref>R v D [1984] AC 778 at 806, HL</ref> If the child (being capable of doing so) did consent to being taken or carried away, the fact that the person having custody or care and control of that child did not consent to that child being taken or carried away is immaterial.

===United States===
{{Main|Kidnapping in the United States}}
Law in the United States follows from English common law. Following the highly publicized 1932 [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], [[US Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Federal Kidnapping Act]], which authorized the [[FBI]] to investigate kidnapping at a time when the Bureau was expanding in size and authority. The fact that a kidnapped victim may have been taken across state lines brings the crime within the ambit of federal criminal law.

Most states recognize different types of kidnapping and punish accordingly; e.g., New York bases its definition of first-degree kidnapping on the duration and purpose.<ref>{{cite book |title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law |edition=2nd|author=The Gale Group |year=2008 |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/kidnapping |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> There are several deterrents to kidnapping in the United States of America. Among these are:

# The extreme logistical challenges involved in successfully exchanging the money for the return of the victim without being apprehended or surveiled.
# Harsh punishment. Convicted kidnappers face lengthy prison terms. If a victim is brought across state lines, federal charges can be laid as well.
# Good cooperation and information sharing between law enforcement agencies, and tools for spreading information to the public (such as the [[AMBER Alert]] system).

One notorious failed example of kidnap for ransom was the 1976 [[Chowchilla kidnapping|Chowchilla bus kidnapping]], in which 26 children were abducted with the intention of bringing in a $5 million ransom. The children and driver escaped from an underground van without the aid of law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/chowchilla_kidnap/index.html |title=Chowchilla kidnap, Crime Library website |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |date=1976-07-15 |accessdate=2012-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403043518/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/chowchilla_kidnap/index.html |archivedate=2014-04-03 }}</ref> According to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], kidnapping makes up 2% of all reported violent crimes against juveniles.<ref name="project.org"/>

From the 1990s on, the [[New York divorce coercion gang]] was involved in the kidnapping and torture of [[Jewish]] husbands in [[New York City]] and [[New Jersey]] for the purpose of forcing them to grant ''[[Get (divorce document)|gittin]]'' (religious divorces) to their wives.

According to a ''2003 Domestic Violence Report in Colorado'', out of a survey of 189 incidents, most people (usually white females) are taken from their homes or residence by a present or former spouse or significant other. They are usually taken by force, not by weapon, and usually the victims are not injured when they are freed.
