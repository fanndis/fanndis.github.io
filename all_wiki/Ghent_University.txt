'''Ghent University''' ({{lang-nl|Universiteit Gent}}, abbreviated as '''UGent''') is a [[Public university|public]] research [[university]] located in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. It was established in 1817 by [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. After the [[Belgian revolution]] of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer the university. In 1930, the university became the first [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking university in Belgium, whereas [[French language|French]] had previously been the standard academic language in what was '''''Université de Gand'''''. In 1991, it was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from ''State University of Ghent'' ({{lang-nl|Rijksuniversiteit Gent}}, abbreviated as ''RUG'') to its current designation.

In contrast to the [[KU Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] or the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel|Free University of Brussels]], UGent considers itself a ''pluralist'' university in a special sense, i.e. not connected to any particular religion or political ideology. Its motto '''Inter Utrumque''' ('In Between Both Extremes'), on the coat of arms, suggests the acquisition of wisdom and science comes only in an atmosphere of peace, when the institution is fully supported by the monarchy and fatherland.

Ghent University is one of the biggest [[Flanders|Flemish]] universities, consisting of 44,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The University also supports the [[Ghent University Library|University Library]] and the [[Ghent University Hospital|University Hospital]], which is one of the largest hospitals in Belgium. It is one of the greatest beneficiaries of funding from the [[Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)]]. Ghent University consistently rates among the top 100 universities in the world {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}.

== History ==
[[File:De plechtige installatie van de Universiteit van Gent door de prins van Oranje in de troonzaal van het stadhuis op 9 oktober 1817. Rijksmuseum SK-A-4088.jpeg|thumb|left|Painting of the establishment of the State University of Ghent in 1817 when the city was under Dutch rule]]

=== Foundation, in the 19th century ===
The university in Ghent was opened on October 9, 1817, with JC van Rotterdam serving as the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. In the first year, it had 190 students and 16 professors. The original four faculties consisted of Humanities (Letters), Law, Medicine and Science, and the language of instruction was [[Latin]]. The university was founded by [[King William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] as part of a policy to stem the intellectual and academic lag in the southern part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], later to become Belgium.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}
[[File:Onderzoek_farmacie_Ugent.jpg|left|thumb|Onderzoek farmacie Ugent]]
After peaking at a student population of 414, the number of students declined quickly following the [[Belgian Revolution]]. At this time, the Faculties of Humanities and Science were broken from the university, but they were restored five years later, in 1835.
Ghent University played a role in the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Friedrich [[August Kekulé]] (7 September 1829 – 13 July 1896) unraveled the structure of benzene at Ghent and [[Adolf von Baeyer]] (Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer), a student of [[August Kekulé]], made contributions to organic chemistry.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In 1882, Sidonie Verhelst became the first female student at the university.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

French became the language of instruction, taking the place of Latin, after the 1830 Revolution. In 1903, the Flemish politician [[Lodewijk De Raet]] led a successful campaign to begin instruction in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and the first courses were begun in 1906.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

=== Developments since the 20th century ===
[[File:Ghent University 1910 - Studentenvereniging Société Académique d'Histoire.jpg|thumb|Ghent University 1910 – Studentenvereniging Société Académique d'Histoire|alt=|left]]During [[World War I]], the occupying German administration conducted ''[[Flamenpolitik]]'' and turned Ghent University into the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. A Flemish Institute (''Vlaemsche Hoogeschool''), commonly known as [[Von Bissing University]], was founded in 1916 but was disestablished after the war and French language was fully reinstated. In 1923, Cabinet Minister [[Pierre Nolf]] put forward a motion to definitively establish the university as a Dutch-speaking university, and this was realized in 1930. [[August Vermeylen]] served as the first rector of a Dutch-language university in Belgium.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,880570,00.html A Language Come Back], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', April 28, 1923</ref>

In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the German administration of the university attempted to create a German orientation, removing faculty members and installing loyal activists.[[File:Universiteitsforum 2010PM 0603 21H7975.JPG|alt=|thumb|Universiteitsforum 2010PM 0603 21H7975]]After the war, the university became a much larger institution, following government policy of democratizing higher education in Flanders during the 1950s and 1960s. By 1953, there were more than 3,000 students, and by 1969 more than 11,500. The number of faculties increased to eleven, starting with Applied Sciences in 1957. It was followed by Economics and Veterinary Medicine in 1968, Psychology and Pedagogy, as well as Bioengineering, in 1969, and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The faculty of Politics and Social Sciences is the most recent addition, in 1992. In the 1960s to 1980s, there were several [[student activism|student demonstrations]] at Ghent University, notably around the [[Blandijn]] site, which houses the Faculty of Arts & Philosophy.<ref>{{cite web

In 1991, the university officially changed its name from ''Rijksuniversiteit Gent'' (RUG) to ''Universiteit Gent'' (UGent), following an increased grant of autonomy by the government of the [[Flemish Community]].
