'''''The San Diego Union-Tribune''''' is an American metropolitan [[daily newspaper]], published in [[San Diego]], [[California]].

Its name derives from a 1992 merger between the two major daily newspapers at the time, ''The San Diego Union'' and the ''San Diego Evening Tribune''. The name changed to '''''U-T San Diego''''' in 2012 but was changed again to ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'' in 2015.<ref name = "Beutner">{{cite news |last= Beutner |first=  Austin |url= http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/may/21/tribune-sale-letter-readers-austin-beutner/ |title= LA Times, Union-Tribune Combine Forces |work= The San Diego Union-Tribune |date= March 15, 2015}}</ref> In 2015, it was acquired by [[Tribune Publishing]].

===Platinum Equity===
On August 17, 2010, the ''Union-Tribune'' changed its design to improve "clarity, legibility, and ease of use". Changes included being printed on thinner, 100 percent recycled paper, moving the comics to the back of the business section, and abbreviating the title ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'' on the front page to ''U-T San Diego''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Apple |first=Charles |url=http://apple.copydesk.org/2010/08/17/san-diego-union-tribune-launches-redesign/ |title=San Diego Union-Tribune Launches Redesign |publisher=Apple.copydesk.org |date=August 17, 2010 |access-date=October 31, 2010}}</ref> The ''U-T'' nameplate was created by Jim Parkinson, a [[type designer]] who also created nameplates for ''[[The Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[Newsweek]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last= Vore |first= Adrian |url= http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/may/26/whats-in-a-nameplate-a-lot-actually/ |title= What's in a Nameplate?

The purchase price was reportedly in excess of $110 million.<ref name = "sold">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/business/media/san-diego-union-tribune-sold-to-hotelier-for-more-than-100-million.html |title= ''San Diego Union-Tribune'' Sold to Hotelier for More Than $100 Million |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= November 17, 2011}}</ref> Manchester built two landmark downtown hotels, the [[Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel]] and the [[San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina]].

[[File:The San Diego Union-Tribune (2012-08-13).svg|thumb|Logo between 2012 and 2015|100px]]
On January 3, 2012, the newspaper announced that it would use the name ''U-T San Diego'' "on all of our media products and communications"; the newspaper's website (formerly called "SignOn San Diego" and available under SignOnSanDiego.com) would use the name UTSanDiego.com.  The official announcement explained the change as being intended to "unify our print and digital products under a single brand with a clear and consistent expectation of quality".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/jan/03/our-readers-ut-san-diego/ |title= To Our Readers |work= UTSanDiego.com |date= January 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Dan |last=  Walters |url= http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2012/01/san-diego-union-tribune-becomes-u-t-san-diego.html |title= San Diego Union-Tribune Becomes 'U-T San Diego' |work= [[The Sacramento Bee]] |date= January 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author-link= Jim Romenesko |first= Jim |last= Romenesko |url= http://jimromenesko.com/2012/01/03/san-diego-union-tribune-becomes-u-t-san-diego/ |title= ''San Diego Union-Tribune'' Becomes ''U-T San Diego'' | publisher = JimRomanesko.com |date= January 3, 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, ''U-T San Diego'' launched [[U-T TV]], a television [[news channel]]. The network featured news, lifestyle, and editorial content produced by the newspaper's staff, and was created as part of the newspaper's growing emphasis on multi-platform content under Manchester. On February 20, 2014, U-T TV was dropped from cable, lack crusial carriage from Time Warner Cable. The channel remaining staff was retained to produce video content for the newspaper's digital properties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=U-T TV Goes Dark|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/u-t-tv-goes-dark/129288|work= [[Broadcasting & Cable]] |access-date=February 20, 2014|date=February 20, 2014}}</ref>

===Tribune Publishing ownership===
On May 7, 2015, it was announced that the [[Tribune Publishing Company]], publisher of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and other newspapers, had reached a deal to acquire ''U-T San Diego'' and its associated properties for $85 million. The sale ended the newspaper's 146 years of private ownership. The transaction was completed on May 21, 2015. On the same date, the newspaper reintroduced its previous branding as  ''The San Diego Union-Tribune''.<ref name = "Beutner" />

The ''Union-Tribune'' and the ''Los Angeles Times'' became part of a new operating entity known as the California News Group, with both newspapers led by ''Times'' publisher and chief executive officer [[Austin Beutner]]. The two newspapers reportedly would retain distinct operations, but there would be a larger amount of synergy and content sharing between them.

The acquisition did not include the newspaper's headquarters, which was retained by Manchester and would be leased by the newspaper.<ref name=uts-tribunebuy>{{cite news |title= $85M Deal to Combine ''U-T'', ''LA Times'' |url= http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/may/07/tribune-buys-sandiego-newspaper/ |work= U-T San Diego |date= May 7, 2015 |access-date= May 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=lat-utbuy>{{cite news |title= L.A.

On May 26, 2015, the newspaper announced it would [[layoff|lay off]] 178 employees, representing about thirty percent of the total staff, as it consolidated its printing operations with the ''Times'' in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pfeifer |first=Stuart |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-union-tribune-layoffs-20150527-story.html |title=San Diego Union-Tribune Lays Off 178, Mostly in Printing, Delivery |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 27, 2015 |access-date=May 27, 2015 }}</ref> In 2016, ''The San Diego Union Tribune'' acquired the monthly entertainment magazine ''Pacific San Diego''.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Union Tribune Acquires Pacific San Diego Magazine| access-date = 2018-06-23| url = https://www.sandiegoville.com/2016/06/union-tribune-acquires-pacific-san.html}}</ref> On June 13, 2015, at 10:02&nbsp;p.m. PDT the final run of ''The San Diego Union Tribune'' was printed at the San Diego headquarters in Mission Valley began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jun/15/ut-presses-cease-printing/|title=End of an era: U-T presses cease|first=Michele|last=Parente|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> It was to print the Sunday edition newspaper for June 14, 2015. The following Monday's newspaper would be printed at the ''Los Angeles Times'' location. The dismantling of the printing presses in Mission Valley began in mid-September 2015.

===Purchase by Patrick Soon-Shiong===
In February 2018, a deal was reached to sell the ''Union-Tribune'' to [[Patrick Soon-Shiong]], a medical doctor who has made billions as a biotech entrepreneur. The deal also included the ''Los Angeles Times'' and multiple community newspapers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/economy/sd-me-billionaire-owners-20180208-story.html|title=New U-T, Times owner joins ranks of billionaire buyers|last=Wilkens|first=John|date=February 11, 2018|newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> The sale closed on June 18, 2018.<ref name="Soon-Shiong" />

==Headquarters==
The newspaper was originally located in Old Town San Diego, and was moved to [[downtown San Diego]] in 1871. In 1973, it moved to a custom-built, brick and stone office and printing plant complex in [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]].

The newspaper moved back downtown in May 2016, to offices on the 9th through 12th floors of a tower at 600 B Street. The Union-Tribune is to be the named tenant of the building, replacing Bridgepoint Education and, before that, Comerica.<ref>{{cite news |last=Showley |first=Roger |date=May 16, 2016 |title=U-T: Back downtown |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/may/16/union-tribune-downtown/ |newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune |location=San Diego, CA |access-date=June 4, 2016 }}</ref>

==Criticisms==

===Copleys and Platinum Equity===
Under the Copleys' ownership, the newspaper had a reliably conservative editorial position, endorsing almost exclusively [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for elective office, and sometimes refusing to interview or cover [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates.

Under Platinum Equity, the newspaper's editorial position "skewed closer to the middle" and showcased multiple viewpoints.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/7931|title=Media Watchdog: Union Tribune Sale Raises Media Ethics Concerns|last=Raftery|first=Miriam|date=November 20, 2011|work=East County Magazine|access-date=June 9, 2013}}</ref>

===Manchester and Lynch===
When Manchester and business partner [[John Lynch (radio)|John Lynch]] took ownership in 2011, they were open about their desire to use the newspaper to "promote their agenda of downtown development and politically conservative causes",<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theblaze.com/stories/san-diego-media-baron-expands-business-to-promote-conservatism |first= Becket |last= Adams |title= San Diego Media Baron Expands Business to Promote Conservatism | publisher = [[The Blaze]] |date= October 22, 2012}}</ref> with Lynch stating on [[KPBS-FM|KPBS]] radio that he and Manchester "wanted to be cheerleaders for all that is good in San Diego".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/nov/17/union-tribune-sold-doug-manchester/ |last= Sharma |first= Anita |title= Developer Doug Manchester Buys Union-Tribune |publisher= [[KPBS-FM]] |date= November 17, 2011}}</ref> Lynch expanded on this position in 2012, saying "We make no apologies. We are doing what a newspaper ought to do, which is to take positions. We are very consistent—pro-conservative, pro-business, pro-military—and we are trying to make a newspaper that gets people excited about this city and its future."<ref name="pulpit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/business/media/san-diego-union-tribune-open-about-its-pro-business-motives.html?_r=0|title=Newspaper as Business Pulpit|last=Carr|first=David|date=June 10, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 8, 2013}}</ref>

This open promotion of certain viewpoints resulted in criticism from journalism professors and other newspaper editors, who worried that negative news about topics such as the military and business might not be covered.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/sep/11/its-official-u-t-san-diego-buying-north-county-tim/  |first1= Erik |last1= Anderson |first2= Megan |last2= Burke |first3= Maureen |last3= Cavanaugh |first4= Peggy |last4= Pico |agency= City News Service |title= It's Official: ''U-T San Diego'' Is Buying ''North County Times'' |publisher= [[KPBS-TV]] |date= September 11, 2012}}</ref> Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at [[Point Loma Nazarene University]], argued, "Now if you're saying we're going to be the cheerleaders of the military, why would you report on this guy that's taking bribes?... Where's the cheerleading there?" a reference to the ''Union-Tribune'''s [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning coverage of the [[Duke Cunningham]] bribery scandal.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/economy/article_df889cac-fc78-11e1-a1ec-0019bb2963f4.html |last= Davis |first= Rob |title= Manchester Consolidates Power with Second Newspaper Buy |work= [[Voice of San Diego]] |date= September 11, 2012}}</ref> A ''[[New York Times]]'' writer added, "There is a growing worry that the falling value and failing business models of many American newspapers could lead to a situation where moneyed interests buy papers and use them to prosecute a political and commercial agenda. That future appears to have arrived in San Diego."<ref name = "pulpit" />

Lynch said, "We totally respect the journalistic integrity of our paper and there is a clear line of demarcation between our editorials and our news. Our editor, Jeff Light, calls the shots." However, in November 2011 Lynch told the sports editor that the sports pages should advocate for a new football stadium; when a longtime sportswriter wrote skeptically about the idea, he was fired.<ref name = "pulpit" />

====Downtown redevelopment====
In January 2012, two months after Manchester bought the ''U-T'', the newspaper featured a front-page proposal for downtown redevelopment, to include a downtown football stadium and an expansion of the [[San Diego Convention Center]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/jan/22/think-big-think-big-new-vision-needed-for/|type= Editorial |title= Think Big: New Vision Needed for Downtown Waterfront|date=January 22, 2012|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=June 9, 2013}}</ref> Both properties are adjacent to hotels that Manchester owns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougmanchester.com/|title=Papa Doug Manchester | publisher = dougmanchester.com |access-date=June 9, 2013}}</ref>

In September 2012, ''[[Investigative Newsource]]'' reporter Brooke Williams obtained articles that claimed Lynch "threatened" Port Commissioner [[Scott Peters (politician)|Scott Peters]], who was running for Congress, "with a newspaper campaign to dismantle the Unified [[Port of San Diego]]". In e-mails obtained by Williams, Lynch was quoted as indicating that if the [[Dole Food Company]] obtained a long-term contract, that the Port's independence governance would be questioned in editorial coverage. Williams said the effort showed "the extent to which the newspaper's new owners will go to push their vision for a football stadium on the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal",<ref>{{cite news |url= http://inewsource.org/port-commissioner-the-ut-is-coming-after-us/ |title= Port Commissioner: 'The UT Is Coming After Us,' |work= Investigative Newsource |date= September 27, 2012}}</ref>

====Endorsements and polling====
During the [[2012 San Diego mayoral election|2012 mayoral election]] the owners of the ''U-T'' donated to Republican City Council Member [[Carl DeMaio]]'s campaign,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://voiceofsandiego.org/2012/10/22/the-head-spinning-polls-in-the-mayors-race/ |first= Scott |last= Lewis |title= The Head-Spinning Polls in the Mayor's Race |work= [[Voice of San Diego]] |date= October 22, 2012}}</ref> and the newspaper ran several prominent editorials favoring DeMaio. Those endorsements were wrapped around the front section of the newspaper on a separate page, "as though they were even more important" than the front page.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voiceofsandiego.org/2012/09/11/the-two-faces-of-papa-doug/|title=The Two Faces of Papa Doug|last=Lewis|first=Scott|date=September 11, 2012|work= [[Voice of San Diego]] |access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref>

In October 2012, a poll was taken by the ''U-T'' asking respondents to choose between DeMaio and Democratic Congressman [[Bob Filner]] in the mayoral election to be held in November. A rival news outlet noted that  "Employees of a newspaper, television / radio station, marketing / public opinion research company or the city of San Diego—or who live with someone employed in one of those fields" were excluded from the poll results, which showed the Republican leading the Democrat, 46 percent to 36 percent. Reporter [[Kelly Davis (reporter)|Kelly Davis]] of SDCityBeat.com wrote: "Common sense dictates that those votes [by city employees or those living with them] would swing in Filner's favor due to DeMaio's long-running feud with city-employee unions." But ''U-T'' assignment editor Michael Smolens replied that "city employees were excluded to avoid political entanglements" in other parts of the ballot as well as in the mayor's race.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/blog-100000004-why-were-city-employees-excluded-from-the-u-t-mayoral-poll.html |first=Kelly |last= Davis |title= Why Were City Employees Excluded from the U-T Mayoral Poll? |work= San Diego CityBeat |date= October 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.utsandiego.com/mayoral_poll1021] Poll results</ref> Despite the newspaper's efforts, DeMaio lost to Filner.
