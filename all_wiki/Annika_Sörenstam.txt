'''Annika Sörenstam''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈǎnːɪka ˈsœ̂ːrɛnˌstam|pron|sv-Annika Sörenstam.ogg}}; born 9 October 1970) is a retired Swedish [[professional golfer]].

The winner of a record eight [[LPGA Tour#LPGA Tour awards|Player of the Year]] awards, and six [[LPGA Tour#LPGA Tour awards|Vare Trophies]] given to the LPGA player with the lowest seasonal scoring average, she is the only female golfer to shoot a 59 in competition. She holds various all-time scoring records including the lowest season scoring average: 68.6969 in 2004.

Representing Europe in the [[Solheim Cup]] on eight occasions between 1994 and 2007, Sörenstam was the event's [[List of European Solheim Cup golfers#Record European point winners|all-time leading points earner]] until her record was surpassed by England's [[Laura Davies]] during the [[2011 Solheim Cup]]. Sörenstam also was captain of the [[2017 Solheim Cup|2017]] European Solheim Cup team.

In 2003, Sörenstam played in the [[Bank of America Colonial]] tournament to become the first woman to play in a [[PGA Tour]] event since 1945.

On 2 December 2020, she was appointed president of the [[International Golf Federation]] from 1 January 2021.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/golf/annika-sorenstam-succeed-peter-dawson-igf-president-3055999 |title=Annika Sörenstam to succeed Peter Dawson as IGF president |newspaper=The Scotsman |first=Martin |last=Dempster |date=3 December 2020 |accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

==Childhood and amateur career==
She was born in [[Bro, Stockholm|Bro]] near [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].<ref name="Golf Annika's Way">Annika Sörenstam with the editors of Golf Magazine: ''Golf Annika's Way'', Gotham Books, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59240-076-0}}</ref> Sörenstam's father Tom was an [[IBM]] executive and her mother Gunilla worked in a bank.

As a child, Sörenstam was a talented all-round sports girl. She was a nationally ranked junior [[tennis]] player, played [[association football]] (soccer) in her hometown team Bro IK, and was such a good [[Alpine skiing|skier]] that the coach of the Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to northern Sweden to improve her skiing year round.<ref name="Golf Annika's Way"/><ref>Claes Lind with Annika Sörenstam, ''Våga bli bäst'' or ''Dare to be the Best'', Sportförlaget i Europa AB, 2003, {{ISBN|91-88541-56-8}}</ref><ref name="Red">{{cite web

===Junior golf===
The Sörenstam family began playing golf at Viksjö Golf Club in [[Jakobsberg]], north of Stockholm and later switched to nearby Bro-Bålsta Golf Club, opened in 1980, initially with a 9-hole course. At the age of 12, Annika shared her first set of golf clubs with her sister. Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even - and earned her first handicap of 54.<ref name="Golf Annika's Way"/> 

At the [[European Tour]] tournament [[Scandinavian Enterprise Open]] in Stockholm in July 1986, she tried to be a volunteer caddie and was asked to stand in a line with all other candidates. When all male volunteer caddies finally had been chosen by the tournament professionals, three teen-age girls were left without a bag yet. It was Annika, Charlotta and [[Fanny Sunesson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/after-20-years-it-s-definitely-her-bag-1.1009795 |title=After 20 years, it's definitely her bag |newspaper=Irish Times |location=Dublin, Ireland |date=May 30, 2006}}</ref>

She was so shy as a junior, she used to deliberately three-putt at the end of a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech.<ref name="ACAD3">

In 2008, Sörenstam was highly critical of other female golfers who tried to play in the PGA Tour – her comments to [[Michelle Wie]] for playing on the men's tour: "I really don't know why Michelle continues to do this.

===Solheim Cup captaincy===
At the [[2013 Solheim Cup]] at the [[Colorado Golf Club]] in [[Parker, Colorado]], United States, Sörenstam participated as a non-playing assistant captain, selected by European Team captain [[Liselotte Neumann]]. During the match, an incident with Sörenstam involved, occurred. The Americans accused Sörenstam of telling a European caddie that European player [[Jodi Ewart-Shadoff]] should concede a putt for par to [[Paula Creamer]], so it could not show teammate [[Lexi Thompson]] the line for a coming putt. By the rules, only the captain were allowed to give advice to players during the competition. In the end, the 2013 match became an 18–10 triumph for the European team, winning on American soil for the first time and defending the cup for the first time. 

For the [[2015 Solheim Cup]] at [[Golf Club St. Leon-Rot]], [[Germany]], Sörenstam again was appointed an assistant captain by a Swedish European Team captain, this time [[Carin Koch]]. Two controversies with Sörenstam involved, given a lot of public attention, occurred during the match. The second day afternoon four-ball match between [[Suzann Pettersen]] and [[Charley Hull]] for Europe against [[Alison Lee]] and [[Brittany Lincicome]], United States, was all square, when Lee missed a putt to win the 17th hole. Taking for granted that the next 18-inch putt was conceded, Lee picked up her ball. However, Pettersen pointed out that it was not conceded, and the Europeans won the hole. Koch and Sörenstam tried to convince Pettersen to change her mind and concede the putt, but as it was a fact that Lee had picked up her ball without the putt being given to her, it was not a possibility within the [[rules of golf]], for the players to agree on the outcome of the hole and change the sequence of events afterwards. Pettersen/Hull eventually won the match.

Later during the 2015 Solheim Cup, after Koch and Sörenstam was seen in a discussion with U.S. captain [[Juli Inkster]], Sörenstam explained that she was accused of giving advice, which she strongly denied.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sorenstam: 'I was wrongly accused of giving advice' |url=https://www.golfchannel.com/article/golf-central-blog/sorenstam-i-was-wrongly-accused-giving-advice |work=Golf Channel |first=Randall |last=Mell |date=21 September 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2020}}</ref> The 2015 match ended in a U.S. win 14½–13½, after a strong American come-back the last day, said to have been inspired by the incident with the not conceded putt.

Sörenstam was appointed captain of the [[2017 Solheim Cup|2017]] European Solhem Cup team. The match, played at [[Des Moines Golf and Country Club]], [[Iowa]], United States, was won by the U.S. team 16½–11½.

==Business career==
Sörenstam began the transition from professional golfer to entrepreneur during the later years of her career, attempting to combine golf, fitness and charitable works into various businesses under the ANNIKA brand with the brand statement "Share my Passion". They are all promoted by her website on which there is a blog to which she and her staff regularly contribute.<ref name="Passion2">
