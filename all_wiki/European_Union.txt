The EU and [[Citizenship of the European Union|European citizenship]] were established when the [[Maastricht Treaty]] came into force in 1993.{{sfn|Craig |De Burca|2011|page=15}} The EU traces its origins to the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) and the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] and 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]]. The original members of what came to be known as the [[European Communities]] were the [[Inner Six]]: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and [[West Germany]]. The Communities and their successors have grown in size by [[enlargement of the European Union|the accession of new member states]] and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], came into force in 2009.

{{Main|Ideas of European unity before 1945}}

During the centuries following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in 476, several European states viewed themselves as ''[[translatio imperii]]'' ("transfer of rule") of the defunct [[Roman Empire]]: the [[Frankish Empire]] (481–843) and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962–1806) were thereby attempts to resurrect [[Western Roman Empire|Rome in the West]].{{efn|The Frankish Empire has had a symbolic relevance for the building of Europe since the 20th century: [[Charlemagne]] is often regarded as the "Father of Europe" and a similarity between the borders of Charlemagne's Empire and that of the [[European Economic Community]] was made explicit during the 1965 Aachen exhibition sponsored by the Council of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Story|first=Joanna|title=Charlemagne: Empire and Society|date=2005|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-7089-1|location=|pages=2–3}}</ref> Kikuchi Yoshio (菊池良生) of&nbsp;[[Meiji University]]&nbsp;suggested that the notion of&nbsp;[[Holy Roman Empire]]&nbsp;as a federal political entity influenced the later structural ideas of the European Union.<ref>{{cite book|title=神聖ローマ帝国|last1=Kikuchi (菊池)|first1=Yoshio (良生)|year=2003|isbn=978-4-06-149673-6|page=264}}</ref>|name=|group=}} This political philosophy of a supra-national rule over the continent, similar to the example of the ancient Roman Empire, resulted in the early Middle Ages in the concept of a ''[[Renovatio imperii Romanorum|renovatio imperii]]'' ("restoration of the empire"),<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Patrick|last=Corbet|title=Renovatio imperii romanorum|encyclopedia=Oxford Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages|editor=Vauchez|publisher=James Clarke & Co.|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780227679319.001.0001/acref-9780227679319-e-2403|date=2002|editor-first=André|editor-link=André Vauchez|isbn=978-0227679319}}</ref> either in the forms of the ''Reichsidee'' ("imperial idea")<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schramm|first=Percy E.|title=Kaiser, Rom und Renovatio; Studien zur Geschichte des römischen Erneuerungsgedankens vom Ende des karolingischen Reiches bis zum Investiturstreit.|date=1957|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft|year=|isbn=|location=Darmstadt|pages=143|language=German|oclc=15021725}}</ref> or the religiously inspired ''Imperium Christianum'' ("christian empire").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Folz|first=Robert|title=The concept of empire in Western Europe from the fifth to the fourteenth century|date=1969|publisher=Edward Arnold|year=|isbn=978-0-7131-5451-1|location=London|pages=65|oclc=59622}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gorp|first1=Bouke Van|last2=Renes|first2=Hans|date=2007|title=A European Cultural Identity?

During the [[interwar period]], the consciousness that national markets in Europe were interdependent though confrontational, along with the observation of a larger and growing US market on the other side of the ocean, nourished the urge for the economic integration of the continent.{{sfn|Kaiser|Varsori|2010|p=140}} In 1920, advocating the creation of a European [[economic union]], British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] wrote that "a Free Trade Union should be established ... to impose no protectionist tariffs whatever against the produce of other members of the Union."<ref>John Maynard Keynes, ''Economic Consequences of the Peace'', New York: Harcourt, Brace & Howe, 1920, pp. 265–66.</ref> During the same decade, [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], one of the first to imagine of a modern political union of Europe, founded the [[Paneuropean Union|Pan-Europa Movement]].{{sfn|Rosamond|2000|pp=21–22}} His ideas influenced his contemporaries, among which then [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Aristide Briand]].

It also led directly to the founding of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949, the first great effort to bring the nations of Europe together, initially ten of them. The Council focused primarily on values—human rights and democracy—rather than on economic or trade issues, and was always envisaged as a forum where sovereign governments could choose to work together, with no supra-national authority. It raised great hopes of further European integration, and there were fevered debates in the two years that followed as to how this could be achieved.

In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which created the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and established a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]]. They also signed another pact creating the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) for co-operation in developing [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Both treaties came into force in 1958.<ref name="Europa History 45-59"/>

The EEC and Euratom were created separately from the ECSC and they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by [[Walter Hallstein]] ([[Hallstein Commission]]) and Euratom was headed by [[Louis Armand]] ([[Armand Commission]]) and then [[Étienne Hirsch]]. Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_atomic_energy_community-en-19bc7f11-bea1-49c7-b534-18327c303f41.html |title=A European Atomic Energy Community |publisher=Cvce.eu |date=13 October 1997 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_customs_union-en-a11a5f17-d744-479e-ba75-2c70b6058608.html|title=A European Customs Union|work=cvce.eu|year=2016}}</ref>

During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power.

In 2004, the EU saw [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|its biggest enlargement to date]] when [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]] joined the Union.<ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web|title=A decade of further expansion |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211143505/http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 February 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Lisbon Treaty (2007{{ndash}}present)===
In 2007, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] became EU members. Later that year, [[Slovenian euro coins|Slovenia]] adopted the euro,<ref name="Europa History 00"/> followed by [[Cypriot euro coins|Cyprus]] and [[Maltese euro coins|Malta]] in 2008, [[Slovak euro coins|Slovakia]] in 2009, [[Estonian euro coins|Estonia]] in 2011, [[Latvian euro coins|Latvia]] in 2014, and [[Lithuania euro coins|Lithuania]] in 2015.

On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the [[Three pillars of the European Union|EU three pillars]] system into a single legal entity provisioned with a [[legal personality]], created a permanent [[President of the European Council]], the first of which was [[Herman Van Rompuy]], and strengthened the position of the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]].{{sfn|Piris|2010|page=448}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=6266|title=European Parliament announces new President and Foreign Affairs Minister|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>

Christians in the European Union are divided among members of Catholicism (both [[Latin Church|Roman]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]]), numerous [[Protestant]] denominations ([[Anglicans]], [[Lutherans]], and [[Reformed]] forming the bulk of this category), and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

Through successive [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargements]], the European Union has grown from the [[Inner Six|six founding states]] (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to the current {{EUnum}}. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]], thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pooled-sovereignty|title=Answers {{ndash}} The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com|accessdate=12 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120091030/http://www.answers.com/topic/pooled-sovereignty|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=EU institutions and other bodies |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm |publisher=Europa |accessdate=4 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601191547/http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm |archivedate=1 June 2009 |df= }}</ref>

To become a member, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning [[market economy]]; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law.

Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] (north-east Europe) to tropical ([[French Guiana]]), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or [[hemiboreal]] climate (Northern [[Balkans]] and Central Europe).<ref name="Humid Continental climate">{{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |title=Humid Continental Climate |year=2007 |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |work=The physical environment |accessdate=29 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530170321/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |archivedate=30 May 2007}}</ref>

The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants living in [[urban area]]s as of 2006.

Constitutionally, the EU bears some resemblance to both a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]],<ref>Kiljunen, Kimmo (2004). The European Constitution in the Making.

Routledge. p. 49. {{ISBN|0-415-22647-3}}. "Our theoretical analysis suggests that the EC/EU is neither a federation nor a confederation in the classical sense.

(It does not have a formal constitution: its status is defined by the [[Treaty of European Union]] and the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]).

This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called ''Kompetenz-kompetenz''); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of [[subsidiarity]] requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined.

The European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]]: the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Council]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.

EU policy is in general promulgated by [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]], which are then implemented in the [[Sovereignty|domestic legislation]] of its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], and [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]], which are immediately enforceable in all member states. [[Lobbying#European Union|Lobbying]] at EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130558/LDM_BRI(2013)130558_REV1_EN.pdf |title=EU Library Briefing:Lobbying the EU institutions |work=Europarl |access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>

====European Council====<!-- Heads of state -->
{{Main|European Council}}

[[File:Charles Michel (49467991288).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[President of the European Council]], [[Charles Michel]]]]
The '''European Council''' gives political direction to the EU. It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the [[President of the European Council]] (currently [[Charles Michel]]), the [[President of the European Commission]] and one representative per [[member state of the European Union|member state]] (either its [[head of state]] or [[head of government]]). The [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] (currently [[Josep Borrell]]) also takes part in its meetings. It has been described by some as the Union's "supreme political authority".<ref name="How work">{{cite web|title=How does the EU work|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|accessdate=12 July 2007}}</ref> It is actively involved in the negotiation of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaty changes]] and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.

The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a "[[head of state|collective head of state]]" and [[ratification|ratifies]] important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aMsWxEnaqrUC&pg=PA146 ''With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective''] Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146:<br />''Fourth, the European Council acts a "collective head of state" for the EU.''</ref>

The European Council should not be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]], an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg.

One of the 27 is the [[President of the European Commission]] ([[Ursula von der Leyen]] for 2019{{ndash}}2024), [[President of the European Commission#Appointment|appointed by the European Council]], subject to the Parliament's approval. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], who is ''ex-officio'' a [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-President of the Commission]] and is also chosen by the European Council.<ref>[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|Treaty on European Union: Article 17:7]]</ref> The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the [[Council of the European Union]] in agreement with the nominated President. The 27 Commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by vote of the [[European Parliament]].

In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the Union. Examples of such alliances include the [[Visegrad Group]], [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]], the [[New Hanseatic League]], the [[Weimar Triangle]], the [[Lublin Triangle]], [[EU Med Group]] and the [[Craiova Group]].

The '''European Parliament''' is one of three [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative institutions]] of the EU, which together with the [[Council of the European Union]] is tasked with amending and approving the [[European Commission|Commission]]'s proposals.
The 705 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly [[Elections in the European Union|elected]] by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years on the basis of [[proportional representation]]. MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]] where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wellfire Interactive |url=http://www.fairvote.org/european-parliament-to-be-elected-with-proportional-representation-systems |title=MEPs must be elected on the basis of proportional representation, the threshold must not exceed 5%, and the electoral area may be subdivided in constituencies if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the voting system |publisher=Fairvote.org |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref>

In the [[ordinary legislative procedure]], the European Commission proposes legislation, which requires the joint approval of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pass. This process applies to nearly all areas, including the [[budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. The Parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]]. The [[President of the European Parliament]] (currently [[David Sassoli]]) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally.

===Competences===
EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/events/2009/index.html|title=Competences and consumers|accessdate=25 November 2010}}</ref>

That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative procedure]] is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.

The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:

{{EU competences}}

==Legal system and justice==
{{Further|European Union law|Treaties of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
The EU is based on a series of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]].

And Article 47 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.</ref>

Under the principle of [[Supremacy (European Union law)|supremacy]], national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.<ref group="lower-alpha" name="Supremacy">According to the principle of [[Law of the European Union#Supremacy|Supremacy]] as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v.

Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; ''Raoul George Nicolo'' [1990] 1 CMLR 173.</ref>

The [[direct effect]] and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman [[Robert Lecourt]]<ref>William Phelan, ''Great Judgments of the European Court of Justice: Rethinking the Landmark Decisions of the Foundational Period'' (Cambridge, 2019).</ref>

The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of the EU—formally called the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]]—consists of two courts: the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] and the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF |title=Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union |publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>
The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and [[Preliminary ruling|cases referred to it]] by the courts of member states.<ref>{{cite web |title=Court of Justice: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/#competences |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref> Because of the doctrines of [[direct effect]] and supremacy, many judgments of the Court of Justice are automatically applicable within the internal legal orders of the member states.

===Fundamental rights===
The treaties declare that the EU itself is "founded on the values of respect for [[human dignity]], [[liberty|freedom]], democracy, [[equality before the law|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group|minorities]]&nbsp;... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."<ref>[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|Article 2, Treaty on European Union (consolidated 1 December 2009)]]</ref>

In 2009, the [[Lisbon Treaty]] gave legal effect to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The charter is a codified catalogue of [[fundamental right]]s against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states."<ref>Case 11/70, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v. Einfuhr und Vorratstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel; Article 6(2) of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended).</ref> The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.<ref name="europarl-rights">{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/2_1_1_en.htm|title=Respect for fundamental rights in the EU – general development|publisher=The [[European Parliament]]|work=European Parliament Fact Sheets|accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref>

The EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas,  especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Furthermore, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Social Charter]], as well as the [[source of law]] for the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] are created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition.

On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to create a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious [[human rights violations]] and abuses around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://news.bloombergtax.com/international-trade/europe-unveils-new-sanctions-plan-for-human-rights-violations |title= Europe Unveils New Sanctions Plan for Human Rights Violations |accessdate= 19 October 2020 |website= Bloomberg Tax}}</ref>

===Acts===
{{see also|European Citizens' Initiative}}
The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], and [[Decision (European Union)|decisions]]. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,<ref group="lower-alpha">See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61973J0034:EN:NOT <nowiki>[1973]</nowiki> ECR 981].</ref> and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.<ref group="lower-alpha" name="art249"/> Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.<ref group="lower-alpha">To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 28 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115</ref> When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have [[direct effect]] in national law against member states.

Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in [[competition law]], or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|title=How EU takes decisions|accessdate=1 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102215021/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=2 January 2011}}</ref>

The [[European Ombudsman]] was established by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].

Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs; initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism.

This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the [[Schengen Agreement]] and the associated cross border crime.

Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the [[EU's common commercial policy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal}}</ref> Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of [[European Political Cooperation]] which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the [[Single European Act]]. EPC was renamed as the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref name="EPC">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708111806/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date= 8 July 2007 |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |title=European political co-operation (EPC) |accessdate=3 September 2007 |publisher=Europa web portal |author=The European commission |work=Europa Glossary |df= }}</ref>

The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.<ref name="art11 Union">Article 21 of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon), on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]</ref> The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue.

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]].

To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process.

The EU uses foreign relations instruments like the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the Union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a [[member state of the European Union]], or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.

International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily. Its role was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 [[Earth Summit|UN Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, [[South Africa]]; and the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements are the [[Paris Agreement]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, [[planet]], prosperity, [[peace]] and [[partnership]] - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of [[human]]ity.

EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the council, the European Parliament and the commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/european-consensus/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141039/http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/european-consensus/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 August 2011 }}</ref> It is applied from the principles of [[Capability approach]] and [[Rights-based approach to development]].

===Internal market===
{{Main|European Single Market|Digital Single Market|European consumer law}}

Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently becoming a [[single market]], and a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] between its member states.

Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or [[import quota]]s, as they travel internally.

Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom.

The free movement of persons means that [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.<ref name="Europa Single Market P">{{cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm |author=European Commission |accessdate=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613212310/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm |archivedate=13 June 2007 }}</ref>

The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.<ref name="Europa Single Market S">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Services |publisher=Europa |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |author=European Commission |accessdate=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610133514/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |archivedate=10 June 2007 }}</ref> According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

The creation of a [[European Currency Unit|European single currency]] became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] if they wanted to join the [[Currency union|monetary union]]. The states wanting to participate had first to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]].

In 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with [[History of the euro|eleven member states]] joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when [[euro banknotes|euro notes]] and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Almunia says 'undesirable' to act on Sweden's euro refusal |first1=Teresa |last1=Kuchler |publisher=EUobserver.com |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/22733 |accessdate=26 December 2006}}</ref><ref group="lower-alpha">{{cite web|title=ERM II |publisher=Danish Finance Ministry |date=20 March 2009 |url=http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |accessdate=26 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503183816/http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |archivedate=3 May 2011 }}</ref>

The [[European System of Financial Supervision]] is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the [[European Banking Authority]], the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]]. To complement this framework, there is also a [[European Systemic Risk Board]] under the responsibility of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/?aid=30866|title=Europe seals deal on financial supervision|work=euobserver.com}}</ref>

To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.

[[Rail transport in Europe]] is being synchronised with the [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS), an initiative to greatly enhance safety, increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in Europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitised mostly wireless versions and by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.

The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Paper on Transport|publisher=Euractiv|date=22 September 2004|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628|accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref> The [[Highways in Poland|Polish road network]] was upgraded such as the [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 autostrada]].<ref>{{cite web|title=EUR 650 million for the Polish Road Network|url=http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-113-poland-eur-650-million-for-the-polish-road-network.htm|access-date=25 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160259/http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-113-poland-eur-650-million-for-the-polish-road-network.htm|archive-date=19 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The policy's [[Incomes policy|price controls]] and market interventions led to considerable [[overproduction]]. These were [[Buffer stock scheme|intervention stores]] of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the [[Third World|developing world]].<ref name="Guardian CAP">{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1|accessdate=30 August 2007|location=London}}</ref> Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/>

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of [[set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels.<ref name="stead"/> One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.<ref name="EC CAP">{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Europa|accessdate=30 August 2007}}</ref>

The EU has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting workers rights and preventing social and environmental dumping. To this end it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the [[Working Time Directive]] and the [[Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011|Environmental Impact Assessment Directive]]. The EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states.

The [[European Social Charter]] is the main body that recognizes the social rights of European citizens.

A [[European unemployment insurance]] has been proposed among others by the commissioner of Jobs [[Nicolas Schmit]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/10114908/10/19/Asi-es-el-seguro-europeo-contra-el-paro-que-propone-el-futuro-comisario-de-Empleo-de-la-UE.html|title=Así es el seguro europeo contra el paro que propone el futuro comisario de Empleo de la UE - elEconomista.es|website=www.eleconomista.es}}</ref>

In 1957, when the EEC was founded, it had no environmental policy.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}} Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards, and biotechnology.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}} According to the [[Institute for European Environmental Policy]], environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics.<ref name="European Environmental Policy 2012">Institute for European Environmental Policy (2012) Manual of European Environmental Policy, Earthscan, London.</ref>

European policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}}

Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:l28027|title=EUR-Lex – l28027 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}} EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.<ref name="European Environmental Policy 2012"/>

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport policies of the European Union}}
[[Association football]] is by far the most popular sport in the European Union by the number of registered players. The other sports with the most participants in clubs are tennis, basketball, swimming, athletics, golf, gymnastics, equestrian sports, handball, volleyball and sailing.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=M. van Bottenburg|author2=B.

Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. There are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]] that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.<ref name="BBC Boseman">{{cite news |last=Fordyce |first=Tom |title=10&nbsp;years since Bosman|work=BBC News |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|accessdate=13 July 2007}}</ref>

The flag used is the [[Flag of Europe]], which consists of a [[Circle of stars|circle of]] 12 golden stars on a blue background.

Besides naming the continent, the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] has frequently been employed as a [[National personification|personification]] of Europe. Known from the myth in which [[Zeus]] seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present Union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the Union's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of [[Euro banknotes]]. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.{{sfn|Demey|2007|page=387}}
