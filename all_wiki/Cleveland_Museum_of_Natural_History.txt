The '''Cleveland Museum of Natural History''' is a [[natural history museum]] located approximately five miles (8&nbsp;km) east of downtown [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in [[University Circle]], a 550-acre (220 ha)  concentration of educational, cultural and medical institutions. The museum was established in 1920 by [[Cyrus S. Eaton]] to perform research, education and development of collections in the fields of [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]], wildlife biology, and [[zoology]].<ref>[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=ECS1 Cyrus Eaton - Cleveland Biography]</ref> The museum traces its roots to the Ark, formed in 1836 on Cleveland's [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] by [[William Case]], the Academy of Natural Science formed by William Case and [[Jared Potter Kirtland]], and the Kirtland Society of Natural History, founded in 1869 and reinvigorated in 1922 by the trustees of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hendrickson |first=Walter B. |date=1962 |title=The Arkites and Other Pioneer Natural History Organizations of Cleveland |location=Cleveland |publisher=Western Reserve University |lccn=62-17763}}</ref>

[[Donald Johanson]] was the curator of the museum when he discovered "[[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]," the skeletal remains of the ancient [[Hominidae|hominid]] ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]''. The current Curator and Head of the Physical Anthropology Department is [[Yohannes Haile-Selassie]].

In 2002, the new Fannye Shafran [[Planetarium]] was built near the entrance to the museum, containing displays on the planets in the Solar System, and historical [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]s of exploration, such as [[compass]]es and [[astrolabe]]s.

Museum collections total more than four million specimens and include specimens of paleontology, zoology, archaeology, [[mineralogy]], ornithology, and a variety of other scientific subjects.

A beloved full-scale model of a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' on the lawn delights Cleveland children.

Some of the more important specimens are:
*An extensive collection of Late [[Devonian]] fossil fish from the [[Cleveland Shale]], including several mounted skulls of the [[arthrodire]] [[placoderm]] [[Dunkleosteus]].
*Nine hundred [[monkey]] and [[ape]] skeletons, and more than 3,100 human skeletons (the [[Hamann-Todd Collection]]).
*The only specimen of the small [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaur]] ''[[Nanotyrannus lancensis]]''.
*The [[holotype]] of the ''[[Haplocanthosaurus]]'' [[Sauropoda|sauropod]].
*The most complete mount of a ''[[Coelophysis|Coelophysis bauri]]''.
*Mounted taxidermy remains of [[Balto]] the [[sled dog]].
*An extensive mineralogy collection that includes a [[Moon rock]] and the [[Jeptha Wade]] [[gemstone|gem]] collection.
*Replica skeletons of [[Triceratops]] and [[Jane (dinosaur)|Jane]], a juvenile tyrannosaurid.
*Multiple [[mastodon]] and [[mammoth]] specimens.
*A cast of an ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' skeleton, an early hominid affectionately dubbed [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]].
*A new ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' skeleton that is now on display.
*The museum's [[Allosaurus]] has been remounted and is on display.
*A collection of 30,000 plant fossils acquired from the [[University of Cincinnati]] by former curator of [[paleobotany]], [[Shya Chitaley]].<ref name="Plain Dealer">{{cite news |title=Researcher Shyamala Chitaely worked until nearly age 93 at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History: News obituary |first=Grant |last=Segall |url=http://www.cleveland.com/obituaries/index.ssf/2013/05/researcher_shyamala_chitaely_w.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=10 May 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>

The museum has made many discoveries over the years. Recently, in Vertebrate Paleontology, both the remains of a [[Titanichthys]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} in Ohio and a new ceratopsian, [[Albertaceratops nesmoi]], have been made. Both are expected to go on display eventually.

===Hamann-Todd Collection===
The '''Hamann-Todd Collection''' is a collection of more than 3100 human [[skeleton]]s and over 900 primate skeletons that were assembled starting in 1893.  The collection was originally housed at [[Western Reserve University]] Medical School in a new medical building that was built for that purpose.  The first floor of this building contained the Hamann Museum of Comparative Anthropology and Anatomy.  However, due to the costs of storing the bones, the collection was transferred{{when|date=December 2013}} to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 1893, Carl August Hamann initiated the collection.  Its administration was taken over by T. Wingate Todd after Hamann was named dean of Western Reserve University's medical school in 1912.  Todd managed to assemble the great majority of the human skeletons in the collection, over 3000, before his death in 1938.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Perkins Wildlife Center===

The Ralph Perkins II Wildlife Center and Woods Garden presented by Key Bank, which includes live animals and plants native to Ohio, opened on September 3, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Litt|title=Cleveland Museum of Natural History's new Perkins Wildlife Center: The best 2 acres in CLE|url=http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2016/08/cleveland_museum_of_natura_2.html|work=The Plain Dealer|date=28 August 2016|access-date=28 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Perkins Wildlife Center|url=https://www.cmnh.org/nature-wildlife/wildlife|publisher=Cleveland Museum of Natural History|access-date=28 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426200457/https://www.cmnh.org/nature-wildlife/wildlife|archive-date=26 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
