The ukulele is a small guitar-like instrument, which was introduced to [[Hawaii]] by [[Portuguese immigration to Hawaii|Portuguese immigrants]], from [[Madeira]]. It gained great popularity elsewhere in the [[United States]] during the early 20th century and from there spread internationally.

The [[Tone (musical instrument)|tone]] and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.

==History==
The ukulele is commonly associated with [[music from Hawaii]] where the name roughly translates as "jumping flea",<ref>{{harvnb|Beloff|2003|p=13}}</ref> perhaps because of the movement of the player's fingers. Legend attributes it to the nickname of the Englishman [[Edward William Purvis]], one of King [[Kalākaua]]'s officers, because of his small size, fidgety manner, and playing expertise. One of the earliest appearances of the word ''ukulele'' in print (in the sense of a stringed instrument) is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s ''Catalogue of the Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments of All Nations'' published in 1907. The catalog describes two ukuleles from Hawaii: one that is similar in size to a modern soprano ukulele, and one that is similar to a tenor (see {{section link||Types and sizes}}).<ref name="met1907">{{cite book|title=Catalogue of the Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments of All Nations|date=1907|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|location=New York|volume=Volume III. Instruments of Savage Tribes and Semi-Civilized Peoples, Part 2. Oceania|page=51}}</ref>

Developed in the 1880s, the ukulele is based on several small guitar-like instruments of Portuguese origin, the [[Machete (musical instrument)|machete]],<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last=Tranquada and King|title=The Ukulele, A History|publisher=Hawaii University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4}}</ref> the [[cavaquinho]], the [[timple]], and the [[rajão]], introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants from [[Madeira]] and [[Cape Verde]].<ref>{{cite book

One of the most important factors in establishing the ukulele in [[Hawaiian music]] and [[Hawaiian culture|culture]] was the ardent support and promotion of the instrument by King [[Kalākaua]].

===Japan===
The ukulele arrived in [[Japan]] in 1929 after Hawaiian-born [[Yukihiko Haida]] returned to the country upon his father's death and introduced the instrument. Haida and his brother [[Katsuhiko Haida|Katsuhiko]] formed the Moana Glee Club, enjoying rapid success in an environment of growing enthusiasm for Western popular music, particularly Hawaiian and [[jazz]]. During [[World War II]], authorities banned most Western music, but fans and players kept it alive in secret, and it resumed popularity after the war. In 1959, Haida founded the [[Nihon Ukulele Association]]. Today, Japan is considered a second home for Hawaiian musicians and ukulele virtuosos.<ref>{{harvnb|Beloff|2003|p=110}}</ref>

====Post-1990 revival====
After the 1960s, the ukulele declined in popularity until the late 1990s, when interest in the instrument reappeared.<ref name="Shepherd2003">{{cite book|author=John Shepherd|title=Continuum encyclopedia of popular music of the world: VolumeII: Performance and production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&pg=PA450|accessdate=16 April 2011|date=27 February 2003|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-6322-7|pages=450–}}</ref> During the 1990s, new manufacturers began producing ukuleles and a new generation of musicians took up the instrument. [[Jim Beloff]] set out to promote the instrument in the early 1990s and created over two dozen ukulele music books featuring modern music as well as classic ukulele pieces.<ref>''[[Mighty Uke]]'', Interview with Jim Beloff, 2010</ref>

All-time best selling Hawaiian musician [[Israel Kamakawiwo'ole]] helped re-popularise the instrument, in particular with his 1993 [[reggae]]-rhythmed [[Medley (music)|medley]] of "[[Over the Rainbow]]" and "[[What a Wonderful World]]," used in films, television programs, and commercials. The song reached no. 12 on ''Billboard'''s [[Hot Digital Tracks]] chart the week of January 31, 2004.<ref>''Billboard'', for the survey week ending January 18, 2004.</ref>

The creation of YouTube was a large influence on the popularity of the ukulele. One of the first videos to go viral was [[Jake Shimabukuro]]'s ukulele rendition of [[George Harrison]]'s "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" on [[YouTube]]. The video quickly went [[Viral video|viral]], and as of September 2020, had received over 17 million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSkP3uym5k|title=Ukulele weeps by Jake Shimabukuro|last=Catholic Laitinen|date=6 September 2020|accessdate=3 April 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>

==Construction==
The ukulele is generally made of wood, though variants have been composed partially or entirely of plastic or other materials. Cheaper ukuleles are generally made from [[plywood]] or [[laminate]] woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a [[tonewood]] such as [[spruce]]. More expensive ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as [[mahogany]]. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawaii, called [[koa]].

Typically, ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small [[acoustic guitar]]. They are also often seen in non-standard shapes, such as cutaway shape and an oval, usually called a "pineapple" ukulele (see image below), invented by the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.

These instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in [[Course (music)|courses]], giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.)  The strings themselves were originally made of [[catgut]].  Modern ukuleles use [[nylon]] [[polymer]] strings, with many variations in the material, such as [[fluorocarbon]], [[aluminium]] (as winding on lower-pitched strings),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.martinguitar.com/strings/ukulele/|title=Ukulele Strings - C.F. Martin & Co.|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and Nylgut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquilausa.com/uke_strings.html|title=Aquila Nylgut Ukulele Strings, wholesale source for retailers and dealers|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>

Instruments with 6 or 8 strings in four courses are often called taropatches, or taropatch ukuleles. They were once common in a concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch ukuleles. The six string, four course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a Lili'u, though this name also applies to the eight-string version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|title=110mb.com - Want to start a website?|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621113819/http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|archive-date=2013-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Eight-string baritone taropatches exist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/kamaka-baritone-8-string-hf-48.html|title=Kamaka Baritone 8 String HF-48|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and, 5-string tenors have also been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/shop-by/popular-models/kala-ka-atp5-ctg-solid-cedar-top-5-string-tenor.html|title=Kala -KA-ATP-CTG Solid Cedar Top Tenor Slothead -Gloss Finish|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> 
[[File:3 ukes.jpg|thumb|140px|Soprano pineapple ukulele, baritone ukulele and taropatch baritone ukulele.]]

==Types and sizes==
Common types of ukuleles include soprano (standard ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone.  Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or "pocket uke"), bass, and [[contrabass]] ukuleles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamorindamusic.com/uke_101.htm|title=Lamorinda Music|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> Other types of ukuleles include [[banjo ukulele]]s and electric ukuleles. Of the standard ukuleles, the soprano, often called "standard" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller [[tenor guitar]]) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/news-features-the-story-behind-the-kala-u-bass/|title=The story behind the wildly popular Kala U-Bass|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunaguitars.com/query?upc=819998182960|title=Uke Baritone Bass w/Preamp Tattoo - Luna Guitars|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>

[[File:My dog has fleas.png|thumb|"My dog has fleas" tuning. {{audio|My dog has fleas.mid|Play}}]]

One of the most common tunings for the standard or soprano ukulele is [[Sixth chord|C<sup>6</sup>]] tuning: G<sub>4</sub>–C<sub>4</sub>–E<sub>4</sub>–A<sub>4</sub>, which is often remembered by the notes in the "My dog has fleas" jingle (see sidebar).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ukuleleintheclassroom.com/tunings.htm|title=Ukulele in the Classroom|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>  The G string is tuned an octave higher than might be expected, so this is often called "high G" tuning. This is known as a "[[reentrant tuning]]"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording. 

More rarely used with the soprano ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or "low G" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower:  G<sub>3</sub>–C<sub>4</sub>–E<sub>4</sub>–A<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret. 

Another common tuning for the soprano ukulele is the higher string-tension D<sup>6</sup> tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sub>4</sub>–D<sub>4</sub>–F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>–B<sub>4</sub>, one step higher than the G<sub>4</sub>–C<sub>4</sub>–E<sub>4</sub>–A<sub>4</sub> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s.  D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some{{by whom|date=November 2019}} to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sub>3</sub>–D<sub>4</sub>–F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>–B<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes called "Canadian tuning" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor ukuleles, and extensive use by [[James Hill (Canadian musician)|James Hill]] and [[J. Chalmers Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jameshillmusic.com/faq#tuning|title=James Hill - FAQ|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>

Whether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the "standard" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate.  There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.<ref>Tranquada, J.; ''The Ukulele:  A History''; University of Hawaii Press; Honolulu:  2012.  0824-83634-0 According to Tranquanda, ""This is an old and seemingly never-ending argument. While the pioneering methods of Kaai (1906) and Rollinson (1909) both use C tuning, a sampling of the methods that follow give a sense of the unresolved nature of the debate: Kealakai (1914), D tuning; Bailey (1914), C tuning; Kia (1914), D tuning; Kamiki (1916), D tuning; Guckert (1917), C tuning; Stumpf (1917), D tuning."</ref>

For the concert and tenor ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.

The baritone ukulele usually uses linear G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>3</sub>–G<sub>3</sub>–B<sub>3</sub>–E<sub>4</sub>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar. 

Bass ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sub>1</sub>–A<sub>1</sub>–D<sub>2</sub>–G<sub>2</sub> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sub>2</sub>–A<sub>2</sub>–D<sub>3</sub>–G<sub>3</sub>, for Ohana type metal-string basses.

Sopranino ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>5</sub>–G<sub>4</sub>–B<sub>4</sub>–E<sub>5</sub>.

As is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone ukulele in linear C<sup>6</sup>. Some players tune ukuleles like other four-string instruments such as the [[mandolin]],<ref>{{cite web

Ukulele varieties include hybrid instruments such as the [[guitalele]] (also called guitarlele), [[banjo ukulele]] (also called banjolele), [[harp ukulele]], [[lap steel ukulele]], and the [[ukelin]]. It is very common to find ukuleles mixed with other stringed instruments because of the amount of strings and the easy playing ability. There is also an [[Electric ukulele|electrically amplified variant]] of the ukulele. The [[resonator ukulele]] produces sound by one or more spun aluminum cones ([[resonators]]) instead of the wooden soundboard, giving it a distinct and louder tone. The [[Tahitian ukulele]], another variant, is usually carved from a single piece of wood,<ref name="Studies2003">{{cite book|author=University of the South Pacific.

Close cousins of the ukulele include the Portuguese forerunners, the ''[[cavaquinho]]'' (also commonly known as ''machete'' or ''braguinha'') and the slightly larger ''[[rajao|rajão]]''. Other relatives include, the [[Cuatro (instrument)|Venezuelan cuatro]], the [[Colombia]]n ''[[tiple]]'', the ''[[timple]]'' of the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ''[[vihuela]]'', the Mexican [[requinto jarocho]], and the [[Andes|Andean]] ''[[charango]]'' traditionally made of an [[armadillo]] shell. In Indonesia, a similar Portuguese-inspired instrument is the [[kroncong]].<ref name="Wallach2008">{{cite book|author=Jeremy Wallach|title=Modern Noise, Fluid Genres: Popular Music in Indonesia, 1997–2001|url=https://archive.org/details/modernnoisefluid00wall_0|url-access=registration|accessdate=15 September 2012|date=22 October 2008|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-22904-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/modernnoisefluid00wall_0/page/268 268]–|author-link=Jeremy Wallach}}</ref>
