In 2010, Hammer's breakthrough film role was in [[David Fincher]]'s ''[[The Social Network]],'' about the creation of [[Facebook]]. He portrayed the identical twins [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]], with actor [[Josh Pence]] serving as a body double during filming. The filmmakers utilized [[computer-generated imagery]] during post-production to superimpose Hammer's face over Pence's as well as the use of [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen photography]] in certain scenes. In preparation for the film, Hammer stated that he had to learn how to row on both sides of a boat in order to play the twins, who are rowing champions.<ref>[http://talkoffame.com/?p=1867 'Social Network' Stars Talk Twitter and Clint Eastwood] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409013911/http://talkoffame.com/?p=1867 |date=April 9, 2011 }}</ref> Hammer and Pence also went through 10 months of extensive twin boot camp in preparation for their roles, in order to "drill the subtle movements and speech patterns that the Winklevosses would have developed over two decades of genetic equality."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093002654.html|title='Social Network' twins played by unrelated men.

His next role was that of the first Associate Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Clyde Tolson]], in [[Clint Eastwood]]'s 2011 film ''[[J. Edgar]].'' The biographical drama, written by [[Dustin Lance Black]], focused on the expansive career of [[J. Edgar Hoover]], of which the titular role was portrayed by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. The acting was largely praised, with [[David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' calling Hammer's performance "charming", and [[The Hollywood Reporter|''The Hollywood Reporter''<nowiki/>'s]] [[Todd McCarthy]] describing it as "excellent”.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/14/the-man-in-charge|title=The Man in Charge|last=Denby|first=David|journal=The New Yorker (Serial)|date=2011-11-07|access-date=2019-03-25|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> McCarthy goes on further in his review to particularly praise the chemistry between DiCaprio and Hammer, specifically in their depiction of the often speculated romantic relationship between their characters, pointing out that, "...the way the homoerotic undertones and impulses are handled is one of the best things about the film; the emotional dynamics, given all the social and political factors at play, feel entirely credible, and the DiCaprio and Hammer excel during the exchanges of innuendo, covert desire, recriminations and mutual understanding."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/j-edgar-film-review-257366|title=J.
