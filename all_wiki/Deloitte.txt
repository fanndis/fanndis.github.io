==History==
===Early history===
In 1845, [[William Welch Deloitte]] opened an office in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the [[Great Western Railway]].<ref name="history">{{cite web| url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/about-deloitte.html| title=About Deloitte| work=Deloitte| accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref> He went on to open an office in New York in 1880.<ref name="history" />

In 1890, Deloitte opened a branch office on Wall Street headed by Edward Adams and P.D. Griffiths as branch managers. That was Deloitte's first overseas venture. Other branches were soon opened in [[Chicago]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. In 1898 P.D. Griffiths returned from New York and became a partner in the London office.<ref name="Book1">{{cite book|title=Deloitte & Co.|date=1959|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

In 1896, [[Charles Waldo Haskins]] and [[Elijah Watt Sells]] formed Haskins & Sells in New York.<ref name="history" /> It was later described as "the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants".<ref>[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/elijah-watt-sells Elijah Watt Sells], "The Accounting Hall of Fame", [[Fisher College of Business]]. Retrieved 2013-08-07.</ref>

In 1898, [[George Touche]] established an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] in New York.<ref name="history" />

On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and managing partner of Haskins & Sells, testified before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency]]. Carter helped convince [[United States Congress|Congress]] that independent audits should be mandatory for [[Public company|public companies]].<ref name="history" />

[[File:William welch deloitte small.jpg|thumb|upright|William Welch Deloitte, founder of Deloitte]]
In 1947, [[Detroit]] accountant George Bailey, then president of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]], launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey & Smart.<ref name="history" /> Headed by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated [[management consulting]] function. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche.<ref name="history" /> In 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey & Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969.<ref name="history" /> In 1968 [[Nobuzo Tohmatsu]] formed Tohmatsu Aoki & Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975.<ref name="history" /> In 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].<ref name="history" />

In 1972, Deloitte's firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths & Co.) merged with Haskins & Sells to form Deloitte Haskins & Sells.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Simplified Family Tree for the Firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells|url=http://www.icaew.com/-/media/corporate/files/library/subjects/accounting-history/family-trees/family-tree-deloitte-haskins-sells.ashx?la=en|website=Icaew.com|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>

In 1989, Deloitte Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross in the US to form Deloitte & Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins & Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]]).<ref name=NYT>[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/05/business/deloitte-touche-merger-done.html Deloitte Touche merger done] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> Some member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins & Sells and merged with other firms.<ref name=NYT /> In the UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer & Oppenheim in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spicer & Oppenheim|url=https://www.icaew.com/en/library/historical-resources/guide-to-historical-resources/firm-histories/whats-in-a-name/spicer-and-oppenheim|website=ICAEW.com}}</ref>

===Recent history===
At the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte & Touche, the name of the international firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names "Deloitte" or "Touche Ross" – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.<ref name="history" />

[[File:DeloitteOfficeChicago.jpg|thumb|left|Deloitte Office Building in Downtown Chicago]]
In 1995, the partners of Deloitte & Touche decided to create Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/Activities/homepage/consultingclub/wetfeet%20-%20deloitte_consulting.pdf|title=Deloitte Consulting, Page 6|website=Wellesley.edu|accessdate=10 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409002538/http://www.wellesley.edu/Activities/homepage/consultingclub/wetfeet%20-%20deloitte_consulting.pdf|archive-date=9 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Name and branding==
[[File:DeloitteNewSmall.png|thumb|right|Deloitte logo (short form)]]
In 1989, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged in most countries with Touche Ross, forming Deloitte & Touche. However, in the United Kingdom, the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged instead with Coopers & Lybrand (later renamed PwC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/pl/eng/about/main/history.html|title=PWC: History and milestones|website=Pwc.com|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>

While the full name of the UK private company is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,<ref name="gov.uk">{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07271800 |title=Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited |work=Companies House |accessdate=2020-07-23}}</ref> in 1989, it initially branded itself as DTT International. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by [[William G. Parrett]], the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2200392/ernst-young-launches-rebrand |title=Ernst & Young launches rebrand plan |work=Accountancy Age |accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

According to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/about-deloitte.html |title=virat Deloitte |work=Deloitte |accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2008, Deloitte adopted its new "Always One Step Ahead" (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: "To be the Standard of Excellence". AOSA represents the global organization's value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte's brand strategy and positioning framework.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalblogs.deloitte.com/deloitteperspectives/2010/11/170000-brand-managers-step-ahead-as-one.html |title=170,000 brand managers step ahead, as one |work=Deloitte Perspectives |accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

In June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo, with Deloitte written in black color instead of the earlier blue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/deloitte-brand-gets-makeover.html|title=Deloitte’s brand gets a makeover|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>

In [[India]], Deloitte operates under several brand names, including A.F.Ferguson &Co., A.F.Ferguson Associates, S.B.Billimoria, C.C.Choksi & Co., P.C.Hansotia, Fraser & Ross and Deloitte Haskins & Sells (India).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deloitte and KPMG do not have license to operate in India |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/deloitte-kpmg-have-no-licence-to-do-audit-work-in-india/articleshow/3986506.cms |accessdate=29 September 2018 |newspaper=The Economic Times}}</ref>

==Legal structure==
For many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a Swiss [[Swiss association|''Verein'']] (the equivalent of an unincorporated association). As of 31 July 2010, members of the ''Verein'' became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (DTTL), a UK private company limited by guarantee without share capital.<ref name="gov.uk"/> Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and [[professional regulation]]s of the particular country or countries in which it operates.<ref name=structure>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/20/deloitte-touche-tohmatsu-legal-registration-london |title=Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu quits Swiss system to make UK its new legal home |author=Andrew Clark |work=The Guardian |date=20 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref>

[[File:GE Building by David Shankbone.JPG|upright|thumb|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]]]
This structure is similar to other [[professional services networks]] which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the [[International Federation of Accountants|IFAC]] Forum of Firms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/forum-firms/|title=IFAC Forum of Firms|publisher=IFAC|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2019 the UK partners in the firm received average pay of £882,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=PwC partners set for bumper pay boost despite audit criticism |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e5fd21aa-d87d-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17 |accessdate=1 July 2020 |work=Financial Times|date=16 September 2019}}</ref>

==Services==
Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country).<ref name="Deloitte"/>

===Audit===
Audit provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing, IT control assurance and Media & Advertising Assurance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/services/audit.html|title=Audit & Assurance {{!}} Deloitte {{!}} Global services, reports, and insights|website=Deloitte|language=en|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref> In 2018, audit grew by 7.7%.<ref name="Deloitte"/>

It qualified its opinion in 2004 as to company sales, returns, and allowances. The firm resigned from the Kelon account after completing the 2004 audit.

The "excoriating" and "damning" (''[[The Guardian]]'')<ref name="Davies-16May2018">{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Rob|title='Recklessness, hubris and greed' – Carillion slammed by MPs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/recklessness-hubris-and-greed-carillion-slammed-by-mps|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=The Guardian|date=16 May 2018}}</ref> final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into Carillion's collapse was published on 16 May 2018, and criticised Deloitte for its involvement in the company's financial reporting practices:
:"Deloitte were responsible for advising Carillion’s board on risk management and financial controls, failings in the business that proved terminal. Deloitte were either unable to identify effectively to the board the risks associated with their business practices, unwilling to do so, or too readily ignored them."<ref name="Carillion report conclusion">{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|page=91|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>

The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain's corporate governance regime, accusing the big four accounting firms of operating as a "cosy club".<ref name="Davies-16May2018"/> Deloitte said it was "disappointed" with the committees' conclusions regarding its role as internal auditors, but would take on board any lessons that could be learned from Carillion's collapse.<ref name="Davies-16May2018"/>

=== Autonomy ===
Following [[HP Autonomy|Autonomy's]] 2011 sale to [[Hewlett-Packard]], the British software company was accused of accounting improprieties that contributed to an $8.8 billion write-down of Autonomy's value. In May 2018, the UK-Based [[Financial Reporting Council]] launched disciplinary action against Deloitte, Autonomy's auditor at the time of the sale. Deloitte Partners who led the audit were accused of failing to correct false and misleading information filed with the FRRP, and otherwise failing to act with objectivity during the course of the audit. The FRC's action followed legal proceedings in the US that found former Autonomy executive Sushovan Hussain guilty of fraud earlier that month.<ref name=ftautonomy>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cab0c718-64a1-11e8-90c2-9563a0613e56|title=UK watchdog acts against Deloitte over Autonomy accounts|last=Fildes|first=Nic|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|url-status=|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref>

=== State unemployment portals ===
Deloitte Consulting has been heavily involved in building unemployment insurance web portals across various states, including Ohio, Colorado and Illinois. In May 2020, following a wave of applications resulting from the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], it was revealed that major security weaknesses existed in the web portals of these states. Personal information of unemployed applicants, including addresses and social security numbers, were exposed and viewable by the public. Following the revelation, proposed class actions were filed against the company.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Deloitte Sued Over Pandemic Unemployment Website Data Breaches|url=https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/deloitte-sued-over-pandemic-unemployment-website-data-breaches|access-date=2020-06-22|website=news.bloomberglaw.com|language=en}}</ref>

The controversy follows similar short-fallings in Florida's unemployment portal. The CONNECT site, designed by Deloitte, was described as a "colossal failure" as it was created over-budget, delivered late, and did not work. Again, individuals laid off during the COVID pandemic were particularly vulnerable as they were out of jobs and unable to received unemployment assistance. In May 2020, an investigation was ordered by Florida Governor [[Ron DeSantis]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Report: Company behind flawed unemployment website says Florida got what it asked for|url=https://www.wtsp.com/article/money/business/connect-website-florida-unemployment-deloitte/67-644f9528-3b11-4080-bad9-fdca8f6cfb37|access-date=2020-06-22|website=wtsp.com|language=en-US}}</ref>
