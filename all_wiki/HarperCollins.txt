===Mergers and acquisitions===
Collins was bought by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] in 1989, and was combined with Harper & Row, which NewsCorp had acquired two years earlier. In addition to the simplified and merged name, the logo for HarperCollins was derived from the torch logo for Harper and Row, and the fountain logo for Collins, which were combined into a stylized depiction of flames atop waves.

In 1990, HarperCollins sold [[J. B. Lippincott & Co.]], its medical publishing division, to the Dutch publisher [[Wolters Kluwer]].<ref>{{cite news |issn=0362-4331 |last=Cohen |first=Roger |title=J.B.

===United States v. Apple Inc.===
In April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed ''[[United States v. Apple Inc.]]'', naming [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], HarperCollins, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for [[e-books]], and weaken [[Amazon.com]]'s position in the market, in violation of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]].<ref name="washington post DOJ sues">{{cite news |author=Mui, Ylan Q. and Hayley Tsukayama |title=Justice Department sues Apple, publishers over e-book prices |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/justice-department-files-suit-against-apple-publishers-report-says/2012/04/11/gIQAzyXSAT_story.html  |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>

===US warehouse closings===
It was announced to employees privately and then later in the day on November 5, 2012, that HarperCollins was closing its remaining two US warehouses, in order to merge shipping and warehousing operations with [[RR Donnelley|R.&nbsp;R. Donnelley]] in Indiana. The Scranton, Pennsylvania warehouse closed in September 2013 and a Nashville, Tennessee warehouse, under the name (D.B.A.) Thomas Nelson (which distributes the religious arm of HarperCollins/Zondervan Books), in the winter of 2013. Several office positions and departments continued to work for HarperCollins in Scranton, but in a new location.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2012/11/06/harpercollins-to-close-warehouses-in.html |title=HarperCollins to close warehouses in deal with R.R.

The Scranton warehouse closing eliminated approximately 200 jobs, and the Nashville warehouse closing eliminated up to 500 jobs; the exact number of distribution employees is unknown.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20130814/BUSINESS02/308140115/2095/BUSINESS02 |title= HarperCollins Publishers to sell Nashville distribution center |work=The Tennessean |first=Getahn|last=Ward |date=August 14, 2003}}</ref>

===Internet Archive lawsuit===
In June 2020, HarperCollins was one of a group of publishers who sued the [[Internet Archive]], arguing that its collection of e-books was denying authors and publishers revenue and accusing the library of "willful mass copyright infringement".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/books/internet-archive-emergency-library-coronavirus.html|title=Publishers Sue Internet Archive Over Free E-Books|date=June 1, 2020|accessdate=June 12, 2020|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Elizabeth A.|last=Harris}}</ref>

In September 2020, HarperCollins sued [[Lindsay Lohan]] for entering into a book deal and collecting a $350,000 advance for a tell-all memoir that never materialized.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trepany|first=Charles|title=Lindsay Lohan sued by HarperCollins for collecting $365K advance but never writing book|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2020/09/10/lindsay-lohan-sued-book-advance-harpercollins/3462822001/|access-date=2020-09-11|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Business strategy==
[[File:ASA conference 2008 - 31.JPG|thumb|2008 conference booth]]

===Web approach===
In 2008, HarperCollins launched a browsing feature on its website to allow customers can read selected excerpts from books before purchasing, on both desktop and mobile browsers.<ref name=":1">[http://mashable.com/2008/02/10/harpercollins-free-previews/ HarperCollins (Finally) Offers Free Books Online<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref><ref>Pace, Andrew K. “Technically Speaking.” American Libraries 2006 April: 80.</ref><ref>[http://mashable.com/2007/08/15/harpercollins-iphone/ HarperCollins Offers Books on the iPhone<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> This functionality gave the publisher's website the ability to compete with physical bookstores, in which customers can typically look at the book itself, and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon's]] use of excerpts ("teasers") for online book purchasers.<ref name=":1">[http://mashable.com/2008/02/10/harpercollins-free-previews/ HarperCollins (Finally) Offers Free Books Online<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>

At the beginning of October 2013, the company announced a partnership with online digital library [[Scribd]]. The official statement revealed that the "majority" of the HarperCollins US and HarperCollins Christian catalogs will be available in Scribd's subscription service. Chantal Restivo-Alessi, chief digital officer at HarperCollins, explained to the media that the deal represents the first time that the publisher has released such a large portion of its catalog.<ref>{{cite web|title=With HarperCollins Deal, Scribd Unveils Its Bid To Become The Netflix For Books|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/01/scribd-harpercollins-book-subscriptions/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=October 1, 2013|first=Anthony|last=Ha|date=October 1, 2013}}</ref>

HarperCollins formerly operated ''authonomy'', an online community of authors, from 2008 to 2015. The website offered an alternative to the traditional "[[slushpile|slush pile]]" approach for handling unsolicited manuscripts sent to a publisher with little chance of being reviewed. Using authonomy, authors could submit their work for [[peer review]] and ranking by other members; the five highest-ranked manuscripts each month would be read by HarperCollins editors for potential publication. The site was closed after authors "learned to game the system" to earn top-five rankings, and fewer authonomy titles were selected to be published.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/authonomy-writing-community-closed-by-harpercollins|title=Authonomy writing community closed by HarperCollins|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2015-08-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

From 2009 to 2010, HarperCollins operated [[Bookarmy]], a social networking site.

===Speakers Bureau===
The '''HarperCollins Speakers Bureau''' (also known as HCSB) is the first lecture agency to be created by a major publishing house.<ref name="mcgee"/> It was launched in May 2005<ref name="mcgee">McGee, Celia.

===HarperAcademic===
[https://www.harperacademic.com/ HarperAcademic] is the academic marketing department of HarperCollins.  HarperAcademic provides instructors with the latest in adult titles for course adoption at the high school and college level, as well as titles for first-year and other common read programs at academic institutions.  They also attend several major academic conferences to showcase new titles for academic professionals.

[https://soundcloud.com/user-639387857 HarperAcademic Calling], a podcast produced by the department, provides interviews with authors of noteworthy titles.

===HarperStudio===
HarperCollins announced HarperStudio in 2008 as a "new, experimental unit... that will eliminate the traditional profit distributions to authors. The long-established author advances and bookseller returns has not proved to be very profitable to either the author or the publisher. The approach HarperStudio is now taking is to offer little or no advance, but instead to split the profit 50% (rather than the industry standard 15%), with the author." The division was headed by Bob Miller, previously the founding publisher of [[Disney Hyperion|Hyperion]], the adult books division of the [[Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/business/04harper.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=New HarperCollins Unit to Try to Cut Writer Advances|author=Rich, Motoko|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_en_bu/books_publisher_switch|title=Hyperion publisher goes to HarperCollins|author=Italie, Hillel|publisher=Associated Press|date=April 3, 2008|accessdate=April 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064317/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_en_bu/books_publisher_switch <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate =April 8, 2008}}</ref> HarperStudio folded in March 2010 after Miller left for [[Workman Publishing]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/04/that-was-fast-say-goodbye-to-harper-studio.html|title=That was fast: say goodbye to Harper Studio|author=Kellogg, Carolyn|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 2, 2010}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===''If I Did It''===
{{main|If I Did It}}
''If I Did It'' was a book written by [[O. J. Simpson]] about his alleged murder of [[Nicole Simpson]], which was planned as a HarperCollins title, and which attracted considerable controversy and a legal battle over publication.

===Ben Collins===
In August 2010, the company became embroiled in a legal battle with the [[BBC]] after a book it was due to publish, later identified as the forthcoming autobiography of racing driver [[Ben Collins (racing driver)|Ben Collins]], revealed the identity of [[The Stig]] from ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11108795|title=Top Gear boss lambasts Stig book plans|date=August 27, 2010|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> In his blog, Top Gear executive producer [[Andy Wilman]] accused HarperCollins of "hoping to cash in" on the BBC's [[intellectual property]], describing the publishers as "a bunch of chancers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transmission.blogs.topgear.com/2010/08/27/the-stig-he-is-ours/|title=The Stig.

===''East and West''===
The company became embroiled in controversy in 1998 after it was revealed it blocked [[Chris Patten]]'s (the last British governor of Hong Kong) book ''[[East and West (book)|East and West]]'' after a direct intervention by the then-CEO of [[News International]], [[Rupert Murdoch]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/analysis/61122.stm|title=Rupert Murdoch Faces Authors' Revolt.|date=March 1, 1998|work=Transmission|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> It was later revealed by Stuart Proffitt, the editor who had worked on the book for HarperCollins, that this intervention was designed to appease the Chinese authorities‒of whom the book was critical‒as Murdoch intended to extend his business empire into China and did not wish to cause problems there by allowing the book to be published.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/bookworm-who-turned-1147399.html| date=February 28, 1998|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|location=London|first=David|last=Lister|title=Bookworm who turned}}</ref> Murdoch's intervention caused both Proffitt's resignation from the company and outrage from international media outside of News International. Chris Patten later published with [[Macmillan Publishing]], initially in America, where it carried the logo "The book that Rupert Murdoch refused to publish".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9033316/Leveson-inquiry-Rupert-Murdoch-dropped-Lord-Pattens-book-to-curry-favour-with-Chinese.html| date=January 23, 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|location=London|title=Leveson inquiry: Rupert Murdoch 'dropped Lord Patten's book to curry favour with Chinese'}}</ref> After a successful legal campaign against HarperCollins, Patten went on to publish the book in the UK in September 1998 after accepting a sum of £500,000 and receiving an apology from [[Rupert Murdoch]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16682122|date=January 23, 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|title= Rupert Murdoch blocked my book, says Lord Patten }}</ref>
