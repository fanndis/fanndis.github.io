'''East Germany''', officially the '''German Democratic Republic''' ('''GDR'''; {{lang-de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}} {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə demoˈkʁaːtɪʃə ʁepuˈbliːk|}}, '''DDR''' {{IPA-de|ˌdeːdeːˈʔɐʁ|}}), was a country that existed from 1949 to 1990, the period when the [[New states of Germany|eastern portion]] of [[Germany]] was part of the [[Eastern Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. Commonly described as a [[communist state]] in English usage, it described itself as a [[Socialist state|socialist]] "workers' and peasants' state".<ref name="MajorOsmond">Patrick Major, Jonathan Osmond, ''The Workers' and Peasants' State: Communism and Society in East Germany Under Ulbricht 1945–71'', Manchester University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-6289-6}}</ref> It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces following the end of World War II—the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of the [[Potsdam Agreement]], bounded on the east by the [[Oder–Neisse line]].

In 1989, numerous social, economic and political forces in the GDR and abroad, one of the most notable ones being the peaceful protests starting in the city of Leipzig, led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the establishment of a government committed to liberalization. The following year, [[1990 East German general election|a free and fair election]] was held<ref>Geoffrey Pridham, Tatu Vanhanen. ''Democratization in Eastern Europe'' Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|0-415-11063-7}} pp. 135</ref> and international negotiations led to the signing of the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Final Settlement treaty]] on the status and borders of Germany. The GDR dissolved itself and [[German reunification|reunified]] with West Germany on 3 October 1990, becoming a fully sovereign state in the reunified [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist leader [[Egon Krenz]], were prosecuted by Federal Republic after reunification for alleged offenses committed during the Cold War.<ref>[http://www.newworker.org/nw29897.htm#international Repeal the racist asylum laws]. www.newworker.org (29 August 1997).

Geographically, the GDR bordered the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] to the east, [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] to the southeast and [[West Germany]] to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR also bordered the Soviet sector of [[History of Berlin#West and East Germany|Allied-occupied Berlin]], known as [[East Berlin]], which was also administered as the state's ''de facto'' capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] known collectively as West Berlin. The three sectors occupied by the Western nations were sealed off from the GDR by the Berlin Wall from its construction in 1961 until it was brought down in 1989.

==Naming conventions==
The official name was ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (German Democratic Republic), usually abbreviated to "DDR" (GDR). Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its [[Constitution of East Germany (1968)|second constitution]] in 1968. West Germans, the western media and statesmen initially avoided the official name and its abbreviation, instead using terms like ''Ostzone'' (Eastern Zone),<ref name=zeit49>{{cite news |author=Berlin Korrespondent|title=Nationale Front in der Ostzone|url=http://www.zeit.de/1949/22/nationale-front-in-der-ostzone |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |date = June 1949|access-date=10 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111023236/http://www.zeit.de/1949/22/nationale-front-in-der-ostzone|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone; often abbreviated to ''SBZ'') and ''sogenannte DDR''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html |title=Vom Sogenannten |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203124606/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html |archive-date=3 February 2016 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=21 October 1968 |page=65 |url-status=live }}</ref> or "so-called GDR".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA20 |title=Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany, 1959 - Germany (West) |page=20 |year=1959 |access-date=16 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221170436/https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA20 |archive-date=21 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The centre of political power in East Berlin was referred to as ''[[Pankow]]'' (the seat of command of the Soviet forces in East Germany was referred to as [[Karlshorst]]).<ref name=zeit49 /> Over time, however, the abbreviation "DDR" was also increasingly used colloquially by West Germans and West German media.{{NoteTag|The use of the abbreviation ''BRD'' (FRG) for West Germany, the ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (''Federal Republic of Germany''), on the other hand, was never accepted in West Germany since it was considered a political statement. Thus ''BRD'' (FRG) was a term used by East Germans, or by West Germans who held a pro-East-German view. Colloquially, West Germans called West Germany simply Germany (reflecting West Germany's claim to represent the whole of Germany), or alternatively the ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' (Federal Republic or Federal Territory, respectively), referring to the country and ''Bundesbürger'' (Federal citizen) for its citizens, with the adjective ''bundesdeutsch'' (Federal German).}}

When used by West Germans, {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} ([[West Germany]]) was a term almost always in reference to the geographic region of [[Western Germany]] and not to the area within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, this use was not always consistent and West Berliners frequently used the term ''Westdeutschland'' to denote the Federal Republic.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Language of Human Rights in West Germany |first = Lora |last = Wildenthal |page = 210 }}</ref> Before World War II, {{lang|de|Ostdeutschland}} (eastern Germany) was used to describe all the territories east of the [[Elbe]] ([[East Elbia]]), as reflected in the works of sociologist [[Max Weber]] and political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]].<ref>Cornfield, Daniel B. and '' ''Hodson, Randy'' ''(2002).''

Explaining the internal impact of the GDR government from the perspective of German history in the long term, historian [[Gerhard A. Ritter]] (2002) has argued that the East German state was defined by two dominant forces{{snd}}[[Soviet communism]] on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German communists on the other.<ref>Compare: {{cite journal |first= Gerhard A. |last= Ritter |author-link= Gerhard A.

The GDR always was constrained by the example of richer West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes implemented by the communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and in transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and of the media.

===Origins===
At the [[Yalta Conference]] during World War II, the [[Allies of World War II| Allies]] (the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union) agreed on dividing a defeated [[Nazi Germany]] into [[Allied-occupied Germany| occupation zones]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWyalta.htm |title= Yalta Conference |publisher= spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |access-date= 25 September 2010 |url-status= dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514081136/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWyalta.htm |archive-date= 14 May 2011 }}</ref> and on dividing Berlin, the German capital, among the Allied powers as well. Initially this meant the formation of three zones of occupation, i.e., American, British, and Soviet. Later, a French zone was carved out of the US and British zones.

===1949 establishment===
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
The ruling communist party, known as the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED), formed in April 1946 from [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany |the merger]] between the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD).<ref>On the discussion about Social Democrats joining the SED see Steffen Kachel, Entscheidung für die SED 1946 – ein Verrat an sozialdemokratischen Idealen?, in: ''[[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]]'', No. I/2004.{{date?}} </ref> The two former parties were notorious rivals when they were active before the Nazis consolidated all power and criminalised them, and official East German and Soviet histories portrayed this merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties and symbolic of the new friendship of German socialists after defeating their common enemy; however, there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than commonly portrayed, and that the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD's eastern branch to merge with the KPD, and the communists, who held a majority, had virtually total control over policy.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/Nachkriegsjahre/PolitischerNeubeginn/sed.html |title= LeMO Kapitel: Zwangsvereinigung zur SED |author= Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland |website= hdg.de |access-date= 15 July 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614213527/http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/Nachkriegsjahre/PolitischerNeubeginn/sed.html |archive-date= 14 June 2012|url-status= live}}</ref> The SED remained the ruling party for the entire duration of the East German state. It had close ties with the Soviets, which maintained [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany| military forces in East Germany]] until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 (the [[Russian Federation]] continued to maintain forces in the territory of the former East Germany until 1994), with the stated purpose of countering [[NATO]] bases in West Germany.

As West Germany was reorganized and gained independence from its occupiers (1945-1949), the GDR was established in East Germany in October 1949. The emergence of the two sovereign states solidified the 1945 division of Germany.<ref>See [http://web.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect17.htm Anna M.

The German Question: The Stalin Note of 1952 and the Problem of Reunification.

There have been several debates about whether Germany missed a real chance for reunification in 1952.

In 1949 the Soviets turned control of East Germany over to the SED, headed by [[Wilhelm Pieck]] (1876–1960), who became [[President of the German Democratic Republic | President of the GDR]] and held the office until his death, while the [[First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany | SED General Secretary]] [[Walter Ulbricht]] assumed most executive authority.

The government of East Germany denounced West German failures in accomplishing [[denazification]] and renounced ties to the [[Nazi]] past, imprisoning many former Nazis and preventing them from holding government positions.

===Zones of occupation===
{{Further|Allied-occupied Germany}}

In the Yalta and Potsdam conferences of 1945, the Allies established their joint military occupation and administration of Germany via the [[Allied Control Council]] (ACC), a four-power (US, UK, USSR, France) [[military occupation| military government]] effective until the restoration of German sovereignty. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ{{snd}}''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'') comprised the five states (''Länder'') of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Thuringia]]{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones. The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently, as the other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the Soviet administration instituted a separate socialist government in its zone {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.

[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1949.png|thumb|left|upright|West Germany (blue) comprised the Western Allies' zones, excluding the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] (purple); the Soviet zone, East Germany (red) surrounded West Berlin (yellow).]]

Yet, seven years after the Allies' 1945 [[Potsdam Agreement]] on common German policies, the USSR via the [[Stalin Note]] (10 March 1952) proposed [[German reunification]] and [[superpower disengagement]] from Central Europe, which the three Western Allies (the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]]) rejected. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], a Communist proponent of reunification, died in early March 1953. Similarly, [[Lavrenty Beria]], the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued German reunification, but he was removed from power that same year before he could act on the matter. His successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification went unconsidered until 1989. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

East Germany regarded East Berlin as its capital, and the Soviet Union and the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]] diplomatically recognized East Berlin as the capital. However, the Western Allies disputed this recognition, considering the entire city of Berlin to be [[military occupation |occupied territory]] governed by the [[Allied Control Council]]. According to Margarete Feinstein, East Berlin's status as the capital was largely unrecognized by the West and by most Third World countries.<ref name="German Democratic Republic page 78">"State symbols: the quest for legitimacy in the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, 1949–1959", by Margarete Myers Feinstein, page 78: " ... claims of East Berlin as the capital of the GDR, ... East Berlin was not recognized by the West and most Third World countries"</ref> In practice, the ACC's authority was rendered moot by the [[Cold War]], and East Berlin's status as occupied territory largely became a [[legal fiction]], the Soviet sector of Berlin became fully integrated into the GDR.{{citation needed|date= January 2020}}

The deepening Cold War conflict between the Western Powers and the Soviet Union over the unresolved status of West Berlin led to the [[Berlin Blockade]] (24 June 1948{{snd}}12 May 1949). The Soviet army initiated the blockade by halting all Allied rail, road, and water traffic to and from West Berlin. The Allies countered the Soviets with the [[Berlin Airlift]] (1948–49) of food, fuel, and supplies to West Berlin.<ref>Michael D. Haydock, ''City Under Siege: The Berlin Blockade and Airlift, 1948–1949'' (2000)</ref>

{{History of Germany}}

On 21 April 1946 the [[Communist Party of Germany]] ({{lang|de|Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands}}{{snd}}KPD) and the part of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] ({{lang|de|Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands}}{{snd}}SPD) in the Soviet zone merged to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED{{snd}}{{lang|de| Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands}}), which then won the [[1946 Soviet occupation zone state elections | elections of October 1946]]. The SED government [[nationalization |nationalised]] infrastructure and industrial plants.

In March 1948 the [[German Economic Commission]] ({{lang|de|Deutsche Wirtschaftskomission}}—DWK) under its chairman [[Heinrich Rau]] assumed administrative authority in the Soviet occupation zone, thus becoming the predecessor of an East German government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weitz|1997|p=350:}} Following a Soviet order in February 1948, the German Economic Commission became a nascent state structure for all intents and purposes, with competence far beyond the economy proper; it gained the power to issue orders and directives to all German organs within the Soviet Occupation Zone.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|McCauley|1983|p= 38:}} The DWK had become the ''de facto'' government of the Soviet zone. Its chairman was Heinrich Rau (SED), and four of his six deputies were also SED members.</ref>

On 7 October 1949 the SED established the {{lang|de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}} (German Democratic Republic{{snd}}GDR), based on a socialist political constitution establishing its control of the [[anti-Fascism| Anti-Fascist]] [[National Front (East Germany) |National Front of the German Democratic Republic]] (NF, {{lang|de| Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik}}), an omnibus alliance of every party and mass organisation in East Germany. The NF was established to stand for election to the {{lang|de|Volkskammer}} ([[People's Chamber]]), the East German parliament. The first and only president of the German Democratic Republic was [[Wilhelm Pieck]]. However, after 1950, political power in East Germany was held by the First Secretary of the SED, [[Walter Ulbricht]].<ref>[[Patrick Major]] and Jonathan Osmund, ''Workers' and Peasants' State: Communism and Society in East Germany under Ulbricht, 1945–71'' (2002)</ref>

On 16 June 1953, workers constructing the new {{lang|de|[[Stalinallee]]}} boulevard in [[East Berlin]] according to the GDR's officially promulgated [[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design | Sixteen Principles of Urban Design]], rioted against a 10% production-quota increase. Initially a labour protest, the action soon included the general populace, and on 17 June similar protests occurred throughout the GDR, with more than a million people [[general strike| striking]] in some 700 cities and towns. Fearing anti-communist [[counter-revolution]], on 18 June 1953 the government of the GDR enlisted the [[Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany |Soviet Occupation Forces]] to aid the police in ending the riot; some fifty people were killed and 10,000 were jailed.{{Clarify|reason= I don't understand the transition between the previous paragraph and this one.|date= January 2020}}<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,894998,00.html East Berlin 17 June 1953: Stones Against Tanks] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110123034004/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,894998,00.html |date= 23 January 2011 }}, ''Deutsche Welle''.

The German [[war reparations]] owed to the Soviets impoverished the Soviet Zone of Occupation and severely weakened the East German economy.

In 1971 the Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] had Ulbricht removed;{{cn|date=October 2020}} [[Erich Honecker]] replaced him. While the Ulbricht government had experimented with liberal reforms, the Honecker government reversed them. The new government introduced a new [[East German Constitution]] which defined the German Democratic Republic as a "republic of workers and peasants".<ref>Henry Krisch, "Soviet-GDR Relations in the Honecker Era", ''East Central Europe,'' December 1979, Vol. 6 Issue 2, pp.&nbsp;152–172.</ref>

Initially, East Germany claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, a claim supported by most of the Communist bloc. It claimed that West Germany was an illegally-constituted [[puppet state]] of NATO. However, from the 1960s onward, East Germany began recognizing itself as a separate country from West Germany, and shared the legacy of the [[German Reich|united German state of 1871–1945]]. This was formalized in 1974, when the reunification clause was removed from the revised East German constitution. West Germany, in contrast, maintained that it was the only legitimate government of Germany. From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East Germany was an illegally constituted state. It argued that the GDR was a Soviet puppet-state, and frequently referred to it as the "Soviet occupation zone". West Germany's allies shared this position until 1973. East Germany was recognized primarily by Communist countries and by the [[Arab bloc]], along with some "scattered sympathizers".<ref name=time>{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903634,00.html |title= East Germany: The Price of Recognition |date= 1 January 1973 |work= [[Time (magazine) |Time]] |access-date= 21 October 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111218025533/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903634,00.html |archive-date= 18 December 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] (1955), West Germany did not establish (formal) diplomatic ties with any country –— except the Soviets –– that recognized East German sovereignty.

In the early 1970s, the {{lang|de|[[Ostpolitik]]}} ("Eastern Policy") of "Change Through Rapprochement" of the pragmatic government of [[West Germany|FRG]] [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]], established normal diplomatic relations with the [[East Bloc]] states. This policy saw the [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty (1972)|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972), which relinquished any separate claims to an [[exclusive mandate]] over Germany as a whole and established normal relations between the two Germanies. Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanies into the UN to that effect.<ref name="time"/>  Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant "Germany as whole".<ref>{{citation |first= Peter E. |last= Quint |title= The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification | year = 1991 |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= 14 }}</ref>  The two Germanies each relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].

This assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation |first= Donald P. |last= Kommers |title= The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |year= 2012 |publisher= Duke University Press | page= 308 }}</ref>

===GDR identity===
[[File:Karl Marx memorial.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9| [[Karl Marx]] monument in [[Chemnitz]] (renamed ''Karl-Marx-Stadt'' from 1953 to 1990)]]

From the beginning, the newly-formed GDR tried to establish its own separate identity.<ref>David Priestand, ''Red Flag:  A History of Communism'', New York: Grove Press, 2009</ref> Because of the imperial and military legacy of [[Prussia]], the SED repudiated continuity between Prussia and the GDR. The SED destroyed a number of symbolic relics of the former [[Prussian aristocracy]]: [[Junker (Prussia) | Junker]] manor-houses were torn down, the [[City Palace, Berlin| Berliner Stadtschloß]] was razed, and the [[equestrian statue of Frederick the Great]] was removed from East Berlin. Instead the SED focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including [[Thomas Müntzer]]'s role in the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524-1525 and the role played by the heroes of the class struggle during Prussia's industrialization.

Especially after the Ninth Party Congress in 1976, East Germany upheld historical reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein |Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] (1757-1831), [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] (1750-1822), [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767-1835), and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] (1755-1813) as examples and role models.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

{{Main|Die Wende| German reunification}}

In May 1989, following widespread public anger over the faking of results of local government elections, many GDR citizens applied for exit visas or [[Republikflucht|left the country]] contrary to GDR laws. The impetus for this exodus of East Germans was the removal of the electrified fence along [[Hungarian People's Republic |Hungary]]'s border with [[Austria]] on 2 May 1989. Although formally the Hungarian frontier was still closed, many East Germans took the opportunity to enter Hungary via [[Czechoslovakia]], and then make the illegal crossing from Hungary to Austria and to West Germany beyond.<ref name="Judt" /> By July, 25,000 East Germans had crossed into Hungary;<ref>[https://archive.is/20050419213613/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_east_wall.shtml The Berlin Wall (1961–89)] German Notes.

The opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the [[Pan-European Picnic]] on 19 August 1989 then set in motion a chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony came from [[Otto von Habsburg]], who proposed it to [[Miklós Németh]], the then Hungarian Prime Minister, who promoted the idea.<ref>Miklós Németh in Interview, Austrian TV - ORF "Report", 25 June 2019.</ref> The patrons of the picnic, Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State [[Imre Pozsgay]], who did not attend the event, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reaction to an opening of the border on the [[Iron Curtain]]. In particular, it tested whether Moscow would give the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary the command to intervene. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by the Paneuropean Union through posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the [[Paneuropean Union]], which was then headed by [[Karl von Habsburg]], distributed thousands of brochures inviting GDR citizens to a picnic near the border at Sopron (near Hungary's border with Austria).<ref name="Hilde Szabo 2014">{{cite news |url=https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/welt-europa/weltpolitik/364731_Die-Berliner-Mauer-begann-im-Burgenland-zu-broeckeln.html |first=Hilde |last=Szabo |title=Die Berliner Mauer begann im Burgenland zu bröckeln |trans-title=The Berlin Wall began to crumble in Burgenland |language=de |newspaper=Wiener Zeitung |date=16 August 1999}}</ref><ref>Otmar Lahodynsky: ''Paneuropäisches Picknick: Die Generalprobe für den Mauerfall'' (Pan-European picnic: the dress rehearsal for the fall of the Berlin Wall - German), in: ''Profil'' 9 August 2014.</ref><ref name="Die Zeit 2014">{{cite news |url=https://www.zeit.de/wissen/geschichte/2014-08/ddr-flucht-1989-grenzpicknick-sopron |first=Ludwig |last=Greven |title=Und dann ging das Tor auf |newspaper=Die Zeit |date=19 August 2014 |trans-title=And then the Gate Opened }}</ref> The local Sopron organizers knew nothing of possible GDR refugees, but envisaged a local party with Austrian and Hungarian participation.<ref>Otmar Lahodynsky "Eiserner Vorhang: Picknick an der Grenze" (Iron curtain: picnic at the border - German), in Profil 13 June 2019.</ref>  But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Thus the barrier of the Eastern Bloc was broken. The reaction to this from Erich Honecker in the "Daily Mirror" of 19 August 1989 was too late and showed the current loss of power: "Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West."{{cn|date=October 2020}} Now tens of thousands of the media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use force of arms.

The next major turning point in the exodus came on 10 September 1989, when the Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Horn]] announced that his country would no longer restrict movement from Hungary into Austria. Within two days 22,000 East Germans crossed into Austria, with tens of thousands more in the following weeks.<ref name="Judt">{{cite book | title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 | first = Tony | last = Judt | year = 2005 | page = 612 }}</ref>

Many other GDR citizens [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany| demonstrated against the ruling party]], especially in the city of [[Leipzig]]. The Leipzig demonstrations became a weekly occurrence, with a turnout of 10,000 people at the first demonstration on 2 October and peaking at an estimated 300,000 by the end of the month.<ref name="Postwar 613" /> The protests were surpassed in East Berlin, where half a million demonstrators turned out against the regime on 4 November.<ref name="Postwar 613">{{cite book | title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 | first  = Tony | last = Judt | year = 2005 | page = 613 }}</ref> [[Kurt Masur]], the conductor of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], led local negotiations with the government and held town meetings in the concert hall.<ref>Darnton, Robert, ''Berlin Journal'' (New York, 1992, W.W.

The massive demonstration in East Berlin on 4 November coincided with Czechoslovakia formally opening its border to West Germany.<ref name="Postwar 614">{{cite book | title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 | first = Tony | last = Judt | year = 2005 | page = 614 }}</ref> With the West more accessible than ever before, 30,000 East Germans made the crossing via Czechoslovakia in the first two days alone. To try to stem the outward flow of the population, the SED proposed a concessionary law loosening restrictions on travel. When the ''Volkskammer'' rejected this on 5 November, the Cabinet and the [[Politburo]] of the GDR resigned.<ref name="Postwar 614" /> It left only one avenue open for Krenz and the SED, that of completely abolishing travel restrictions between East and West.

On 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing freely into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time in nearly 30 years. Krenz resigned a month later, and the SED opened negotiations with the leaders of the incipient Democratic movement, [[Neues Forum]], to schedule free elections and begin the process of democratization. As part of this, the SED eliminated the clause in the East German constitution guaranteeing the Communists leadership of the state. This was approved in the ''Volkskammer'' on 1 December 1989 by a vote of 420 to 0.<ref name="Postwar">{{cite book |title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |first = Tony |last = Judt |year = 2005 |page = 615 }}</ref>

East Germany held [[East German general election, 1990|its last elections in March 1990]]. The winner was a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations ([[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany|2+4]] Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the ''[[Volkskammer]]'' on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original [[New states of Germany|East German states]] that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]]). On 1 July a currency union preceded the political union: the "Ostmark" was abolished, and the Western German "Deutsche Mark" became common currency.

Although the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions and qualifications; some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic now recognising each other as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P. |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for Unification by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.

The great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies required government subsidy for the full integration of the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the resulting [[deindustrialization]] in the former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient [[command economy]]. But many East German critics contend that the [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock-therapy]] style of [[privatization]], the artificially high [[rate of exchange]] offered for the [[East German mark|Ostmark]], and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.<ref>For example, the economist Jörg Roesler{{snd}}see: Jörg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war möglich. Alternative Programme für das wirtschaftliche Zusammengehen beider deutscher Staaten, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.34-46. The historian Ulrich Busch argued that the currency union came too early; see Ulrich Busch: Die Währungsunion am 1. Juli 1990: Wirtschaftspolitische Fehlleistung mit Folgen, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.&nbsp;5&ndash;24.</ref>

There were four periods in East German political history.<ref>David P. Conradt, ''The German Polity'' (2008) p. 20</ref> These included: 1949–61, which saw the building of socialism; 1961–1970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971–85 was termed the [[Honecker]] Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985–89 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.

===Organization===
{{Further|Constitution of East Germany}}

The ruling political party in East Germany was the ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.<ref name="ReferenceB">Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890–1990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref>

The Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to supporting a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets' understanding of democracy was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet-bloc countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:
* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), which merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.
* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD). The party merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.
* ''Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]], LDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.
* ''Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)|National Democratic Party of Germany]], NDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED, and had to accept its "[[vanguard party|leading role]]" as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.

The Volkskammer also included representatives from the ''[[mass movement|mass organisations]]'' like the [[Free German Youth]] (''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' or ''FDJ''), or the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]. There was also a [[Democratic Women's Federation of Germany]], with seats in the Volkskammer.

Important non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (''Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund'' or ''[[DTSB]]''), and [[People's Solidarity]] (''Volkssolidarität''), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].

After the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the "[[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]]" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke''). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.<ref>Mary Elise Sarotte, ''1989: The Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe'' (Second Edition) Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014</ref>

The East German population declined by three million people throughout its forty-one year history, from 19&nbsp;million in 1948 to 16&nbsp;million in 1990; of the 1948 population, some 4&nbsp;million [[Expulsion of Germans|were deported]] from the lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], which made the home of millions of Germans part of Poland and the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.populstat.info/Europe/germanec.htm |title=East Germany: country population |publisher=Populstat.info |access-date=28 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811041417/http://www.populstat.info/Europe/germanec.htm |archive-date=11 August 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> This was a stark contrast from Poland, which increased during that time; from 24&nbsp;million in 1950 (a little more than East Germany) to 38&nbsp;million (more than twice of East Germany's population).

{{Main|Administrative divisions of East Germany|List of leaders of administrative divisions of East Germany}}

Until 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, [[East Berlin]] (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]], their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the [[Middle Germany|Middle German]] ''Länder'' (states) and ''Provinzen'' ([[provinces of Prussia]]). The western parts of two provinces, [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]] and [[Lower Silesia]], the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.

The [[East German Administrative Reform of 1952]] established 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts) and ''de facto'' disestablished the five ''Länder''. The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.

East Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.

== Military ==
[[File:Nva-ehrenwache.jpg|thumb|right|upright|East German ''[[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]'' changing-of-the-guard ceremony in East Berlin]]
The government of East Germany had control over a large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945–92), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.

=== National People's Army ===
{{Main|National People's Army}}
The Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]]. It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month [[conscription]] period was introduced in 1962. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
It was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|title=East German Military: Warsaw Pact's Finest|first1=Bernard E.|last1=Trainor|date=8 November 1988|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801003742/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>
The NVA consisted of the following branches:
* Army ''([[Landstreitkräfte]])''
* Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]''{{snd}}People's Navy)
* Air Force ''([[Luftstreitkräfte der NVA|Luftstreitkräfte/Luftverteidigung]])''

=== Border troops ===
{{Main|Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic}}

The border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.

=== Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft ===
{{Main|Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft}}

After the NVA was separated from the [[Volkspolizei]] in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the [[Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft|Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB)]]. These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.

=== Stasi ===
{{main|Stasi}}
The Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.

=== Combat groups of the working class ===
The ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a "party Army". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politbüro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.

=== Conscientious objection ===
{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}

Every man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former [[construction soldier]]s were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.

=== United States as primary threat ===

The East German state propaganda promoted an "[[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]" line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.<ref>[[Mark Allinson]], ''Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany 1945–1968'' (2000) ch 1</ref>  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov]]'s theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. supported network [[Radio Free Europe]]. The East German state propaganda promoted love for Russia, the "great Socialist Soviet Union" helping "democratic forces" dismantle the "monopoly capitalists."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Applebaum |first1=Anne |title=Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe |date=2013 |publisher=First Anchor Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-9593-3 |page=304 |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoSGzXQln_oC |access-date=August 28, 2020}}</ref> East German propagandists also had a strong anti-U.S. line in support of Russian imperialism.

=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin]]

After receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972–73, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]] in support of Russian expansion. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and socialist [[Derg|Ethiopia]]), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.

Already in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's [[MPLA]], Mozambique's [[FRELIMO]] and the [[PAIGC]] in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: [[People's Republic of the Congo]], [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somali Democratic Republic]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], and the [[People's Republic of Benin]].

The first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.

It was estimated that altogether, 2000–4000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |page=184 |title=Moscow's Third World Strategy |isbn=0-691-02332-8 |last1=Rubinstein |first1=Alvin Z. |date=16 July 1990 |access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201040239/https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |archive-date=1 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0619-306, Trabant 601.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trabant]] automobile was a profitable product made in the German Democratic Republic.]]

The East German economy began poorly because of the devastation caused by the Second World War; the loss of so many young soldiers, the disruption of business and transportation, the allied bombing campaigns that decimated cities, and reparations owed to the USSR. The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref name="Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9"/>

The socialist [[centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent. This made the East German economy the richest in all of the [[Soviet Bloc]] until reunification in 1990.<ref name="Econ stats">{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109185421/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 November 2007|title=Business America.

Notable East German exports were [[camera|photographic cameras]], under the [[Praktica]] brand; automobiles under the [[Trabant]], [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]], and the [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|IFA]] brands; hunting rifles, [[sextant]]s, [[typewriter]]s and [[watch|wristwatches]].

Until the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of basic foodstuffs such as [[sugar]] and [[coffee]]. East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.

The government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as "the second pay packet".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), "Social policy as an institutional transformation problem", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM).<ref>Jonathan R. Zatlin, ''The Currency of Socialism: Money and Political Culture in East Germany'' (2007)</ref> 
Economic issues would also persist in the east of Germany after the reunification of the west and the east, James Hawes in his book 'the shortest history of Germany'. Quotes from the federal office of political education (23 June 2009) 'In 1991 alone, 153 billion Deutschmarks had to be transferred to eastern Germany to secure incomes, support businesses and improve infrastructure... by 1999 the total had amounted to 1.634 trillion Marks net... The sums were so large that public debt in Germany more than doubled.'<ref>The shortest history of Germany, James Hawes (2018), federal office of political education [23 June 2009]</ref>

In 1950, 85% of the GDR citizens were [[Protestants]], while 10% were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. In 1961, the renowned philosophical theologian [[Paul Tillich]] claimed that the Protestant population in East Germany had the most admirable Church in Protestantism, because the Communists there had not been able to win a spiritual victory over them.<ref>Paul Tillich. Christianity and the Encounter of the World Religions (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), p. 20.</ref> By 1989, membership in the Christian churches dropped significantly. Protestants constituted 25% of the population, Catholics 5%. The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.

===State atheism===
{{Further|State atheism|Irreligion in Germany}}

When it first came to power, the Communist party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first the promotion of [[Marxist-Leninist atheism]] received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced.{{by whom|date=September 2015}} This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.<ref>Fulbrook, "The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR"</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0613-039, Sitzung des Martin-Luther-Komitees.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|A 1980 meeting between representatives of the BEK and Erich Honecker]]

East Germany, historically, was majority [[Protestant]] (primarily [[Lutheran]]) from the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the [[Nazism|Nazi-oriented]] [[German Christians (movement)|German Christians]], [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]] and [[united and uniting churches|United churches]] from most parts of Germany came together as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (''Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach'').

In 1969 the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and [[East Berlin]]{{NoteTag|The Eastern churches were the [[Evangelical Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] (EKiBB, East Ambit, for East Berlin and Brandenburg), [[Evangelical Church of Silesia|Evangelical Church of the Görlitz Ecclesiastical Region]], [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church#Evangelical Church in Greifswald|Evangelical Church in Greifswald]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony]], [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony]] (KPS), [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia]] and [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] (East Region, for EKiBB-East Ambit, Görlitz, Greifswald and KPS, and since 1970 for Anhalt too).}} broke away from the EKD and formed the ''Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic'' ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] ''Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine''. In June 1991, following the [[German reunification]], the BEK churches again merged with the EKD ones.

Between 1956 and 1971 the [[leadership]] of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation.<ref>Martin Onnasch, "Konflikt und Kompromiss: Die Haltung der evangelischen Kirchen zu den gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen in der DDR am Anfang der fünfziger Jahre," ["Conflict and compromise: the position of the Protestant churches with regard to social changes in the GDR at the beginning of the 1950s"], ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte / Halbjahresschrift für Theologie und Geschichtswisseschaft,'' 1990, Vol. 3 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;152–165.</ref> From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name="Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86">Stephen R. Bowers, "Private Institutions in Service to the State: The German Democratic Republic's Church in Socialism," ''East European Quarterly,'' Spring 1982, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;73–86.</ref>

[[Manfred Stolpe]] became a lawyer for the Brandenburg Protestant Church in 1959 before taking up a position at church headquarters in Berlin. In 1969 he helped found the ''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR'' (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.

Apart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]]. The [[Moravian Church]] also had its presence as the ''Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine''. There were also other Protestants such as [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Adventists]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Quakers]].

===Catholicism===

The smaller Catholic Church in eastern Germany had a fully functioning episcopal hierarchy that was in full accord with the Vatican. During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.<ref name="Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86"/>

After 1945 the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bernd Schaefer|title= The East German State and the Catholic Church, 1945-1989|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|year= 2010|publisher= Berghahn Books|isbn= 978-1-84545-852-2|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062014/https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|archive-date= 3 June 2016|url-status= live}} ch 1</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}

With a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns. The government responded by limiting international contacts for bishops.<ref>{{cite book|author= Adrian Webb|title= Routledge Companion to Central and Eastern Europe since 1919|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=omjBEYM3IK4C&pg=PA185|year= 2008|publisher= Taylor & Francis|page= 185|isbn= 978-0-203-92817-2|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160427110838/https://books.google.com/books?id=omjBEYM3IK4C&pg=PA185|archive-date= 27 April 2016|url-status= live}}</ref>{{qn|date=September 2015}}

East Germany's culture was strongly influenced by communist thought and was marked by an attempt to define itself in opposition to the west, particularly West Germany and the United States. Critics of the East German state{{who|date=November 2015}} have claimed that the state's commitment to Communism was a hollow and cynical tool, [[Machiavelli]]an in nature, but this assertion has been challenged by studies{{which|date=November 2014}} that have found that the East German leadership was genuinely committed to the advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress. However, Pence and Betts argue, the majority of East Germans over time increasingly regarded the state's ideals to be hollow, though there was also a substantial number of East Germans who regarded their culture as having a healthier, more authentic mentality than that of West Germany.<ref>Pence and Betts, ''Socialist modern: East German everyday culture and politics''. page 37 for Maaz, 58.</ref>

West German television and radio could be received in many parts of the East. The Western influence led to the formation of more "underground" groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands – the so-called [[Die anderen Bands]] ("the other bands") – were [[Die Skeptiker]], {{ill|Die Art|de}} and [[Feeling B]]. Additionally, [[hip hop]] culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' and ''[[Wild Style]]'', young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop culture of their own.<ref>Brown, Timothy S.

The government of the GDR was invested in both promoting the tradition of German [[classical music]], and in supporting composers to write new works in that tradition. Notable East German composers include [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Paul Dessau]], [[Ernst Hermann Meyer]], [[Rudolf Wagner-Régeny]], and [[Kurt Schwaen]].

The birthplace of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750), [[Eisenach]], was rendered as a museum about him, featuring more than three hundred instruments, which, in 1980, received some 70,000 visitors.

=== Cinema ===
The prolific cinema of East Germany was headed by the [[DEFA]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defa-stiftung.de |title=DEFA{{snd}}Stiftung{{snd}}Home |publisher=Defa-stiftung.de |access-date=28 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426152958/http://www.defa-stiftung.de/ |archive-date=26 April 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Deutsche Film AG'', which was subdivided in different local groups, for example ''Gruppe Berlin'', ''Gruppe [[Babelsberg]]'' or ''Gruppe [[Johannisthal (Berlin)|Johannisthal]]'', where the local teams shot and produced films. The East German industry became known worldwide for its productions, especially children's movies (''[[Das kalte Herz]]'', film versions of the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales and modern productions such as ''[[Das Schulgespenst]]''). {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Frank Beyer]]'s ''[[Jacob the Liar (1975 film)|Jakob der Lügner]]'' (Jacob the Liar), about [[the Holocaust]], and ''[[Fünf Patronenhülsen]]'' (Five Cartridges), about resistance against fascism, became internationally famous.<ref>Beate Müller, ''Stasi-Zensur-Machtdiskurse: Publikationsgeschichten und Materialien zu Jurek Beckers Werk'' (Berlin: Max Niemeyer, 2006), 129-30. {{ISBN|978-3-484-35110-3}}</ref>

Films about daily life, such as ''[[The Legend of Paul and Paula|Die Legende von Paul und Paula]]'', by [[Heiner Carow]], and ''[[Solo Sunny]]'', directed by [[Konrad Wolf]] and [[Wolfgang Kohlhaase]], were very popular. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The film industry was remarkable for its production of ''[[Ostern]]'', or Western-like movies. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in these films often took the role of displaced people who fight for their rights, in contrast to the [[Western (genre)|North American westerns]] of the time, where they were often either not mentioned at all or are portrayed as the villains. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavs]] were often cast as Native Americans because of the small number of Native Americans in Europe. [[Gojko Mitić]] was well known in these roles, often playing the righteous, kindhearted and charming [[Tribal chief|chief]] (''[[The Sons of Great Bear|Die Söhne der großen Bärin]]'' directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became an honorary [[Sioux]] chief when he visited the United States in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his movies. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several films. These films were part of the phenomenon of Europe producing alternative films about the colonization of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Cinemas in the GDR also showed foreign films. Czechoslovak and Polish productions were more common, but certain western movies were shown, though the numbers of these were limited because it cost foreign exchange to buy the licences. Further, films representing or glorifying what the state viewed as capitalist ideology were not bought. Comedies enjoyed great popularity, such as the Danish ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' or movies with the French comedian [[Louis de Funès]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, several films depicting life in the GDR have been critically acclaimed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some of the most notable were ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' by [[Wolfgang Becker]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Roger F.|date=28 June 2007|title=Good Bye, Lenin! : Free-Market Nostalgia for Socialist Consumerism|journal=Seminar: A Journal of Germanic Studies|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=206–219|doi=10.1353/smr.2007.0027|s2cid=201759614|issn=1911-026X}}</ref> ''[[The Lives of Others|Das Leben der Anderen]]'' (The Lives of Others) by [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]] (won the [[Academy Award]] for best Film in a Foreign Language) in 2006,<ref name="test">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/awards 2006 Academy Award for "The Lives of Others"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010025327/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/awards |date=10 October 2011 }},</ref>  and ''[[Alles auf Zucker!]]'' (Go for Zucker) by Dani Levi.

=== Sport ===
East Germany was very successful in the sports of [[cycling]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weight-lifting]], swimming, gymnastics, track and field, [[boxing]], [[ice skating]], and winter sports. The success is largely attributed to [[doping in East Germany|doping]] under the direction of [[Manfred Höppner]], a sports doctor, described as the architect of East Germany's state-sponsored drug program.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Helmstaedt |first1=Karin |title=East German Doping Trial |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/east-german-doping-trial/article4165918/ |access-date=5 September 2019 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=19 July 2000 |location=Berlin}}</ref>

</ref> Another factor for success was the furtherance system for young people in GDR. Sport teachers at school were encouraged to look for certain talents in children ages 6 to 10 years old. For older pupils it was possible to attend grammar schools with a focus on sports (for example sailing, football and swimming). This policy was also used for talented pupils with regard to music or mathematics. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Sports clubs were highly subsidized, especially sports in which it was possible to get international fame. For example, the major leagues for ice hockey and basketball just included 2 teams each. [[Association football|Football]] was the most popular sport. Club football teams such as [[Dynamo Dresden]], [[1. FC Magdeburg]], [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena]], [[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig]] and [[BFC Dynamo]] had successes in European competition. Many East German players such as [[Matthias Sammer]] and [[Ulf Kirsten]] became integral parts of the reunified national football team.

=== Television and radio ===
Television and radio in East Germany were state-run industries; the ''[[Rundfunk der DDR]]'' was the official radio broadcasting organisation from 1952 until unification. The organization was based in the ''Funkhaus Nalepastraße'' in East Berlin. ''[[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]]'' (DFF), from 1972 to 1990 known as ''Fernsehen der DDR'' or DDR-FS, was the state television broadcaster from 1952. Reception of Western broadcasts was widespread.<ref name=Cooke>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7ajL_aNu6oC&pg=PA146 |page=146 |title=Representing East Germany Since Unification: From Colonization to Nostalgia |isbn=978-1-84520-189-0 |last1=Cooke |first1=Paul |date=August 2005 |access-date=14 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326211319/http://books.google.com/books?id=H7ajL_aNu6oC&pg=PA146 |archive-date=26 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The sexual culture of both German districts was different.

== Industry ==

=== Telecommunications ===
{{further|Telecommunications in Germany|Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc}}

By the mid-1980s, East Germany possessed a well-developed communications system. There were approximately 3.6&nbsp;million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[Teletypewriter message|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.

An unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long-distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.

In 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[Fürstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].

== Legacy ==

[[Margot Honecker]], former Minister for Education of East Germany and wife of Erich Honecker, the East German head of state, said:

{{quote|In this state, each person had a place. All children could attend school free of charge, they received vocational training or studied, and were guaranteed a job after training. Work was more than just a means to earn money. Men and women received equal pay for equal work and performance. Equality for women was not just on paper. Care for children and the elderly was the law. Medical care was free, cultural and leisure activities affordable. Social security was a matter of course. We knew no beggars or homelessness. There was a sense of solidarity. People felt responsible not only for themselves, but worked in various democratic bodies on the basis of common interests.<ref>[http://www.workers.org/articles/2015/11/16/interview-with-the-gdrs-margot-honecker-the-past-was-brought-back/ Interview with the GDR’s Margot Honecker — 'The past was brought back'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221133853/http://www.workers.org/articles/2015/11/16/interview-with-the-gdrs-margot-honecker-the-past-was-brought-back |date=21 December 2015 }}, ''[[Workers World]]'', 16 November 2015</ref>}}

In contrast, German historian [[Jürgen Kocka]] in 2010 summarized the consensus of most recent scholarship:

{{quote|Conceptualizing the GDR as a dictatorship has become widely accepted, while the meaning of the concept dictatorship varies.

Many East Germans initially regarded the dissolution of the GDR positively,<ref>Martin Blum, "Remaking the East German Past: 'Ostalgie,' Identity, and Material Culture," ''Journal of Popular Culture,'' Winter 2000, Vol. 34 Issue 3, pp.&nbsp;229–54.</ref> but this reaction soon turned sour.<ref>{{cite book |first = Leonie |last = Naughton |title=That Was the Wild East: Film Culture, Unification, and the "New" Germany |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AugFhjJZz0QC&pg=PA14|year=2002|publisher=U. of Michigan Press|page=14|isbn=978-0-472-08888-1 |access-date = 14 October 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160521031132/https://books.google.com/books?id=AugFhjJZz0QC&pg=PA14|archive-date=21 May 2016|url-status=live }}</ref> West Germans often acted as if they had "won" and East Germans had "lost" in unification, leading many East Germans (''Ossis'') to resent West Germans (''Wessis'').<ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last = Bickford |title=Fallen Elites: The Military Other in Post-Unification Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sELghp1BIbgC&pg=PA10|year=2011|publisher=Stanford U.P.|page=10|isbn=978-0-8047-7396-6 |access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427060712/https://books.google.com/books?id=sELghp1BIbgC&pg=PA10|archive-date=27 April 2016|url-status=live }}</ref> In 2004, Ascher Barnstone wrote, "East Germans resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West Germans see the East Germans as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing.

Unification and subsequent federal policies led to serious economic hardships for many East Germans that had not existed before the Wende. Unemployment and homelessness, which had been minimal during the communist era, grew and quickly became widespread; this, as well as the closures of countless factories and other workplaces in the east, fostered a growing sense that East Germans were being ignored or neglected by the federal government.

In addition, many East German women found the west more appealing, and left the region never to return, leaving behind an underclass of poorly educated and jobless men.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Connolly |title=Educated women leave east German men behind |date=2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/01/germany.kateconnolly |access-date=16 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117063245/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/01/germany.kateconnolly |archive-date=17 November 2018 |url-status=live |newspaper=The Guardian }}</ref>

These and other effects of unification led many East Germans to begin to think of themselves more strongly as "East" Germans rather than as simply "Germans". In many former GDR citizens this produced a longing for some aspects of the former East Germany, such as full employment and other perceived benefits of the GDR state, termed "[[Ostalgie]]" (a [[Blend word|blend]] of {{lang|de|Ost}} "east" and {{lang|de|Nostalgie}} "nostalgia") and depicted in the [[Wolfgang Becker]] film ''[[Goodbye Lenin!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://generic.wordpress.soton.ac.uk/cifr/2017/10/02/rewriting-ideal-history-the-ostalgie-expression-in-goodbye-lenin-2003/ |title=Rewriting ideal history: The Ostalgie expression in Goodbye, Lenin (2003)  |access-date=9 July 2020 }}</ref>
