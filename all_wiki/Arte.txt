'''Arte''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|r|ˈ|t|eɪ}}; '''{{lang|fr|Association relative à la télévision européenne}}''', sometimes stylized in lowercase or uppercase in its logo) is a [[European Union|European public service]] [[Television channel|channel]] that promotes [[Culture|cultural]] programming. 

It is made up of three separate companies: the [[Strasbourg]]-based [[European Economic Interest Grouping]] ARTE GEIE, plus two member companies acting as editorial and programme production centres, ARTE France in [[Paris]] (France) and ARTE Deutschland in [[Baden-Baden]] (Germany). As an international joint venture (an EEIG), its programmes focuses to audiences in both countries. Due to this, the channel features two audio tracks and two subtitle tracks, each in [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].

80% of ARTE's programming are provided by its French and German subsidiaries, each making half of the programmes available, while the remainder is being provided by the European subsidiary and the channel's European partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/qui-sommes-nous-cluster/publications/?lang=en|title=How is ARTE funded? - ARTE Entreprise|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref>

ARTE France was formerly known as [[La Sept]]. ARTE Deutschland TV GmbH is a subsidiary of the two main public German TV networks [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]].

Selected programmes are available with [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] subtitles online.<ref name="Pressemitteilung: Der europäische Kultursender Arte jetzt auch auf Englisch und Spanisch">[http://presse.arte.tv/apios/press_release/1757.pdf Pressemitteilung: Der europäische Kultursender Arte jetzt auch auf Englisch und Spanisch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216113315/http://presse.arte.tv/apios/press_release/1757.pdf |date=16 February 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.arte.tv/sites/services/arte-desormais-en-cinq-langues/|title=Avec le polonais, ARTE désormais en cinq langues - Services|newspaper=Services|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/what-we-do/|title=What we do|last=ARTE|website=ARTE Entreprise|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:2011 Arte Strasbourg.JPG|thumb|left|The ARTE building in [[Strasbourg]]]]

ARTE began [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in 1992, filling frequencies left unused by the demise of [[La Cinq]], the first French commercial television network (created in 1986). The opening night on 30 May 1992 was broadcast live from the [[Strasbourg Opera House]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The founding of ARTE|url=http://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/the-founding-of-arte-2/?lang=en|publisher=arte.tv|accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref>

ARTE started out as an evening-only service. In the daytime, the frequencies were shared with other channels. A public channel called ''Télé emploi'' occupied the French frequencies for about a month during 1994, before the start of La Cinquième (''now [[France 5]]'') in December that year. For German viewers, ARTE was assigned a frequency on the [[Astra 1D]] satellite in late 1994, and it was eventually shared with [[Nickelodeon Germany]], later replaced by the new public children's channel [[Kinderkanal]].

In 1996, it started offering an afternoon schedule with reruns for viewers on digital satellite and digital cable. A "proper" afternoon schedule with programmes between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. was introduced on 6 January 2001.<ref>[http://download.pro.arte.tv/archives/bulletin/2001bul02.pdf A R T E M a g a z i n e], 6 January 2001</ref> The channel eventually got its own analogue frequency on the Astra satellites.

Since 2005 ARTE broadcasts 24/7. In 2007 the catch-up service ARTE+7 is launched, offering internet users free access to a broad range of programs within seven days of their original transmission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/category/subjects/die-ausstrahlung/?lang=en|title=Broadcasting Archives - ARTE Entreprise|website=ARTE Entreprise|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>

==Transmission and reception==
ARTE programmes are available with multi-channel audio: all programmes go out in French and in German. Furthermore the original version is screened whenever possible with subtitles in French and German and the hearing or visually impaired may get subtitles or an [[audio description]]. Since 2015 a selection of programmes are available with English and Spanish subtitles online, with Polish to follow in late 2016.<ref name="Arte setzt auf Themenabende">{{cite web|url=http://www.muensterschezeitung.de/Nachrichten/Kultur/2260089-Medien-Arte-setzt-auf-Themenabende|title=Arte setzt auf Themenabende|first=Münstersche|last=Zeitung|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref>

The channel enjoys a major footprint in Europe. Both the German and the French version can be received in nearly whole Europe via the satellite [[Astra (satellite)|Astra1]] (19, 2° East), the French version is also available via [[Hot Bird]] (13° East). In addition ARTE is relayed not only by all cable networks in Germany and France, but by numerous cable networks in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and in the Netherlands too.

Since 2008 ARTE broadcasts in [[High-definition television|HD]] in Germany and in France. Like the national channels of its own respective countries, the German [[High-definition television|HDTV]]version of ARTE broadcasts in [[720p50]], while the French one broadcasts in [[1080i25]]. In April 2016 ARTE co-produced (with [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] satellite owner, [[SES S.A.|SES]]) a live [[Ultra-high-definition television]] broadcast of the [[Le Corsaire]] ballet from the Vienna State Opera. The programme was transmitted free-to-air on the [[HD+|UHD1]] demonstration channel from the [[Astra 19.2°E]] satellites.<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/financialpost/20160329005926/en/SES-ARTE-Broadcast-Le-Corsaire-Ballet-Live ''SES and ARTE to Broadcast Le Corsaire Ballet Live in Ultra HD via Astra 19.2''] Business Wire. 29 March 2016. Accessed 27 April 2016</ref>

Online ARTE programmes can be streamed live or watched on catch-up TV for at least 7 and up to 700 days on [http://www.arte.tv/guide/plus7/ ARTE+7] and the theme platforms [http://concert.arte.tv ARTE Concert], [https://web.archive.org/web/20101221230818/http://creative.arte.tv/ Creative], [http://info.arte.tv Info], [http://future.arte.tv Future] or [http://cinema.arte.tv Cinema].

===International===
In Africa, ARTE is broadcast via [[Satellite television|satellite]], [[Cable television|cable]], [[MMDS]] and [[ADSL]] in many other countries, via the digital service [[CanalSat]] Horizons.
Many French-language ARTE programs are also broadcast in Canada on the [[Ici ARTV]] cable channel, partly owned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (85%) and ARTE itself (15%). The Australian [[Special Broadcasting Service]] translates many ARTE programs into English for broadcast on its own [[SBS Television|television network]] and overseas.

==Market Share==
ARTE usually has more viewers in France than in Germany. In 2015, its share of overall viewing was about 2.2% in France and about 1% in Germany.
The differences can be put down to the different television markets in both countries. In France, ARTE was for a long time available to almost everyone as one of six analogue terrestrial channels. Relatively few French households received cable and satellite television, and the other terrestrial channels didn't really compete with ARTE. Meanwhile, thanks to widespread roll-out of cable television, the vast majority of German households had access to about three dozen channels, including several from the public broadcasters with content similar to Arte.<ref>[http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_454-544-1-30.pdf Zehn Jahre arte]</ref> After the introduction of [[digital terrestrial television in France]], ARTE's market share has fallen there, while it has been more or less flat in Germany.
