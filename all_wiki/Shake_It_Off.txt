"'''Shake It Off'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Co-written by Swift and its producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], "Shake It Off" is an [[uptempo]] [[dance-pop]] song featuring a [[saxophone]] line in its instrumentation. The lyrics are about Swift's indifference to her detractors and their negative comments on her image, inspired by the media scrutiny that she had experienced. It was the lead single from her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', which Swift marketed as her first [[pop music|pop]] album that eschewed the [[country pop]] sound of her previous repertoire. The song was released for digital download worldwide on August 18, 2014, by [[Big Machine Records]].

Contemporary critics received "Shake It Off" with moderate reviews. They found the song's dance-pop production catchy, but lamented that the lyrics were not up to par with Swift's traditional vivid songwriting. Retrospectively, critics have considered "Shake It Off" the effective opener for the ''1989'' era, which transformed Swift's sound and image from a country singer-songwriter to a pop star.<!-- <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_asia/features/every-taylor-swift-song-ranked-2747916|title=Every Taylor Swift song ranked in order of greatness|first=Hannah|last=Mylrae|work=[[NME]]|date=September 8, 2020|accessdate=November 26, 2020}}</ref> --> The song featured on 2010s-decade-end lists by ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Consequence of Sound]]''.

It also topped charts in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, New Zealand, Poland and Slovakia.

The single was supported by a music video directed by [[Mark Romanek]]. In the video, Swift portrays a clumsy person attempting to practice several dance moves without success. To further promote the song, Swift performed live on televised events including the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[iHeartRadio Music Festival]]. She included "Shake It Off" on the [[set list]]s for two of her world tours, [[the 1989 World Tour]] (2015) and [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018). The song won Favorite Song at the [[41st People's Choice Awards|2015 People's Choice Awards]], and received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards|2015 Grammy Awards]].<!-- <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/12/05/grammy-nominations-a-strange-way-to-announce-musics-biggest-awards/|title=Grammy nominations: Beyoncé, Sam Smith, Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea and more|work=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/11/05/sam-smith-pharrell-taylor-swift-lead-2015-peoples-choice-nominations/ | title= Sam Smith, Pharrell, Taylor Swift Lead 2015 People's Choice Nominations | date= November 5, 2014 | publisher= CBS Chicago | accessdate= March 13, 2015}}</ref> -->

Lyrically, the song is dedicated to Swift's detractors. She has discussed this, saying, "I’ve learned a pretty tough lesson that people can say whatever they want about us at any time, and we cannot control that. The only thing we can control is our reaction to that."<ref name="Time">{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3138525/taylor-swift-shake-it-off-1989/|title=Watch Taylor Swift Show Off Her Dance Moves in New 'Shake It Off' Video|first=Nolan|last=Feeney|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref> In an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Swift elaborated:

<blockquote>
I've had every part of my life dissected—my choices, my actions, my words, my body, my style, my music. When you live your life under that kind of scrutiny, you can either let it break you, or you can get really good at dodging punches. And when one lands, you know how to deal with it. And I guess the way that I deal with it is to shake it off.<ref name="RS">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-dismisses-the-haters-dances-with-fans-for-new-song-shake-it-off-20140818|title=Taylor Swift Dismisses the Haters in New Song 'Shake It Off'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

In an October 2014 ''NPR'' interview, Swift spoke about the lyrical message of the song in relation to her previous work and a desire to reclaim the "narrative":

<blockquote>
With the song 'Shake It Off,' I really wanted to kind of take back the narrative, and have more of a sense of humor about people who kind of get under my skin&nbsp;– and not let them get under my skin. There's a song that I wrote a couple years ago called "[[Mean (song)|Mean]]," where I addressed the same issue but I addressed it very differently. I said, "Why you gotta be so mean?," from kind of a victimized perspective, which is how we all approach bullying or gossip when it happens to us for the first time. But in the last few years I've gotten better at just kind of laughing off things that absolutely have no bearing on my real life. I think it's important to be self-aware about what people are saying about you, but even more so, be very aware of who you actually are, and to have that be the main priority.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melissa Block|title='Anything That Connects': A Conversation With Taylor Swift|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/31/359827368/anything-that-connects-a-conversation-with-taylor-swift|website=NPR|publisher=NPR|accessdate=30 January 2015|format=Audio upload and transcript|date=31 October 2014}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===2014 Triple J Hottest 100===
Following a January 13, 2015 article on [[BuzzFeed]] titled "Why Isn't Everyone Voting For 'Shake It Off' In The Hottest 100?" by Mark Di Stefano, the "#Tay4Hottest100" [[hashtag]] campaign began during the voting period for the [[Triple J Hottest 100]] radio poll for 2014. The campaign led to a significant amount of media coverage as Australian music fans debated the merits of Swift's inclusion in the poll, including the potential for a number-one ranking. According to those critical of the campaign, the Hottest 100 is reserved for non-mainstream artists who were "discovered or fostered by Triple J." and provides valuable exposure for artists in the outer circles of the music industry.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Peter Vincent|title=Triple J Hottest 100: Has Taylor Swift been dumped from contention due to KFC ad?|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/triple-j-hottest-100-has-taylor-swift-been-dumped-from-contention-due-to-kfc-ad-20150120-12u1gi.html|accessdate=January 23, 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=January 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Sarah Smith|title=Flight Facilities weigh in on Taylor Swift Hottest 100 furore|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/59825/Flight_Facilities_weigh_in_on_Taylor_Swift_Hottest_100_furore|website=inthemix|publisher=inthemix Pty Ltd|accessdate=January 23, 2015|date=January 20, 2015}}</ref> Accusations of cultural elitism surfaced during the campaign, with the ''[[Guardian Australia|Guardian]]''{{'}}s Elle Hunt writing: "the virulent response to #Tay4Hottest100 has revealed the persistence of a dichotomy I'd thought we'd thrown out long ago: that of high art versus low."<ref>{{cite news|author1=Elle Hunt|title=#Tay4Hottest100: Taylor Swift campaign shows it's time for Triple J to shake off cultural elitism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/19/tay4hottest100-taylor-swift-campaign-shows-its-time-for-triple-j-to-shake-off-cultural-elitism|accessdate=January 21, 2015|work=The Guardian|date=January 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Di Stefano|title=Why Isn't Everyone Voting For "Shake It Off" In The Hottest 100?|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/tay-4-hottest100#.gmLzd8y1p|website=BuzzFeed|publisher=BuzzFeed, Inc|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref>

Station manager Chris Scaddan told the media that the Swift campaign is within the rules of the poll, later instructing Triple J employees not to comment to "media, friends, family" about the campaign, as "it will all become clear when we get to the countdown next Monday." The station said: "we don't comment on voting campaigns while Hottest 100 voting is open. It draws attention to them and may influence the results of the poll."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Joe Harris|title=The Guardian Says Triple J Are "Sexist" For Ignoring Taylor Swift, & That's Just Dumb|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/432757/guardian-triple-j-sexist-taylor-swift.htm|website=Tone Deaf|publisher=Tone Deaf|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=January 20, 2015}}</ref> Marketing website Mumbrella suggested on January 20 that a Facebook post by [[KFC]] incorporating the "#Tay4Hottest100" hashtag was against the Hottest 100 rules and could see Swift disqualified.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Christensen|first1=Nic|title=KFC Facebook post may have disqualified Taylor Swift campaign from Triple J Hottest 100 list|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/abc-coy-taylor-swifts-hottest-100-eligibility-kfc-tries-jump-tay4hottest100-bandwagon-271943|website=Mumbrella|accessdate=January 22, 2015|date=January 20, 2015}}</ref> Also on January 20, the ''Guardian'' submitted a freedom of information request to the ABC in regard to the station's response to the campaign.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Elle Hunt|title=Taylor Swift fans have spoken – but will Triple J's Hottest 100 listen?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/20/taylor-swift-fans-have-spoken-but-will-triple-js-hottest-100-listen|accessdate=January 21, 2015|work=The Guardian|date=January 20, 2015}}</ref>

After journalist Peter Vincent reported that the Swift campaign had "swallowed" the Hottest 100 for 2014, citing research from the [[University of Queensland]] that showed that over 7,341 Hottest 100 posts in a 30-day period leading up to the poll results related to Swift, "Shake It Off" was eventually disqualified by the radio station in an announcement on January 26, 2015. The official announcement read: "it became pretty clear, pretty quick that a lot of people just wanted to prod some 'hipsters' for the lulz", acknowledging that the station "had a heap of fun", while Swift is "smart", "cool" and "successful". The song would have placed in the number 12 position if it had been allowed to compete.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Cameron Adams|title=Taylor Swift disqualified from Hottest 100|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/taylor-swift-disqualified-from-hottest-100/story-fnndfy6b-1227196860796|accessdate=January 26, 2015|work=News.com.au|date=January 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Peter Vincent|title=Taylor Swift campaign has swallowed Triple J Hottest 100|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/taylor-swift-campaign-has-swallowed-triple-j-hottest-100-20150123-12wfs1.html|accessdate=January 26, 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=January 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Lawsuits===
In November 2015 Jessie Braham, known by the stage name Jesse Graham, sued Swift for $42&nbsp;million in damages claiming Swift stole lines from his song "Haters Gonna Hate" stating that Swift's "hook is the same as mine" and that there would be no "Shake It Off" if he "hadn't written 'Haters Gonna Hate'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4096114/taylor-swift-lawsuit/|title=Taylor Swift Sued for $42 Million Over 'Shake It Off' Lyrics|first=Joanna|last=Plucinska|website=Time}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2015/11/taylor-swift-lawsuit-shake-it-off-lyrics/|title=Taylor Swift Is Being Sued for Allegedly Stealing 'Shake It Off' Lyrics|date=November 1, 2015|website=spin.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6746310/taylor-swift-sued-lyrics-shake-it-off|title=Taylor Swift Sued for Allegedly Lifting Lyrics to 'Shake it Off': Report|website=billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/11/04/taylor-swift-sued-alleged-plagiarism-shake-off/75156072/|title=Taylor Swift sued for alleged plagiarism in 'Shake It Off'|website=usatoday.com}}</ref> The lawsuit was dismissed by [[United States federal judge|United States District Court Judge]] Gail Standish and used Swift's own lyrics from "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]", "[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]", "[[Blank Space]]" and "Shake It Off", stating
<blockquote>
At present, the Court is not saying that Braham can never, ever, ever get his case back in court. But, for now, we have got problems, and the Court is not sure Braham can solve them. As currently drafted, the Complaint has a blank space -- one that requires Braham to do more than write his name. And, upon consideration of the Court's explanation ... Braham may discover that mere pleading BandAids will not fix the bullet holes in his case. At least for the moment, Defendants have shaken off this lawsuit.
</blockquote>
Standish ruled that Braham did not have enough factual evidence but could file a new complaint "if his lawsuit deficiencies are corrected."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/us/taylor-swift-copyright-lawsuit-dismissed/index.html|title=Taylor Swift shakes off copyright lawsuit|author1=Andreas Preuss |author2=Chris Isidore |author3=Samuel Burke|website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/judge-dismisses-taylor-swift-lawsuit|title=Shake It Off!
