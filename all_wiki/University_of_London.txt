In 1830, UCL applied for a royal charter as a university which would allow it to confer degrees.

In 1835, the government announced the response to UCL's petition for a charter. Two charters would be issued, one to UCL incorporating it as a college rather than a university, without degree awarding powers, and a second "establishing a Metropolitan University, with power to grant academical degrees to those who should study at the London University College, or at any similar institution which his Majesty might please hereafter to name".<ref name="millbanksystems4">{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1835/jul/30/london-university#S3V0029P0_18350730_HOC_24|publisher=hansard.millbanksystems.com|title=London University (Hansard, 30 July 1835)|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref>

Following the issuing of its charter on 28 November 1836, the new University of London started drawing up regulations for degrees in March 1837. The death of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] in June, however, resulted in a problem&nbsp;– the charter had been granted "during our Royal will and pleasure", meaning it was annulled by the king's death.<ref name="google3">{{cite book|title=The English Universities: From the German|author1=Huber, V.A.|author2=Newman, F.W.|date=1843|volume=3|publisher=William Pickering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZtRAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA565|page=565|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> Queen Victoria issued a second charter on 5 December 1837, reincorporating the university. The university awarded its first degrees in 1839, all to students from UCL and King's College.

The university established by the charters of 1836 and 1837 was essentially an examining board with the right to award degrees in arts, laws and medicine. However, the university did not have the authority to grant degrees in theology, considered the senior faculty in the other three English universities. In medicine, the university was given the right to determine which medical schools provided sufficient medical training. In arts and law, by contrast, it would examine students from UCL, King's College, or any other institution granted a royal warrant, effectively giving the government control of which institutions could submit students for examination by the university. Beyond this right to submit students for examination, there was no other connection between the colleges and the university.

In 1849 the university held its first graduation ceremony at [[Somerset House]] following a petition to the senate from the graduates, who had previously received their degrees without any ceremony. About 250 students graduated at this ceremony. The [[Academic dress of the University of London|London academic robes]] of this period were distinguished by their "rich velvet facings".<ref>{{cite news |title=University of London |work=Morning Chronicle |date=11 May 1849 |access-date=14 December 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000082/18490511/017/0007| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

The list of institutions whose students could enter University of London examinations grew rapidly by 1858, including all other British universities as well as over 30 other schools and colleges outside of London. In that year, a new charter opened up the examinations to everyone, effectively abolishing the weak link between the university and the colleges.<ref>{{cite book|work=An Account of the Reconstruction of the University of London, Part 1|title= The Abolition of the Collegiate System|pages= 8–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Du4lNR4izwC&pg=PA8|author=William Henry Allchin|publisher=H.

The University, which was intended "to perform all the functions of the Examiners in the Senate House of Cambridge" although limited to the duty of examination, admitted to its examinations only those students who had gone through a course of study at University or King's College or some other "approved institution." The list of these "approved institutions" rapidly expanded. In 1850 a supplemental Charter admitted the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and their several Colleges, but a number of institutions of varying character and status had also been added by the Crown from time to time}}</ref> This led the [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Earl of Kimberley]], a member of the university's senate, to tell the House of Lords in 1888 "that there were no Colleges affiliated to the University of London, though there were some many years ago".<ref name="millbanksystems5">{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1888/aug/11/consideration-of-commons-amendments#S3V0330P0_18880811_HOL_23|publisher=hansard.millbanksystems.com|title=Consideration of Commons' Amendments (Hansard, 11 August 1888)|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> The reforms of 1858 also incorporated the graduates of the university into a [[Convocation ceremony|convocation]], similar to those of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, and authorised the granting of degrees in science, the first BSc being awarded in 1860.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOd3N6291CQC&pg=PA5|title=The University of London, 1858–1900: The Politics of Senate and Convocation|author=Francis Michael Glenn Willson|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|page=5|isbn=9781843830658}}</ref>

The expanded role meant the university needed more space, particularly with the growing number of students at the provincial [[university college#United Kingdom|university colleges]]. Between 1867 and 1870 a new headquarters was built at [[6 Burlington Gardens]], providing the university with exam halls and offices.

In 1863, via a fourth charter, the university gained the right to grant degrees in surgery.<ref name="google5">{{cite book|title=University of London, the Historical Record: (1836-1912) Being a Supplement to the Calendar, Completed to September 1912.

In 1878, the university set another first when it became the first university in the UK to admit women to degrees, via the grant of a supplemental charter. Four female students obtained Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1880 and two obtained Bachelor of Science degrees in 1881, again the first in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://london.ac.uk/about-us/history-university-london |title=University of London: Brief history |publisher=London.ac.uk |access-date=13 April 2010}}</ref>

In the late 19th century, the university came under criticism for merely serving as a centre for the administration of tests, and there were calls for a "teaching university" for London. UCL and KCL considered separating from the university to form a separate university, variously known as the Albert University, Gresham University and Westminster University. Following two [[royal commission]]s the University of London Act 1898 was passed, reforming the university and giving it a federal structure with responsibility for monitoring course content and academic standards within its institutions. This was implemented in 1900 with the approval of new statutes for the university.<ref name="UoL Future">{{citation|last=Grant|first=Malcolm|author-link=Malcolm Grant|title=The future of the University of London: a discussion paper from the Provost of UCL|pages=3–6| date=March 2005 |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/images/Uni-Lon.pdf}}</ref><gallery mode="packed" heights="175">

The reforms initiated by the 1898 act came into force with the approval of the new federal statutes in 1900. Many of the colleges in London became schools of the university, including UCL, King's College, [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] and the [[London School of Economics]]. [[Regent's Park College]], which had affiliated in 1841, became an official divinity school of the university in 1901 (the new statutes having given London the right to award degrees in theology) and [[Richmond Theological College|Richmond (Theological) College]] followed as a divinity school of the university in 1902; [[Goldsmiths College, University of London|Goldsmiths College]] joined in 1904; [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] was founded in 1907; [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] joined in 1915; the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] was founded in 1916; and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], which was founded in 1823, joined in 1920.

The previous provision for colleges outside London was not abandoned on federation, instead London offered two routes to degrees: "internal" degrees offered by schools of the university and "external" degrees offered at other colleges (now the [[University of London (Worldwide)|University of London flexible and distance learning programmes]]).

UCL and King's College, whose campaign for a teaching university in London had resulted in the university's reconstitution as a federal institution, went even further than becoming schools of the university and were actually merged into it. UCL's merger, under the 1905 University College London (Transfer) Act, happened in 1907. The charter of 1836 was surrendered and all of UCL's property became the University of London's. King's College followed in 1910 under the 1908 King's College London (Transfer) Act. This was a slightly more complicated case, as the theological department of the college (founded in 1846) did not merge into the university but maintained a separate legal existence under King's College's 1829 charter.<ref>{{cite book|title=University of London, the Historical Record: (1836–1912)|publisher=University of London|date=1912|pages=7–24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyPiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA7}}</ref>

The expansion of the university's role meant that the Burlington Garden premises were insufficient, and in March 1900 it moved to the Imperial Institute in South Kensington.<ref name="google6">{{cite book|title=The University of London, 1858-1900: The Politics of Senate and Convocation|author=Willson, F.M.G.|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=9781843830658|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOd3N6291CQC&pg=PA8|page=8|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> However, its continued rapid expansion meant that it had outgrown its new premises by the 1920s, requiring yet another move. A large parcel of land in [[Bloomsbury]] near the [[British Museum]] was acquired from [[Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford|the Duke of Bedford]] and [[Charles Holden]] was appointed architect with the instruction to create a building "not to suggest a passing fashion inappropriate to buildings which will house an institution of so permanent a character as a University." This unusual remit may have been inspired by the fact that [[William Beveridge]], having just become director of LSE, upon asking a taxi driver to take him to the University of London was met with the response "Oh, you mean the place near the [[Royal School of Needlework]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2003/11/senate_house_un.html |title=City of Sound |publisher=City of Sound |date=22 November 2003 |access-date=13 April 2010}}</ref> Holden responded by designing [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]], the current headquarters of the university, and at the time of completion the second largest building in London.<ref>{{cite web|author=Emporis GmbH |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=110747 |title=Emporis Buildings |publisher=Emporis.com |access-date=13 April 2010}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], the colleges of the university (with the exception of Birkbeck) and their students left London for safer parts of the UK, while Senate House was used by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], with its roof becoming an observation point for the [[Royal Observer Corps]]. Though the building was hit by bombs several times, it emerged from the war largely unscathed; rumour at the time had it that the reason the building had fared so well was that [[Adolf Hitler]] had planned to use it as his headquarters in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/botm/senate-house-bloomsbury-wc1|title=Senate House, Bloomsbury, WC1&nbsp;— The Twentieth Century Society|work=c20society.org.uk}}</ref>

The latter half of the last century was less eventful. In 1948, Athlone Press was founded as the publishing house for the university, and sold to the Bemrose Corporation in 1979,<ref name="AIM25">{{Citation | author=Archives in London & the M25 area (AIM25) |chapter=Athlone Press: 1945–1979 |title=holdings at Senate House Library, University of London |date=29 November 2006 |chapter-url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/14/1671.htm |access-date=21 December 2009}}</ref> subsequent to which it was acquired by [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum publishing]].<ref name="allbusines.com2006">{{Citation | author=allbusiness | chapter = Sturrock departs Continuum | title= Article citing companies encompassed by Continuum | date = 29 November 2006 | chapter-url = http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4663699-1.html | access-date= 21 December 2009}}</ref> However, the post-WWII period was mostly characterised by expansion and consolidation within the university, such as the acquisition as a constituent body of the Jesuit theological institution Heythrop College on its move from Oxfordshire in 1969.

The 1978 University of London Act saw the university defined as a federation of self-governing colleges, starting the process of decentralisation that would lead to a marked transference of academic and financial power in this period from the central authorities in Senate House to the individual colleges. In the same period, UCL and King's College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporate in 1977, while King's College's new charter in 1980 reunited the main body of the college with the corporation formed in 1829. In 1992 centralised graduation ceremonies at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] were replaced by individual ceremonies at the colleges.<ref>{{cite book|title=The World of UCL|page=275|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ucl-press/browse-books/the-world-of-ucl/|author1=Negley Harte|author2= John North |author3 =Georgina Brewis | date=June 2018|publisher=UCL Press}}</ref> One the largest shifts in power of this period came in 1993, when [[HEFCE]] (now the Office for Students, OfS<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/|title=Home - Office for Students|last=Students|first=Office for|date=2018-01-12|website=www.officeforstudents.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref>) switched from funding the University of London, which then allocated money to the colleges, to funding the colleges directly and them paying a contribution to the university.<ref name="UoL Future" />

There was also a tendency in the late 20th century for smaller colleges to be amalgamated into larger "super-colleges". Some of the larger colleges (most notably UCL, King's College, LSE and Imperial) periodically put forward the possibility of their departure from the university, although no steps were taken to actually putting this into action until the early 21st century.

[[File:Imperial Institute.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]] Building in South Kensington, home to the university from 1900 to 1937]]

===21st century===
In 2002, [[Imperial College]] and [[University College London|UCL]] mooted the possibility of a merger, raising the question of the future of the University of London and the smaller colleges within it. Subsequently, considerable opposition from academic staff of both UCL and Imperial led to a rejection of the merger.<ref>The Guardian. 18 November 2002 [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/nov/18/highereducation.universitymergers Opposition ends Imperial and UCL merger dream]</ref>

Despite this failure, the trend of decentralising power continued. A significant development in this process was the closing down of the [[Convocation]] of all the university's alumni in October 2003; this recognised that individual college alumni associations were now increasingly the centre of focus for alumni.<ref name="london">{{cite web|url=http://www.london.ac.uk/52.html|publisher=london.ac.uk|title=University of London: Convocation|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> However, the university continued to grow even as it moved to a looser federation, and, in 2005, admitted the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]].

On 9 December 2005, Imperial College became the second constituent body (after Regent's Park College) to make a formal decision to leave the university. Its council announced that it was beginning negotiations to withdraw from the university in time for its own centenary celebrations, and in order to be able to award its own degrees. On 5 October 2006, the University of London accepted Imperial's formal request to withdraw from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_5-10-2006-13-17-17?newsid=2736|title=News_5-10-2006-13-17-17|author=CBLAIR|work=imperial.ac.uk}}</ref> Imperial became fully independent on 9 July 2007, as part of the celebrations of the college's centenary.

The ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' announced in February 2007 that the London School of Economics, University College London and King's College London all planned to start awarding their own degrees, rather than degrees from the federal University of London as they had done previously, from the start of the academic year starting in Autumn 2007. Although this plan to award their own degrees did not amount to a decision to leave the University of London, the ''THES'' suggested that this "rais[ed] new doubts about the future of the federal University of London".<ref name="THES">{{cite web|last1=Attwood|first1=Rebecca|title=London trio to award their own degrees|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/london-trio-to-award-their-own-degrees/207945.article|website=Times Higher Education Magazine|access-date=March 11, 2018}}</ref>

Since 2010, the university has been outsourcing support services such as cleaning and portering. This has prompted industrial action by the largely [[Latin American]] workforce under the "3Cosas" campaign (the 3Cosas&nbsp;– 3 causes&nbsp;–being [[sick pay]], [[holiday pay]], and pensions for outsourced workers on parity with staff employed directly by the university). The 3Cosas campaigners were members of the [[UNISON]] trade union. However, documents leaked in 2014 revealed that UNISON representatives tried to counter the 3Cosas campaign in meetings with university management.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/mar/24/cost-private-contracts-universities-documents-services-workers|title=The true cost of private contracts in universities|first=Aditya|last=Chakrabortty|date=24 March 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The 3Cosas workers subsequently transferred to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain.

Following good results in the [[Research Excellence Framework]] in December 2014, [[City University London]] said that they were exploring the possibility of joining the University of London.<ref name="theguardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/20/universities-research-excellence-framework-modern-languages|work=The Guardian|title=Universities worry about fallout from research ranking |access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> It was subsequently announced in July 2015 that City would join the University of London in August 2016.<ref name="Grove"/> It will cease to be an independent university and become a college as "City, University of London".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/documents/s53556/150723%2520City%2520University%2520London.pdf |title=Committee Report |website=democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk |date=2015 |access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref>

In 2016 reforms were proposed that would see the colleges become member institutions and be allowed to legally become universities in their own right. A bill to amend the university's statutes was introduced into the House of Lords in late 2016. The bill was held up by procedural matters in the House of Commons, with MP [[Christopher Chope]] objecting to it receiving a second [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] without debate and no time having been scheduled for such debate. Twelve of the colleges, including UCL and King's, have said that they will seek university status once the bill is passed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/bill-paves-way-london-colleges-gain-university-status|title=Bill paves way for London colleges to gain university status|date=18 April 2018|author=John Morgan|work=[[Times Higher Education]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-strange-tale-of-the-university-of-london-bill/|title=The strange tale of the University of London Bill|author=David Kernohan|date=26 July 2018|publisher=WONKHE|access-date=30 September 2018}}</ref> The bill was debated and passed its second reading on 16 October 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-10-16/debates/2F554391-4F2E-4550-8D4F-359E08169031/UniversityOfLondonBill(Lords)|date=16 October 2018|work=[[Hansard]]|access-date=17 November 2018|title=University of London Bill [Lords]}}</ref> It received royal assent on 20 December 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/universityoflondon/stages.html|title=Bill stages — University of London Act 2018|website=parliament.uk|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, the [[University of London Press]], founded in 1910, was relaunched as a fully [[open access|open-access]] publisher specializing in "distinctive scholarship at the forefront of the [[Humanities]]".<ref>https://london.ac.uk/press</ref>

==Campuses==
[[File:Senate House, University of London.jpg|right|thumb|[[Senate House, London|Senate House]], constructed 1932–1937: the headquarters of the University of London]]
The university owns a considerable [[central London]] estate 12 hectares freehold land in [[Bloomsbury]], near [[Russell Square tube station]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ac.uk/138.html| title=The Central University's Estate| publisher=University of London| access-date=22 June 2016| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213000715/http://www.london.ac.uk/138.html| archive-date=13 February 2006| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Some of the university's colleges have their main buildings on the estate. The Bloomsbury Campus also contains eight Halls of Residence and [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]], which houses [[Senate House Library]], the chancellor's official residence and previously housed the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]], now part of [[University College London]] (UCL) and housed in its own new building. Almost all of the [[School of Advanced Study]] is housed in Senate House and neighbouring Stewart House.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://w01.sascms.wf.ulcc.ac.uk/348.html| title=Redevelopment Project of Senate House and Stewart House| publisher=University of London School of Advanced Study| access-date=2 March 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031207/http://w01.sascms.wf.ulcc.ac.uk/348.html| archive-date=28 September 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The university also owns many of the squares that formed part of the Bedford Estate, including [[Gordon Square]], [[Tavistock Square]], [[Torrington Square]] and [[Woburn Square]], as well as several properties outside Bloomsbury, with many of the university's colleges and institutes occupying their own estates across London:
* [[Clare Market]],
* The [[Aldwych]], where the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] and part of [[King's College London]] are based
* The North and East Wings of [[Somerset House]], the location for the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] and [[King's College London]], respectively
* [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]],
* the [[University of London Boat Club]] in [[Chiswick]], and
* The campus of [[Royal Holloway and Bedford New College]] including the historic [[Founder's Building]].

The university also has several properties outside London, including a number of residential and catering units further afield and the premises of the [[University of London Institute in Paris]], which offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in French and historical studies.

==Organisation and administration==
{{see also|List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of London}}
The University's Board of Trustees, the governing and executive body of the University, comprises eleven appointed independent persons – all of whom are non-executive; the Vice-Chancellor, the Deputy Vice Chancellor and four Heads of member institutions, appointed by the Collegiate Council.

The Board of Trustees is supported by the Collegiate Council, which comprises the Heads of the member institutions of the University, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor, the Dean and Chief Executive of the School of Advanced Study, the Chief Executive of the University of London Worldwide and the Collegiate Council's Chair, the Vice-Chancellor.

* [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] ([[Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] from 1987), [[University of London Chancellor election, 1981|1981]]–present

==Member institutions==
{{main|Member institutions of the University of London}}

For most practical purposes, ranging from admission of students to negotiating funding from the government, the 17 member institutions are treated as individual universities. Legally speaking they are known as ''Recognised Bodies'', with the authority to examine students and award them degrees of the university. Some member institutions also have the power to award their own degrees instead of those of the university; those which exercise that power include:{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
* [[City, University of London]]
* [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London]]
* [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]
* [[King's College London]]
* [[London School of Economics and Political Science]]
* [[Queen Mary University of London]]
* [[Royal Holloway, University of London]]
* [[SOAS, University of London]]
* [[St George's, University of London]]
* [[University College London]]

Most decisions affecting the member institutions and institutes of the University of London are made at the level of the member institutions or institutes themselves. The University of London does retain its own decision-making structure, however, with the Collegiate Council and Board of Trustees, responsible for matters of academic policy. The Collegiate Council is made up of the heads of member institutions of the university.<ref name="Collegiate Council"/>

The 12 institutes, or ''Listed Bodies'', within the University of London offer courses leading to degrees that are both examined and awarded by the University of London. Additionally, twelve universities in England, several in Canada and many in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (notably in East Africa) began life as associate colleges of the university offering such degrees. By the 1970s, almost all of these colleges had achieved independence from the University of London. An increasing number of overseas and UK-based academic institutes offer courses to support students registered for the [[University of London International Programmes|University of London]] flexible and distance learning diplomas and degrees and the Teaching Institutions Recognition Framework enables the recognition of these institutions.

Under the University of London Act 2018, a member institution is defined as "an educational, academic or research institution which is a constituent member of the University and has for the time being― (a) the status of a college under the statutes; or (b) the status of a university". As of February 2019, 12 of the colleges of the university have said they are seeking university status.

===Colleges in special relation===
{{main|University of London International Programmes}}
Between 1946 and 1970, the university entered into 'schemes of special relation' with university colleges in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. These schemes encouraged the development of independent universities by offering a relationship with the University of London. University colleges in these countries were granted a [[Royal Charter]]. An Academic Board of the university college negotiated with the University of London over the entrance requirements for the admission of students, syllabuses, examination procedures and other academic matters. During the period of the special relationship, graduates of the colleges were awarded University of London degrees.

Some of the colleges which were in special relation are listed below, along with the year in which their special relation was established.
* 1946&nbsp;– The University College of the West Indies, until 1961. (Now the [[University of the West Indies]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwi.edu/aboutuwi/briefhistory.aspx |title=University of the West Indies |publisher=Uwi.edu |date=24 June 1986 |access-date=13 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527093104/http://www.uwi.edu/aboutuwi/briefhistory.aspx |archive-date=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* 1948&nbsp;– University College of the Gold Coast, (now [[University of Ghana]])
* 1948&nbsp;– University College, Ibadan, until 1967. (Now the [[University of Ibadan]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ui.edu.ng/deptmedicine.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 November 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009145219/http://www.ui.edu.ng/deptmedicine.htm |archive-date=9 October 2006 }}</ref>
* 1956&nbsp;– University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now the [[University of Zimbabwe]]).
* 1961&nbsp;– Royal College Nairobi (now the [[University of Nairobi]]).
* 1963&nbsp;– [[University of East Africa]]

In 1970, the 'Schemes of Special Relation' were phased out.

==Coat of arms==
[[File:University of London arms.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|The University of London coat of arms]]
The University of London received a grant of arms in April 1838.<ref name=harte1986>{{cite book|last=Harte|first=N. B.|title=The University of London, 1836–1986: An Illustrated History| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_iE0JVcUDogC&pg=PA90 |access-date=4 August 2015|year=1986|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-0-485-12052-3|page=90}}</ref> The arms depict a [[Saint George's Cross|cross of St George]] upon which there is a [[Tudor rose]] surrounded by detailing and surmounted by a crown. Above all of this there is a blue field with an open book upon it.

The arms are described in the grant as:

:''Argent, the Cross of St George, thereon the Union Rose irradiated and ensigned with the Imperial Crown proper, a Chief Azure, thereon an open Book also proper, Clasps gold''<ref name=harte1986 />

==Academic dress==
{{Main|Academic dress of the University of London}}
The University of London had established a rudimentary code for [[academic dress]] by 1844. The university was the first to devise a system of academic dress based on faculty colours, an innovation that was subsequently followed by many other universities.

Colleges that award their own degrees have their own academic dress for those degrees.

==Student life==
[[File:University of London Union, Malet Street, London-22April2008.jpg|thumb|The main building of the [[University of London Union]] (now rebranded as 'Student Central, London')]]

In {{HESA year}}, {{HESA student population|INSTID=LON}} students (approximately 5% of all UK students) attended one of the University of London's [[federated school|affiliated schools]].<ref name="HESA citation"/> Additionally, over 50,000 students are part of [[University of London Worldwide]].<ref name="External"/>

The ULU building on [[Malet Street]] (close to Senate House) was home to the [[University of London Union]], which acted as the [[Students' union|student union]] for all University of London students alongside the individual college and institution unions. The building is now rebranded as "Student Central, London", offering full membership to current University of London students, and associate membership to students at other universities, and other groups. The union previously owned ''[[London Student]],'' the largest student newspaper in Europe, which now runs as a digital news organisation<ref>{{cite web |author=BAM Agency Ltd |url=http://www.ulu.co.uk/content/index.php?page=9 |title=London Student |publisher=Ulu.co.uk |access-date=13 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527183333/http://www.ulu.co.uk/content/index.php?page=9 |archive-date=27 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About London Student: A workers' co-operative student media startup|url=http://www.lsnews.co.uk/team/|website=[[London Student]]|access-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716014001/http://www.lsnews.co.uk/team/|archive-date=16 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Sports, clubs and traditions===
Though most sports teams are organised at the college level, [[ULU]] ran several sports clubs of its own, some of which (for example the rowing team) compete in [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]] leagues. The union also organised leagues for college teams to participate in. These leagues and sports clubs are supported by Friends of University of London Sport which aims to promote them.

In addition to these, ULU catered for sports not covered by the individual colleges through clubs such as the [[University of London Union Lifesaving Club]], which helps students gain awards and learn new skills in [[lifesaving]] as well as sending teams to compete throughout the country in the [[BULSCA]] league.

ULU also organised several societies, ranging from Ballroom and Latin American Dance to [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], and from the [[University of London Big Band]] to the [[Breakdancing]] Society. Affiliated to the university is the [[University of London Society of Change Ringers]], a society for bellringers at all London universities.

The university runs the [[University of London Boat Club]].

==Controversy==
In recent years the University of London has seen much controversy surrounding its treatment of staff and students.

In 2012, outsourced cleaning staff ran the "3 Cosas" campaign, fighting for improvements in three areas - sick pay, holiday and pensions. After over a year of high-profile strikes, protests and occupations, concessions were made by the university in terms of sick pay and holidays, however these improvements were nowhere near to the extent of what was being demanded by the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://3cosascampaign.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=24 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, after a student occupation in favour of ten demands, including fair pay for workers, a halt to privatisation of the university and an end to plans to shut down the university's student union [[ULU]], police were called, resulting in the violent eviction and arrests of over 60 students, as well as police violence towards students outside supporting the occupation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/05/three-arrests-student-protest-university-of-london|title=Police officer accused of punching student at University of London protest|first=Kevin|last=Rawlinson|date=5 December 2013|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> After these events, a high-profile "Cops Off Campus" demonstration was held against the university's use of police violence to crush student protest, with thousands in attendance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/thousands-of-students-attend-cops-off-campus-demo-with-police-so-far-nowhere-to-be-seen-8998440.html|title=Thousands of students attend 'cops off campus' demo - with police so|date=11 December 2013|website=The Independent}}</ref>

In 2018, a student occupation in support of a continued campaign to bring all workers in-house at the university gained national media attention after a video of university staff drilling shut a fire door to trap students in a room they had occupied, putting them at serious risk of harm, was viewed over 19,000 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/JusticeforUOLWorkers/videos/225038318236742/|title=University of London have sealed us into the Chancellor's Hall|via=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Video footage later emerged of university managers harassing students and harming their property on top of this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/JusticeforUOLWorkers/videos/235925293814711/|title=// UoL management hypocrisy //|via=www.facebook.com}}</ref>
Later on in 2018, an article was published by [[Vice Media|Vice]] that reported the militarisation of the university campus at Senate House, where over 25 extra security had been brought in, with students known to be involved in political campaigns being barred from using university facilities, as well as being verbally, physically and sexually assaulted by temporary security staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wjbn5n/the-university-of-londons-theatre-of-security-is-clamping-down-on-student-dissent|title=The University of London's 'Theatre of Security' Is Clamping Down on Student Dissent|first=Simon|last=Childs|date=23 May 2018}}</ref> As of June 2018 no staff are known to have been reprimanded for these actions.

In December 2018, the [[Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain]] called for a boycott of events at the university's central administration buildings, including Senate House, with the aim of putting pressure on the University of London to bring outsourced cleaning, catering and security staff in-house by targeting a revenue stream worth around £40 million per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Largest university in UK hit by boycott over outsourced staff|url=https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/largest-university-in-uk-hit-by-boycott-over-outsourced-staff/|website=Personnel Today|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Academics, politicians and trade unionists join boycott of UofL's use of outsourced workers|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/academics-politicians-and-trade-unionists-join-boycott-of-uol%27s-use-of-outsourced-workers|website=Morning Star|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Boycott Over Outsourcing Could Cost University £Millions|url=https://www.twinfm.com/article/boycott-over-outsourcing-could-cost-university-millions|website=Twin FM|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref>

In May 2019, the congress of the [[University and College Union]], voted to boycott the University of London's central administration buildings including Senate House, raising the pressure on the University of London.<ref>{{cite web|title=University of London faces boycott over treatment of staff|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/26/university-of-london-admin-centre-senate-house-boycotted-over-treatment-of-staff|website=The Guardian|access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref> Dr Dion Georgiou, an academic supporting the boycott and a member of UCU, wrote a comment piece for The Guardian shortly before the vote, urging the congress to approve the motion and claiming that "[outsourced workers] face an intransigent university management, whose response has frequently blended short-termism with heavy-handedness".<ref>{{cite web|title=I'm proud to back a University of London boycott – the outsourcing has to end|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/24/university-of-london-boycott-academics-outsourcing-cleaners|website=The Guardian|access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref> The motion was passed two days later.

==The federal model elsewhere==
In 1850, [[Queen's University of Ireland]]<ref name=harte1986 /> was created on the model of the University of London to provide degrees for students from the colleges established at Belfast, Cork and Galway.<ref name=harte1986 /> When the [[University of New Zealand]] was constituted in 1874,<ref name="University Global">{{cite book|last=Schreuder|first=Deryck M.|title =Universities for a New World: Making a Global Network in International Higher Education, 1913-2013|date=3 October 2013| publisher=SAGE Publications India, 2013| isbn=9788132117780}}</ref> it was a federal university modelled on the University of London, functioning principally as an examining body.<ref name="University Global"/> [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]], when it was constituted in 1875 and authorised to be responsible for examinations throughout [[South Africa]].<ref name="University Global"/> In [[Canada]], similar structures were adopted, but on a regional basis.<ref name="University Global"/> The [[University of Toronto]] acted as an examining and degree awarding body for the province of [[Ontario]] from 1853 to 1887, by utilising an operating model based on that of University of London.<ref name="University Global"/>

The [[University of Wales]] was established in 1893 on a similar model to the University of London, as the universities examined and awarded degrees, while the colleges recruited students and taught them.<ref name="Collegial Higher Education">{{cite book|last1=Tapper|first1=Ted|last2=Palfreyman|first2=David|title=The Collegial Tradition in the Age of Mass Higher Education| publisher=Springer Science & Business Media, 2010| isbn=9789048191543}}</ref>
