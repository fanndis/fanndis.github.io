{{History of the Soviet Union}}

The '''Eastern Front''' of [[World War II]] was a [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]] of conflict between the European [[Axis powers]] and co-belligerent [[Finland]] against the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Poland]] and other [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which encompassed [[Central Europe]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Northern Europe|Northeast Europe]] ([[Baltic states|Baltics]]), and [[Southeast Europe]] ([[Balkans]]) from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945. It was known as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] in the Soviet Union and some of its successor states, while everywhere else it was called the Eastern Front.

The battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/09/world-war-ii-the-eastern-front/100150/|title= World War II: The Eastern Front|date= 18 September 2011|website= The Atlantic|accessdate= 26 November 2014}}</ref> They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity, wholesale destruction, mass deportations, and immense loss of life due to combat, starvation, exposure, disease, and massacres. Of the estimated [[World War II casualties|70–85 million deaths]] attributed to World War II, around 30&nbsp;million occurred on the Eastern Front.<ref name=30m /> The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theatre of operations]] in World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] and the Axis nations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2007|p=xix}}: "That conflict, which ended sixty years before this book’s completion, was a decisive component – arguably the single most decisive component – of the Second World War. It was on the eastern front, between 1941 and 1945, that the greater part of the land and associated air forces of Nazi Germany and its Axis partners were ultimately destroyed by the Soviet Union in what, from 1944, its people – and those of the fifteen successor states – called, and still call, the Great Patriotic War"</ref>

The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. Though never engaged in military action in the Eastern Front, the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States]] and the [[United Kingdom in World War II|United Kingdom]] both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union in the form of the [[Lend-Lease]] program. The joint [[Operation Silver Fox|German–Finnish operations]] across the northernmost Finnish–Soviet border and in the [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk region]] are considered part of the Eastern Front. In addition, the Soviet–Finnish [[Continuation War]] is generally also considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front.

==Background==
{{See also|Anschluss|Munich Agreement|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact}}
Germany and the Soviet Union remained unsatisfied with the outcome of [[World War I]] (1914–1918). Soviet Russia had lost substantial territory in [[Eastern Europe]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (March 1918), where the [[Bolshevik]]s in Petrograd conceded to German demands and ceded control of Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, and other areas, to the [[Central Powers]]. Subsequently, when Germany in its turn [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|surrendered]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] (November 1918) and these territories became independent states under the terms of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] at [[Versailles]], [[Soviet Russia]] was in the midst of [[Russian Civil War|a civil war]] and the Allies did not recognise the Bolshevik government, so no Soviet Russian representation attended.<ref name="Hankey2015">{{cite book|author= Donald Hankey|title= The Supreme Control at the Paris Peace Conference 1919 (Routledge Revivals): A Commentary|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MPzOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA50|date= 3 June 2015|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-1-317-56756-1|pages= 50}}</ref>

[[Adolf Hitler]] had declared his intention to invade the Soviet Union on 11 August 1939 to [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt]], [[League of Nations]] Commissioner, by saying:

<blockquote>
Everything I undertake is directed against the Russians. If the West is too stupid and blind to grasp this, then I shall be compelled to come to an agreement with the Russians, beat the West and then after their defeat turn against the Soviet Union with all my forces. I need the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] so that they can't starve us out, as happened in the last war.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Greatest Battle: Stalin, Hitler, and the Desperate Struggle for Moscow That Changed the Course of World War II |url = https://archive.org/details/greatestbattlest0000nago |url-access = registration |last = Nagorski |first = Andrew |publisher = Simon & Schuster |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7432-8111-9 |location = Amazon }}</ref>
</blockquote>
The [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] signed in August 1939 was a [[Non aggression pact|non-aggression agreement]] between Germany and the Soviet Union. It contained a secret [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] aiming to return [[Central Europe]] to the pre–World War I [[status quo ante bellum|''status quo'']] by dividing it between Germany and the Soviet Union. Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania would return to the Soviet control, while Poland and Romania would be divided.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Eastern Front was also made possible by the [[German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement]] in which the Soviet Union gave Germany the resources necessary to launch military operations in Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ericson|first1=Edward|title=Feeding the German Eagle: Soviet Military Aid to Nazi Germany, 1933–1941|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-96337-3|pages=34–35|year=1999}}</ref>

On 1 September 1939 [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]], starting [[World War II]]. On 17 September, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded]] [[Kresy|Eastern Poland]], and, as a result, [[Fourth Partition of Poland|Poland was partitioned]] among Germany, the Soviet Union and Lithuania. Soon after that, the Soviet Union demanded significant territorial concessions from Finland, and after Finland rejected Soviet demands, the Soviet Union attacked Finland on 30 November 1939 in what became known as the [[Winter War]] – a bitter conflict that resulted in a peace treaty on 13 March 1940, with Finland maintaining its independence but losing its eastern parts in [[Karelia]].<ref name=malksoo/>

In June 1940 the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied and illegally annexed]] the three [[Baltic states]] (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).<ref name=malksoo>{{cite book|author= Mälksoo, Lauri|year= 2003|title= Illegal Annexation and State Continuity: The Case of the Incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR|location= Leiden, Boston|publisher= Brill| isbn= 90-411-2177-3}}</ref> The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact ostensibly provided security to the Soviets in the occupation both of the Baltics and of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|the north and northeastern regions of Romania]] (Northern [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]], June–July 1940), although Hitler, in announcing the invasion of the Soviet Union, cited the Soviet annexations of Baltic and Romanian territory as having violated Germany's understanding of the Pact. Moscow partitioned the annexed Romanian territory between the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]] and [[Moldavian SSR|Moldavian Soviet republics]].

===German ideology===
{{Main|Mein Kampf|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazism and race}}
[[Adolf Hitler]] had argued in his autobiography ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) for the necessity of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space"): acquiring new territory for Germans in Eastern Europe, in particular Russia.<ref>"We National Socialists consciously draw a line under the direction of our foreign policy war. We begin where we ended six centuries ago. We stop the perpetual Germanic march towards the south and west of Europe, and have the view on the country in the east. We finally put the colonial and commercial policy of the pre-war and go over to the territorial policy of the future. But if we speak today in Europe of new land, we can primarily only to Russia and the border states subjects him think."

Hitler as early as 1917 had referred to the Russians as inferior, believing that the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] had put the [[Jews]] in power over the mass of [[Slavs]], who were, in Hitler's opinion, incapable of ruling themselves and had thus ended up being ruled by Jewish masters.<ref name="Megargee2007">{{cite book|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|author-link=Geoffrey Megargee|title=War of Annihilation: Combat and Genocide on the Eastern Front, 1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSpUZ6t6BPwC&pg=PA4|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4482-6|page=4}}</ref>

Hitler referred to the war in radical terms, calling it a "[[war of annihilation]]" (''Vernichtungskrieg'') which was both an ideological and racial war. The Nazi vision for the future of Eastern Europe was codified most clearly in the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''. The populations of occupied Central Europe and the Soviet Union were to be partially deported to West Siberia, enslaved and eventually exterminated; the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or "Germanized" settlers.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Steinberg |title=The Third Reich Reflected: German Civil Administration in the Occupied Soviet Union, 1941–4 |journal=[[The English Historical Review]] |volume=110 |issue=437 |pages=620–651 |date=June 1995 |jstor=578338 |doi=10.1093/ehr/CX.437.620}}</ref> In addition, the Nazis also sought to wipe out the large Jewish population of Central and Eastern Europe<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/wansee-transcript.html |accessdate=5 January 2009 |title=The Wannsee Protocol |work=Literature of the Holocaust |publisher=University of Pennsylvania}} citing {{cite book |editor-first=John |editor-last=Mendelsohn |title=The Wannsee Protocol and a 1944 Report on Auschwitz by the Office of Strategic Services |volume=Volume 11 |series=The Holocaust: Selected Documents in Eighteen Volumes |location=New York |publisher=Garland |date=1982 |pages=18–32}}</ref>

After Germany's initial success at the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Battle of Kiev]] in 1941, Hitler saw the Soviet Union as militarily weak and ripe for immediate conquest. In a speech at the [[Berlin Sportpalast]] on 3 October, he announced, "We have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."<ref>{{Internet Archive film | youtube-KFiOi_UnX98 | Adolf Hitler's Speech on Operation Barbarossa }}</ref> Thus, Germany expected another short ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' and made no serious preparations for prolonged warfare. However, following the decisive Soviet victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943 and the resulting dire German military situation, Nazi propaganda began to portray the war as a German defence of Western civilisation against destruction by the vast "[[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]] hordes" that were pouring into Europe.

Throughout the 1930s the Soviet Union underwent massive [[industrialisation]] and economic growth under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Stalin's central tenet, "[[Socialism in One Country]]", manifested itself as a series of nationwide centralised [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]] from 1929 onwards. This represented an ideological shift in Soviet policy, away from its commitment to the international communist [[World revolution|revolution]], and eventually leading to the dissolution of the [[Comintern]] (Third International) organisation in 1943.

[[File:Europe before Operation Barbarossa, 1941 (in German).png|thumb|upright=1.05|left|Situation in Europe by May/June 1941, immediately before [[Operation Barbarossa]]]]
The war was fought between Nazi Germany, its allies and Finland, against the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. The conflict began on 22 June 1941 with the [[Operation Barbarossa]] offensive, when [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces crossed the borders described in the [[German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact]], thereby invading the Soviet Union. The war ended on 9 May 1945, when [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]] [[Unconditional surrender|surrendered unconditionally]] following the [[Battle of Berlin]] (also known as the [[Berlin Offensive]]), a strategic operation executed by the [[Red Army]].

The states that provided forces and other resources for the German war effort included the [[Axis Powers]] – primarily Romania, Hungary, Italy, pro-Nazi Slovakia, and Croatia. [[Anti-Soviet]] Finland, which had fought the [[Winter War]] against the Soviet Union, also joined the offensive. The ''Wehrmacht'' forces were also assisted by anti-[[Communist]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] in places like Western Ukraine, and the [[Baltic states]]. Among the most prominent volunteer army formations was the [[Blue Division|Spanish Blue Division]], sent by Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] to keep his ties to the Axis intact.<ref name="Payne2011">{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=The Franco Regime, 1936–1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6Ie_HYgjUwC&pg=PA282|date=27 September 2011|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=978-0-299-11073-4|page=282}}</ref>

The Soviet Union offered support to the partisans in many ''Wehrmacht''-occupied countries in [[Central Europe]], notably those in [[Slovak National Uprising|Slovakia]], [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Poland]]. In addition, the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]], particularly the [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|First]] and [[Polish Second Army|Second]] Polish armies, were armed and trained, and would eventually fight alongside the Red Army. The [[Free French]] forces also contributed to the Red Army by the formation of the [[Normandie-Niemen|GC3]] (''Groupe de Chasse 3'' or 3rd Fighter Group) unit to fulfil the commitment of [[Charles de Gaulle]], leader of the Free French, who thought that it was important for French servicemen to serve on all fronts.

For nearly two years the border was quiet while Germany conquered Denmark, Norway, [[Battle of France|France, the Low Countries]], and the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]]. Hitler had always intended to renege on his pact with the Soviet Union, eventually making the decision to invade in the spring of 1941.

Some historians say Stalin was fearful of war with Germany, or just did not expect Germany to start a [[two-front war]], and was reluctant to do anything to provoke Hitler. Others say that Stalin was eager for Germany to be at war with capitalist countries. Another viewpoint is that Stalin expected war in 1942 (the time when all his preparations would be complete) and stubbornly refused to believe its early arrival.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardesty|first=Von|title=Red Phoenix: The Rise of Soviet Air Power, 1941–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-lmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA16|year=1982|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|isbn=978-0-87474-510-8|page=16}}</ref>

Germany had been assembling very large numbers of troops in eastern Poland and making repeated [[reconnaissance]] flights over the border; the Soviet Union responded by assembling its divisions on its western border, although the Soviet mobilisation was slower than Germany's due to the country's less dense road network. As in the [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] on the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] or [[Soviet–Japanese Border Wars|Soviet–Japanese border conflicts]], Soviet troops on the western border received a directive, signed by [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and [[Army General (Soviet rank)|General of the Army]] [[Georgy Zhukov]], that ordered (as demanded by Stalin): "do not answer to any provocations" and "do not undertake any (offensive) actions without specific orders" – which meant that Soviet troops could open fire only on their soil and forbade counter-attack on German soil. The German invasion therefore caught the Soviet military and civilian leadership largely by surprise.

The extent of warnings received by Stalin about a German invasion is controversial, and the claim that there was a warning that "Germany will attack on 22 June without declaration of war" has been dismissed as a "popular myth". However, some sources quoted in the articles on Soviet spies [[Richard Sorge]] and [[Willi Lehmann]], say they had sent warnings of an attack on 20 or 22 June, which were treated as "disinformation". The [[Lucy spy ring]] in Switzerland also sent warnings, possibly deriving from Ultra codebreaking in Britain. Sweden had access to internal German communications through breaking the crypto used in the [[Siemens and Halske T52]] crypto machine also known as the Geheimschreiber and informed Stalin about the forthcoming invasion well ahead of June 22, but did not reveal its sources.

Soviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation, so sent false alarms to Moscow about a German invasion in April, May and the beginning of June. Soviet intelligence reported that Germany would rather invade the USSR after the fall of the British Empire<ref>Source: L. E. Reshin, "Year of 1941", vol. 1, p. 508.</ref> or after an unacceptable ultimatum demanding German occupation of Ukraine during the German invasion of Britain.<ref>Source: L. E. Reshin, "Year of 1941", vol. 2, p. 152.</ref>

===Foreign support and measures===
[[Strategic bombing during World War II|A strategic air offensive]] by the [[United States Army Air Force]] and [[Royal Air Force]] played a significant part in reducing German industry and tying up German air force and air defence resources, with some bombings, such as the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of the eastern German city of Dresden]], being done to facilitate specific Soviet operational goals. In addition to Germany, hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs were dropped on their eastern allies of [[Bombing of Romania in World War II|Romania]] and [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Allied bombing statistics 1939–45|Hungary]], [[Operation Tidal Wave|primarily in an attempt to cripple Romanian oil production]].

British and Commonwealth forces also contributed directly to the fighting on the Eastern Front through their service in the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] and [[No. 151 Wing RAF|training Red Air Force pilots]], as well as in the provision of early material and intelligence support.

====Nazi Germany====
[[File:Europe under Nazi domination.png|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Europe]] at the height of German military expansion, 1942]]
Germany's economic, scientific, research and industrial capabilities were one of the most technically advanced in the world at the time. However, access to (and control of) the [[resource]]s, raw materials and production capacity required to entertain long-term goals (such as European control, German territorial expansion and the destruction of the USSR) were limited. Political demands necessitated the expansion of Germany's control of natural and human resources, industrial capacity and farmland beyond its borders (conquered territories). Germany's military production was tied to resources outside its area of control, a dynamic not found amongst the Allies.

During the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. [[Norway]] lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}} Axis allies such as [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Finland]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] benefited from Germany's net imports. Overall, [[Vichy France|France]] made the largest contribution to the German war effort. In 1943–44, French payments to Germany may have risen to as much as 55% of French GDP.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-the-second-world-war/economics-of-the-war-with-nazi-germany/E2F3FE2B9549A00F2E992673C5C8B28D|title=The economics of the war with Nazi Germany|first1=Adam|last1=Tooze|first2=Jamie|last2=Martin|editor-first1=Adam|editor-last1=Tooze|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last2=Geyer|date=26 October 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=3|pages=27–55}}</ref> Overall, Germany imported 20% of its food and 33% of its raw materials from conquered territories and Axis allies.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z2932p3/revision/4</ref>

On 27 May 1940, Germany signed the "Oil Pact" with Romania, by which Germany would trade arms for oil. Romania's oil production amounted to approximately 6,000,000 tons annually. This production represents 35% of the total fuel production of the Axis including the synthetic products and the substitutes and 70% of the total production of crude oil.<ref>A History of Romanian Oil, Vol. II, p. 245</ref> In 1941, Germany only had 18% of the oil it had in peacetime. Romania supplied Germany and its allies with roughly 13&nbsp;million barrels of oil (about 4&nbsp;million per year) between 1941 and 1943. Germany's peak oil production in 1944 amounted to about 12&nbsp;million barrels of oil per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peakoil.com/consumption/china-today-is-foreign-oil-dependent-like-germany-in-ww2|title=China today is foreign oil dependent like Germany in WW2 &#124; Peak Oil News and Message Boards|website=peakoil.com}}</ref>

Rolf Karlbom estimated that [[Sweden|Swedish]] share of Germany's total consumption of [[iron]] may have amounted to 43% during the period of 1933–43. It may also be likely that 'Swedish ore formed the raw material of four out of every ten German guns' during the Hitler era'.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03585522.1968.10411499 | volume=16 | title=Swedish iron ore exports to Germany, 1933–44 | year=1968 | journal=Scandinavian Economic History Review | pages=171–175 | last1 = Karlbom | first1 = Rolf| issue=2 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[Operation Barbarossa]] began just before dawn on 22 June 1941. The Germans cut the wire network in all Soviet western military districts to undermine the Red Army's communications.<ref name="ZHU">{{cite book | last =Zhukov | first =Georgy | title =Vospominaniya i razmyshleniya| publisher =Agenstvo pechati Novosti | year = 1972| location = Moscow}}</ref> Panicky transmissions from the Soviet front-line units to their command headquarters were picked up like this: "We are being fired upon.

At 03:15 on 22 June 1941, 99 of 190 German divisions, including fourteen [[panzer division]]s and ten motorised, were deployed against the Soviet Union from the Baltic to the Black Sea. They were accompanied by ten Romanian divisions, three Italian divisions, two Slovakian divisions and nine Romanian and four Hungarian [[brigade]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last =Zhilin | first =P.A.

To establish air supremacy, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began immediate attacks on Soviet airfields, destroying much of the forward-deployed Soviet Air Force airfield fleets consisting of largely obsolescent types before their pilots had a chance to leave the ground.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.852</ref> For a month the offensive conducted on three axes was completely unstoppable as the [[panzer]] forces [[Encirclement|encircled]] hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops in huge pockets that were then reduced by slower-moving [[infantry]] armies while the panzers continued the offensive, following the ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' [[Military doctrine|doctrine]].

[[Army Group North]]'s objective was [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] via the [[Baltic states]]. Comprising the [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th]] and [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Armies]] and the [[4th Panzer Group]], this formation advanced through the Baltic states, and the Russian [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]] and [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]] regions.

[[Army Group Centre]]'s two panzer groups (the [[2nd Panzer Group|2nd]] and [[3rd Panzer Group|3rd]]), advanced to the north and south of [[Brest-Litovsk]] and converged east of [[Minsk]], followed by the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd]], [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th]], and [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Armies]]. The combined panzer force reached the [[Berezina river|Beresina River]] in just six days, {{convert|650|km|mi|abbr=on}} from their start lines. The next objective was to cross the [[Dnieper river]], which was accomplished by 11 July. Their next target was [[Smolensk]], which fell on 16 July, but the [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|fierce Soviet resistance in the Smolensk area]] and slowing of the ''Wehrmacht'' advance by the North and South Army Groups forced Hitler to halt a central thrust at Moscow and to divert the 3rd Panzer Group north. Critically, [[Heinz Guderian|Guderian]]'s 2nd Panzer Group was ordered to move south in a giant pincer manoeuvre with Army Group South which was advancing into Ukraine. Army Group Centre's infantry divisions were left relatively unsupported by armour to continue their slow advance to Moscow.<ref name="wilt">{{cite journal |first=Alan F. |last=Wilt |title=Hitler's Late Summer Pause in 1941 |journal=[[The Journal of Military History|Military Affairs]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=187–191 |date=December 1981 |jstor=1987464 |doi=10.2307/1987464}}</ref>

This decision caused a severe leadership crisis. The German field commanders argued for an immediate offensive towards Moscow, but Hitler [[Lötzen decision|over-ruled them]], citing the importance of Ukrainian agricultural, mining and industrial resources, as well as the massing of Soviet reserves in the [[Gomel]] area between Army Group Centre's southern flank and the bogged-down Army Group South's northern flank. This decision, Hitler's "summer pause",<ref name="wilt" /> is believed to have had a severe impact on the [[Battle of Moscow]]'s outcome, by slowing down the advance on Moscow in favour of encircling large numbers of Soviet troops around Kiev.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Russel H.

[[Army Group South]], with the [[1st Panzer Group]], the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th]], [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11th]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Armies]], was tasked with advancing through [[Galicia (Central Europe)#Second World War and Distrikt Galizien|Galicia]] and into [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]. Their progress, however, was rather slow, and they took heavy casualties in a [[Battle of Brody (1941)|major tank battle]]. At the beginning of July, the [[Third Army (Romania)|Third]] and [[Fourth Army (Romania)|Fourth]] Romanian Armies, aided by elements of the German 11th Army, fought their way through [[Bessarabia]] towards [[Odessa]]. The 1st Panzer Group turned away from Kiev for the moment, advancing into the Dnieper bend (western [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]). When it joined up with the southern elements of Army Group South at [[Uman, Ukraine|Uman]], the Group [[Battle of Uman|captured about 100,000 Soviet prisoners]] in a huge encirclement.

As the [[Red Army]] withdrew behind the Dnieper and [[Daugava River|Dvina]] rivers, the Soviet [[Stavka]] (high command) turned its attention to evacuating as much of the western regions' industry as it could. Factories were dismantled and transported on flatcars away from the [[front line]] for re-establishment in more remote areas of the [[Ural Mountains]], [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]] and south-eastern [[Siberia]]. Most civilians were left to make their own way east, with only industry-related workers evacuated with the equipment; much of the population was left behind to the mercy of the invading forces.

Stalin ordered the retreating Red Army to initiate a [[scorched-earth policy]] to deny the Germans and their allies basic supplies as they advanced eastward. To carry out that order, [[destruction battalions]] were formed in front-line areas, having the authority to summarily execute any suspicious person. The destruction battalions burned down villages, schools, and public buildings.<ref name=paavle>{{cite book|author=[[:et:Indrek Paavle|Indrek Paavle]], Peeter Kaasik|year=2006|pages=469–493|chapter=Destruction battalions in Estonia in 1941|editor=[[:et:Toomas Hiio|Toomas Hiio]] |editor2=Meelis Maripuu |editor3=Indrek Paavle |title=Estonia 1940–1945: Reports of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity|location=Tallinn|title-link=Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity}}</ref> As a part of this policy, the [[NKVD prisoner massacres|NKVD massacred thousands of anti-Soviet prisoners]].<ref name="Social Catastrophe">{{cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Gellately|title=Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z42C6L-fxjUC&pg=PA391|year=2007|publisher=Alfred A.

Hitler then decided to resume the advance on Moscow, re-designating the panzer groups as panzer armies for the occasion. [[Battle of Moscow|Operation Typhoon]], which was set in motion on 30 September, saw the 2nd Panzer Army rush along the paved road from [[Oryol]] (captured 5 October) to the [[Oka River]] at [[Plavsk]], while the 4th Panzer Army (transferred from Army Group North to Centre) and 3rd Panzer armies surrounded the Soviet forces in two huge pockets at [[Vyazma]] and [[Bryansk]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Second World War|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|author-link=Martin Gilbert|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=1989|isbn=0-297-79616-X|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/secondworldwar00gilb_0/page/242 242–3]|url=https://archive.org/details/secondworldwar00gilb_0/page/242}}</ref> Army Group North positioned itself in front of [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and attempted to cut the rail link at [[Mga]] to the east.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Total War|last1=Calvocoressi|first1=Peter|last2=Wint|first2=Guy|publisher=Penguin|year=1972|location=Harmandsworth, England|pages=179}}</ref> This began the 900-day [[Siege of Leningrad]].

Army Group South pushed down from the Dnieper to the [[Sea of Azov]] coast, also advancing through [[Kharkov]], [[Kursk]], and [[Stalino]]. The combined German and Romanian forces moved into the [[Crimea]] and took control of all of the [[peninsula]] by autumn (except [[Sevastopol]], which [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942)|held out]] until 3 July 1942). On 21 November, the Wehrmacht [[Battle of Rostov (1941)|took Rostov]], the gateway to the [[Caucasus]]. However, the German lines were over-extended and the Soviet defenders counterattacked the 1st Panzer Army's spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of the city and behind the [[Mius River]]; the first significant German [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of the war.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stopped at Stalingrad|url=https://archive.org/details/stoppedatstaling00hayw|url-access=limited|last=Hayward|first=Joel|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=1998|isbn=0-7006-1146-0|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stoppedatstaling00hayw/page/n16 10]–11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Second World War|last=Liddell Hart|first=B.

The onset of the winter freeze saw one last German lunge that opened on 15 November, when the Wehrmacht attempted to encircle Moscow. On 27 November, the 4th Panzer Army got to within {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] when it reached the last tramstop of the Moscow line at [[Khimki]]. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Army failed to take [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], the last Soviet city that stood in its way to the capital. After a meeting held in [[Orsha]] between the head of the ''OKH'' ([[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army General Staff]]), General [[Franz Halder]] and the heads of three [[Army Group|Army]] groups and armies, decided to push forward to [[Moscow]] since it was better, as argued by the head of [[Army Group Center]], [[Field Marshal]] [[Fedor von Bock]], for them to try their luck on the battlefield rather than just sit and wait while their opponent gathered more strength.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Barbarossa|last=Clark|first=Alan|publisher=Cassell|year=1965|isbn=0-304-35864-9|location=London|pages=172–180}}</ref>

However, by 6 December it became clear that the ''Wehrmacht'' did not have the strength to capture Moscow, and the attack was suspended.

The Soviet counter-offensive during the Battle of Moscow had removed the immediate German threat to the city. According to [[Zhukov]], "the success of the December counter-offensive in the central strategic direction was considerable. Having suffered a major defeat the German striking forces of Army Group Centre were retreating." [[Stalin]]'s objective in January 1942 was "to deny the Germans any breathing space, to drive them westward without let-up, to make them use up their reserves before spring comes..."<ref name=GeorgyZhukov>{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=Pen and Sword Books Ltd. |year=1974 |isbn=9781781592915 |pages=52–53}}</ref>

The main blow was to be delivered by a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] orchestrated by the [[Northwestern Front]], the [[Kalinin Front]] and the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]]. The overall objective according to Zhukov was the "subsequent encirclement and destruction of the enemy's main forces in the area of Rzhev, Vyazma and Smolensk. The [[Leningrad Front]], the [[Volkhov Front]] and the right wing forces of the Northwestern Front were to rout the [[Army Group North]]." The [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] and [[Southern Front (Soviet Union)|Southern Front]] were to defeat the [[Army Group South]]. The [[Caucasian Front (Soviet Union)|Caucasian Front]] and [[Black Sea Fleet]] were to take back the [[Crimea]].<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|53}}

The 20th Army, part of the 1st Shock Army, the 22nd Tank Brigade and five ski battalions launched their attack on 10 January 1942. By 17 January, the Soviets had captured Lotoshino and Shakhovskaya. By 20 January, the 5th and 33rd armies had captured Ruza, Dorokhovo, Mozhaisk and Vereya, while the 43rd and 49th armies were at Domanovo.<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|58–59}}

The Wehrmacht rallied, retaining a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] at Rzhev. A Soviet [[Paratrooper|parachute drop]] by two battalions of the 201st Airborne Brigade and the 250th Airborne Regiment on 18 and 22 January was designed to "cut off enemy communications with the rear." Lt.-Gen. [[Mikhail Grigoryevich Yefremov]]'s 33rd Army aided by Gen. Belov's 1st Cavalry Corps and [[Soviet Partisans]] attempted to seize Vyazma. This force was joined by additional paratroopers of the 8th Airborne Brigade at the end of January. However, in early February, the Germans managed to cut off this force, separating the Soviets from their main force in the rear of the Germans. They were supplied by air until April when they were given permission to regain the Soviet main lines.

By April 1942, the Soviet Supreme Command agreed to assume the defensive so as to "consolidate the captured ground." According to Zhukov, ''"During the winter offensive, the forces of the Western Front had advanced from 70 to 100&nbsp;km, which somewhat improved the overall operational and strategic situation on the Western sector."''<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|64}}

To the north, the Red Army surrounded a German [[garrison]] in [[Demyansk]], which held out with air supply for four months, and established themselves in front of [[Kholm, Kholmsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kholm]], [[Velizh]], and [[Velikie Luki]].

Further north still, the Soviet Second Shock Army was unleashed on the [[Volkhov River]]. Initially this made some progress; however, it was unsupported, and by June a German counterattack cut off and destroyed the army. The Soviet commander, Lieutenant General [[Andrey Vlasov]], later defected to Germany and formed the ROA or [[Russian Liberation Army]].

In the south the Red Army lunged over the [[Donets River]] at [[Izyum]] and drove a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep salient. The intent was to pin Army Group South against the [[Sea of Azov]], but as the winter eased the Wehrmacht counter-attacked and cut off the over-extended Soviet troops in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]].

Although plans were made to attack Moscow again, on 28 June 1942, the offensive re-opened in a different direction. Army Group South took the initiative, anchoring the front with the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Voronezh]] and then following the [[Don River, Russia|Don river]] southeastwards. The grand plan was to secure the Don and [[Volga]] first and then drive into the Caucasus towards [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|the oil fields]], but operational considerations and Hitler's vanity made him order both objectives to be attempted simultaneously. Rostov was recaptured on 24 July when the 1st Panzer Army joined in, and then that group drove south towards [[Maykop|Maikop]]. As part of this, Operation Shamil was executed, a plan whereby a group of [[Brandenburger commando]]s dressed up as Soviet [[NKVD]] troops to destabilise Maikop's defences and allow the 1st Panzer Army to enter the oil town with little opposition.

Meanwhile, the 6th Army was driving towards [[Stalingrad]], for a long period unsupported by 4th Panzer Army, which had been diverted to help 1st Panzer Army cross the Don. By the time the 4th Panzer Army had rejoined the Stalingrad offensive Soviet resistance (comprising the 62nd Army under [[Vasily Chuikov]]) had stiffened. A leap across the Don brought German troops to the Volga on 23 August but for the next three months the ''Wehrmacht'' would be fighting the Battle of Stalingrad street-by-street.

Towards the south, the 1st Panzer Army had reached the Caucasian foothills and the [[Malka River]]. At the end of August Romanian mountain troops joined the Caucasian spearhead, while the Romanian 3rd and 4th armies were redeployed from their successful task of clearing the Azov [[littoral]]. They took up position on either side of Stalingrad to free German troops for the main offensive. Mindful of the continuing antagonism between Axis allies Romania and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], the Romanian army in the Don bend was separated from the Hungarian 2nd army by the Italian 8th Army. Thus, all of Hitler's allies were involved – including a [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakian]] contingent with the 1st Panzer Army and a [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian]] [[regiment]] attached to 6th Army.

The advance into the Caucasus bogged down, with the Germans unable to fight their way past [[Malgobek]] and to the main prize of [[Grozny]]. Instead, they switched the direction of their advance to approach it from the south, crossing the Malka at the end of October and entering [[North Ossetia–Alania|North Ossetia]]. In the first week of November, on the outskirts of [[Vladikavkaz|Ordzhonikidze]], the 13th Panzer Division's spearhead was snipped off and the panzer troops had to fall back. The offensive into Russia was over.

While the German 6th and 4th Panzer Armies had been fighting their way into Stalingrad, Soviet armies had congregated on either side of the city, specifically into the Don [[bridgehead]]s, and it was from these that they struck in November 1942. In [[Operation Uranus]] started on 19 November, two Soviet fronts punched through the Romanian lines and converged at [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]] on 23 November, trapping 300,000 Axis troops behind them.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.925–926</ref> A simultaneous offensive on the Rzhev sector known as [[Operation Mars]] was supposed to advance to Smolensk, but was a costly failure, with German tactical defences preventing any breakthrough.

The Germans rushed to transfer troops to the Soviet Union in a desperate attempt to relieve Stalingrad, but the offensive could not get going until 12 December, by which time the 6th Army in Stalingrad was starving and too weak to break out towards it. [[Operation Wintergewitter|Operation Winter Storm]], with three transferred panzer divisions, got going briskly from [[Kotelnikovo]] towards the Aksai river but became bogged down {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} short of its goal. To divert the rescue attempt, the Red Army decided to smash the Italians and come down behind the relief attempt if they could; that operation starting on 16 December. What it did accomplish was to destroy many of the aircraft that had been transporting relief supplies to Stalingrad. The fairly limited scope of the Soviet offensive, although still eventually targeted on Rostov, also allowed Hitler time to see sense and pull Army Group A out of the Caucasus and back over the Don.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.927–928</ref>

On 31 January 1943, the 90,000 survivors of the 300,000-man 6th Army surrendered. By that time the Hungarian 2nd Army had also been wiped out. The Red Army advanced from the Don {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of Stalingrad, marching through Kursk (retaken on 8 February 1943) and Kharkov (retaken 16 February 1943). To save the position in the south, the Germans decided to abandon the Rzhev salient in February, freeing enough troops to make a successful [[riposte]] in eastern Ukraine. [[Erich von Manstein|Manstein]]'s counteroffensive, strengthened by a specially trained [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]] equipped with [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]], opened on 20 February 1943 and fought its way from [[Poltava]] [[Third Battle of Kharkov|back into Kharkov]] in the third week of March, when the spring thaw intervened.This left a glaring Soviet bulge ([[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]) in the front centered on Kursk.

After the failure of the attempt to capture Stalingrad, Hitler had delegated planning authority for the upcoming campaign season to the [[German Army High Command]] and reinstated [[Heinz Guderian]] to a prominent role, this time as Inspector of Panzer Troops. Debate among the General Staff was polarised, with even Hitler nervous about any attempt to pinch off the Kursk salient. He knew that in the intervening six months the Soviet position at Kursk had been reinforced heavily with [[anti-tank]] guns, [[tank trap]]s, [[land mine|landmines]], [[barbed wire]], [[trench warfare|trenches]], [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]], [[artillery]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name="Mastny 1365–1388">{{cite journal

However, if one last great ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' offensive could be mounted, then attention could then be turned to the Allied threat to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. Certainly, the peace negotiations in April had gone nowhere.<ref name="Mastny 1365–1388"/> The advance would be executed from the Orel salient to the north of Kursk and from [[Belgorod]] to the south. Both wings would converge on the area east of Kursk, and by that means restore the lines of [[Army Group South]] to the exact points that it held over the winter of 1941–1942.

[[File:RIAN archive 997 Soldiers and a gun on the road.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.9|Soviet soldiers and 45mm gun on the road, 1 August 1943]]

In the north, the entire [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] had been redeployed from the Rzhev salient into the Orel salient and was to advance from Maloarkhangelsk to Kursk. But its forces could not even get past the first objective at [[Olkhovatka]], just {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the advance. The 9th Army blunted its spearhead against the Soviet [[land mine|minefields]], frustratingly so considering that the high ground there was the only natural barrier between them and flat tank country all the way to Kursk. The direction of advance was then switched to [[Ponyri]], to the west of Olkhovatka, but the 9th Army could not break through here either and went over to the defensive. The Red Army then launched a counter-offensive, [[Operation Kutuzov]].

On 12 July the Red Army battled through the demarcation line between the 211th and 293rd divisions on the [[Zhizdra River]] and steamed towards [[Karachev]], right behind them and behind Orel. The southern offensive, spearheaded by [[German 4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Army]], led by Gen. Col. [[Hermann Hoth|Hoth]], with three Tank Corps made more headway. Advancing on either side of the upper Donets on a narrow corridor, the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] and the [[Grossdeutschland Division|Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier divisions]] battled their way through minefields and over comparatively high ground towards [[Oboyan]]. Stiff resistance caused a change of direction from east to west of the front, but the tanks got {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} before encountering the reserves of the [[Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army]] outside [[Prokhorovka]]. Battle was joined on 12 July, with about one thousand tanks being engaged.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Merz-014-12A, Russland, Beginn Unternehmen Zitadelle, Panzer.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Prokhorovka]] was one of the largest tank battles ever fought. It was part of the wider [[Battle of Kursk]].|alt=]]

After the war, the battle near Prochorovka was idealised by Soviet [[historian]]s as the largest tank battle of all time. The [[meeting engagement]] at Prochorovka was a Soviet defensive success, albeit at heavy cost. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army, with about 800 light and medium tanks, attacked elements of the II SS Panzer Corps. Tank losses on both sides have been the source of controversy ever since. Although the 5th Guards Tank Army did not attain its objectives, the German advance had been halted.

At the end of the day both sides had fought each other to a standstill, but regardless of the German failure in the north [[Erich von Manstein]] proposed he continue the attack with the 4th Panzer Army. The Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' [[Operation Husky|landing in Sicily]] on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halt the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north. The Germans' final strategic offensive in the Soviet Union ended with their defence against a major Soviet counteroffensive that lasted into August.

The Kursk offensive was the last on the scale of 1940 and 1941 that the ''Wehrmacht'' was able to launch; subsequent offensives would represent only a shadow of previous German offensive might.

[[File:BM 13 TBiU 7.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]]" – a notable Soviet rocket launcher]]
The Soviet multi-stage summer offensive started with the advance into the Orel salient. The diversion of the well-equipped ''Großdeutschland Division'' from Belgorod to Karachev could not counteract it, and the Wehrmacht began a withdrawal from Orel (retaken by the Red Army on 5 August 1943), falling back to the Hagen line in front of [[Bryansk]]. To the south, the Red Army broke through Army Group South's Belgorod positions and headed for Kharkov once again. Although intense battles of movement throughout late July and into August 1943 saw the [[Tiger I|Tigers]] blunting Soviet tank attacks on one axis, they were soon outflanked on another line to the west as the Soviet forces advanced down the [[Olshanka|Psel]], and Kharkov was abandoned for the final time on 22 August.

The German forces on the [[Mius]], now comprising the 1st Panzer Army and a reconstituted 6th Army, were by August too weak to repulse a Soviet attack on their own front, and when the Red Army hit them they retreated all the way through the [[Donbass]] industrial region to the Dnieper, losing half the farmland that Germany had invaded the Soviet Union to exploit. At this time Hitler agreed to a general withdrawal to the Dnieper line, along which was meant to be the ''Ostwall'', a line of defence similar to the [[Westwall#Reactivation of the Siegfried Line, 1944|Westwall]] (Siegfried Line) of fortifications along the German frontier in the west.

The main problem for the Wehrmacht was that these defences had not yet been built; by the time Army Group South had evacuated eastern Ukraine and begun withdrawing across the Dnieper during September, the Soviet forces were hard behind them. Tenaciously, small units paddled their way across the {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide river and established [[bridgehead]]s. A second attempt by the Red Army to gain land using parachutists, mounted at [[Kaniv]] on 24 September, proved as disappointing as at Dorogobuzh eighteen months previously. The paratroopers were soon repelled – but not until still more Red Army troops had used the cover they provided to get themselves over the Dnieper and securely dug in.


As September ended and October started, the Germans found the Dnieper line impossible to hold as the Soviet bridgeheads grew. Important Dnieper towns started to fall, with [[Zaporozhye]] the first to go, followed by [[Dnepropetrovsk]]. Finally, early in November the Red Army broke out of its bridgeheads on either side of Kiev and captured the Ukrainian capital, at that time the third largest city in the Soviet Union.

{{convert|80|mi|km|round=10|order=flip}} west of Kiev, the 4th Panzer Army, still convinced that the Red Army was a spent force, was able to mount a successful riposte at [[Zhytomyr]] during the middle of November, weakening the Soviet bridgehead by a daring outflanking strike mounted by the SS Panzer Corps along the river Teterev. This battle also enabled Army Group South to recapture Korosten and gain some time to rest. However, on [[Christmas Eve]] the retreat began anew when the First Ukrainian Front (renamed from the Voronezh Front) struck them in the same place. The Soviet advance continued along the railway line until the 1939 Polish–Soviet border was reached on 3 January 1944.

To the south, the Second Ukrainian Front (ex [[Steppe Front]]) had crossed the Dnieper at [[Kremenchug]] and continued westwards. In the second week of January 1944 they swung north, meeting Vatutin's tank forces which had swung south from their penetration into Poland and surrounding ten German divisions at Korsun–Shevchenkovsky, west of [[Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Cherkassy]]. Hitler's insistence on holding the Dnieper line, even when facing the prospect of catastrophic defeat, was compounded by his conviction that the Cherkassy pocket could break out and even advance to Kiev, but Manstein was more concerned about being able to advance to the edge of the pocket and then implore the surrounded forces to break out.

By 16 February the first stage was complete, with panzers separated from the contracting Cherkassy pocket only by the swollen Gniloy Tikich river. Under shellfire and pursued by Soviet tanks, the surrounded German troops, among whom were the [[SS Division (motorised) Wiking|5th SS Panzer Division ''Wiking'']], fought their way across the river to safety, although at the cost of half their number and all their equipment. They assumed the Red Army would not attack again, with the spring approaching, but on 3 March the Soviet Ukrainian Front went over to the offensive. Having already isolated the Crimea by severing the [[Isthmus of Perekop|Perekop isthmus]], Malinovsky's forces advanced across the mud to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] border, not stopping on the river [[Prut]].

One final move in the south completed the 1943–44 campaigning season, which had wrapped up a Soviet advance of over {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip}}. In March, 20 German divisions of ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Hans-Valentin Hube]]'s [[1st Panzer Army]] were encircled in what was to be known as [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket|Hube's Pocket]] near Kamenets-Podolskiy. After two weeks' of heavy fighting, the 1st Panzer managed to escape the pocket, at the cost of losing almost the entire heavy equipment. At this point, Hitler sacked several prominent generals, Manstein included. In April, the Red Army took back [[Odessa]], followed by 4th Ukrainian Front's campaign to restore control over the Crimea, which culminated in the capture of [[Sevastopol]] on 10 May.

Along Army Group Centre's front, August 1943 saw this force pushed back from the Hagen line slowly, ceding comparatively little territory, but the loss of Bryansk, and more importantly Smolensk, on 25 September cost the ''Wehrmacht'' the keystone of the entire German defensive system. The 4th and 9th armies and 3rd Panzer Army still held their own east of the upper Dnieper, stifling Soviet attempts to reach Vitebsk. On Army Group North's front, there was barely any fighting at all until January 1944, when out of nowhere Volkhov and Second Baltic Fronts struck.<ref name="glantz"/>

In a lightning campaign, the Germans were pushed back from Leningrad and [[Novgorod]] was captured by Soviet forces. After a {{convert|75|mi|km|order=flip|adj=on|round=10}} advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia.

''Wehrmacht'' planners were convinced that the Red Army would attack again in the south, where the front was {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip}} from [[Lviv]] and offered the most direct route to [[Berlin]]. Accordingly, they stripped troops from Army Group Centre, whose front still protruded deep into the Soviet Union. The Germans had transferred some units to France to counter the [[invasion of Normandy]] two weeks before. The Belorussian Offensive (codenamed [[Operation Bagration]]), which was agreed upon by Allies at the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943 and launched on 22 June 1944, was a massive Soviet attack, consisting of four Soviet army groups totalling over 120 divisions that smashed into a thinly held German line.

They focused their massive attacks on Army Group Centre, not Army Group North Ukraine as the Germans had originally expected. More than 2.3&nbsp;million Soviet troops went into action against German Army Group Centre, which had a strength of fewer than 800,000 men. At the points of attack, the numerical and quality advantages of the Soviet forces were overwhelming. The Red Army achieved a ratio of ten to one in tanks and seven to one in aircraft over their enemy. The Germans crumbled. The capital of [[Belarus]], [[Minsk]], was taken on 3 July, trapping some 100,000 Germans. Ten days later the Red Army reached the prewar Polish border. ''Bagration'' was, by any measure, one of the largest single operations of the war.

By the end of August 1944, it had cost the Germans ~400,000 dead, wounded, missing and sick, from whom 160,000 were captured, as well as 2,000 tanks and 57,000 other vehicles. In the operation, the Red Army lost ~180,000 dead and missing (765,815 in total, including wounded and sick plus 5,073 Poles),<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite book|last=Krivosheev|first=G.

On the [[Karelian Isthmus]], the Red Army launched a [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive]] against the Finnish lines on 9 June 1944, (coordinated with the Western Allied Invasion of Normandy). Three armies were pitted there against the Finns, among them several experienced guards rifle formations. The attack breached the Finnish front line of defence in Valkeasaari on 10 June and the Finnish forces retreated to their secondary defence line, the [[VT-line]]. The Soviet attack was supported by a heavy artillery barrage, air bombardments and armoured forces. The VT-line was breached on 14 June and after a failed counterattack in Kuuterselkä by the Finnish armoured division, the Finnish defence had to be pulled back to the [[VKT-line]]. After heavy fighting in the battles of [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala|Tali-Ihantala]] and [[Battle of Ilomantsi|Ilomantsi]], Finnish troops finally managed to halt the Soviet attack.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In Poland, as the Red Army approached, the [[Polish Home Army]] (AK) launched [[Operation Tempest]]. During the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the Red Army were ordered to halt at the [[Vistula River]].

In [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], the [[Slovak National Uprising]] started as an armed struggle between German ''Wehrmacht'' forces and rebel Slovak troops between August and October 1944. It was centered at [[Banská Bystrica]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

On 8 September 1944 the Red Army began an attack on the [[Battle of the Dukla Pass|Dukla Pass]] on the Slovak–Polish border. Two months later, the Soviet forces won the battle and entered Slovakia. The toll was high: 20,000 Red Army soldiers died, plus several thousand Germans, Slovaks and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechs]].

Under the pressure of the Soviet [[Baltic Offensive (1944)|Baltic Offensive]], the German Army Group North [[Tallinn Offensive|were withdrawn]] to fight in the sieges of [[Moonzund Landing Operation|Saaremaa]], [[Courland Pocket|Courland]] and [[Battle of Memel|Memel]].

The Soviet Union finally entered [[Warsaw]] on 17 January 1945, after the city was destroyed and abandoned by the Germans. Over three days, on a broad front incorporating four army [[Front (Soviet Army)|fronts]], the Red Army launched the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]] across the Narew River and from Warsaw. The Soviets outnumbered the Germans on average by 5–6:1 in troops, 6:1 in artillery, 6:1 in tanks and 4:1 in [[self-propelled artillery]]. After four days the Red Army broke out and started moving thirty to forty kilometres a day, taking the Baltic states, [[Danzig]], [[East Prussia]], [[Poznań]], and drawing up on a line sixty kilometres east of [[Berlin]] along the River [[Oder]]. During the full course of the Vistula–Oder operation (23 days), the Red Army forces sustained 194,191 total casualties (killed, wounded and missing) and lost 1,267 tanks and assault guns.

On 25 January 1945, Hitler renamed three army groups. [[Army Group North]] became [[Army Group Courland]]; Army Group Centre became Army Group North and [[Army Group A]] became Army Group Centre. Army Group North (old Army Group Centre) was driven into an ever-smaller pocket around [[Königsberg]] in [[East Prussia]].

A limited counter-attack (codenamed [[Operation Solstice]]) by the newly created [[Army Group Vistula]], under the command of ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], had failed by 24 February, and the Red Army drove on to [[Pomerania]] and cleared the right bank of the Oder River. In the south, the German attempts, in [[Operation Konrad]], to relieve the encircled garrison at [[Budapest]] failed and the city fell on 13 February. On 6 March, the Germans launched what would be their final major offensive of the war, [[Operation Spring Awakening]], which failed by 16 March. On 30 March the Red Army entered [[Austria]] and captured [[Vienna]] on 13 April.

OKW claim German losses of 77,000 killed, 334,000 wounded and 292,000 missing, with a total of 703,000 men, on the Eastern Front during January and February 1945.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|title=Armageddon: The Battle for Germany, 1944–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKmeiZmEXJoC&pg=PP1|year=2005|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-375-71422-1}}</ref>

On 9 April 1945, Königsberg in East Prussia finally fell to the Red Army, although the shattered remnants of Army Group Centre continued to resist on the [[Vistula Spit]] and [[Hel Peninsula]] until the end of the war in Europe. The [[East Prussian Offensive|East Prussian operation]], though often overshadowed by the Vistula–Oder operation and the later battle for Berlin, was in fact one of the largest and costliest operations fought by the Red Army throughout the war. During the period it lasted (13 January – 25 April), it cost the Red Army 584,788 casualties, and 3,525 tanks and assault guns.

The fall of Königsberg allowed Stavka to free up General [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]'s [[2nd Belorussian Front]] (2BF) to move west to the east bank of the Oder. During the first two weeks of April, the Red Army performed their fastest front redeployment of the war. General [[Georgy Zhukov]] concentrated his [[1st Belorussian Front]] (1BF), which had been deployed along the Oder river from [[Frankfurt an der Oder|Frankfurt]] in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the [[Seelow Heights]]. The 2BF moved into the positions being vacated by the 1BF north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines and the remnants of the German 2nd Army, which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig, managed to escape across the Oder. To the south General [[Ivan Konev]] shifted the main weight of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] (1UF) out of [[Upper Silesia]] north-west to the [[Neisse]] River.<ref name=Ziemke71>Ziemke, ''Berlin'', see [[#References|References]] page 71</ref> The three Soviet fronts had altogether some 2.5&nbsp;million men (including 78,556 soldiers of the [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|1st Polish Army]]); 6,250 tanks; 7,500 aircraft; 41,600 artillery pieces and mortars; 3,255 [[truck]]-mounted [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] [[rocket launcher]]s, (nicknamed "Stalin Organs"); and 95,383 motor vehicles, many of which were manufactured in the United States.<ref name=Ziemke71 />

The Soviet offensive had two objectives. Because of Stalin's suspicions about the intentions of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] to hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet [[sphere of influence]], the offensive was to be on a broad front and was to move as rapidly as possible to the west, to meet the Western Allies as far west as possible. But the over-riding objective was to capture Berlin. The two were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin was taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and part of the [[German nuclear energy project|German atomic bomb]] program.<ref>Beevor, ''Berlin'', see [[#References|References]] Page 138</ref>

The [[Battle of Berlin|offensive to capture central Germany and Berlin]] started on 16 April with an assault on the [[Battle of the Oder–Neisse|German front lines on the Oder and Neisse rivers]]. After several days of heavy fighting the Soviet 1BF and 1UF punched holes through the German front line and were fanning out across central Germany. By 24 April, elements of the 1BF and 1UF had completed the [[encirclement]] of the German capital and the [[Battle of Berlin]] entered its final stages. On 25 April the 2BF broke through the German 3rd Panzer Army's line south of [[Stettin]]. They were now free to move west towards the [[British 21st Army Group]] and north towards the Baltic port of [[Stralsund]]. The [[58th Guards Rifle Division]] of the [[5th Guards Army]] made contact with the [[US 69th Infantry Division]] of the [[U.S. First Army|First Army]] near [[Torgau]], Germany at the [[Elbe]] river.<ref name="Beevor217-233">Beevor, ''Berlin'', see [[#References|References]] pp. 217–233</ref><ref name=Ziemke81>Ziemke, ''Berlin'', see [[#References|References]] pp. 81–111</ref>

At 2:41 am on 7 May 1945, at [[SHAEF]] headquarters, German Chief-of-Staff General [[Alfred Jodl]] signed the [[German Instrument of Surrender|unconditional surrender]] documents for all German forces to the Allies at [[Reims]] in France. It included the phrase ''All forces under German control to cease active operations at 2301 hours Central European time on 8 May 1945''. The next day shortly before midnight, Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] repeated the signing in Berlin at Zhukov's headquarters, now known as the [[German-Russian Museum]]. [[The end of World War II in Europe|The war in Europe was over]].<ref>Ziemke, ''occupation'', [[#References|References]] [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/other/us-army_germany_1944-46_ch15.htm#b3 CHAPTER XV:The Victory Sealed] Page 258 last paragraph</ref>

In the Soviet Union the end of the war is considered to be 9 May, when the surrender took effect [[Moscow]] time. This date is celebrated as a [[Public holiday|national holiday]] – [[Victory Day (Eastern Europe)|Victory Day]] – in [[Russia]] (as part of a two-day 8–9 May holiday) and some other post-Soviet countries. The [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945|ceremonial Victory parade]] was held in Moscow on 24 June.

The German Army Group Centre initially refused to surrender and continued to [[Prague Offensive|fight in Czechoslovakia]] until about 11 May.<ref name="Ziemke-134">Ziemke, ''Berlin'', [[#References|References]] p. 134</ref>

A small German garrison on the Danish island of Bornholm refused to surrender until they were bombed and invaded by the Soviets. The island was returned to the Danish government four months later.

===Soviet Far East: August 1945===
{{Main|Soviet invasion of Manchuria}}
After the German defeat, [[Joseph Stalin]] promised his allies Truman and Churchill, that he would attack the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] within 90 days of the German surrender. The [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] began on 8 August 1945, with an assault on the Japanese puppet states of [[Manchukuo]] and neighbouring [[Mengjiang]]; the greater offensive would eventually include northern [[Korea]], [[South Sakhalin|southern Sakhalin]], and the [[Kuril Islands]]. Apart from the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]], it marked the only military action of the Soviet Union against [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]; at the [[Yalta Conference]], it had agreed to Allied pleas to terminate the neutrality pact with Japan and enter the Second World War's Pacific theatre within three months after the end of the war in Europe. While not a part of the Eastern Front operations, it is included here because the commanders and much of the forces used by the Red Army came from the European Theatre of operations and benefited from the experience gained there. In many ways this was a 'perfect' operation, delivered with the skill gained during the bitter fighting with the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe over four years.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Raymond L. |last=Garthoff |title=The Soviet Manchurian Campaign, August 1945 |journal=Military Affairs |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=312–336 |date=October 1969 |jstor=1983926 |doi=10.2307/1983926}}</ref>

The Eastern Front was the largest and bloodiest [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]] of [[World War II]]. It is generally accepted as being the deadliest conflict in human history, with over 30&nbsp;million killed as a result.<ref name=30m>According to G. I. Krivosheev. (''Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses.'' Greenhill 1997 {{ISBN|1-85367-280-7}}), in the Eastern Front, Axis countries and German co-belligerents sustained 1,468,145 irrecoverable losses (668,163 KIA/MIA), Germany itself– 7,181,100 (3,604,800 KIA/MIA), and 579,900 PoWs died in Soviet captivity. So the Axis KIA/MIA amounted to 4.8 million in the East during the period of 1941–1945. This is more than a half of all Axis losses (including the Asia/Pacific theatre). The USSR sustained 10.5 million military losses (including PoWs who died in German captivity, according to Vadim Erlikman. ''Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik.'' Moscow 2004. {{ISBN|5-93165-107-1}}), so the number of military deaths (the USSR and the Axis) amounted to 15 million, far greater than in all other World War II theatres. According to the same source, total Soviet civilian deaths within post-war borders amounted to 15.7 million. The numbers for other Central European and German civilian casualties are not included here.</ref> The [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]] suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.<ref>{{cite book|last=Duiker|first=William J.|title=Contemporary World History|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd0bCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT159|edition=sixth|year=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-44790-2|page=138|chapter=The Crisis Deepens: The Outbreak of World War II}}</ref> It involved more land combat than all other World War II theatres combined. The distinctly brutal nature of warfare on the Eastern Front was exemplified by an often wilful disregard for human life by both sides. It was also reflected in the ideological premise for the war, which also saw a momentous clash between two directly opposed ideologies.

Aside from the ideological conflict, the mindframe of the leaders of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] respectively, contributed to the escalation of terror and murder on an unprecedented scale. Stalin and Hitler both disregarded human life in order to achieve their goal of victory. This included the terrorisation of their own people, as well as [[mass deportation]]s of entire populations. All these factors resulted in tremendous brutality both to combatants and civilians that found no parallel on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].

{{quote|In War II Russia occupies a dominant position and is the decisive factor looking toward the defeat of the Axis in Europe. While in Sicily the forces of Great Britain and the United States are being opposed by 2 German divisions, the Russian front is receiving attention of approximately 200 German divisions.

The war inflicted huge losses and suffering upon the civilian populations of the affected countries. Behind the front lines, [[wikt:atrocity|atrocities]] against civilians in German-occupied areas were routine, including those carried out as part of the Holocaust. German and German-allied forces treated civilian populations with exceptional brutality, massacring whole village populations and routinely killing civilian hostages (see [[German war crimes]]). Both sides practised widespread [[scorched earth]] tactics, but the loss of civilian lives in the case of Germany was incomparably smaller than that of the Soviet Union, in which at least 20&nbsp;million were killed. According to British historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]], "The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater: since a high proportion of those killed were young men of child-begetting age, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than post-1939 projections would have led one to expect."<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosking|first=Geoffrey A.|title=Rulers and Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&pg=PA242|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|page=242}}</ref>

When the Red Army invaded Germany in 1944, many German civilians suffered from reprisals by Red Army soldiers (see [[Soviet war crimes]]). After the war, following the [[Yalta conference]] agreements between the Allies, the [[German people|German populations]] of [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|displaced to the west]] of the [[Oder–Neisse line]], in what became one of the largest [[forced migration]]s of people in world history.

The Soviet Union came out of World War II militarily victorious but economically and structurally devastated. Much of the combat took place in or close to populated areas, and the actions of both sides contributed to massive loss of civilian life and tremendous material damage. According to a summary, presented by Lieutenant General [[Roman Rudenko]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in [[Nuremberg]], the property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679&nbsp;billion rubles. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2&nbsp;million citizens dead during the [[Siege of Leningrad]].<ref name="ReferenceB">''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.</ref>

The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, {{convert|40000|mi|km|order=flip}} of railroad, 4,100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries; leaving 25&nbsp;million homeless. Seven million horses, 17&nbsp;million cattle, 20&nbsp;million pigs, 27&nbsp;million sheep were also slaughtered or driven off.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Wild fauna were also affected. Wolves and foxes fleeing westward from the killing zone, as the Soviet army advanced between 1943 and 1945, were responsible for a [[rabies]] epidemic that spread slowly westwards, reaching the coast of the [[English Channel]] by 1968.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=1–2}}</ref>

==Leadership==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were both ideologically driven states (by [[Soviet communism]] and by [[Nazism]] respectively), in which the foremost political [[leader]]s had [[Totalitarianism|near-absolute power]]. The character of the war was thus determined by the political leaders and their [[ideology]] to a much greater extent than in any other theatre of World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Adolf Hitler===
{{Main|Adolf Hitler}}
[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] led Germany during World War II.]]

Adolf Hitler exercised tight control over the German war-effort, spending much of his time in his command bunkers (most notably at [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]], at [[Vinnitsa]] in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], and under the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] in [[Berlin]]). At crucial periods in the war he held daily situation-conferences at which he used his remarkable talent for public speaking to overwhelm opposition from his generals and from the OKW staff with rhetoric.

In part because of the unexpected degree of German success in the Battle of France (despite the warnings of the professional military) Hitler believed himself a military genius, with a grasp of the total war-effort that eluded his generals. In August 1941, when [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] (commander-in-chief of the ''Wehrmacht'') and [[Fedor von Bock]] appealed for an attack on Moscow, Hitler instead ordered the encirclement and capture of Ukraine, in order to acquire the farmland, industry, and natural resources of that country. Some historians like Bevin Alexander in ''How Hitler Could Have Won'' regard this decision as a missed opportunity to win the war.

In the winter of 1941–1942 Hitler believed that his obstinate refusal to allow the German armies to retreat had saved Army Group Centre from collapse. He later told [[Erhard Milch]]:

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B24543, Hauptquartier Heeresgruppe Süd, Lagebesprechung.jpg|thumb|Hitler with generals [[Friedrich Paulus]], [[Adolf Heusinger]] and [[Fedor von Bock]] in Poltawa, German-occupied Ukraine, June 1942]]

<blockquote>
I had to act ruthlessly. I had to send even my closest generals packing, two army generals, for example … I could only tell these gentlemen, "Get yourself back to Germany as rapidly as you can – but leave the army in my charge. And the army is staying at the front."
</blockquote>

The success of this [[hedgehog defence]] outside Moscow led Hitler to insist on the holding of territory when it made no military sense, and to sack generals who retreated without orders. Officers with initiative were replaced with yes-men or with fanatical Nazis. The disastrous encirclements later in the war – at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun]] and many other places – resulted directly from Hitler's orders. This idea of holding territory led to another failed plan, dubbed{{by whom|date=May 2018}} "''Heaven-bound Missions''", which involved fortifying even the most unimportant or insignificant of cities and the holding of these "fortresses" at all costs. Many divisions became cut off in "fortress" cities, or wasted uselessly in secondary theatres, because Hitler would not sanction retreat or voluntarily abandon any of his conquests.

Frustration at Hitler's [[leadership]] in the war was one of the factors in the attempted [[coup d'etat]] of 1944, but after the failure of the [[20 July Plot]] Hitler considered the army and its officer corps suspect and came to rely on the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and Nazi party members to prosecute the war.

Hitler's direction of the war ultimately proved disastrous for the German Army, though the skill, loyalty, professionalism and endurance of officers and soldiers enabled him to keep Germany fighting to the end. [[F. W. Winterbotham]] wrote of Hitler's signal to [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] to continue the attack to the west during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]:

{{quote|From experience we had learned that when Hitler started refusing to do what the generals recommended, things started to go wrong, and this was to be no exception.}}

===Joseph Stalin===
{{Main|Joseph Stalin}}
[[File:CroppedStalin1943.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin]] led the Soviet Union during World War II.]]

Joseph Stalin bore the greatest responsibility for some of the disasters at the beginning of the war (for example, the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)]]), but equally deserves praise for the subsequent success of the Soviet [[Red Army]], which depended on the unprecedentedly [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union]], which Stalin's internal policy had made the first priority throughout the 1930s.
Stalin's [[Great Purge]] of the Red Army in the late 1930s involved the legal prosecution of many of the senior command, many of whom the courts convicted and sentenced to death or to imprisonment.

The executed included [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], a proponent of armoured [[blitzkrieg]]. Stalin promoted some [[obscurantist]]s like [[Grigory Kulik]] who opposed the mechanisation of the army and the production of tanks, but on the other hand purged the older commanders who had held their positions since the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917–1922, and who had experience, but were deemed "politically unreliable". This opened up their places to the promotion of many younger officers that Stalin and the [[NKVD]] regarded as in line with [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] politics. Many{{quantify|date=May 2018}} of these newly promoted commanders proved terribly inexperienced, but some later became very successful. Soviet tank-output remained the largest in the world.

From the foundation of the Red Army in 1918, political distrust of the military had led to a system of "dual command", with every commander paired with a [[political commissar]], a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Larger units had military councils consisting of the commander, commissar and chief of staff – commissars ensured the loyalty of the commanding officers and implemented Party orders.

Following the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation of eastern Poland]], of the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|Baltic states]] and of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] in 1939–1940, Stalin insisted on the occupation of every fold of the newly Sovietized territories; this move westward positioned troops far from their depots, in salients that left them vulnerable to encirclement. As tension heightened in spring, 1941, Stalin desperately tried not to give Hitler any provocation that Berlin could use as an excuse for a German attack; Stalin refused to allow the military to go on the alert – even as German troops gathered on the borders and German reconnaissance planes overflew installations. This refusal to take necessary action was instrumental in the destruction of major portions of the Red Air Force, lined up on its airfields, in the first days of the German-Soviet war.

At the crisis of the war, in the autumn of 1942, Stalin made many concessions to the army: the government restored unitary command by removing the Commissars from the [[chain of command]]. Order 25 of 15 January 1943 introduced [[Shoulder mark|shoulderboards]] for all ranks; this represented a significant symbolic step, since after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] shoulderboards had connotations as a symbol of the old Tsarist régime. Beginning in autumn 1941, units that had proved themselves by superior performance in combat were given the traditional "Guards" title.{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 181}}

These concessions were combined with ruthless discipline: [[Order No. 227]], issued on 28 July 1942, threatened commanders who retreated without orders with punishment by [[court-martial]]. Infractions by military and ''[[politruk]]s'' were punished with transferral to [[penal battalion]]s and to penal [[Company (military unit)|companies]] which carried out especially hazardous duties, such as serving as ''tramplers'' to clear Nazi minefields.<ref>{{Citation | last = Toppe | first = Alfred | title = Night Combat | publisher = Diane | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7881-7080-5 | page = 28}}</ref> The order stipulated to capture or shoot "cowards" and fleeing panicked troops at the rear the blocking detachments in the first three months shot 1,000 penal troops and sent 24,993 to penal battalions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953|last=Roberts|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11204-1|pages=132}}</ref> By October 1942 the idea of regular blocking detachments was quietly dropped, By 29 October 1944 the units were officially disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bdsa.ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%8B-%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B7%D0%B0-1944-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4/784-636|title=ПРИКАЗ О РАСФОРМИРОВАНИИ ОТДЕЛЬНЫХ ЗАГРАДИТЕЛЬНЫХ ОТРЯДОВ|website=bdsa.ru|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ivan's War: Life and Death in the Red Army|last=Merridale|first=Catherine|publisher=New York : Metropolitan Books|year=2006|isbn=0-8050-7455-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158 158]|oclc=60671899|url=https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158}}</ref>

As it became clear that the Soviet Union would win the war, Stalin ensured that propaganda always mentioned his leadership of the war; he sidelined the victorious generals and never allowed them to develop into political rivals. After the war the Soviets once again purged the Red Army (though not as brutally as in the 1930s) and demoted many successful officers (including [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]], [[Rodion Malinovsky|Malinovsky]] and [[Ivan Koniev|Koniev]]) to unimportant positions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The enormous territorial gains of 1941 presented Germany with vast areas to pacify and administer. For the majority of people of the Soviet Union, the Nazi invasion was viewed as a brutal act of unprovoked aggression. While it is important to note that not all parts of Soviet society viewed the German advance in this way, the majority of the Soviet population viewed German forces as occupiers. In areas such as [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] (which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940) the ''Wehrmacht'' was tolerated by a relatively more significant part of the native population.

This was particularly true for the territories of Western Ukraine, recently rejoined to the Soviet Union, where the anti-Polish and anti-Soviet [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian nationalist underground]] hoped in vain to establish the "independent state", relying on German armed force. However, Soviet society as a whole was hostile to the invading Nazis from the very start. The nascent national liberation movements among Ukrainians and [[Cossack]]s, and others were viewed by Hitler with suspicion; some, especially those from the Baltic States, were co-opted into the Axis armies and others brutally suppressed. None of the conquered territories gained any measure of self-rule.

Instead, the [[Nazism|Nazi ideologues]] saw the future of the East as one of settlement by German colonists, with the natives killed, expelled, or reduced to slave labour. The cruel and brutally inhumane treatment of Soviet civilians, women, children and elderly, the daily bombings of civilian cities and towns, Nazi pillaging of Soviet villages and hamlets and unprecedented harsh punishment and treatment of civilians in general were some of the primary reasons for Soviet resistance to Nazi Germany's invasion. Indeed, the Soviets viewed Germany's invasion as an act of aggression and an attempt to conquer and enslave the local population.

[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|link=Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph, 1942|thumb|[[Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph|Einsatzgruppen murdering Jews]] in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942]]
Regions closer to the front were managed by military powers of the region, in other areas such as the Baltic states annexed by the USSR in 1940, Reichscommissariats were established. As a rule, the maximum in loot was extracted. In September 1941, [[Erich Koch]] was appointed to the Ukrainian Commissariat. His opening speech was clear about German policy: "I am known as a brutal dog ... Our job is to suck from Ukraine all the goods we can get hold of ... I am expecting from you the utmost severity towards the native population."

Atrocities against the Jewish population in the conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916093736/http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ |date=16 September 2012 }} on the [[Yad Vashem]] website</ref>

The massacres of Jews and other [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] were only a part of the deaths from the Nazi occupation. Many hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians were executed, and millions more died from [[starvation]] as the Germans requisitioned food for their armies and fodder for their draft horses. As they retreated from Ukraine and Belarus in 1943–44, the German occupiers systematically applied a [[scorched earth]] policy, burning towns and cities, destroying infrastructure, and leaving civilians to starve or die of exposure.<ref>On 7 September 1943, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent orders to [[HSSPF]] "Ukraine" [[Hans-Adolf Prützmann]] that "not a human being, not a single head of cattle, not a hundredweight of cereals and not a railway line remain behind; that not a house remains standing, not a mine is available which is not destroyed for years to come, that there is not a well which is not poisoned. The enemy must really find completely burned and destroyed land". He ordered cooperation with Infantry general Staff, also someone named Stampf, and sent copies to the Chief of Regular Police, Chief of Security Police & SS, [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] Berger, and the chief of the partisan combating units. See ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Supplement A'' pg 1270.</ref> In many towns, the battles were fought within towns and cities with trapped civilians caught in the middle. Estimates of total civilian dead in the Soviet Union in the war range from seven million (''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'') to seventeen million (Richard Overy).

The Nazi ideology and the maltreatment of the local population and Soviet POWs encouraged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] fighting behind the front; it motivated even anti-communists or non-Russian nationalists to ally with the Soviets and greatly delayed the formation of German-allied divisions consisting of Soviet POWs (see [[Vlasov army]]). These results and missed opportunities contributed to the defeat of the ''Wehrmacht''.

Vadim Erlikman has detailed Soviet losses totalling 26.5&nbsp;million war related deaths. Military losses of 10.6&nbsp;million include six million killed or missing in action and 3.6&nbsp;million POW dead, plus 400,000 paramilitary and [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan]] losses. Civilian deaths totalled 15.9&nbsp;million, which included 1.5&nbsp;million from military actions; 7.1&nbsp;million victims of Nazi [[genocide]] and reprisals; 1.8&nbsp;million deported to Germany for [[forced labour]]; and 5.5&nbsp;million [[famine]] and [[disease]] deaths. Additional famine deaths, which totalled one million during 1946–47, are not included here. These losses are for the entire territory of the USSR including territories annexed in 1939–40.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Belarus]] lost a quarter of its pre-war population, including practically all its intellectual elite. Following bloody encirclement battles, all of the present-day Belarus territory was occupied by the Germans by the end of August 1941. The Nazis imposed a brutal regime, deporting some 380,000 young people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands (civilians) more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holocaustcontroversies.yuku.com/topic/1856/The-Nazi-struggle-against-Soviet-partisans|title=The Nazi struggle against Soviet partisans|website=Holocaust Controversies}}</ref> More than 600 villages like [[Khatyn]] were burned with their entire population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/travel1/Khatyn.html|title=Khatyn WWI Memorial in Belarus|website=www.belarusguide.com}}</ref> More than 209 cities and towns (out of 270 total) and 9,000 villages were destroyed. Himmler pronounced a plan according to which {{frac|3|4}} of the Belarusian population was designated for "eradication" and {{frac|1|4}} of the racially 'cleaner' population (blue eyes, light hair) would be allowed to serve Germans as slaves.

Some recent reports raise the number of Belarusians who perished in the war to "3 million 650 thousand people, unlike the former 2.2 million. That is to say not every fourth inhabitant but almost 40% of the pre-war Belarusian population perished (considering the present-day borders of Belarus)."<ref>[http://www.belarusguide.com/history1/WWII_partisan_resistance_in_Belarus.htm Partisan Resistance in Belarus during World War II] belarusguide.com</ref>

Sixty percent of Soviet POWs died during the war. By its end, large numbers of Soviet POWs, forced labourers and Nazi collaborators (including those who were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]) went to special [[NKVD]] "filtration" camps. By 1946, 80 per cent of civilians and 20 per cent of POWs were freed, others were re-drafted, or sent to labour battalions. Two per cent of civilians and 14 per cent of the [[Soviet repressions against former prisoners of war|POWs]] were sent to the [[Gulag]].<ref>("Военно-исторический журнал" ("Military-Historical Magazine"), 1997, №5. page 32)</ref><ref>Земское В.Н.

The official Polish government report of war losses prepared in 1947 reported 6,028,000 victims out of a population of 27,007,000 ethnic Poles and Jews; this report excluded ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian losses.

Although the Soviet Union had not signed the [[Geneva Convention (1929)]], it is generally accepted that it considered itself bound by the provisions of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague convention]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jacob |last=Robinson |title=Transfer of Property in Enemy Occupied Territory |journal=[[American Journal of International Law]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=216–230 |date=April 1945 |jstor=2192342 |doi=10.2307/2192342}}</ref> A month after the German invasion in 1941, an offer was made for a reciprocal adherence to Hague convention. This 'note' was left unanswered by Third Reich officials.<ref>Beevor, ''Stalingrad''. Penguin 2001 {{ISBN|0-14-100131-3}} p 60</ref>

Soviet repressions also contributed into the Eastern Front's death toll. Mass repression occurred in the occupied portions of Poland as well as in the Baltic states and Bessarabia. Immediately after the start of the German invasion, the [[NKVD prisoner massacres|NKVD massacred]] large numbers of inmates in most of their prisons in [[Western Belarus]] and Western Ukraine, while the remainder was to be evacuated in death marches.<ref>Robert Gellately.

==Industrial output==
The Soviet victory owed a great deal to the ability of its war industry to outperform the German economy, despite the enormous loss of population and land. Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] of the 1930s had resulted in the industrialisation of the Urals and central Asia. In 1941, thousands of trains evacuated critical factories and workers from Belarus and Ukraine to safe areas far from the front lines. Once these facilities were reassembled east of the Urals, production could be resumed without fear of German bombing.

As the Soviet Union's manpower reserves ran low from 1943 onwards, the great Soviet offensives had to depend more on equipment and less on the expenditure of lives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The increases in production of [[materiel]] were achieved at the expense of civilian living standards – the most thorough application of the principle of [[total war]] – and with the help of [[Lend-Lease]] supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Germans, on the other hand, could rely on a large slave workforce from the conquered countries and Soviet POWs. American exports and technical expertise also enabled the Soviets to produce goods that they wouldn't have been able to on their own. For example, while the USSR was able to produce fuel of octane numbers from 70 to 74, Soviet industry only met 4% of demand for fuel of octane numbers from 90+; all aircraft produced after 1939 required fuel of the latter category. To fulfill demands, the USSR depended on American assistance, both in finished products and TEL.<ref>Alexander Matveichuk. [http://www.oilru.com/or/47/1006/ A High Octane Weapon of Victory.] Oil of Russia. Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. 2 November 2011.</ref>

Germany had far greater resources than did the USSR, and dwarfed its production in every matrix except for oil, having over five times the USSR's coal production, over three times its iron production, three times its steel production, twice its electricity production, and about 2/3 of its oil production.<ref>Walter Dunn, "The Soviet Economy and the Red Army", Praeger (30 August 1995), page 50. Citing K.F. Skorobogatkin, et al, "50 Let Voorezhennyk sil SSR" (Moscow: Voyenizdat, 1968), p. 457.</ref>

German production of explosives from 1940 to 1944 was 1.595&nbsp;million tons, along with 829,970 tons of powder. Consumption on all fronts during the same period was 1.493&nbsp;million tons of explosives and 626,887 tons of powder.<ref>US Strategic Bombing Survey "Appendix D. Strategic Air Attack on the Powder and Explosives Industries", Table D7: German Monthly Production of Powders and Exploders (Including Extenders) and Consumption by German Armed Forces</ref> From 1941 to 1945, the USSR produced only 505,000 tons of explosives and received 105,000 tons of Lend-Lease imports.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Germany outproduced the Soviet Union 3.16 to 1 in explosives tonnage.

Soviet armoured fighting vehicle production was greater than the Germans (in 1943, the [[Soviet armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Soviet Union manufactured 24,089 tanks and self-propelled guns]] to [[German armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Germany's 19,800]]). The Soviets incrementally upgraded existing designs, and simplified and refined manufacturing processes to increase production, and were helped by a mass infusion of harder to produce goods such as aviation fuel, machine tools, trucks, and high-explosives from Lend-Lease, allowing them to concentrate on a few key industries. Meanwhile, Germany had been cut off from foreign trade for years by the time it invaded the USSR, was in the middle of two extended and costly theatres at air and sea that further limited production ([[Battle of the Atlantic]] and [[Defence of the Reich]]), and was forced to devote a large segment of its expenditures to goods the Soviets could cut back on (such as trucks) or which would never even be used against the Soviets (such as ships). Naval vessels alone constituted 10–15% of Germany's war expenditures from 1940 to 1944 depending on the year, while armoured vehicles by comparison were only 5–8%.<ref>Military Analysis Division, U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey- European War, Volume 3, page 144.

Soviet production and upkeep was assisted by the [[Lend-Lease]] program from the United States and the United Kingdom. In the course of the war the US supplied $11&nbsp;billion of materiel through Lend-Lease. This included 400,000 trucks, 12,000 armoured vehicles (including 7,000 tanks), 11,400 aircraft and 1.75&nbsp;million tons of food.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/PDF/Chapter05.pdf ''World War II The War Against Germany And Italy''], US Army Center of Military History, page 158.</ref> The British supplied aircraft including 3,000 Hurricanes and 4,000 other aircraft during the war. Five thousand tanks were provided by the British and Canada. Total British supplies were about four million tons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/|title=Telegraph|website=The Telegraph}}</ref> Germany on the other hand had the resources of conquered Europe at its disposal; those numbers are however not included into the tables above, such as production in France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, and so on.

After the defeat at Stalingrad, Germany geared completely towards a war economy, as expounded in a speech given by [[Joseph Goebbels]], (the Nazi propaganda minister), in the Berlin [[Sportpalast speech|Sportpalast]], increasing production in subsequent years under [[Albert Speer]]'s (the ''Reich'' armaments minister) direction, despite the intensifying [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombing campaign]].

Included in this figure of German losses is the majority of the 2&nbsp;million German military personnel listed as missing or unaccounted for after the war.

Estimated civilian deaths range from about 14 to 17&nbsp;million. Over 11.4&nbsp;million Soviet civilians within pre-1939 Soviet borders were killed, and another estimated 3.5&nbsp;million civilians were killed in the annexed territories.<ref name="krivosheev">Krivosheev, G.

''Atlas of the Holocaust'' 1988 {{ISBN|0-688-12364-3}}</ref> Soviet and Russian historiography often uses the term "irretrievable casualties". According to the [[Narkomat]] of Defence order (No. 023, 4 February 1944), the irretrievable casualties include killed, missing, those who died due to war-time or subsequent wounds, maladies and [[chilblain]]s and those who were captured.

The huge death toll was attributed to several factors, including brutal mistreatment of POWs and captured partisans, the large deficiency of food and medical supplies in Soviet territories, and atrocities committed mostly by the Germans against the civilian population. The multiple battles and the use of [[scorched earth]] tactics destroyed [[Agriculture|agricultural land]], infrastructure, and whole towns, leaving much of the population homeless and without food.

According to a report prepared by the General Staff of the Army issued in December 1944, materiel losses in the East from the period of 22 June 1941 until November 1944 stood at 33,324 armoured vehicles of all types (tanks, assault guns, tank destroyers, self-propelled guns and others).

[[Polish Armed Forces in the East]], initially consisting of Poles from Eastern Poland or otherwise in the Soviet Union in 1939–1941, began fighting alongside the Red Army in 1943, and grew steadily as more Polish territory was liberated from the Nazis in 1944–1945.

When the Axis countries of Central Europe were occupied by the Soviets, they changed sides and declared war on Germany (see [[Allied Commission]]s).

Some Soviet citizens would side with the Germans and join [[Andrey Vlasov]]'s [[Russian Liberation Army]]. Most of those who joined were Russian POWs. These men were primarily used in the Eastern Front but some were assigned to guard the beaches of [[Normandy]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=D-Day: the Battle for the Normandy Beaches|last=Ambrose|first=Stephen|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1997|isbn=0-7434-4974-6|location=London|pages=34}}</ref> The other main group of men joining the German army were citizens of the Baltic countries annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 or from Western Ukraine. They fought in their own Waffen-SS units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/nazi-foreign-legions/|title=Nazi Foreign Legions – History Learning Site|work=History Learning Site|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Hitler's notorious [[Commissar Order]] called for Soviet political commissars, who were responsible for ensuring that Red Army units remained politically reliable, to be summarily shot when identified amongst captured troops. Axis troops who captured Red Army soldiers frequently shot them in the field or shipped them to concentration camps to be used as forced labourers or killed.<ref>[[Richard Overy]] The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia (2004), {{ISBN|0-7139-9309-X}}</ref> Additionally, millions of Soviet civilians were captured as POWs and treated in the same manner. It is estimated that between 2.25 and 3.3&nbsp;million Soviet POWs died in Nazi custody, out of 5.25–5.7&nbsp;million. This figure represents a total of 45–57% of all Soviet POWs and may be contrasted with 8,300 out of 231,000 British and U.S. prisoners, or 3.6%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2stats.com/pow_ger_dead_non.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 July 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422053808/http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec45.html|archive-date=22 April 2013  }}</ref><ref name="auto"/> About 5% of the Soviet prisoners who died were of Jewish ethnicity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
