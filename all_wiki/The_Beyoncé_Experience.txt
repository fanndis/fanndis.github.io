'''The Beyoncé Experience''' was the third [[concert tour]] by American singer [[Beyoncé Knowles]]. It was staged in support of her second studio album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' (2006). The Beyoncé Experience consisted of 96 shows in 2007 over five legs, with concerts in all continents, save [[South America]]. Fan-club tickets and VIP packages were on sale in early April and tickets sold officially on April 20, 2007. The tour began that month and finished that November. Knowles collaborated with [[Feeding America|America's Second Harvest]] on a campaign for people who fought with [[famine]], holding pre-concert food drives at every stop during the tour asking from fans to bring food.

Rehearsals for the tour began in March 2007 and the performances featured music performed by an all-female band called Suga Mama chosen by Beyoncé Knowles and her father [[Mathew Knowles]] during auditions held before the release of ''B'Day''. The [[set list]] of the concerts included songs from ''B'Day'', ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'', ten shortened versions of [[Destiny's Child]]'s songs as well as "[[Listen (Beyoncé song)|Listen]]", originally recorded by Knowles for the [[Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture|soundtrack]] of ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' (2006). Ten instrumentalists, three harmony vocalists and ten dancers backed Knowles onstage which also had [[disco ball]]s hanging from the ceilings and color-changing stairs. For the wardrobe of the tour, Knowles collaborated with several designers; it consisted of silvery and sparkly dresses which received praise from critics.

The tour received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]] who praised Knowles' vocal abilities, dancing, choreography and energy on stage during the shows performed simultaneously. The performances of the slow-tempo songs and Destiny's Child's material during the concerts were highlighted by critics. Twenty-nine shows were submitted to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s boxscore grossing $24.9 million, with 272,521 fans attending the performances. Throughout the tour several incidents happened; the [[pyrotechnics]] meant for the stage injured two people in the audience, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs during a performance of "[[Ring the Alarm]]" and had a wardrobe malfunction. A show in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia on November 1, 2007 was relocated to [[Jakarta]], Indonesia due to Malaysia's strict rules surrounding the clothing worn by female performers. The performance at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles was recorded on September 2, 2007 and was released on November 16, 2007 as a live [[DVD]] titled ''[[The Beyoncé Experience Live]]''.

Early before the release of ''B'Day'' in 2006, Knowles held a nationwide audition for female musicians which ended in [[Sony Music Studios]] where she and her father and collaborator [[Mathew Knowles]] were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of "Work It Out" from the live album ''[[Live at Wembley (Beyoncé album)|Live at Wembley]]'' (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533901/beyonce-seeks-all-girl-band.jhtml|title=For The Record: Quick News On Beyonce, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Taylor Hicks, JC Chasez, Beth Orton, Slayer & More|publisher=MTV News.

I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'"<ref name="battle" /> She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [choosing the winners]. [There are] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [people playing] certain instruments, because [some of the contenders] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical."<ref name="battle">{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Beyonce Asks Women To Battle Over Her For Backing-Band Roles |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1534575/beyonce-wants-women-battle-over-her.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]].

Rehearsals for the tour began in March 2007. The [[set list]] of the shows included songs from the standard and deluxe edition of ''B'Day'' as well as songs from ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003).

Sixteen of the wireless channels were devoted to personal monitor systems: 11 in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] and five in [[Monaural|mono]]. Knowles and the rest of the band members had a Sennheiser EK 300 IEM G2 monitoring receiver.<ref name="mixonline" /> Eleven of the channels provided wireless instrument support for guitar, bass and horns, using Sennheiser SK 500 G2 bodypack transmitters. The remaining channels covered Knowles' vocal microphone and those of her backup singers and guest vocalists.<ref name="mixonline" /> Sennheiser EM 3032-U and EM 550 G2 true-diversity receivers with Sennheiser A 5000-CP antennas and AC 3000 [[Diplexer|combiners]] rounded out the system.

[it] is beautifully smooth and captures every nuance of a talented vocalist's performance".<ref name="mixonline" /> He specified Sennheiser SKM 935 G2 microphones for the backup and guest vocalists because they sounded "excellent even under less-than-ideal conditions".<ref name="mixonline">{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mixline_live/sennheiser-beyonce-tour-090507/|title=Sennheiser Supports Beyonce|work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]|date=August 30, 2007|access-date=July 8, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228085855/http://mixonline.com/mixline_live/sennheiser-beyonce-tour-090507/|archive-date=December 28, 2013}}</ref>

Beyoncé's mother and designer [[Tina Knowles]], [[House of Deréon]], [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Gianni Versace S.p.A.|Versace]], [[Elie Saab]] and Herve Leger served as the designers for the outfits of the tour.<ref name="book" /> Jon Pareles of ''The New York Times'' described the clothes as mainly silvery, ranging from miniskirts to formal dresses, flesh-toned bodysuit to bikini to [[negligee]].<ref name="nytimes" /> Pareles further noted that "The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion".<ref name="nytimes" /> J.

{{Quote box|width=20em|align=left|quote="As notable as the supporting cast was, it rarely drew attention away from the star. The show is called 'The Beyonce Experience,' and it lived up to its name, with Beyonce leaving no doubt of her all-around talent.

The writer also added that she had "an honest, God-given talent she's not afraid to share. Her songs, ranging from sultry to soulful were performed with all her heart...

But she was in constant motion".<ref name="nytimes" /> Lee Hildebrand of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' gave a very positive review for the concert and noted that Knowles performed "two fast-paced hours of terrific singing, solid musicianship, spectacular staging and some of the most imaginative choreography ever to have graced the stage of Oracle Arena."<ref name="sfgate" /> Hildebrand further noted that Knowles used "occasional bits of rasp to her ringing mezzo tones to emphasize key lines" while performing the ballads. He wrote that every "twitch, turn, slide and hip shake was in perfect sync" and praised the singer's constant motion most of the time which never left her "out of breath".<ref name="sfgate" /> While reviewing Knowles' concert in Bangkok, Thailand, Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of ''The Nation'' praised her dancing which included "shaking, bouncing and belly dancing, mixed with hip-hop" further comparing it with Shakira's.<ref name="big" /> She further noted that the highlight of the show was when Knowles sang the slow-tempo ballads.<ref name="big" /> ''The Courier Mail''{{'}}s Tonya Turner praised Knowles' "passionate and fiery" performance accompanied by "frantic booty popping and sexy R&B moves".<ref name="courier" /> Writing for the ''Los Angeles Times'', Ann Powers noted that the tour was one of the "modern superstar spectacles that casts the artist's reality onto the level of myth". However, she noted, that "Beyoncé's 'Experience' plays off the performer's well-known struggles and triumphs to build a story that will make fans both gawk and relate. The maddening thing about this dazzling entertainment, though, is that the tale it tells is partly the wrong one."<ref name="powers" /> She concluded the review by saying, "Beyoncé is electric in concert yet reined in by her show's [[postfeminism|post-feminist]] theme. Why not just let it be about her musical prowess?".<ref name="powers" /> Jim Farber of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' praised Knowles' energy and powerful performance on stage, writing "With her triumphant gait, statuesque figure and steely stare, the singer seemed primed not just to perform but to vanquish... Beyoncé sang with a fiery determination, stressing cries and shouts that had no use for subtlety and even less for vulnerability. She danced at an equally mad clip... hitting every mark with a vengeance... A Beyoncé show... has everything to do with power and nothing to do with nuance. It's the kind of thing meant to inspire awe, not intimacy... She sang her songs last night with the force of a rapper, stressing pieces from her two solo albums in a way that made every sound seem percussive."<ref name="farber" /> However, Farber criticized the unsure repertoire of songs performed, writing "Many of her tunes prove too skittish to sink in, and some of her rhythms are too robotic to find a groove."<ref name="farber">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/beyonc-eacute-besieges-garden-article-1.238125|title=Beyoncé besieges Garden|work=[[New York Daily News]]|first=Jim|last=Farber|date=August 7, 2007|access-date=July 10, 2013}}</ref> Scheck of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the snippets of other artists that Knowles included in her own songs were refreshing and included the fast-paced Destiny's Child medley and the performances of "Get Me Bodied" and "Listen" as highlights of the show. He further noted, 
<blockquote>
"It's not for nothing that they call this show 'The Beyonce Experience.' Like the summer blockbuster movies crowding theater screens, this tour by the pop/R&B icon resembles not so much a concert as a series of thrillingly staged set pieces. It's safe to say that her fans will not be disappointed by the two-hour extravaganza. From the diva-style opening, when she rises from beneath the stage amidst a blinding sparkler display, to the final audience sing-along on the female-empowering hit 'Irreplaceable,' the star delivers a crowd-pleasing spectacle that offers as much visual as musical stimulation."<ref name="Reuters" />
