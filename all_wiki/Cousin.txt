Commonly "'''cousin'''" refers to a "'''first cousin'''", a [[Kinship|relative]] whose [[most recent common ancestor]] with the subject is a grandparent.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title =Cousin |encyclopedia =Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase & Fable |year =2013 |publisher =Chambers Harrap Publishers |id =19 }}</ref> More generally, in the [[lineal kinship]] system used in the English-speaking world, a ''cousin'' is a type of [[Kinship|familial]] relationship in which two relatives are two or more [[familial generation]]s away from their most recent common ancestor.

"'''Degrees'''" and "'''removals'''" are used to more precisely describe the relationship between cousins. ''Degree'' measures the separation, in generations, from the most recent common ancestor to one of the cousins (whichever is closest), while ''removal'' measures the difference in generations between the cousins themselves. To illustrate usage, a "second cousin" is a cousin with a ''degree'' of two. When the degree is not specified first cousin is assumed. A cousin that is "once removed" is a cousin with one ''removal''. When the removal is not specified no removal is assumed.<ref name=DictGen>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia =A Dictionary of Genetics |year =2013 |publisher =Oxford University Press |id =8 |last1=King |first1=Robert C. |last2=Stansfield |first2=William D.}}</ref><ref name=DictWebster>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cousin |title=Definition of Cousin by Merriam-Webster |website=merriam-webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>

Various governmental entities have established systems for legal use that can precisely specify kinship with common ancestors any number of generations in the past; for example, in medicine and law, a first cousin is a type of [[third-degree relative]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

People are related with a type of cousin relationship if they share a common ancestor, and are separated from their most recent common ancestor by two or more generations. This means neither person is an [[Lineal descendant|ancestor]] of the other, they do not share a parent (are not [[sibling]]s), and neither is a sibling of the other's parent (are not the other's [[aunt]]/[[uncle]] nor [[Nephew and niece|niece/nephew]]).<ref name="DictWebster" /> In the English system the cousin relationship is further detailed by the concepts of ''degree'' and ''removal''.

The ''degree'' is the number of generations subsequent to the common ancestor before a parent of one of the cousins is found. This means the degree is the separation of the cousin from the common ancestor less one. Also, if the cousins are not separated from the common ancestor by the same number of generations, the cousin with the smallest separation is used to determine the degree.<ref name=DictGen /> The ''removal'' is the difference between the number of generations from each cousin to the common ancestor.<ref name=DictGen /> Two people can be removed but be around the same age due to differences in birth dates of parents, children, and other relevant ancestors.<ref name=DictGen /><ref>{{Cite web|title=What is a First Cousin, Twice Removed?|url=http://www.genealogy.com/articles/research/16_cousn.html|publisher=Genealogy.com|accessdate=Sep 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=GG>{{cite web|url=http://www.genetic-genealogy.co.uk/Toc115570138.html#Single_Cousins|title=Genetic And Quantitative Aspects Of Genealogy – Types Of Collateral Relationships|publisher=Genetic-genealogy.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>

===Gender-based distinctions===

{{Main|Parallel and cross cousins}}

A maternal cousin is a cousin that is related to the mother's side of the family, while a paternal cousin is a cousin that is related to the father's side of the family. This relationship is not necessarily reciprocal, as the maternal cousin of one person could be the paternal cousin of the other. In the example [[#Basic family tree|Basic family tree]] Emma is David's maternal cousin and David is Emma's paternal cousin.

[[Parallel and cross cousins]] on the other hand are reciprocal relationships. Parallel cousins are descended from same-sex siblings. Cousins that are related to same-sex siblings of their most recent common ancestor are parallel cousins.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview cross-cousin |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095649876 |website=Oxford reference |accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref> A parallel first cousin relationship exists when both the subject and relative are maternal cousins, or both are paternal cousins.

Cross cousins are descendants from opposite-sex siblings. A cross first cousin relationship exists when the subject and the relative are maternal cousin and paternal cousin to each other. In the example [[#Basic family tree|Basic family tree]] David and Emma are cross cousins.

Double cousins are relatives that are cousins from two different branches of the family tree. This occurs when [[sibling]]s, respectively, reproduce with different siblings from another family.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/double-cousins-share-one-quarter-their-dna |author=Dr. Barry Starr |title=Relatedness |website=Stanford at The Tech: Understanding Genetics |date=2015-01-13}}</ref> This may also be referred to as "cousins on both sides". The resulting children are related to each other through both their [[parent]]s and are thus doubly related. Double first cousins share both sets of [[grandparent]]s.

|}
Step-cousins are either stepchildren of an individual's aunt or uncle, nieces and nephews of one's step-parent, or the children of one's parent's step-sibling.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/step-cousin-f79762f39431ac31 |title=What Is a Step Cousin? |website=www.reference.com}}</ref> A cousin-in-law is the cousin of a person's spouse or the spouse of a person's cousin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cousin-in-law |title=cousin-in-law |website=Webster's Dictionary}}</ref> In the [[#Basic family tree|Basic family tree]] example David and Edward are cousins-in-law. None of these relationships have consanguinity.

==Consanguinity==

{{Main|Consanguinity}}

Consanguinity is a measure of how closely individuals are related to each other. It is measured by the [[coefficient of relationship]]. Below, when discussing the coefficient of relationship, we assume the subject and the relative are related only through the kinship term. A coefficient of one represents the relationship you have with yourself. Consanguinity decreases by half for every generation of separation from the [[most recent common ancestor]], as there are two parents for each child. When there is more than one common ancestor the consanguinity between each ancestor is added together to get the final result.<ref name="GQAG_COR">{{cite web|url=http://www.genetic-genealogy.co.uk/Toc115570135.html#Single_Cousins|title=Genetic And Quantitative Aspects Of Genealogy – CALCULATION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF RELATIONSHIP|publisher=Genetic-genealogy.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>

Between first cousins there are two shared ancestors each with four generations of separation, up and down the family tree: (<math>\left ( \tfrac{1}{2} \right )^4 + \left ( \tfrac{1}{2} \right )^4</math>), their consanguinity is one-eighth. For each additional removal of the cousin relationship, consanguinity is reduced by half, as the generations of separation increase by one. For each additional degree of the cousin relationship, consanguinity is reduced by a quarter as the generations of separation increase by one on both sides.<ref name="GQAG_COR" />

Half cousins have half the [[consanguinity]] of ordinary cousins as they have half the common ancestors (i.e. one vs two). Double cousins have twice the [[consanguinity]] of ordinary cousins as they have twice the number of common ancestors (i.e. four vs two). Double first cousins share the same consanguinity as half-siblings. Likewise double half cousins share the same consanguinity as cousins as they both have two common ancestors. If there are half siblings on one side and full siblings on the other they would have three-halves the consanguinity of ordinary first cousins.<ref name="GQAG_COR" />

In a scenario where two monozygotic (identical) twins mate with another pair of monozygotic twins, the resulting double cousins would test as genetically similar as siblings.

===Reproduction===

Offspring of first cousin couples and of second cousin couples die younger and reproduce less.<ref>[https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080207/full/news.2008.562.html Nature: When kissing cousins are good for kids - A little inbreeding might boost fertility.] By Heidi Ledford. Date: Published online 7 February 2008.</ref> Couples that are closely related have an increased chance of sharing genes, including mutations that occurred in their family tree. If the mutation is a [[recessive trait]] it will not reveal itself unless both father and mother share it.<ref>[http://theconversation.com/whats-the-genetic-disease-risk-for-children-of-related-couples-7599 The Conversation: What’s the genetic disease risk for children of related couples?] Date: September 27, 2012.

===Cousin marriage===

Cousin marriage is important in several anthropological theories, which often differentiate between matriarchal and patriarchal parallel and cross cousins.

Currently about 10% and historically as high as 80% of all marriages are between first or second cousins.<ref name="kershaw">{{cite news |first = Sarah |last = Kershaw |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/garden/26cousins.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 |title = Shaking Off the Shame |date = 26 November 2009 | work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="kissyourcousin"/> Cousin marriages are often [[arranged marriage|arranged]].<ref name="kershaw" /><ref name="kissyourcousin">{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss|title=Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin - DiscoverMagazine.com}}</ref><ref name=bittles1>{{cite techreport
