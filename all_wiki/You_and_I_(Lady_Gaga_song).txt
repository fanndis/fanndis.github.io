"'''You and I'''"  (stylized as "'''Yoü and I'''") is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Lady Gaga]], taken from her second [[studio album]], ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011). She also co-produced it with [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]]. The track samples [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[We Will Rock You]]" (1977) and features [[electric guitar]] by Queen's [[Brian May]]. Gaga debuted "You and I" in June 2010 during her performance at [[Elton John]]'s White Tie and Tiara Ball. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet, and positive response encouraged her to include the song on her [[setlist]] for [[The Monster Ball Tour]]. She later performed the song on ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]''  to a record crowd in July 2010, and on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in May 2011. On August 23, 2011, [[Interscope Records]] released the song as the fourth single from the album.

"You and I" is a [[tempo|downtempo]] song featuring instrumentation from [[electric guitars]] and piano, with Gaga and Lange providing background vocals. The song received critical acclaim, with reviewers listing it as one of the highlights from ''Born This Way''. After the release of the parent album, "You and I" charted in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, due to digital downloads from the parent album. After being released as a single, "You and I" reached the top ten in the US, Japan, and seven additional countries. The song was also [[Music recording certification|certified]] Triple Platinum in the US for selling three million units. [[American Idol (season 10)|Season ten]] ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Haley Reinhart]] performed "You and I" in May 2011 before its release, earning positive reviews. Her studio recording was released to the [[iTunes Store]] as a single, and appeared on the [[compilation album]], ''American Idol Top 5 Season 10''. "You and I" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]], which was held on February 12, 2012.<ref name="54th Annual Grammy Awards">{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees?year=2011&genre=All |title=54th Annual Grammy Awards |publisher=[[Grammy.com]].

The accompanying music video for "You and I" was also met with a positive response. It was shot by Gaga's long-time collaborator [[Laurieann Gibson]] in Springfield, Nebraska, and it was released on August 16, 2011. It features Yüyi, Gaga's  [[mermaid]] alter ego, and Jo Calderone, Gaga's male alter ego, who also appears on the single's cover. Gaga later performed the song dressed as Jo Calderone at the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song has subsequently been performed on the singer's concert tours and residencies.

According to the sheet music published by [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], "You and I" is set in [[common time]] with a slow [[tempo]] of 60 [[beats per minute]]. It is written in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[A major]]. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E<sub>3</sub> to C{{music|sharp}}<sub>5</sub>. The song begins with an A–G–A [[chord progression]], which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–B{{music|sharp}}m during the chorus, and back to the former chords afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0095415|last=Germanotta|first=Stefani|year=2011|title=Digital Sheet Music – Lady Gaga – Yoü and I |publisher=Musicnotes.com ([[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]])}}</ref> The opening lyrics—"It's been a long time since I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of [[MTV News]] described it as the "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." Her voice sounded like growling during the main [[verse (popular music)|verses]], where she sings the lines: "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..."<ref name="you&"/> Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from "We Will Rock You", thundering [[electric guitars]] and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls."<ref name=Telegraph/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-05-23/ae/29574942_1_gaga-pop-star-album/2|title=Gaga's 'Born This Way' is a long-awaited letdown|first=James|last=Reed|page=2|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=May 23, 2011|access-date=June 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173900/http://articles.boston.com/2011-05-23/ae/29574942_1_gaga-pop-star-album/2|archive-date=March 3, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Kitty Empire]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the song as an "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" with two [[Bruce Springsteen]] references: "born to run" and Nebraska.<ref name=Empire>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/23/lady-gaga-born-this-way-review|title=Lady Gaga: Born This Way – review|first=Kitty|last=Empire|date=May 22, 2011|access-date=June 7, 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224160626/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/23/lady-gaga-born-this-way-review|archive-date=December 24, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

"No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you and someone else. So that's what it's about, perceiving in your imagination that there's something magical inside of you that you can make it work," she said.<ref name="expl"/> After revealing that the wedding dress shown in the video belonged to her mother, Gaga explained the scenes involving the [[Ice cream van|ice cream truck]].

<blockquote>
That's how I wanted to open the video, because I think it really sets up the rest of the story. It allows you to imagine you yourself are not just one person; you're so many.

I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange.

===Synopsis===
[[File:GagaYuyi.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Lady Gaga as Yüyi the Mermaid in the music video]]

The music video begins with Gaga, dressed in black clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and seemingly bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a [[doll]] in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a [[water tank]] appear in quick succession.

The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a [[piano]] in the middle of a [[cornfield]], while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.

During the second verse, a mad scientist, portrayed by Kinney, seemingly tortures Gaga, who is wearing a yellow dress with glasses made of barbwire, as another version of the singer, with teal-colored hair, performs a dance routine with her [[backup dancer]]s in a barn. As the chorus begins for the second time, Gaga appears as Yüyi the Mermaid, with gills on her face and neck, as she lies in a tub filled with dirty water. At the end of the chorus, the camera zooms to a brunette Gaga inside a water tank while she sings "You and I" in the desert scene, and in the cornfield with Calderone. Interspersing scenes again show Gaga having her wedding, Yüyi in her tub, and Gaga seated on a chair with a [[conveyor belt]]. During May's guitar solo, Gaga dances in the cornfield with other dancers dressed in the same white dress, as Yüyi and the scientist kiss. While singing the chorus for the final time, Gaga kisses Calderone in one sequence and runs across the field in another. As the video reaches its conclusion, the tortured Gaga is being slid down as the conveyor belt turns on. The video ends with Yüyi and the scientist together in the bath tub, as a depiction of their dream wedding flashes across, before a last shot of the barn as the screen turns black.

===Reception===
Following its premature release on the Web, the music video for "You and I" met with positive reviews. Matthew Perpetua of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt the video was an improvement over her earlier videos, ''[[Judas (Lady Gaga song)|Judas]]'' and ''The Edge of Glory'', saying, "the best moments of the video put a distinctly Gaga-ish spin on the iconography of Americana and traditional love stories."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-youe-and-i-20110816|first=Matthew|last=Perpetua|title=Lady Gaga" 'Yoü and I'|work=Rolling Stone|date=August 16, 2011|access-date=August 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919031009/http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-youe-and-i-20110816|archive-date=September 19, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Jillian Mapes of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote the video has: "torture contraptions, mermaid sex, a wedding, bondage in a barn, an ice cream truck, and to top it all off, 'Children of the Corn' and religious overtones thrown in for good measure," and thought  the video setting was the strangest representation of Nebraska.<ref name="BillboardLeak" /> Leah Collins of ''[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]'' felt the video was a "great opportunity for the singer to finally find out what it's like to make out with herself."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dose.ca/Lady+Gaga+prematurely+leaks+video+with+video/5263142/story.html|title=Lady Gaga prematurely leaks her new You and I video (with video)|first=Leah|last=Collins|agency=[[Postmedia News]]|work=[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]|date=August 16, 2011|access-date=August 17, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/611zh4gj2?url=http://www.dose.ca/Lady+Gaga+prematurely+leaks+video+with+video/5263142/story.html|archive-date=August 18, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kyle Anderson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted of the scene in which Gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego: "She's just Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, playing a piano in the middle of a corn field—with a little making out on the side, of course."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/08/16/lady-gaga-you-and-i-video/|first=Kyle|last=Anderson|title=Lady Gaga's 'You and I' video, featuring hot Calderone-on-Germanotta action: Watch it here!|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=August 16, 2011|access-date=August 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204120008/http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/08/16/lady-gaga-you-and-i-video/|archive-date=February 4, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Gil Kaufman of MTV News believed that Gaga was not joking when she talked about the video being about the "torture" of being away from the one you love. "And, man, based on the bruising final product, she wasn't kidding," Kaufman concluded.<ref name="nebraska">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669174/lady-gaga-you-and-i-video.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's 'Yoü And I' Video: The Many Faces Of Gaga|date=August 4, 2011|access-date=August 8, 2011|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Kaufman|last=Gil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106205307/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669174/lady-gaga-you-and-i-video.jhtml|archive-date=November 6, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jocelyn Vena of MTV found influences of Gaga's past videos in the various avatars she plays ''You and I''. She explained that:<blockquote> when [Gaga] stands at a crossroads in a big hat, the image is reminiscent of '[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]' Gaga. When she sits nearly makeup-free at her piano in the cornfields, there are touches of the teary-eyed makeup-less Gaga from the '[[Bad Romance]]' video. Flashes of her wedding may remind fans of the wedding dress she wore in the 'Judas' clip. Robot Gaga's facial structures recall some of the steampunk looks of her '[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]' video. Those are only a few of the nods to past personae from her own videography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669240/lady-gaga-you-and-i-yuyi-jo-calderone.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's 'You And I' Personas: Who Are Yuyi And Jo Calderone?|date=August 4, 2011|access-date=August 8, 2011|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Vena|last=Jocelyn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128003147/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669240/lady-gaga-you-and-i-yuyi-jo-calderone.jhtml|archive-date=November 28, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote> Devin Brown of [[CBS News]] felt that Gaga had finally returned to form with the video. "After some visually pleasing but generally lackluster videos, she has finally come out with something to write home about. 'You and I' is arguably the best song on her sophomore release, ''Born This Way'', and now has a video to match."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504943_162-20093603-10391715.html|last=Brown|first=Devin|date=August 18, 2011|access-date=August 18, 2011|title=What Lady Gaga's new music video "You and I" is really about|publisher=[[CBS News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818040716/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504943_162-20093603-10391715.html|archive-date=August 18, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Slant Magazine]] writer commented that the publication had a mixed reaction to the video, saying that it "is essentially a collection of disconnected images we couldn't make heads or tails of."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/08/10-ridiculous-screen-grabs-from-lady-gagas-you-and-i-video/|date=August 17, 2011|access-date=August 21, 2011|title=10 Ridiculous Screen Grabs from Lady Gaga's "You and I" Video|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015223500/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/08/10-ridiculous-screen-grabs-from-lady-gagas-you-and-i-video/|archive-date=October 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 1, 2011, Gaga announced on her [[Twitter]] account that she had shot five "fashion films" related to the song's music video with Dutch photographers [[Inez and Vinoodh|Inez van Lamsweerde]] and [[Inez and Vinoodh|Vinoodh Matadin]]. The characters for each of the videos are: Jo Calderone (Gaga's alter ego), Yuyi (a mermaid), Nymph, Bride, and finally Barn Hooker and Mother.<ref name="ff">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1670179/lady-gaga-you-and-i-fashion-film.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Releases First 'Fashion Film' Version of 'You and I'|date=September 2, 2011|access-date=September 5, 2011|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Kaufman|last=Gil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926113957/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1670179/lady-gaga-you-and-i-fashion-film.jhtml|archive-date=September 26, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> After the tweet, Gaga released the first video, titled "Haus of Ü featuring Nymph".

As wind blows around her, the singer looks intently toward the camera, with the parting shot in color.<ref name="ff"/> The second video featured her as the bride from the opening sequence of the music video. The fashion film portrayed her in the same costume, gradually removing it and her wig. At the end, she is topless with her hand covering her breasts. Interspersed between are scenes portraying people dressed like Gaga, and appearances by Taylor Kinney, who was in the music video, and the singer's stylist [[Nicola Formichetti]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1670702/lady-gaga-you-and-i-fashion-film.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Goes Topless In Latest 'You And I' Fashion Film|date=September 14, 2011|access-date=September 18, 2011|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Kaufman|last=Gil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923175813/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1670702/lady-gaga-you-and-i-fashion-film.jhtml|archive-date=September 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The third fashion film portrayed the singer as the mermaid Yüyi.
