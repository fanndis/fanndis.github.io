The '''City of Sunderland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|n|d|ɚ|l|ə|n|d}}) is a [[local government district]] of [[Tyne and Wear]], in [[North East England]], with the status of a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[metropolitan borough]]. It is named after its largest settlement, [[Sunderland]], but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of [[Hetton-le-Hole]], [[Houghton-le-Spring]], and [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], as well as a range of suburban villages.

The district was formed in 1974, titled the ''Metropolitan Borough of Sunderland'', as part of the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1972]] and is an [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of four former local government districts of [[County Durham]]. It was granted city status in 1992, the 40th anniversary of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s accession to the throne. The borough had a population of 275,400 at the time of the 2011 census, with the majority of the population (174,286) residing in Sunderland.<ref name="BUA">{{cite web| url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx| title=2011 Census - Built-up areas| publisher=[[Office for National Statistics|ONS]]| accessdate=6 August 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921045319/http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx| archive-date=21 September 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
The metropolitan borough was formed in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] by the merger of several districts of [[County Durham]] - [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington Urban District]], [[Houghton-le-Spring|Houghton-le-Spring Urban District]] and [[Hetton-le-Hole|Hetton Urban District]] - with the [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|County Borough of Sunderland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/City_of_Sunderland/id/1978288 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404175832/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/City_of_Sunderland/id/1978288 |archive-date=4 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Washington Tyne and Wear: Encyclopedia - Washington Tyne and Wear</ref>

The metropolitan borough was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1992, the 40th anniversary of the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen's]] accession. At the Queen's Golden Jubilee the city petitioned to be allowed a [[Lord Mayor]], but was unsuccessful. Although the city does not have a [[Cathedral]], as it is located in the [[Diocese of Durham]], it does have [[Sunderland Minster]].

Between 1939 and 1945 the Wear yards launched 245 merchant ships totalling 1.5 million tons, a quarter of the merchant tonnage produced in the UK at this period. Competition from overseas caused a downturn in demand for Sunderland built ships toward the end of the 20th century. The last shipyard in Sunderland closed in 1988.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-tyne-46472740/last-sunderland-shipyard-closure-announced-30-years-ago</ref>

[[Benedict Biscop|St Benedict Biscop]] was adopted as the City's [[Patron saint|Patron Saint]] in March 2004.

==City government==

===Boundary review 2004===
Like all metropolitan authorities, the city is divided into a number of wards or ''electoral districts''. Each has three councillors elected for a four-year term. One third of councillors face re-election each year, and no city elections are held in the fourth year of the election cycle - this was when each ward's sole metropolitan county councillor was elected, prior to the county council's abolition in 1986.

The City has 25 such wards. When the boundaries of these wards were set in 1982, each ward had a roughly equal population. By 2004 there had been a considerable shift in population. In particular, the east and south east – the old parish of Sunderland and the mining village of Ryhope – had lost population to the "New Town" of [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]]. As a result, the boundaries were redrawn; Sunderland lost one ward and Washington gained one. The [[2004 Sunderland Council election|2004 election]] for all 75 councillors was held on 10 June 2004.

===Functions===
The [[Local Government Act 1972]] created two different two-tier systems for local administration, with different division of functions. As a ''metropolitan'' authority, Sunderland retained responsibility for waste collection, although disposal of the waste was a county function, and for education. In 1986, when [[Tyne and Wear]] Metropolitan County Council was abolished, most county functions became the responsibility of the constituent districts, whilst new ''[[Local government in the United Kingdom#Joint-boards|joint boards]]'' assumed the co-ordinating roles in the county. Thus control over economic development, of the Museums and Archive Service, of the Tyne and Wear Fire and Civil Defence Authority and of the Passenger Transport Authority is exercised not by committees of directly elected county councillors but by nominees chosen by the elected members of the five district authorities. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Sunderland has not had a separate police force since 1967, when the Borough of Sunderland Police merged with Durham Constabulary. The City is now part of the [[Northumbria Police]] Force area. This force was set up in 1974, and covers the whole of Tyne and Wear plus the much larger but much less densely populated county of [[Northumberland]].

The city is unparished, except for [[Hetton-le-Hole]] which is a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]], and which has a [[town council]].

===Political structure===
{{see also|Sunderland local elections}}
The City has had a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] controlled council since 1974, and often before that. After the [[2004 Sunderland Council election|elections of May 2003]] the political structure was 63 Labour, 9 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], and 1 [[Independent (politician)|independent]]. The only [[Liberal Party (modern)|Liberal Party]] councillor sat with the only [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] as a "Liberal/Democrat" group. Three Councillors resigned from the Labour Party following disputes over the selection of candidates for the 2004 elections. Two became independent members; one joined the Liberal Democrat party, becoming group leader after the 2004 municipal elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=590|title=Sunderland's political management structure-Sunderland City Council|publisher=Sunderland City Council|access-date=24 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927170501/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=590|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

The reorganisation of electoral areas saw major changes in all but two wards, but the elections of 10 June 2004, the first fought under the new boundaries, saw little change in the political representation of the City as a whole, with 61 Labour, 12 Conservative, and 2 Liberal Democrat councillors elected.

The Conservative party won all three seats in a new ward whose boundaries spanned several old wards. The Liberal Democrats stronghold ward was abolished entirely, and became part of four new wards, and the Liberal Democrat councillors elected in 2004 were from two very different areas.

Following further disputes within the Labour Party, three councillors resigned the whip at the end of 2006 and, joined by one of the Liberal Democrat members formed an independent group, which is the minority party in opposition.

At the [[2007 Sunderland Council election|elections of May 2007]], the Labour Party continued their decline. Labour lost three seats to the Conservatives, whilst former Labour Mayor Mrs Julianna Heron lost to an independent: the same person who had defeated her husband in 2003 and who was in turn defeated by him in 2004. The Conservative party made further significant gains in the [[2008 Sunderland Council election|2008 election]], gaining five additional seats and strengthening their support in others.

The [[2010 Sunderland Council election|election in 2010]], held at the same time as the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|general election]] saw Labour gain four seats to increase their majority.<ref name=change>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/council/html/3768.stm | title = Sunderland | accessdate = 3 January 2011 | work = [[BBC News Online]] | date=19 April 2009}}</ref> In the [[2011 Sunderland Council election|2011 local elections]] Labour gained a further four seats from the Conservatives.<ref name="hold">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/council/html/cm.stm|title=England council elections|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=30 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719152743/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/council/html/cm.stm|archive-date=19 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> After the 2015 General election the composition of the council was Labour 66, Conservative 6 and independent 3.<ref name=hold/>

===Parliamentary constituencies===
Since major boundary changes in 2010, there are three constituencies covering the City of Sunderland, all currently regarded as safe for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]:

*[[Houghton and Sunderland South]]
*[[Sunderland Central]]
*[[Washington and Sunderland West]]

In the 1992, 1997, 2001 and 2005 General Elections, the former Sunderland South constituency was the first to declare the results, and the tradition was continued by the new Houghton and Sunderland South seat in 2010 and 2015.

==Twin towns==
Sunderland is [[town twinning|twinned]] with: [[Essen, Germany]] and [[Saint-Nazaire]], France.<ref name="twin towns">[http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1124&formid=11838 Town Twinning] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527134042/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1124&formid=11838 |date=27 May 2013 }}, Town Twinning - Sunderland City council</ref> It also has Friendship Agreements with [[Washington, DC]], USA; and [[Harbin]] and [[Nanjing]], both in the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref name="twin towns" />

Sunderland and Washington share historical links, as the ancestors of the first [[Presidents of the USA|President]] of the United States of America, [[George Washington]], lived in [[Washington Old Hall]], which is within the [[Municipality|municipal]] boundaries of Sunderland.

==Dialect==
{{Main|Mackem}}
The Mackem accent and dialect is often mistaken for [[Geordie]] by people not from the region, as the two tongues sound very similar in pronunciation and diction.
The dialect also has several variations between different areas of the City, as demonstrated when the hoax tapes purporting to be of the Yorkshire Ripper were analysed. The tapes were made by a man who came to be known as [[Wearside Jack]], and were thought by linguistic experts to be made by someone specifically from the Castletown area of Sunderland. When the perpetrator, [[Wearside Jack|John Humble]] was eventually caught he confirmed that he did indeed attend school in the Castletown area of Sunderland in his childhood.

===Music===
{{Main|Bands and musicians from Yorkshire and North East England}}
Sunderland has produced a modest number of musicians that have gone on to reach international fame, most notably [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] of the [[Eurythmics]]. [[Kenickie]], which featured [[Lauren Laverne]] on vocals, also achieved a top ten album and wide critical acclaim in the mid-to-late-1990s. In recent years, a thriving [[underground music]] scene in Sunderland has helped the likes of [[Smalltown Heroes]], [[The futureheads]], [[Field Music]] and more recently [[Frankie & The Heartstrings]] gain national recognition.

Other famous Sunderland musicians include punk rockers [[The Toy Dolls]], who broke the top five of the charts with "Nellie the Elephant" in December 1984; the punk rock band [[Leatherface]]; the lead singer of dance outfit [[Olive (band)|Olive]], [[Ruth Ann Boyle]], who achieved a UK chart-topper with "You're Not Alone" in May 1997, and has gone on to work with fellow chart-toppers [[Enigma (UK band)|Enigma]]; [[A Tribe of Toffs]] made number 21 with their cult hit "[[John Kettley is a Weatherman]]" in December 1988.

On 7 and 8 May 2005, Sunderland played host to [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Big Weekend]] concert - the UK's largest free music festival.

The only professional sporting team in Sunderland is the [[Association football|football]] team, [[Sunderland A.F.C.]], which was formed in 1879,<ref>{{cite news |title=SAFC history 1879-1889 |url=http://www.safc.com/history/?page_id=2716 |work=SAFC website |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=3 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317072400/http://www.safc.com/history/?page_id=2716 |archive-date=17 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> and plays home games at the 49,000 seat capacity [[Stadium of Light]].<ref>{{cite news |title=SAFC Previous Grounds / History / Previous Grounds |url=http://www.safc.com/history/?page_id=3911 |work=SAFC website |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=3 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421212645/http://www.safc.com/history/?page_id=3911 |archive-date=21 April 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Sunderland also has the north-east's top women's football team, [[Sunderland A.F.C. Women]], who have been financially separated from the men's team since summer 2005. They currently play in the top tier of English women's football - [[FA Women's Premier League National Division]], despite their financial struggles.

Sunderland's longest stadium occupancy so far was of [[Roker Park]] for 99 years beginning in 1898, with relocation taking place due to the stadium's confined location and the need to build an all-seater stadium. The initial relocation plan had been for a stadium to be situated alongside the Nissan factory, but these were abandoned in favour of the Stadium of Light at [[Monkwearmouth]] on the site of a [[colliery]] that had closed at the end of 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunderland Cricket Club|url=http://www.safc.com/history/?page_id=3911|work=SAFC website|date=2 January 2008|accessdate=3 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421212645/http://www.safc.com/history/?page_id=3911|archive-date=21 April 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the dissolution of [[Sunderland Nissan F.C.]], Sunderland itself now has only one non-league side, [[Sunderland Ryhope Community Association F.C.]] who now play in the [[Northern League Division One]] after a successful promotion campaign in the 2009/10 season.<ref>[http://www.sunderlandrca.co.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331170409/http://sunderlandrca.co.uk/ |date=31 March 2019 }} Sunderland RCA FC grassroots football</ref> However [[Washington F.C.]] also hail from Washington in the City.
