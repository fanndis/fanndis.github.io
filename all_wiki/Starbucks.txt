Headquartered in the [[Starbucks Center]], the company was founded in 1971 by [[Jerry Baldwin]], [[Zev Siegl]], and [[Gordon Bowker]] at Seattle's [[Pike Place Market]]. During the early 1980s, they sold the company to [[Howard Schultz]] who – after a business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] – decided to make the [[coffee bean]] store a coffeeshop serving [[espresso]]-based drinks. Schultz's first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. West Coast]]. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[British Columbia]], the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into [[California]] in the early 1990s through a series of highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years, positioning Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee and increasing sales to $5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]] served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]] and spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.

Many stores sell pre-packaged food items, pastries, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and [[Whiskey tumbler|tumblers]]. There are also several select "Starbucks Evenings" locations which offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at [[grocery stores]] in the United States and other countries. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. It planned to open 1,000 Reserve coffee shops by the end of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Robinson|first=Melia|title=Starbucks is opening premium stores where you can buy coffee flights and cold-brew floats — take a look inside|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-of-starbucks-reserve-bar-what-its-like-2017-7|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Business Insider}}</ref> Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. The latest roastery location opened on [[Chicago]]'s [[Magnificent Mile]] in November 2019, and is the world's largest Starbucks. The company has received [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial [[brand loyalty]], market share, and [[Valuation (finance)|company value]].

Starbucks introduced a new line of instant coffee packets, called VIA "Ready Brew," in March 2009. It was first unveiled in New York City with subsequent testing of the product also in [[Seattle]], [[Chicago]], and [[London]]. The first two VIA flavors include Italian Roast and Colombia, which were then rolled out in October 2009, across the U.S. and Canada with Starbucks stores promoting the product with a [[blind study|blind]] "taste challenge" of the instant versus fresh roast, in which many people could not tell the difference between the instant and freshly brewed coffee.

Kevin Knox, who was in charge of doughnuts [[Food quality|quality]] at Starbucks from 1987 to 1993, recalled on his blog in 2010 how [[George Howell (entrepreneur)|George Howell]], coffee veteran and founder of the [[Cup of Excellence]], had been appalled at the [[Coffee roasting#Roast flavors|dark roasted]] beans that Starbucks was selling in 1990.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/coffeecity/2011333088_its_coffee_party_weekend.html|title=Coffee wrap: Starbucks spent $740K on lobbying last year, Le Whif, and an old hand takes a swipe at 'third wave' coffee|last=Allison|first=Melissa|date=March 10, 2010|work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> Talking to the ''New York Times'' in 2008, Howell stated his opinion that the dark roast used by Starbucks does not deepen the flavor of coffee, but instead can destroy purported nuances of flavor.<ref name=":3" /> The March 2007 issue of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' compared American fast-food chain coffees and ranked Starbucks behind [[McDonald's]] Premium Roast in the middle of a [[Coffee wars|coffee war]].

===Starbucks Verismo===
In 2012, Starbucks introduced Starbucks Verismo, a line of coffee makers that brew espresso and regular chocolate from coffee capsules, a type of pre-apportioned [[disposable product|single-use]] container of ground coffee and flavorings utilizing the K-Fee pod system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Verismo.com|url=http://www.verismo.com/en-us/|publisher=Starbucks|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> In a brief review of the 580 model, [[Consumer Reports]] described the results of a comparative test of the Verismo 580 against two competitive brands: "Because you have to conduct a rinse cycle between each cup, the Verismo wasn't among the most convenient of single-serve machines in our coffeemaker tests. Other machines we've tested have more flexibility in adjusting brew-strength—the Verismo has buttons for coffee, espresso, and latte with no strength variation for any type. And since Starbucks has limited its coffee selection to its own brand, there are only eight varieties so far plus a milk pod for the latte."<ref>{{cite web|last=ijnPerratore|first=Ed|title=Does the Verismo coffeemaker deliver true Starbucks flavor?|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/home/2012/10/do-you-get-true-starbucks-flavor-with-its-verismo-coffeemaker.html|publisher=Consumer Reports|access-date=May 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430030455/http://news.consumerreports.org/home/2012/10/do-you-get-true-starbucks-flavor-with-its-verismo-coffeemaker.html|archive-date=April 30, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Licensed and franchise operations===
Independently operated Starbucks locations exist. Stores that independently operate locations include [[Ahold Delhaize]], [[Barnes & Noble]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Albertsons]] and, more recently, [[Publix]] stores. As of 2015, 4,962 licensed locations exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Number of Starbucks stores in the United States from 2005 to 2015*|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/218360/number-of-starbucks-stores-in-the-us/|website=Statista|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> In the [[EMEA]] (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) markets, Starbucks operates a franchising program. Different from the licensing program in which existing corporations may apply to operate a Starbucks kiosk within an existing store, franchises can enable new, freestanding stores.

===Automated locations===
Starbucks has [[Automation|automated]] systems in some areas. These machines have 280 possible drink combinations to choose from. They have touchscreens and customers can play games while they wait for their order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agbeat.com/news-business/starbucks-vending-machines-and-the-future-of-business/ |title=Starbucks vending machines and the future of business |publisher=AGBeat |date=September 14, 2012 |access-date=May 9, 2014}}</ref>

Free Wi-Fi Internet access varies in different regions. In Germany, customers get unlimited free Wi-Fi through [[BT Openzone]], and in Switzerland and Austria, customers can get 30 minutes with a voucher card (through [[T-Mobile]]). Since 2003, Starbucks in the UK rolled out a paid Wi-Fi based on one-time, hourly or daily payment. Then, in September 2009, it was changed to 100% free Wi-Fi at most of its outlets. Customers with a Starbucks Card are able to log-on to the Wi-Fi in-store for free with their card details, thereby bringing the benefits of the loyalty program in line with the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london-insider.co.uk/2009/09/free-wifi-at-all-starbucks-for-reward-card-holders/ |title=Free Wi-Fi at all Starbucks for Reward Card holders |publisher=The London Insider |date=September 23, 2009 |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220010936/http://www.london-insider.co.uk/2009/09/free-wifi-at-all-starbucks-for-reward-card-holders/ |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since July 2010, Starbucks has offered free Wi-Fi in all of its US stores via AT&T and information through a partnership with [[Yahoo!]].

At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot-drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/business/18969709.html |title=Group finds Starbucks logo too hot to handle |publisher=Startribune.com |date=May 16, 2008 |access-date=April 24, 2011}}</ref> but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media.

===Partnerships===
Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to collaborate on selling music as part of the "coffeehouse experience." In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the [[iTunes Store]], selling music similar to that played in Starbucks stores. In September 2007, Apple announced that customers would be able to browse the iTunes Store at Starbucks via Wi-Fi in the US—with no requirement to log into the Wi-Fi network—targeted at [[iPhone]], [[iPod touch]], [[iPad]], and [[MacBook]] users. The iTunes Store will automatically detect recent songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users the opportunity to download the tracks. Some stores feature LCD screens with the artist name, song, and album information of the current song playing. This feature has been rolled out in [[Seattle]], New York City, and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and was offered in limited markets during 2007–2008.<ref name=informationweek>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201804347 Apple Builds Ecosystem With iPod Touch Screen]. (September 5, 2007) Retrieved September 5, 2007</ref> During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the "Song of the Day" promotion in 2007, and a "Pick of the Week" card is now available at Starbucks for a free song download. Since 2011, Starbucks also gives away a "Pick of the Week" card for app downloads from the App Store. A Starbucks app is available in the iPhone [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].

Starting on June 1, 2009, the [[MSNBC]] morning news program ''[[Morning Joe]]'' has been presented as "brewed by Starbucks" and the show's logo changed to include the company logo. Although the hosts have previously consumed Starbucks coffee on air "for free" in the words of MSNBC president [[Phil Griffin (presenter)|Phil Griffin]], it was not paid placement at that time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/media/01joe.html "Starbucks Is Now the Official Joe of 'Morning Joe'"].

Starbucks claimed that Kraft did not sufficiently promote its products and offered Kraft US$750 million to terminate the agreement; however, Kraft declined the offer, but Starbucks proceeded with the termination anyway. Starbucks wanted to terminate the agreement because at the time, single coffee packs were beginning to become popular.

In June 2014, Starbucks announced a new partnership with [[Arizona State University]] (ASU) that would allow Starbucks employees in their Junior and Senior years of college to complete four years of college at Arizona State University's online program for only around 23K. Starbucks employees admitted into the program will receive a scholarship from the college, [http://www.starbucks.com/careers/college-plan College Achievement Plan] (CAP), that will cover 44% of their tuition. The remaining balance and all other expenses would be paid by the student or through traditional financial aid.

==Parodies and infringements==
[[File:LCD_Consumer_Whore_cover.jpg|right|thumb|208x208px|Cartoonist [[Kieron Dwyer]]'s first ''LCD'' issue, 2000.]]
Starbucks has been a target of parodies and imitations of its logo, particularly the 1992 version, and has used legal action against those it perceives to be infringing its intellectual property. In 2000, San Francisco [[cartoonist]] [[Kieron Dwyer]] was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics, later placing it on coffee mugs, T-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to [[free speech]] under U.S. law. The case was eventually settled [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]], as Dwyer claimed he did not have the financial ability to endure a trial case with Starbucks. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially "profiting" from using a "confusingly similar" image of the Starbucks siren logo. Dwyer was allowed to display the image as an expression of free speech, but he can no longer sell it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbldf.org/pr/001130-starbucks.shtml |title=Cartoonist Kieron Dwyer Sued By Starbucks |date=November 30, 2000 |access-date=May 23, 2007 |publisher=Comic Book Legal Defense Fund |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207083413/http://www.cbldf.org/pr/001130-starbucks.shtml|archive-date=February 7, 2005}}</ref> In a similar case, a New York store selling stickers and T-shirts using the Starbucks logo with the phrase "Fuck Off" was sued by the company in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-village-starbucks-was-not-amused.html|title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VILLAGE; Starbucks Was Not Amused|last=Moynihan|first=Colin|date=July 11, 1999|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 1, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite court |litigants = Starbucks v.

The store was owned by a group of young [[Haida people|Haida]] men, who claimed that the name was a coincidence, due to "buck" being a Haida word for "young man" (a claim that cannot be substantiated).

==Environmental and social policies==
===Environmental impact===
[[File:Starbucks-germany.jpg|thumb|Starbucks in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt, Germany]], 2004]]
In 1999, Starbucks started "Grounds for your Garden" to make their business [[environmentally friendlier]]. This gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and lobby their local store to begin the practice. In October 2008, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million liters (6.2 million US gal) of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a '[[dipper well]]' in each of its stores, but this is often required by governmental [[Food safety|public health code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/newsdata/restaurant-inspections/locality/hampton/restaurant/popeyes-chicken-omni-1/240461 |title=An example of government requirement to operate a dipper well |publisher=Hamptonroads.com |date=February 24, 2009 |access-date=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

In June 2009, in response to concerns over its excessive water consumption, Starbucks re-evaluated its use of the dipper well system. In September 2009, company-operated Starbucks stores in Canada and the United States successfully implemented a new water saving solution that meets government health standards. Different types of milk are given a dedicated spoon that remains in the pitcher and the dipper wells were replaced with push button metered faucets for rinsing. This will reportedly save up to {{Convert|150|usgal|l|abbr=on}} of water per day in every store.<ref>{{cite web |title=Recycling & Reducing Waste |url=http://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/environment/recycling |publisher=Starbucks Company }}</ref>

====Recycling====
Starbucks began using 10% [[recycled paper]] in its beverage cups in 2006—the company claimed that the initiative was the first time that recycled material had been used in a product that came into direct contact with a food or beverage.<ref name="nytrecycle">{{cite news|last=Warner |first=Melanie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/business/17starbucks.html |title=Starbucks Will Use Cups With 10% Recycled Paper |work=The New York Times |date=November 17, 2004 |access-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> [[Allen Hershkowitz]] of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] called the 10% content "minuscule,"<ref name="nytrecycle" /> but Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award in 2005 for the initiative.<ref>{{cite web|author=GreenBiz Staff|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2005/10/13/starbucks-honored-recycled-content-cup |title=Starbucks Honored for Recycled-Content Cup |publisher=GreenBiz.com |date=October 13, 2005 |access-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> In a 2008 media article, Starbucks's vice president of corporate social responsibility acknowledged that the company continued to struggle with environmental responsibility, as none of its cups were recyclable and stores did not have recycling bins. At the time that the article was published, Starbucks gave customers who brought in their own reusable cup a 10-cent discount, in addition to using corrugated cup sleeves made from 85 percent post-consumer recycled fiber, which is 34 percent less paper than the original. During the same period, Starbucks entered into a partnership with Conservation International—pledging US$7.5 million over three years—to help protect the natural environment of coffee-growing communities in Mexico and Indonesia.<ref name="seattletimes">{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004412179_starbucks14.html|title=Starbucks struggles with reducing environmental impacts|last=Allison|first=Melissa|date=May 14, 2008|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=March 18, 2009}}</ref>

Farmers who earn high overall scores receive higher prices than those who achieve lower scores. Ratings categories include economic accountability, social responsibility, environmental leadership in coffee growing and processing. Indicators for social responsibility have evolved and now include 'zero tolerance' indicators that require workers to be paid in cash, check, or direct deposit, ensure that all workers are paid the established minimum wage, that workplaces are free of harassment and abuse, that workplaces are nondiscriminatory and do not employ persons under the age of 14, and several more.<ref>{{cite web|last=Semroc|first=Bambi|title=Assessment of the Starbucks Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.)

Ethiopia fought hard for this acknowledgement mainly to help give its poverty-stricken farmers a chance to make more money. In 2006, Starbucks said it paid $1.42 per pound for its coffee.

[[Ethos water|Ethos]], a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2003, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating "helping children get clean water," referring to the fact that US$0.05 from each US$1.80 bottle sold (US$0.10 per bottle in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over US$6.2 million for clean water efforts, the brand is not incorporated as a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a for-profit brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Stealing water day|url= http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110231/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archive-date=October 11, 2007|magazine= NOW Toronto|quote= "Maybe they're not trying to sell anything on World Water Day, but every other day of they year they are selling water." }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shareholder.com/visitors/dynamicdoc/document.cfm?CompanyID=SBUX&DocumentID=1382 |title=Starbucks Corporation 2006 Annual Report |publisher=Shareholder.com |access-date=October 24, 2010}}</ref> The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands.<ref>Walker, R.

===2020 plastic straw ban===
On July 9, 2018, Starbucks President and CEO [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] announced that Starbucks will ban the single-use [[plastic straw]]s by January 1, 2020 on all cold drinks from all locations worldwide due to climate change concerns, pollution, and [[sea turtle]] endangerment as the single-use plastic straws failed to be designed for recycling when they were invented. [[Frappucino]]s will get straws made from a different material that is sustainable and environmentally friendly such as paper or compostable plastic, while other cold drinks will get straw-less lids. However, the new lids will actually have more plastic than the old lid-straw combination but they are recyclable unlike the old lid-single-use straw combination.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/23/starbucks-straws-ban-2020-environment Starbucks is banning straws – but is it really a big win for the environment?], The Guardian, July 23, 2018</ref> The Starbucks locations in Europe, China, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Canada, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington D.C., New Mexico, California, New York, Washington State, New Jersey, Oregon, Maryland, Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island already eliminated plastic straws by the end of 2018.<ref name="market_down">{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/starbucks-and-mcdonalds-plastic-straw-removal-will-go-down-well-with-millennials-2018-07-09|title=Starbucks and McDonald's plastic straw removal will go down well with millennials|first=Tonya|last=Garcia|website=marketwatch.com|access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref><ref name="fortune.com">{{cite web|url=https://fortune.com/2018/07/11/ditching-plastic-straws-replacements/|title=These 8 Companies Are Ditching Plastic Straws.

Starbucks has become the subject of a protest song, "[[A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop]]" by [[Neil Young]] and his band, [[Promise of the Real]].
