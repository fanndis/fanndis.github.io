'''Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛ|f|əl}};<ref name="Who Do You Think You Are?">{{Cite episode |title=Boris Johnson |series=Who Do You Think You Are? |network=BBC |date=20 August 2008}}</ref> born 19 June 1964) is a British politician, author, and former journalist who has been [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from 2008 to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 2001 to 2008 and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since 2015. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[One-nation conservatism|one-nation conservative]].

<!--Early life, journalism, early political career and Mayoralty-->
Johnson was educated at [[Eton College]] and studied [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. In 1989, he became the Brussels correspondent and later a political columnist for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', where his articles exerted a strong [[Eurosceptic]] influence on the British right. He was the editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson was a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior shadow minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]] and resigned from the House of Commons; he was [[2012 London mayoral election|re-elected as Mayor in 2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Thames cable car]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.

<!--Post-Mayoral career, tenure as Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister-->
In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Johnson was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]] in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU membership referendum]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; he resigned from the post two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation]] of Parliament was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].{{efn|name=prorogationtechnicality|Formally, Parliament is prorogued by the monarch (Queen [[Elizabeth II]]) on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the monarch on the Prime Minister's "advice", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function.{{fact|date=September 2020}} It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of the Queen.}} In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest parliamentary victory since 1987, winning 43.6% of the vote – the largest share of any party since 1979. The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union under the terms of a revised [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]], entering into a transition period. Since February 2020, Johnson has led the United Kingdom's ongoing response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=PM to update UK on 'steps to defeat' coronavirus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52480643 |website=BBC News |accessdate=6 October 2020 |date=30 April 2020}}</ref><!--Please be careful when updating the above, only update with very significant updates.

<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->
Supporters of Johnson have praised him as optimistic, humorous and entertaining, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters.

In 1969, the family returned to England and settled into West Nethercote Farm, near [[Winsford, Somerset|Winsford]] in Somerset, Stanley's remote family home on [[Exmoor]] in the [[West Country]].{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=44|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=17|3a1=Gimson|3y=2012|3p=17, 20–22}} There, Johnson gained his first experiences of [[fox hunting]].{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=18}} Stanley was regularly absent from Nethercote, leaving Johnson to be raised largely by his mother, assisted by ''[[au pair]]s''.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=18|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=25}} As a child, Johnson was quiet and studious{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=14}} and suffered from deafness, resulting in several operations to insert [[Tympanostomy tube|grommets]] into his ears.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=13|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=11}} He and his siblings were encouraged to engage in [[highbrow]] activities from a young age,{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=26|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=18}} with high achievement being greatly valued; Johnson's earliest recorded ambition was to be "world king".{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=45|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=28|3a1=Gimson|3y=2012|3pp=17–18}} Having few or no friends other than their siblings, the children became very close.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=28–29}}

In late 1969, the family relocated to [[Maida Vale]] in West London, while Stanley began post-doctoral research at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=29}} In 1970, Charlotte and the children briefly returned to Nethercote, where Johnson attended Winsford Village School, before returning to London to settle in [[Primrose Hill]],{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=30}} where they were educated at Primrose Hill Primary School.{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=44|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=30|3a1=Gimson|3y=2012|3p=26}} A fourth child and third son, [[Jo Johnson|Joseph]], was born in late 1971.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=31}}

In September 1987, Johnson and Mostyn-Owen were married in [[West Felton]], Shropshire, accompanied by a duet for violin and viola ''Allegra e Boris''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.schott-music.com/shop/allegra-e-boris-no272687.html|title=Allegra e Boris|website=englisch}}</ref> specially commissioned for the wedding from [[Hans Werner Henze]].{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=92–94|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=85–86}} After a honeymoon in Egypt, they settled in [[West Kensington]], West London,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=94}} when Johnson secured work for a [[Management consulting|management consultancy]] company, [[L.E.K.

After the editor [[Charles Wilson (journalist)|Charles Wilson]] learned of the matter, Johnson was dismissed.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=100–102|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=90–96}}

Johnson secured employment on the leader-writing desk of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', having met its editor, [[Max Hastings]], during his Oxford University Union presidency.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=102–103|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=97}} His articles appealed to the newspaper's conservative, middle-class, middle-aged "[[Middle England]]" readership,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=108}} and were known for their distinctive literary style, replete with old-fashioned words and phrases and for regularly referring to the readership as "my friends".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=106–107}} In early 1989, Johnson was appointed to the newspaper's Brussels bureau to report on the European Commission,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=109}} remaining in the post until 1994.<ref name="Fletcher">{{Cite news |last=Fletcher |first=Martin |date=4 November 2017 |title=The joke's over – how Boris Johnson is damaging Britain's global stature |work=[[New Statesman]] |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/11/joke-s-over-how-boris-johnson-damaging-britain-s-global-stature |access-date=7 November 2017}}</ref> A strong critic of the integrationist Commission President [[Jacques Delors]], he established himself as one of the city's few [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] journalists.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=115–116}} Many of his fellow journalists there were critical of his articles, opining that they often contained lies designed to discredit the commission.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=121, 126|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=98–99, 100–101}} The Europhile Tory politician [[Chris Patten]] later stated that, at that time, Johnson was "one of the greatest exponents of fake journalism".<ref name="Fletcher" />

Johnson biographer [[Andrew Gimson]] believed that these articles made Johnson "one of [Euroscepticism's] most famous exponents".{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=102}} According to later biographer [[Sonia Purnell]] – who was Johnson's Brussels deputy<ref name="Fletcher" /> – he helped make Euroscepticism "an attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the Right", whereas previously it had been associated with the British Left.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=115}} Johnson's articles established him as the favourite journalist of the Conservative Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]],{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=120|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=104}} but her successor, the Europhile [[John Major]], was annoyed by Johnson and spent much time attempting to refute what he said.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=118, 124}} Johnson's articles exacerbated tensions between the Conservative Party's Eurosceptic and Europhile factions, tensions which were widely viewed as contributing to the party's defeat in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} As a result, Johnson earned the mistrust of many party members.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=124}} His writings were also a key influence on the emergence of the EU-opposing [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=115}} The proprietor of the ''Telegraph'' at the time, [[Conrad Black]], said Johnson "was such an effective correspondent for us in Brussels that he greatly influenced British opinion on this country’s relations with Europe."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Black |first=Conrad |date=29 June 2019 |title=Max Hastings vs Boris Johnson: I know who I'd trust more |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/battle-of-hastings |access-date=9 April 2020 |website=[[The Spectator]]}}</ref>

===Political columnist: 1994–1999===
Back in London, Hastings turned down Johnson's request to become a [[war reporter]],{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=139–140}} instead promoting him to the position of assistant editor and chief political columnist.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=161|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=124}} Johnson's column received praise for being ideologically eclectic and distinctively written, and earned him a Commentator of the Year Award at the ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' awards.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=168|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=125}} His writing style was condemned by some critics as bigotry; in various columns he used the words "[[Pickaninny|piccannies]]" and "[[Watermelon stereotype|watermelon smiles]]" when referring to Africans, championed European colonialism in Uganda{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=169}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Boris |date=10 January 2002 |title=If Blair's so good at running the Congo, let him stay there |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3571742/If-Blairs-so-good-at-running-the-Congo-let-him-stay-there.html |url-access=subscription |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Boris |date=1 September 2005 |title=Getting our knickers in a twist over China |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3619424/Getting-our-knickers-in-a-twist-over-China.html |url-access=subscription |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> and referred to gay men as "tank-topped bumboys".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=171}}

[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Conservative Prime Minister [[John Major]] disliked Johnson and considered vetoing his candidacy.]]
Contemplating a political career, in 1993 Johnson outlined his desire to stand as a Conservative candidate to be a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) in the [[1994 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1994 European Parliament elections]]. [[Andrew Mitchell]] convinced Major not to veto Johnson's candidacy, but Johnson could not find a constituency.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=162–165}} He subsequently turned his attention to obtaining a seat in the UK House of Commons. After being rejected as Conservative candidate for [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St. Pancras]], he was selected as the party's candidate for [[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]] in north Wales, at that time a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[safe seat]]. Spending six weeks campaigning, he attained 9,091 votes (23%) in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], losing to the Labour candidate.{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=46|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2pp=185–186|3a1=Gimson|3y=2012|3p=125}}

Scandal erupted in June 1995 when a recording of a 1990 telephone conversation between Johnson and his friend [[Darius Guppy]] was made public.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=173–176|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=117–123}} In the conversation, Guppy said that his criminal activities involving insurance fraud were being investigated by ''[[News of the World]]'' journalist Stuart Collier, and he asked Johnson to provide him with Collier's private address, seeking to have the latter beaten to the extent of "a couple of black eyes and a cracked rib or something like that". Johnson agreed to supply the information, although he expressed concern that he would be associated with the attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=173–176|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=117–123}} When the phone conversation was published in 1995, Johnson stated that ultimately he had not obliged Guppy's request. Hastings reprimanded Johnson but did not dismiss him.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=173–176|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=117–123}}

Johnson was given a regular column in ''[[The Spectator]]'', sister publication to ''The Daily Telegraph'', which attracted mixed reviews and was often thought rushed.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=168}} In 1999, he was also given a column reviewing new cars in the magazine ''[[GQ]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=171|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=177–178}} His behaviour regularly disgruntled his editors; those at ''GQ'' were frustrated by the large number of parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=171}} whilst at ''The Telegraph'' and ''The Spectator'' he was consistently late in delivering his copy, forcing many staff to stay late to accommodate him; some related that if they went ahead and published without his work included, he would get angry and shout at them with expletives.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=179–181|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=177}}

Johnson's appearance on an April 1998 episode of the BBC's satirical current affairs show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' brought him national fame for his bumbling upper-class persona, viewed as highly entertaining by the show's large audience.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} He was invited back on to later episodes, including as a guest presenter; for his 2003 appearance, Johnson received a nomination for the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance|BAFTA Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=176–178|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=127–129}}<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 April 2020 |title=Television in 2004 - BAFTA Awards |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2004/television |access-date=3 May 2020 |website=[[BAFTA]]}}</ref> After these appearances, he came to be recognised on the street by the public, and was invited to appear on other television shows, such as ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', ''[[Breakfast with Frost]]'', and the political show ''[[Question Time (TV programme)|Question Time]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=178|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=130}}

===''The Spectator'' and MP for Henley: 1999–2008===
In July 1999, Conrad Black offered Johnson the editorship of ''The Spectator'' on the condition he abandoned his parliamentary aspirations; Johnson agreed.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=188|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=131}} While retaining ''The Spectator''{{'}}s traditional right-wing bent, Johnson welcomed contributions from leftist writers and cartoonists.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=198–199}} Under Johnson's editorship, the magazine's circulation grew by 10% to 62,000 and it began to turn a profit.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=191}} His editorship also drew criticism; some opined that under him ''The Spectator'' avoided serious issues,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=204}} while colleagues became annoyed that he was regularly absent from the office, meetings, and events.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=192, 194}} He gained a reputation as a poor political pundit as a result of incorrect political predictions made in the magazine,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=204}} and was strongly criticised – including by his father-in-law <!--Not knighted until the 2006 birthday honours-->[[Charles Wheeler (journalist)|Charles Wheeler]] – for allowing ''Spectator'' columnist [[Taki Theodoracopulos]] to publish racist and antisemitic language in the magazine.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=193}}<ref>{{Cite news |date=2 April 2008 |title=Boris says sorry over 'blacks have lower IQs' article in the Spectator |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/boris-says-sorry-over-blacks-have-lower-iqs-article-in-the-spectator-6630340.html |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

Journalist Charlotte Edwardes alleged in 2019 that Johnson had squeezed her thigh at a private lunch in the offices of the ''Spectator'' in 1999 and that another woman had told her that he had done the same to her.

In 2004, Johnson published an editorial in ''The Spectator'' after the murder of [[Ken Bigley]] suggesting that Liverpudlians were wallowing in their vicitim status and also "hooked on grief" over the [[Hillsborough disaster]], which Johson partly blamed on "drunken fans".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pidd |first=Helen |date=11 August 2019 |title=PM should apologise for Hillsborough remarks, says Liverpool mayor |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/11/boris-johnson-should-apologise-for-spectator-hillsborough-remarks-says-liverpool-mayor}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Boris sorry for Scouse stereotype |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3756418.stm |accessdate=27 June 2020 |work=BBC News |date=19 October 2004}}</ref> In an appendix added to a later edition of his 2005 book about the Roman empire, ''[[The Dream of Rome]]'', Johnson was criticised for arguing [[Islam]] has caused the [[Muslim world]] to be "literally centuries behind" [[Western world|the West]].<ref name="autogenerated3">{{Cite news |last=Perraudin |first=Frances |date=15 July 2019 |title=Boris Johnson claimed Islam put Muslim world 'centuries behind' |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/boris-johnson-islam-muslim-world-centuries-behind-2007-essay |access-date=27 July 2019}}</ref>

====Becoming an MP====
{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The selection of Boris Johnson ... confirms the Tory Party's increasing weakness for celebrity personalities over the dreary exigencies of politics.

Following [[Michael Heseltine]]'s retirement, Johnson decided to stand as Conservative candidate for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]], a Conservative safe seat in [[Oxfordshire]].{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=209–210|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=141}} The local Conservative branch selected him although it was split over Johnson's candidacy – some thought him amusing and charming; others disliked his flippant attitude and lack of knowledge about the local area.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=211–212}} Boosted by his television fame, Johnson stood as the Conservative candidate for the constituency in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], winning with a majority of 8,500 votes.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=220–221}} Alongside his Islington home, Johnson bought a farmhouse outside [[Thame]] in his new constituency.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=240}} He regularly attended Henley social events and occasionally wrote for the ''[[Henley Standard]]''.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=238}} His constituency surgeries proved popular, and he joined local campaigns to stop the closure of [[Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust|Townlands Hospital]] and the local [[Thames Valley Air Ambulance|air ambulance]].{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=239}}

In Parliament, Johnson was appointed to a [[standing committee]] assessing the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002|Proceeds of Crime Bill]], but missed many of its meetings.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=225}} Despite his credentials as a public speaker, his speeches in the House of Commons were widely deemed lacklustre; Johnson later called them "crap".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=232–233}} In his first four years as MP, he attended just over half of the Commons votes; in his second term, this declined to 45%.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=230}} He usually supported the Conservative [[party line (politics)|party line]] but rebelled against it five times in this period.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=231}} In [[free votes]], he demonstrated a more socially liberal attitude than many colleagues, supporting the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] and the [[Local Government Act 2003|repeal of Section 28]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2664163.stm|title=Section 28 compromise avoids a crisis|date=16 January 2003|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name="Conservative Revolts">{{Cite web|url=http://www.revolts.co.uk/Conservative%20splits.pdf |title=Mapping Conservative Divisions Under Michael Howard |accessdate=3 February 2010 |last=Cowley |first=Philip |author2=Mark Stuart |date=19 November 2004 |publisher=Revolts.co.uk |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nFmwnJXk?url=http://www.revolts.co.uk/Conservative%20splits.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> After initially stating he would not, he voted in support of the government's plans to join the US in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]],{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=240}} and in April 2003 visited occupied Baghdad.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=149}} In August 2004, he backed unsuccessful impeachment procedures against Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] for "[[high crimes and misdemeanours]]" regarding the war,<ref>{{Cite news |date=2 September 2004 |title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Programmes {{!}} BBC Parliament {{!}} Impeachment in practice |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3622380.stm |access-date=18 December 2016}}</ref> and in December 2006 described the invasion as "a colossal mistake and misadventure".{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=265}}

Although labelling Johnson "ineffably duplicitous" for breaking his promise not to become an MP, Black decided not to dismiss him because he "helped promote the magazine and raise its circulation".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=189, 190}} Johnson remained editor of ''The Spectator'', also writing columns for ''The Daily Telegraph'' and ''GQ'', and making television appearances.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=226}} His 2001 book, ''[[Friends, Voters, Countrymen|Friends, Voters, Countrymen: Jottings on the Stump]]'', recounted that year's election campaign,{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=230|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=145–146}} while 2003's ''Lend Me Your Ears'' collected together previously published columns and articles.{{sfn|Gimson|2012|pp=176–177}} In 2004, his first novel was published: ''[[Seventy-Two Virgins|Seventy-Two Virgins: A Comedy of Errors]]'' revolved around the life of a Conservative MP and contained various autobiographical elements.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=249–251|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=189–192}} Responding to critics who argued that he was juggling too many jobs, he cited [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]] as exemplars who combined their political and literary careers.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=227|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=143}} To manage the stress, he took up jogging and cycling,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=228}} and became so well known for the latter that Gimson suggested that he was "perhaps the most famous cyclist in Britain".{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=182}}

Following [[William Hague]]'s resignation as Conservative leader, Johnson backed [[Kenneth Clarke]], regarding Clarke as the only candidate capable of winning a general election.

[[File:Boris Johnson -holding a red model bus -2007.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson pledged to replace the city's [[Articulated buses in London|articulated buses]] with [[New Routemaster]] buses if elected mayor]]

Johnson's mayoral campaign focused on reducing youth crime, making public transport safer, and replacing the [[Articulated buses in London|articulated buses]] with an updated version of the [[AEC Routemaster]].{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=327}} Targeting the Conservative-leaning suburbs of [[outer London]], it capitalised on perceptions that the Labour Mayoralty had neglected them in favour of [[inner London]].{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=327|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=285}} His campaign emphasised his popularity, even among those who opposed his policies,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=326–327}} with opponents complaining that a common attitude among voters was: "I'm voting for Boris because he is a laugh".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=327}} The campaign of Labour incumbent [[Ken Livingstone]] portrayed Johnson as an out-of-touch [[toff]] and bigot, citing racist and homophobic language used in his column; Johnson responded that these quotes had been taken out of context and were meant as satire.{{sfnm|1a1=Hosken|1y=2008|1pp=426–427|2a1=Edwards|2a2=Isaby|2y=2008|2pp=67–69, 133|3a1=Purnell|3y=2011|3pp=90, 315}}

===First term: 2008–2012===
Settling into the [[City Hall, London|City Hall]] mayoral office,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=352}} Johnson's first official engagement was an appearance at the [[Sikh]] celebrations for [[Vaisakhi]] in [[Trafalgar Square]].{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=207|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=353}} Rather than bringing a team of assistants with him to the job as Livingstone had done, Johnson built his team over the following six months.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=354}} Those in City Hall who were deemed too closely allied to Livingstone's administration had their employment terminated.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=366}} Johnson appointed [[Tim Parker]] to be first Deputy Mayor, but after Parker began taking increasing control at City Hall and insisted that all staff report directly to him, Johnson dismissed him.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=368–271}} As a result of these problems, many in the Conservative Party initially distanced themselves from Johnson's administration, fearing that it would be counter-productive to achieving a Conservative victory in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=368}}

[[File:Boris Johnson on the podium.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson gave a victory speech in [[City Hall, London|City Hall]] after being elected as a [[Mayor of London]] ]]

He received criticism during the early weeks of his administration, largely because he was late for two official functions in his first week on the job, and because after three weeks he went on holiday to Turkey.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=366}} In July 2008, Johnson visited the closing ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, there offending his Chinese hosts with his attire.{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=371–372|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2pp=308–309}}
During the electoral campaign, Johnson had confided to [[Brian Paddick]] that he was unsure how he would retain his then lifestyle while relying upon the mayoral salary of £140,000 a year.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=360}} To resolve this problem, he agreed to continue his ''Telegraph'' column alongside his mayoral job, thus earning a further £250,000 a year.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=361}} His team believed that this would cause controversy, and made him promise to donate a fifth of his ''Telegraph'' fee to a charitable cause providing bursaries for students. Johnson resented this, and ultimately did not pay a full fifth.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=362}} Controversy erupted when he was questioned about his ''Telegraph'' fee on [[BBC]]'s ''[[HARDtalk]]''; here, he referred to the £250,000 as "chicken feed", something that was widely condemned, given that this was roughly 10 times the average yearly wage for a British worker.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=363}}<ref>{{Cite news |date=14 July 2009 |title=Mayor's £250,000 'chicken feed' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8148899.stm |access-date=2 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Mulholland |first=Hélène |date=14 July 2009 |title=Johnson condemned for describing £250,000 deal as 'chicken feed' |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/14/boris-johnson-telegraph-chicken-feed |access-date=1 April 2010}}</ref>

[[File:2011 London riots.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's response to the 2011 London riots was criticised]]

Johnson appointed himself chair of the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]] (MPA), and in October 2008 successfully pushed for the resignation of Metropolitan Police Commissioner [[Ian Blair]] after the latter was criticised for allegedly handing contracts to friends and for his handling of the [[death of Jean Charles de Menezes]].{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1pp=377–278|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=304}}<ref>{{Cite news |date=2 October 2008 |title=Britain's top policeman resigns |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7648664.stm |access-date=1 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=O'Neill |first1=Sean |last2=Fresco |first2=Adam |last3=Coates |first3=Sam |date=3 October 2008 |title=Boris Johnson forces Sir Ian Blair to quit as police chief |work=The Times |location=London |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-forces-sir-ian-blair-to-quit-as-police-chief-qcmtwr7ff70 |url-access=subscription |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> This earned Johnson great respect among Conservatives, who interpreted it as his first act of strength.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=379}} Johnson resigned as MPA chairman in January 2010,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=388}} but throughout his mayoralty was highly supportive of the Metropolitan Police, particularly during the controversy surrounding the [[death of Ian Tomlinson]].{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=387–388}} Overall crime in London fell during his administration, but his claim that serious youth crime had decreased was shown to be false, and he acknowledged the error.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=436}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Donovan |first=Tim |date=16 November 2011 |title=London mayor admits 'caveats' in youth crime statistics |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15765557}}</ref> Similarly, his claim that Metropolitan Police numbers had increased was also characterized as untrue,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=436}} but the fact-checkers at [[Full Fact]] say that both Johnson's and his critics' positions are defensible.<ref>[https://fullfact.org/crime/police-officers-under-boris-johnson/ "Police numbers under Boris Johnson’s time as Mayor"], [[Full Fact]] (26 Jul 2019), accessed 24 September 2020.</ref> He was also criticised for his response to the [[2011 England riots|2011 London riots]]; holidaying with his family in [[British Columbia]] when the rioting broke out, he did not immediately return to London, only returning 48 hours after it had begun and addressing Londoners 60 hours thereafter.

Johnson championed London's financial sector and denounced what he saw as "banker bashing" following the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]],{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=400|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=324}} condemning the [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] [[Occupy London]] movement that appeared in 2011.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=439–440}} He spent much time with those involved in the financial services, and criticised the government's 50p tax rate for higher earners.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=400}} He collected donations from the city's wealthy for a charitable enterprise, the Mayor's Fund, which he had established to aid disadvantaged youths.  It initially announced that it would raise £100&nbsp;million, but by 2010 it had only spent £1.5&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=414}} He also retained extensive personal contacts throughout the British media,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=389}} which resulted in widespread favourable press coverage of his administration.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=389}} In turn he remained largely supportive of his friends in the media – among them [[Rupert Murdoch]] – during the [[News International phone hacking scandal]].{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=424–425}}

====Re-election campaign====
Up for re-election in 2012, Johnson again hired Crosby to orchestrate his campaign.{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=338}}
Before the election, Johnson published ''Johnson's Life of London'', a work of popular history that the historian [[A. N. Wilson]] characterised as a "coded plea" for votes.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=447–448}}
Polls suggested that while Livingstone's approach to transport was preferred, voters in London placed greater trust in Johnson over issues of crime and the economy.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=440}} During the [[2012 London mayoral election|2012 Mayoral election]], Johnson sought re-election, while Livingstone was again selected as the Labour candidate. Johnson's campaign emphasised the accusation that Livingstone was guilty of [[tax evasion]], for which Livingstone called Johnson a "bare-faced liar".{{sfn|Crines|2013|p=3}} The political scientist Andrew Crines believed that Livingstone's campaign focused on criticising Johnson rather than presenting an alternate and progressive vision of London's future.{{sfn|Crines|2013|p=2}} In 2012, Johnson was [[2012 London mayoral election|re-elected]] as mayor, again defeating Livingstone.<ref name="BBC5May12">{{Cite news |date=5 May 2012 |title=London mayor: Boris Johnson wins second term by tight margin 5&nbsp;May 2012 Last updated at 01:35 |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17946742 |access-date=5 May 2012}}</ref>

In February 2013, during a [[London Assembly]] meeting following the publication of the 2014 budget for London, Johnson was ejected from the meeting following a vote and on the grounds that his deputy Victoria Borwick had left the chamber. Upon realising that the vote meant that he would not be questioned on the budget, Johnson referred to his political opponents as "great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Williams |first=Rob |date=25 February 2013 |title=Video: 'Great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies!' – Boris Johnson's parting shot at London Assembly members after they vote NOT to grill him over budget cuts |work=The Independent |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/video-great-supine-protoplasmic-invertebrate-jellies--boris-johnsons-parting-shot-at-london-assembly-members-after-they-vote-not-to-grill-him-over-16bn-budget-cut-8510244.html |access-date=21 May 2013}}</ref>

Vote Leave was accused of implying that 80 million Turks would come to the UK if it stayed in the EU.

Secret recordings obtained by ''[[BuzzFeed News]]'' in June 2018 revealed Johnson's dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiating style, accusing her of being too collaborative with the European Union in Brexit negotiations. Comparing May's approach to that of the US President Donald Trump – who at the time was engaged in a combative trade war with the EU due to its raising of tariffs on metal – Johnson said: "Imagine Trump doing Brexit. He'd go in bloody hard ... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It's a very, very good thought." He also called [[Philip Hammond]] and the Treasury "the heart of Remain" and accused individuals of scaremongering over a Brexit "meltdown", saying "No panic.

In September 2018, Johnson wrote: "We have opened ourselves to perpetual political blackmail. We have wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution – and handed the detonator to [[Michel Barnier]]." Senior Tories heavily criticised him, with [[Alan Duncan]] of the Foreign Office vowing to ensure the comments marked "the political end of Boris Johnson".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/09/boris-johnson-calls-theresa-may-chequers-brexit-plan-suicide-vest|title=Tories condemn Boris Johnson for Brexit 'suicide vest' remarks|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=9 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/boris-johnson-disgusting-criticism-theresa-may-conservative-row-chequers-plan-suicide-vest-a8529621.html|title=Open warfare between top Tories over Boris Johnson 'suicide vest' jibe at May |work=The Independent |accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref>

====Allegations of racism and Islamophobia====
In August 2018, ''The Daily Telegraph'' published a [[Satire|satirical article]] by Johnson criticising the then [[Burqa#Denmark|newly implemented Danish law]] against the wearing of the [[burqa]] or [[niqab]].

Writing for the ''Telegraph'' in 2002, Johnson referred to a visit by then prime minister Tony Blair: "What a relief it must be for Blair to get out of England. It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving [[piccaninnies]]", in the same article he referred to African people as having "watermelon smiles".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bienkov |first1=Adam |title=Boris Johnson called gay men 'tank-topped bumboys' and black people 'piccaninnies' with 'watermelon smiles' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-record-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-comments-bumboys-piccaninnies-2019-6?r=US&IR=T |website=Business Insider}}</ref>

In a 2004 novel, Johnson described the thoughts of a black parking inspector who had been subjected to racist abuse: "Faced with such disgusting behaviour, some traffic wardens respond with a merciless taciturnity. The louder the rant of the traffic offenders, the more acute are the wardens' feelings of pleasure that they, the stakeless, the outcasts, the niggers, are a valued part of the empire of law, and in a position to chastise the arrogance and selfishness of the indigenous people." In the same book, the narrator refers to the media being controlled by Jewish oligarchs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stefano |first1=Mark Di |title=Prime Minister Boris Johnson Used The N-Word In A 2004 Comic Novel |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/boris-johnson-n-word-novel |website=BuzzFeed}}</ref>

Five days after May's resignation on 7 June, Johnson formally launched his campaign, saying, "After three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on 31 October. We must do better than the current Withdrawal Agreement that has been rejected three times by Parliament—and let me clear that I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome.

===Immigration and the European Union===
[[File:Johnson meets with Junker in Luxembourg.jpg|thumb|Johnson with EU Commission President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], 16 September 2019]]
Purnell believed that it was the influence of Johnson's maternal family, the left-wing Fawcetts, that led to him developing "a genuine abhorrence of racial discrimination".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=25}} Johnson praised the former Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], saying that "Churchill saved this country and the whole of Europe from a barbaric fascist and racist tyranny and our debt to him is incalculable." He added that Churchill had "an extraordinary record as a social reformer who cared deeply for working people and their lives."<ref>{{cite news |title=Winston Churchill: Theresa May says she has portrait of wartime PM in her study amid row over John McDonnell comments |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/winston-churchill-theresa-may-john-mcdonnell-villain-labour-tonypandy-miners-a8779111.html |work=The Independent |date=14 February 2019 |accessdate=26 May 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214205813/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/winston-churchill-theresa-may-john-mcdonnell-villain-labour-tonypandy-miners-a8779111.html |archivedate=14 February 2019}}</ref> In 2003, Johnson said of the EU, "I am not by any means an ultra-Eurosceptic.

On 19 August 2019, Johnson wrote a letter to the EU and asked for the removal of the "backstop" accord, which had previously been agreed and signed by Theresa May during her premiership. The proposal was rejected by the President of the European Council, [[Donald Tusk]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kcbx.org/post/britains-boris-johnson-appeals-eu-drop-irish-backstop-demand#stream/0 |title=Britain's Boris Johnson Appeals To EU To Drop 'Irish Backstop' Demand |accessdate=20 August 2019 |work=kcbx.org}}</ref> On 26 August 2019, Johnson said that Britain would not pay £39 billion for the withdrawal agreement were the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October.

Speaking in [[Northern Ireland]], Johnson described himself as a "fervent and passionate [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|unionist]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Boris Johnson declares unionist views on trip to Northern Ireland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-50338539 |access-date=24 November 2020 |work=BBC News |date=7 November 2019}}</ref> He has proposed building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Simon |title=Johnson's 'bonkers' plan for £15bn bridge derided by engineers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/15/boris-johnson-bonkers-plan-for-15bn-pound-bridge-derided-by-engineers |access-date=24 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=15 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rothwell |first1=James |title=DUP urges Boris Johnson to build a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland to bolster Union |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/14/build-bridge-scotland-bolster-union-dup-urges-boris-johnson/ |access-date=24 November 2020 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 December 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visits Japan (35890109752).jpg|thumb|left|Johnson posing with an [[Aston Martin]] painted with the [[Union Jack]] in 2017]]
Often known simply as "Boris",{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=43|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=1}} Johnson has attracted a [[List of nicknames of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom#Boris Johnson|variety of nicknames]], including "BoJo", a [[portmanteau]] of his forename and surname.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200709060012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205171926/http://www.newstatesman.com/200709060012 |title=The BoJo, Ken and Bri show |work=New Statesman |location=London |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2010 |archivedate=5 December 2007}}</ref> Biographer Sonia Purnell described his public persona as "brand Boris", noting that he developed it while at the University of Oxford.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=91}} Max Hastings referred to this public image as a "façade resembling that of [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]], allied to wit, charm, brilliance and startling flashes of instability",{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=103}} while political scientist Andrew Crines stated that Johnson displayed "the character of a likable and trustworthy individual with strong intellectual capital".{{sfn|Crines|2013|p=1}} ''[[Private Eye]]'' editor [[Ian Hislop]] has defined him as "[[The Beano|Beano]] Boris" due to his perceived comical nature, saying: "He's our [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]&nbsp; ...

Johnson purposely cultivates a "semi-shambolic look",{{sfn|Edwards|Isaby|2008|p=74}} for instance by specifically ruffling his hair in a certain way when he makes public appearances.{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=74|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Gimson|3y=2012|3p=301}}
Purnell described him as "a manic self-promoter" who filled his life with "fun and jokes".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=3}} Described by Crines as "a joker",{{sfn|Crines|2013|p=1}} Johnson has stated that "humour is a utensil that you can use to sugar the pill and to get important points across."{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=3}} Purnell wrote that colleagues regularly expressed the view that Johnson used people to advance his own interests,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=183}} with Gimson saying that Johnson was "one of the great flatterers of our times".{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=x}} Purnell commented that he deflected serious questions using "a little humour and a good deal of bravado".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=214}} According to Gimson, Johnson was "a humane man" who "could also be staggeringly inconsiderate of others" when pursuing his own interests.{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=108}} Gimson also stated that Johnson has "an excessive desire to be liked".{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=258}}

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|Boris is an original—the opposite of a stereotype, the exception to the rule. Overweight and goosey-fleshed, he's the antithesis of an airbrushed pin-up. He resembles a 'human laundry-basket' and has a habit of forgetting to shower.|-Biographer [[Sonia Purnell]]{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=2}}}}

According to Purnell, "[Johnson] is blessed with immense charisma, wit, sex appeal and celebrity gold dust; he is also recognised and loved by millions—although perhaps less so by many who have had to work closely with him (let alone depend on him). Resourceful, cunning and strategic, he can pull off serious political coups when the greater good happens to coincide with his personal advantage but these aspirations are rarely backed up by concrete achievements, or even detailed plans."{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=456}} Furthermore, Purnell said that Johnson was a "highly evasive figure" when it came to his personal life,{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=1}} who remained detached from others and who had very few if any intimate friends.{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=15}} Among friends and family, Johnson is known as "Al" (short for his forename Alexander), rather than his middle name "Boris".{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1a2=Isaby|1y=2008|1p=43|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Gimson|3y=2012|3p=xiii}}
Gimson stated that Johnson "has very bad manners. He tends to be late, does not care about being late, and dresses without much care".{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=301}} Highly ambitious and very competitive, Johnson was, Gimson wrote, born "to wage a ceaseless struggle for supremacy".{{sfn|Gimson|2012|p=17}} He would be particularly angered with those he thought insulted aspects of his personal life; for instance, when an article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' upset Johnson, he emailed commissioning editor [[Sam Leith]] with the simple message "Fuck off and die."{{sfn|Purnell|2011|pp=6–7}} Thus, according to Purnell, Johnson hides his ruthlessness "using bumbling, self-deprecation or humour",{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=26}} and was a fan of "[[Lad culture|laddish]] banter and crude sexual references".{{sfn|Purnell|2011|p=37}}
