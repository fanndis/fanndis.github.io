== Etymology ==
Slovakia’s name in theory means the „Land of the Slavs“ (''[[Slovensko]]'' in Slovak language, stemming from the older form ''Sloven/Slovienin''). As such, it is a cognate of the words [[Slovenia]] and [[Slavonia]]. In medieval Latin, German sources and even some Slavic sources, the same name has often been used for Slovaks, Slovenes, Slavonians and [[Slavs]] in general.

According to one of the theories, between 13th and 14th century a new form of national name has formed for the acenstors of the Slovaks, possibly due to foreign influence – the [[Czech language|Czech]] word ''Slovák'' (in medieval sources from 1291 onward<ref>  UHLÁR, V.: O pôvode názvov Slovák, Slovensko a slovenčina </ref>). This form slowly replaced the name for the male members of the community, but female name (''Slovenka''), reference to the lands inhabited (''Slovensko'') and language name (''slovenčina'') all remained the same, with their base in the older form (compare to Slovenian counterparts). Most foreign translations tends to stem from this newer form (''Slovakia'' in english, ''Slowakei'' in German, ''Slovaquie'' in French, etc.).

In medieval Latin sources, terms Slavus, Slavonia or Slavorum (and more variants, from as early as 1029<ref> UHLÁR, V.: O pôvode názvov Slovák, Slovensko a slovenčina</ref>) has been used for them.

In German sources, name for Slovak lands was Windenland, Windishen landen (early 15th century<ref>PAPSONOVÁ, Mária - ŠMAHEL, František - DVOŘÁKOVÁ, Daniela. Ulrich Richental. Kostnická kronika. Budmerice: Vydavateľstvo Rak, 2009. {{ISBN|978-808550142-1}}.</ref>), later also the form „Slovakia, Schlowakei“ starts to appear (from 16th century<ref>Uličný, Ferdinand (2014). "Toponymum Slovensko – pôvod a obsah názvu" [The name Slovakia (Slovensko) – its origin and content]. Historický časopis. Historický ústav SAV (3): 548. ISSN 0018-2575.</ref>). 
The present Slovak form „''Slovensko''“ is first attested in the year 1675<ref>https://www.juls.savba.sk/ediela/ks/1992/8/ks1992-8.pdf</ref>.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Slovakia}}
[[File:Moravianska venusa.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A [[Moravany Venus|Venus]] from [[Moravany nad Váhom]], which dates back to 22,800 BC]]
The oldest surviving human artefacts from Slovakia are found near [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] and are dated at 270,000&nbsp;BCE, in the [[Lower Paleolithic|Early Paleolithic]] era. These ancient tools, made by the [[Clactonian]] technique, bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Other [[stone tool]]s from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (200,000–80,000&nbsp;BCE) come from the Prévôt (Prepoštská) cave in [[Bojnice]] and from other nearby sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://muzeumpraveku.sk/ |title=Museum of Prehistoric |last=Museum of Prehistoric Prepoštská Cave|work=muzeumpraveku.sk |year=2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> The most important discovery from that era is a [[Neanderthal]] [[human skull|cranium]] (c. 200,000 BCE), discovered near [[Gánovce]], a village in northern Slovakia.

Archaeologists have found prehistoric human skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the [[Gravettian]] culture, principally in the river valleys of [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]], [[Hron]], [[Ipeľ]], [[Váh]] and as far as the city of [[Žilina]], and near the foot of the [[Vihorlat Mountains|Vihorlat]], Inovec, and [[Tribeč]] mountains, as well as in the [[Myjava]] Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad Váhom]] near [[Piešťany]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].

=== Bronze Age ===
During the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this, their period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[Špania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.

[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]

After the disappearance of the Čakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.

=== Iron Age ===

==== Hallstatt Period ====
The arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sereď]]) and in the hill forts like Molpír, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.

A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the "Princes" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.

==== La Tène Period ====
From around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Devín]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[Púchov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with the coinage of the "Velkobysterecky" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and ahead on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].

==== Roman Period ====
[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Trenčín]] (178–179 AD)]]
From 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Szőny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of [[Bratislava]]. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Devín Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of Dúbravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.

Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Trenčín|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Trenčín]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8–6&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.

=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===
In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]] and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].

In 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name="Történeti Kronológia">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=Kálmán|title=Magyarország történeti kronológiája ''("The Historical Chronology of Hungary")''|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Kristó, p.30–31</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.

=== Slavic states ===
The [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of [[Duke]] [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under [[King]] [[Svätopluk I]].

Upon Rastislav's request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] came in 863.

During Rastislav's reign, the [[Principality of Nitra]] was given to his nephew [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svätopluk]] as an [[appanage]].<ref name="caplovic"/> The rebellious prince allied himself with the Franks and overthrew his uncle in 870. Similarly to his predecessor, Svätopluk I (871–894) assumed the title of the king (''rex''). During his reign, the Great Moravian Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, when not only present-day [[Moravia]] and Slovakia but also present-day northern and [[central Hungary]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], southern Poland and [[Vojvodina|northern Serbia]] belonged to the empire, but the exact borders of his domains are still disputed by modern authors.<ref name="Tóth">{{cite book|last=Tóth|first=Sándor László|title=Levediától a Kárpát-medencéig ''("From Levedia to the Carpathian Basin")''|publisher=Szegedi Középkorász Műhely|year=1998|location=Szeged|page=199|isbn=963-482-175-8}}</ref> Svatopluk also withstood attacks of the [[Hungarians|Magyar]] tribes and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], although sometimes it was he who hired the Magyars when waging war against East Francia.<ref>page=51</ref>

In 880, [[Pope John&nbsp;VIII]] set up an independent [[ecclesiastical province]] in Great Moravia with Archbishop [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]] as its head. He also named the German cleric [[Wiching]] the Bishop of [[Nitra]].

After the death of Prince Svatopluk in 894, his sons [[Mojmir II of Moravia|Mojmír&nbsp;II]] (894–906?) and [[Svatopluk&nbsp;II]] succeeded him as the Prince of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively.<ref name="caplovic"/> However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire. Weakened by an internal conflict as well as by constant warfare with [[Eastern Francia]], Great Moravia lost most of its peripheral territories.

In the meantime, the semi-nomadic Magyar tribes, possibly having suffered defeat from the similarly nomadic [[Pechenegs]], left their territories east of the [[Carpathian Mountains]],<ref>{{cite book|title=A Country Study: Hungary |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+hu0013)|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref> invaded the [[Carpathian Basin]] and started to occupy the territory gradually around 896.<ref>pages=189–211</ref> Their armies' advance may have been promoted by continuous wars among the countries of the region whose rulers still hired them occasionally to intervene in their struggles.<ref name="Kristó 2">{{cite book|last=Kristó|first=Gyula|title=Magyar honfoglalás – honfoglaló magyarok ''("The Hungarians' Occupation of their Country – The Hungarians occupying their Country")''|publisher=Kossuth Könyvkiadó|year=1996|pages=84–85|isbn=963-09-3836-7}}</ref>

It is not known what happened with both Mojmír&nbsp;II and Svatopluk&nbsp;II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In [[Battle of Pressburg|three battles]] (4–5 July and 9 August 907) near [[Bratislava]], the Magyars routed [[Bavaria]]n armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the break-up of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).

Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic script]] and its successor [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]]. The administrative system of [[Great Moravia]] may have influenced the development of the administration of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

Following the disintegration of the [[Great Moravian Empire]] at the turn of the 10th century, the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] annexed the territory comprising modern Slovakia. After their defeat on the [[Lech River]] they abandoned their nomadic ways; they settled in the centre of the Carpathian valley, adopted Christianity and began to build a new state—the Hungarian kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://loststory.net/node/71 |title=The kingdom of Hungary |publisher=loststory.net|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>

From the 11th century, when the territory inhabited by the Slavic-speaking population of Danubian Basin was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary, until 1918, when the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] collapsed, the territory of modern Slovakia was an integral part of the Hungarian state.<ref>{{cite book|author=Felak, James Ramon |title=At the Price of the Republic: Hlinka's Slovak People's Party, 1929–1938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOlD_8Kw0K0C&pg=PA3|date=15 June 1995|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0-8229-7694-3|pages=3–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Schuster, Rudolf |title=The Slovak Republic: A Decade of Independence, 1993–2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Brjcd07bN6sC&pg=PA71|date=January 2004|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-0-86516-568-7|pages=71–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Prokhorov, A.

Owing to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s expansion into Hungarian territory, [[Bratislava]] was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, ahead of the old Hungarian capital of [[Buda]] falling in 1541. It became part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, marking the beginning of a new era. The territory comprising modern Slovakia, then known as [[Upper Hungary]], became the place of settlement for nearly two-thirds of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] nobility fleeing the Turks and far more linguistically and culturally Hungarian than it was before.<ref name="books.google.pl"/> Partly thanks to old [[Hussite]] families, and Slovaks studying under [[Martin Luther]], the region then experienced a growth in [[Protestantism]].<ref name="books.google.pl"/> For a short period in the 17th century, most Slovaks were [[Lutherans]].<ref name="books.google.pl"/> They defied the Catholic Habsburgs and sought protection from neighbouring [[Transylvania]], a rival continuation of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] state that practised religious tolerance and normally had Ottoman backing. Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent wars between Catholics in the west territory and Protestants in the east, also against Turks, the frontier was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by Catholic German and Slovak troops on the Habsburg side. By 1648, Slovakia was not spared the [[Counter-Reformation]], which brought the majority of its population from Lutheranism back to [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1655, the printing press at the [[Trnava]] university produced the Jesuit Benedikt Szöllősi's Cantus Catholici, a Catholic hymnal in the Slovak language that reaffirmed links to the earlier works of Cyril and Methodius.

The [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]], the rivalry between [[Austria]] and [[Transylvania]], and the frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.<ref>"[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation]".

As the [[Great Turkish War|Turks withdrew]] from Hungary in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased, although [[Pressburg]] retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848 when it was transferred back to Buda.<ref>[http://www.slovakiasite.com/bratislava.php Bratislava].

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution of 1848–49]], the Slovaks supported the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Emperor]], hoping for independence from the Hungarian part of the [[Austria–Hungary|Dual Monarchy]], but they failed to achieve their aim.

[[File:Prohlášení nezávislosti.jpg|thumb|right|[[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in the United States, 1918.]]
In late October 1918, the Czech nationalist Tomáš Masaryk declared the "independence" for the territories of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Upper Hungary]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and proclaimed a common state, [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. The Slovaks were not consulted. In 1919, during the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous [[German people|Germans]], [[Slovaks]], [[Hungarians]] and Ruthenians within the newly set borders. The borders were set by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities, at least on paper.

During the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy but also culture and educational opportunities. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.<ref>J.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Polisencky, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline'' (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113–114.</ref>

In the 1930s Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revisionist]] governments of Germany, Hungary and Poland who used the aggrieved minorities in the country as a useful vehicle. Revision of the borders was called for, as Czechs constituted only 43% of the population. Eventually, this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia. The remainder of Czechoslovakia was renamed Czecho-Slovakia and promised a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. This, however, failed to materialize.<ref>''Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939'' edited by Professor E. L. Woodward, Roham Butler, M.A., and Margaret Lambert, PhD., Third Series, vol.iv, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1951, pps:94-99: 'Memorandum on the Present Political Situation in Slovakia'.</ref> Parts of southern and eastern Slovakia were also reclaimed by Hungary at the [[First Vienna Award]] of November 1938.

In 1969 Czechoslovakia became a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. Czechoslovakia became a [[puppet state]] of the Soviet Union. [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] was never part of the Soviet Union and remained independent to a degree.

Borders with the West were protected by the [[Iron Curtain]]. About 600 people, men, women, and children, were killed on the Czechoslovak border with [[Austria]] and [[West Germany]] between 1948 and 1989.<ref>"[https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20030674/border-killings-remain-unpunished-decades-later.html]." spectator.sme.sk.

=== Slovak Republic (1993–present) ===
[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|left|Slovakia became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]
The end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989, during the peaceful [[Velvet Revolution]], was followed once again by the country's dissolution, this time into two [[succession of states|successor states]]. The word "socialist" was dropped in the names of the two republics, with the Slovak Socialist Republic renamed as Slovak Republic. On 17 July 1992, Slovakia, led by Prime Minister [[Vladimír Mečiar]], declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Mečiar and [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Czech Prime Minister]] [[Václav Klaus]] negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November, the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992.

The Slovak Republic and the [[Czech Republic]] went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slovakia.org/history-topics |title=The Breakup of Czechoslovakia |publisher=Slovakia |accessdate=3 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010135407/http://www.slovakia.org/history-topics |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/velvet+divorce |title=Velvet divorce |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Slovakia has, nevertheless, remained a close partner with the Czech Republic. Both countries co-operate with Hungary and Poland in the [[Visegrád Group]]. Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2009, Slovakia adopted the [[Euro]] as its national currency. In 2019, Zuzana Čaputová became Slovakia's first female president.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Walker|first=Shaun|date=2019-03-31|title=Slovakia's first female president hails victory for progressive values|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/31/slovakia-elects-zuzana-caputova-first-female-president|url-status=live|access-date=2020-07-15|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

{{Wide image|High Tatras Panorama.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the [[High Tatras]]}}

Slovakia lies between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[50th parallel north|50° N]], and longitudes [[16th meridian east|16°]] and [[23rd meridian east|23° E]]. The Slovak landscape is noted primarily for its mountainous nature, with the [[Carpathian Mountains]] extending across most of the northern half of the country. Among these [[mountain range]]s are the high peaks of the [[Fatra-Tatra Area]] (including [[Tatra Mountains]], [[Veľká Fatra|Greater Fatra]] and [[Lesser Fatra]]), [[Slovak Ore Mountains]], [[Slovak Central Mountains]] or [[Beskids]]. The largest lowland is the fertile [[Danubian Lowland]] in the southwest, followed by the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]] in the southeast.<ref name=cia>{{cite web |title= Slovakia |work= [[The World Factbook]] |publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] |year=2007 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lo.html |accessdate=26 April 2008}}</ref> Forests cover 41% of Slovak land surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etrend.sk/trend-archiv/rok-/cislo-J%C3%BAn/az-dve-paetiny-uzemia-slovenska-pokryvaju-lesy.html|title=Až dve pätiny územia Slovenska pokrývajú lesy|publisher=etrend.sk |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref>

=== Tatra mountains ===
{{Main|Tatra Mountains}}
[[File:Slovakia topo.jpg|{{largethumb}}|A [[topography|topographical]] map of Slovakia]]

The Tatra Mountains, with 29 peaks higher than {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Sea level#AMSL|AMSL]], are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. The Tatras occupy an area of {{convert|750|km2|0|abbr=out}}, of which the greater part {{convert|600|km2|0|abbr=out}} lies in Slovakia. They are divided into several parts.

To the north, close to the Polish border, are the [[High Tatras]] which are a popular [[hiking]] and [[skiing]] destination and home to many scenic lakes and valleys as well as the highest point in Slovakia, the [[Gerlachovský štít]] at {{convert|2655|m|0}} and the country's highly symbolic mountain [[Kriváň (peak)|Kriváň]]. To the west are the [[Western Tatras]] with their highest peak of [[Bystrá (mountain)|Bystrá]] at {{convert|2248|m|0}} and to the east are the [[Belianske Tatras]], smallest by area.

Separated from the Tatras proper by the valley of the [[Váh]] river are the [[Low Tatras]], with their highest peak of [[Ďumbier]] at {{convert|2043|m|0}}.

The Tatra mountain range is represented as one of the three hills on the [[coat of arms of Slovakia]].

=== Caves ===
{{Main|List of caves in Slovakia}}
[[File:Domica Cave 20.jpg|thumb|right|[[Domica]] Cave]]

Slovakia has hundreds of caves and caverns under its mountains, of which 30 are open to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssj.sk/sk/verejnosti-volne-pristupne-jaskyne|title=Verejnosti voľne prístupné jaskyne|publisher=ssj.sk |accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref> Most of the caves have [[stalagmite]]s rising from the ground and [[stalactite]]s hanging from above. There are currently five Slovak caves under [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Site status. They are [[Dobšiná Ice Cave]], [[Domica]], [[Gombasek Cave]], [[Jasovská Cave]] and [[Ochtinská Aragonite Cave]]. Other caves open to the public include [[Belianska Cave]], [[Demänovská Cave of Liberty]], [[Demänovská Ice Cave]] or [[Bystrianska Cave]].

=== Rivers ===
{{Main|List of rivers of Slovakia}}
[[File:Belá river (Slovakia).jpg|thumb|right|[[Belá (river)|Belá River]]]]

Most of the rivers arise in the Slovak mountains. Some only pass through Slovakia, while others make a natural border with surrounding countries (more than {{convert|620|km|mi|disp=sqbr}}). For example, the [[Dunajec]] ({{convert|17|km|disp=sqbr}}) to the north, the [[Danube River|Danube]] ({{convert|172|km|disp=sqbr}}) to the south or the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] ({{convert|119|km|disp=sqbr}}) to the West. The total length of the rivers on Slovak territory is {{convert|49774|km}}.

The longest river in Slovakia is the [[Váh]] ({{convert|403|km|disp=sqbr}}), the shortest is the Čierna voda. Other important and large rivers are the [[Myjava (river)|Myjava]], the [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]] ({{convert|197|km|disp=sqbr}}), the [[Orava (river)|Orava]], the [[Hron]] ({{convert|298|km|disp=sqbr}}), the [[Hornád]] ({{convert|193|km|disp=sqbr}}), the [[Sajó|Slaná]] ({{convert|110|km|disp=sqbr}}), the [[Ipeľ]] ({{convert|232|km|disp=sqbr}}, forming the border with Hungary), the [[Bodrog]], the [[Laborec]], the [[Latorica]] and the [[Ondava]].

The biggest volume of discharge in Slovak rivers is during [[Spring (season)|spring]], when the snow melts from the mountains. The only exception is the Danube, whose discharge is the greatest during summer when the snow melts in the [[Alps]]. The Danube is the largest river that flows through Slovakia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nie ste prihlásený. |url=http://www.slovakregion.sk/vodstvo-jazera-rieky-rybniky-slovenska |title=Translated from Slovak language |publisher=Slovakregion.sk |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SVK present.svg|thumb|left|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Slovakia]]

The Slovak climate lies between the temperate and [[continental climate]] zones with relatively warm [[summer]]s and cold, cloudy and humid [[winter]]s. Temperature extremes are between {{convert|-41|to|40.3|C}} although temperatures below {{convert|-30|C}} are rare. The weather differs from the mountainous north to the plains in the south.

The warmest region is [[Bratislava]] and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may reach {{convert|30|C}} in summer, occasionally to {{convert|39|C}} in [[Hurbanovo]]. During night, the temperatures drop to {{convert|20|C}}. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of {{convert|-5|C}} to {{convert|10|C}}. During night it may be freezing, but usually not below {{convert|-10|C}}.

In Slovakia, there are four [[season]]s, each season ([[Spring (season)|spring]], summer, [[autumn]] and [[winter]]) lasts three months. The dry continental air brings in the summer heat and winter frosts. In contrast, oceanic air brings rainfalls and reduces summer temperatures. In the lowlands and valleys, there is often fog, especially in winter.

Spring starts with 21 March and is characterised by colder weather with an average daily temperature of {{convert|9|C}} in the first weeks and about {{convert|14|C}} in May and {{convert|17|C}} in June. In Slovakia, the weather and climate in the spring are very unstable.

Summer starts on 22 June and is usually characterised by hot weather with daily temperatures exceeding {{convert|30|C}}. July is the warmest month with temperatures up to about {{convert|37|to|40|C}}, especially in regions of southern Slovakia—in the urban area of Komárno, Hurbanovo or Štúrovo. Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop—40 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|C}} (less in the mountains).

Autumn in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|C}}, in November to {{convert|3|C}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called [[Indian summer]]).

Winter starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C}}. In December and January, it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it changes into the thaw and frost. Winters are colder in the mountains, where the snow usually lasts until March or April and the night temperatures fall to {{convert|-20|C}} and colder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026021233/http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archivedate=26 October 2007 |title=Based on the "Climate" article from |publisher=www.slovensko.com |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>

The geographical position of Slovakia determines the richness of the diversity of fauna and flora. More than 11,000 plant species have been described throughout its territory, nearly 29,000 animal species and over 1,000 species of protozoa. [[Endemism|Endemic]] biodiversity is also common.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://geography.upol.cz/soubory/lide/smolova/RGSR/ucebnice/fg/biota.html|title=Regionální geografie Slovenska - elektronická učebnice|website=geography.upol.cz|access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref>

Slovakia is located in the biome of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]]s. As the altitude changes, the vegetation associations and animal communities are forming height levels ([[oak]], [[beech]], [[spruce]], [[scrub pine]], [[alpine meadows]] and [[subsoil]]). Forests cover 44% of the territory of Slovakia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tasr.sk/|title=Tlačová agentúra Slovenskej republiky - TASR.sk|website=www.tasr.sk|access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref> In terms of forest stands, 60% are [[broadleaf trees]] and 40% are [[coniferous trees]].

Slovakia is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democratic]] republic with a [[multi-party system]]. The last [[2020 Slovak parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] were held on 29 February 2020 and two rounds of [[2019 Slovak presidential election|presidential elections]] took place on 16 and 30 March 2019.

The Slovak [[head of state]] and the formal head of the executive is the president (currently [[Zuzana Čaputová]], the first female president), though with very limited powers. The president is elected by direct, popular vote under the [[two-round system]] for a five-year term. Most [[executive (government)|executive]] power lies with the [[head of government]], the prime minister (currently [[Igor Matovič]]), who is usually the leader of the winning party and who needs to form a majority coalition in the parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president. The remainder of the cabinet is appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.

Slovakia's highest [[legislature|legislative]] body is the 150-seat [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Council of the Slovak Republic]] (''Národná rada Slovenskej republiky''). Delegates are elected for a four-year term on the basis of [[proportional representation]].

Slovakia's highest [[judiciary|judicial body]] is the [[Constitutional Court of Slovakia]] (''Ústavný súd''), which rules on constitutional issues. The 13&nbsp;members of this court are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by parliament.

The [[Constitution of Slovakia|Constitution of the Slovak Republic]] was ratified 1 September 1992, and became effective 1 January 1993. It was amended in September 1998 to allow [[direct election]] of the president and again in February 2001 due to EU admission requirements. The [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The [[code (law)|legal code]] was modified to comply with the obligations of [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) and to expunge the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[Law|legal theory]]. Slovakia accepts the compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction with reservations.

=== Human rights ===
[[United States Department of State|The US State Department]] in 2017 reported:

<blockquote>The government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas. The most significant human rights issues included incidents of interference with privacy; corruption; widespread discrimination against Roma minority; and security force violence against ethnic and racial minorities government actions and rhetoric did little to discourage. The government investigated reports of abuses by members of the security forces and other government institutions, although some observers questioned the thoroughness of these investigations. Some officials engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. Two former ministers were convicted of corruption during the year.<ref>U.S. Dept. of State, [https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2017 – Slovakia" 27 September 2018]</ref></blockquote>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Regions of Slovakia|Districts of Slovakia|List of municipalities and towns in Slovakia}}
[[File:Bratislava Cityscape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bratislava]], capital and largest city of Slovakia]]
Slovakia is divided into 8 ''[[kraj]]e'' (singular—''kraj'', usually translated as "region"), each of which is named after its principal city. Regions have enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy since 2002. Their [[Self-governance|self-governing]] bodies are referred to as Self-governing (or autonomous) Regions (sg. ''samosprávny kraj'', pl. ''samosprávne kraje'') or Upper-Tier Territorial Units (sg. ''vyšší územný celok'', pl. ''vyššie územné celky'', abbr. VÚC).

The ''kraje'' are subdivided into many ''[[okres]]y'' (sg. ''okres'', usually translated as districts). Slovakia currently has 79&nbsp;districts.

The ''okresy'' are further divided into ''[[List of municipalities and towns in Slovakia|obce]]'' (sg. ''obec'', usually translated as "municipality"). There are currently 2,890 municipalities.

In terms of economics and [[unemployment]] rate, the western regions are richer than eastern regions. Bratislava is the third-richest region of the [[European Union]] by GDP (PPP) per capita (after [[Hamburg]] and [[Luxembourg City]]); GDP at purchasing power parity is about three times higher than in other Slovak regions.<ref name="finweb.hnonline.sk">{{cite web|url=https://finweb.hnonline.sk/ekonomika/919558-bratislava-je-treti-najbohatsi-region-unie|title=Bratislava je tretí najbohatší región únie.

The [[OECD]] in 2017 reported:

<blockquote>The Slovak Republic continues exhibiting robust economic performance, with strong growth backed by a sound financial sector, low public debt and high international competitiveness drawing on large inward investment.<ref>oecd.org, [http://www.oecd.org/slovakia/economic-survey-slovak-republic.htm "Economic Survey of the Slovak Republic 2017" 3 July 2017]</ref></blockquote>

In 2020, Slovakia was ranked by the [[International Monetary Fund]] as the 38th [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|richest country in the world]] (out of 187 countries), with purchasing power parity per capita GDP of $38,321. The country used to be dubbed the "[[Tatra Tiger]]". Slovakia successfully transformed from a centrally [[planned economy]] to a market-driven economy. Major [[privatisation]]s are completed, the banking sector is almost completely in private hands, and foreign investment has risen.

The Slovak economy is one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe and [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|3rd-fastest]] in [[eurozone]] (2017). In 2007, 2008 and 2010 (with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth of 10.5%, 6% and 4%, retrospectively). In 2016, more than 86% of Slovak exports went to [[European Union]], and more than 50% of Slovak imports came from other European Union member states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Intra-EU_trade_in_goods_-_recent_trends|title=Intra-EU trade in goods - recent trends}}</ref>

The Slovak government encourages foreign investment since it is one of the driving forces of the economy. Slovakia is an attractive country for [[Investment|foreign investors]] mainly because of its low wages, low tax rates, well educated [[labor force|labour force]], favourable geographic location in the heart of Central Europe, strong political stability and good international relations reinforced by the country's accession to the European Union. Some regions, mostly at the east of Slovakia have failed to attract major investment, which has aggravated regional disparities in many economic and social areas. [[Foreign direct investment]] inflow grew more than 600% from 2000 and cumulatively reached an all-time high of $17.3&nbsp;billion in 2006, or around $22,000 per capita by the end of 2008.

Slovakia ranks 45th out of 190 economies in terms of ease of doing business, according to the [[Ease of doing business index|2020 World Bank Doing Business Report]] and 57th out of the 63 countries in terms of competitive economy, according to the [[World Competitiveness Yearbook|2020 World Competitiveness Yearbook Report]].

=== Energy ===
[[File:Mochovce - chladice veže.JPG|thumb|left|Nuclear Power Plant [[Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant|Mochovce]]]]

In 2012, Slovakia produced a total of 28,393 [[GWh]] of [[electricity]] while at the same time consumed 28 786 GWh. The slightly higher level of consumption than the capacity of production (- 393 GWh) meant the country was not self-sufficient in energy sourcing. Slovakia imported electricity mainly from the [[Czech Republic]] (9,961 GWh—73.6% of total import) and exported mainly to [[Hungary]] (10,231 GWh—78.2% of total export).

[[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] accounts for 53.8% of total electricity production in Slovakia, followed by 18.1% of [[Thermal power station|thermal power]] energy, 15.1% by [[hydro power]] energy, 2% by [[solar energy]], 9.6% by other sources and the rest 1.4% is imported.<ref>{{cite web|work=Electricity consumption / production in Slovakia in 2012|url=http://www.sepsas.sk/seps/dokumenty/RocenkySed/Rocenka_SED_2012.pdf|title=National Control Centre of Slovakia|year=2013|accessdate=3 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021455/http://www.sepsas.sk/seps/dokumenty/RocenkySed/Rocenka_SED_2012.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2013}}</ref>

The two nuclear power-plants in Slovakia are in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]] and [[Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant|Mochovce]], each of them containing two operating reactors. Before the accession of Slovakia to the EU in 2004, the government agreed to turn-off the V1 block of [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice power-plant]], built-in 1978. After deactivating the last of the two reactors of the V1 block in 2008, Slovakia stopped being self-dependent in energy production.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Currently there is another block (V2) with two active reactors in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]]. It is scheduled for decommissioning in 2025. Two new reactors are under construction in Mochovce plant. The nuclear power production in Slovakia occasionally draws the attention of [[Austria]]n green-energy activists who organise protests and block the borders between the two countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Slovakia contains many castles, most of which are in ruins. The best known castles include [[Bojnice Castle]] (often used as a filming location), [[Spiš Castle]], (on the UNESCO list), [[Orava Castle]], [[Bratislava Castle]], and the ruins of [[Devín Castle]]. [[Čachtice Castle]] was once the home of the world's most prolific female serial killer, the 'Bloody Lady', [[Elizabeth Báthory]].
[[File:Bardejov10Slovakia6.JPG|thumb|left|The centre of [[Bardejov]] – a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]

Slovakia's position in Europe and the country's past (part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Habsburg]] monarchy and [[Czechoslovakia]]) made many cities and towns similar to the cities in the [[Czech Republic]] (such as [[Prague]]), [[Austria]] (such as [[Salzburg]]) or [[Hungary]] (such as [[Budapest]]). A historical centre with at least one square has been preserved in many towns. Large historical centers can be found in [[Bratislava]], [[Trenčín]], [[Košice]], [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Levoča]], and [[Trnava]]. Historical centres have been going through a restoration in recent years.

Historical churches can be found in virtually every village and town in Slovakia. Most of them are built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, but there are also many examples of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]], for example [[Banská Bystrica]], Bardejov and [[Spišská Kapitula]]. The [[Basilica of St. James, Levoča|Basilica of St. James]] in Levoča with the tallest wood-carved altar in the world and the Church of the Holy Spirit in [[Žehra]] with medieval [[fresco]]s are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The [[St. Martin's Concathedral]] in [[Bratislava]] served as the [[coronation]] church for the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest sacral buildings in Slovakia stem from the [[Great Moravia]]n period in the 9th century.
[[File:Jasná Ski Resort - gondola lift Kosodrevina - Chopok (4).jpg|thumb|Cable cars at [[Jasná]] in the Tatra Mountains.]]

Very precious structures are the complete wooden churches of northern and northern-eastern Slovakia. Most were built from the 15th century onwards by [[Catholic]]s, [[Lutheran]]s and members of [[Eastern Christianity|eastern-rite]] churches.

Tourism in [[Slovak Republic]] is one of the main sectors of the economy, but not using its whole capacity. It is based on internal tourism, where Slovaks spend holidays within the country. Major areas are: [[Bratislava]] and [[Vysoké Tatry]]. To other regions belong: [[Pieniny]] National Park, Malá Fatra NP, and [[Nízke Tatry]] NP.

;Castles and châteaux
There are many castles located throughout the country. To the biggest and the most beautiful ones belong: [[Spiš castle]], Stará Ľubovňa castle, [[Kežmarok]] castle, Orava castle, [[Trenčín]] castle, [[Bratislava castle]], and Devín castle. To the castle ruins belong Šariš castle, Gýmeš castle, Považský hrad (castle), and [[Strečno castle]], where they filmed Braveheart movie.

;Caves
Caves opened for public are mainly located in Northern Slovakia. In the south-west of the country only Jaskyňa Driny is opened to the public. The most popular ones are: [[Dobšinsá Ice Cave]], Demänovská ľadová cave, Demänovská jaskyňa slobody, Belianska cave, and Domica cave. To the other caves which are opened belong Ochtinská aragonitová cave, Gombasecká cave, and Jasovská cave.

;Spa resorts
There are many spas throughout the whole country. The biggest and the most favorite center is [[Piešťany spa]], where a big portion of visitors come from [[The Gulf countries]], i.e. [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar]], Kuwait, and [[Bahrain]]. To the other famous spas belong: Bardejovské kúpele, Trenčianske Teplice spa, Turčianske Teplice spa, and Spa Rajecké Teplice. There are many smaller ones: Kúpele Štós, Kúpele Číž, Kúpele Dudince, Kováčová, Kúpele Nimnica, Kúpele Smrdáky, Kúpele Lúčky, and Kúpele Vyšné Ružbachy with treatments against schizophrenia.

Typical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, [[črpák]]s (wooden pitchers), [[fujara]]s (a [[folk instrument]] on the UNESCO list) and [[valaška]]s (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from [[husk|corn husks]] and wire, notably human figures. Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organisation ÚĽUV (''Ústredie ľudovej umeleckej výroby''—Centre of [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Production). ''Dielo'' shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.

Prices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighbouring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower.

=== Science ===
The [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] has been the most important scientific and research institution in the country since 1953. Slovaks have made notable scientific and technical contributions during history. Slovakia is currently in the negotiation process of becoming a member of the [[European Space Agency]]. Observer status was granted in 2010, when Slovakia signed the General Agreement on Cooperation<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://slovak.space/sr-a-vesmir/spolupraca-s-esa/|title=Spolupráca s ESA - Slovak Space Portal|work=Slovak Space Portal|access-date=5 November 2017|language=sk-SK}}</ref> in which information about ongoing education programmes was shared and Slovakia was invited to various negotiations of the ESA. In 2015, Slovakia signed the European Cooperating State Agreement based on which Slovakia committed to the finance entrance programme named PECS (Plan for the European Cooperating States) which serves as preparation for full membership. Slovak research and development organizations can apply for funding of projects regarding space technologies advancement. Full membership of Slovakia in the ESA is expected in 2020 after signing the ESA Convention. Slovakia will be obliged to set state budget inclusive ESA funding.

Education in Slovakia is compulsory from age 6 to 16. The education system consists of elementary school which is divided into two parts, the first grade (age 6–10) and the second grade (age 10–15) which is finished by taking nationwide testing called Monitor, from Slovak language and math. Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present in the first grade of elementary school.

After finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.

After finishing high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919. Although it's not the first university ever established on Slovak territory, it's the oldest university that is still running. Most universities in Slovakia are public funded, where anyone can apply. Every citizen has a right to free education in public schools.

Slovakia has several privately funded universities, however public universities consistently score better in the ranking than their private counterparts. Universities have different criteria for accepting students. Anyone can apply to any number of universities.

=== Folk tradition ===
{{See also|Music of Slovakia}}
[[File:Vlkolinec 02.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden folk architecture can be seen in the well-preserved village of [[Vlkolínec]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]
[[Folk tradition]] has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, ''"[[Nad Tatrou sa blýska]]"'', which is based on a melody from ''"[[Kopala studienku]]"'' folk song.

The manifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the "''Východná''" Folklore Festival. It is the oldest and largest nationwide festival with international participation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festivalvychodna.sk/|title=Folklórny festival Východná|first=Národné osvetové|last=centrum|website=Folklórny festival Východná}}</ref> which takes place in [[Východná]] annually. Slovakia is usually represented by many groups but mainly by SĽUK (''Slovenský ľudový umelecký kolektív—Slovak folk art collective''). SĽUK is the largest Slovak folk art group, trying to preserve the folklore tradition.

An example of wooden folk architecture in Slovakia can be seen in the well-preserved village of [[Vlkolínec]] which has been the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/622/|title=Vlkolínec|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref> The [[Prešov Region]] preserves the world's most remarkable folk wooden churches.

The best known Slovak hero, found in many folk [[mythologies]], is [[Juraj Jánošík]] (1688–1713) (the Slovak equivalent of [[Robin Hood]]). The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. Jánošík's life was depicted in a list of literary works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a film ''Jánošík'' directed by [[Martin Frič]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jánošík movie on Czechoslovak Film Database|year=1935|url=http://www.csfd.cz/film/3113-janosik/}}</ref>

The [[Bratislava City Gallery]], founded in 1961 is the second biggest Slovak gallery of its kind. It stores about 35,000 pieces of Slovak international art and offers permanent displays in [[Johann Pálffy Palace|Pálffy Palace]] and [[Mirbach Palace]], located in the Old Town. Danubiana Art Museum, one of the youngest art museums in Europe, is situated near [[Čunovo]] waterworks (part of [[Gabčíkovo - Nagymaros Dams|Gabčíkovo Waterworks]]). Other major galleries include: [[Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art]] (Warhol's parents were from [[Miková]]), [[East Slovak Gallery]], [[Ernest Zmeták Art Gallery]], [[Zvolen Castle]].

For a list of notable Slovak writers and poets, see [[Lists of Slovak authors|List of Slovak authors]].

Christian topics include poem [[Proglas]] as a foreword to the four [[Gospel]]s, partial translations of the Bible into [[Old Church Slavonic]], ''Zakon sudnyj ljudem''.

[[Medieval literature]], in the period from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was written in [[Latin]], Czech and Slovakised Czech. Lyric (prayers, songs and formulas) was still controlled by the Church, while epic was concentrated on legends. Authors from this period include [[Johannes de Thurocz]], author of the [[Chronica Hungarorum]] and Maurus, both of them Hungarians.<ref name=Phillips>{{cite book |title=The dictionary of biographical reference: containing one hundred thousand names, together with a classed index of the biographical literature of Europe and America|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionarybiogr00philgoog|last=Lawrence Barnett Phillips |authorlink=|year=1871 |publisher=S. Low, Son, & Marston |location=|isbn=|page=1020}}</ref> The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.

Two leading persons codified the Slovak language. The first was [[Anton Bernolák]] whose concept was based on the western Slovak [[dialect]] in 1787. It was the codification of the first-ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was [[Ľudovít Štúr]], whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843.

Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik|Pavol Jozef Šafárik]], [[Matthias Bel|Matej Bel]], [[Ján Kollár]], and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] and [[Alexander Dubček]].

[[Sheep|Lamb]] and [[goat]] are eaten but are not widely popular.

The traditional Slovak meals are [[bryndzové halušky]], {{ill|bryndzové pirohy|it}} and other meals with potato dough and [[bryndza]]. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzové halušky especially is considered a national dish, and is very commonly found on the menu of traditional Slovak restaurants.

A typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup ("kapustnica"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called "krvavnica", made from any parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal.

Wine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or rosé (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}

The most recent success was a silver medal at the [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8,280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Before 2012, the Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] participated in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |title=World of difference for KHL? |publisher=iihf.com |date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082543/http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>

Slovakia hosted the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal and [[2019 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] also won the gold medal. Both competitions took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Košice]].

;Football
[[File:Tehelne pole.jpg|thumb|right|Football stadium [[Tehelné pole]] in Bratislava. Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia.]]
Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3–2 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[Ján Kozák (footballer, born 1954)|Ján Kozák]]. This helped the team reach its best-ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].

In club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Košice]] in [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League|1997–98]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2005–06 season]], and [[MŠK Žilina]] in [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|2010–11]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005–06 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.
