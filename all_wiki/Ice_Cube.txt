Ice Cube's rap audience never regained the prominence of his first three albums.<ref name=":5" /> Yet amid his many features and brief collaborations, September 2007 brought ''[[In the Movies]]'', a compilation album of Ice Cube songs on soundtracks.<ref>Jeffries, David.

=== C.I.A. (circa 1986) ===
With friend [[Sir Jinx]], Ice Cube formed the rap group [[C.I.A. (group)|C.I.A.]], and performed at parties hosted by [[Dr. Dre]]. Since 1984, Dre was a member of a popular DJ crew, the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]], which by 1985 was also performing and recording electro rap. Dre had Cube help write the Wreckin Cru's hit song "Cabbage Patch." Dre also joined Cube on a side project, a duo called Stereo Crew, which made a 12-inch record, "She's a Skag," released on [[Epic Records]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Johson|first=Bill|date=May 31, 2010|title=Ice Cube Reminisces On His Very First Gig And Single|work=The Urban Daily|url=http://theurbandaily.com/music/first-things-first-music/billjohnson/ice-cube-reminisces-on-his-very-first-gig-and-single/|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

In 1987, C.I.A. released the [[Dr. Dre]]-produced single "[[My Posse]]." Meanwhile, the Wreckin' Cru's home base was the Eve After Dark nightclub, about a quarter of a mile outside of the city Compton in Los Angeles county. While Dre was on the turntable, Ice Cube would rap, often parodying other artists' songs. In one instance, Cube's rendition was "My Penis," parodying Run-DMC's "[[My Adidas]]."<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jake|title=Dr. Dre in the Studio: From Compton, Death Row, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, the Game, and Mad Money : the Life, Times, and Aftermath of the Notorious Record Producer, Dr. Dre|date=2006|publisher=Amber Books Publishing|isbn=9780976773559|location=London|page=6}}</ref> In 2015, the nightclub's co-owner and Wreckin' leader [[Alonzo Williams]] would recall feeling his reputation damaged by this and asking it not to be repeated.<ref name="Lonzo">[http://allhiphop.com/2015/08/24/world-class-wreckin-crus-lonzo-williams-dr-dre-gay-rumors-straight-outta-compton/ World Class Wreckin’ Cru Founder Alonzo Williams Addresses Dr. Dre Gay Rumors & ‘Straight Outta Compton’], Allhiphop.com, August 24, 2015</ref>

At 16, Cube sold his first song to Eric Wright, soon dubbed [[Eazy-E]], who was forming [[Ruthless Records]] and the musical team [[N.W.A]], based in [[Compton, California]].<ref name="Jessie Carney Smith 2006" /> Himself from [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]], Cube would be N.W.A's only core member not born in Compton.

Upon the success of the song "[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]]"—written by Cube, produced by Dre, and rapped by Eazy-E, helping establish gangsta rap in California—Eazy focused on developing N.W.A,<ref>Loren Kajikawa, ''Sounding Race in Rap Songs'' (Oakland: [[University of California Press]], 2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-x9BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA93&dq=Boyz+Straight p 93].</ref> which soon gained [[MC Ren]]. Cube wrote some of Dre's and nearly all of Eazy's lyrics on N.W.A's official debut album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in August 1988.<ref name=":2" /> Yet by late 1989, Cube questioned his compensation and N.W.A's management by [[Jerry Heller]].<ref name="Ice Cube 2002">''Ice Cube: Attitude'' (McIver, 2002) {{ISBN|1-86074-428-1}}</ref>

Cube had also written most of Eazy-E's debut album ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]''. He had received a total pay of $32,000, and the contract that Heller presented in 1989 did not confirm that he was officially an N.W.A member.<ref name="Attitude70">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref> After leaving the group and its label, Cube sued Heller, and the lawsuit was later settled out of court.<ref name="Attitude70"/> In response, N.W.A members attacked Cube on the 1990 EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on N.W.A's next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]'', in 1991.<ref name=":122" />

===Cube solo (1990–)===

==== ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'' (1990) ====
In early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with iconic rap group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team, [[the Bomb Squad]]. Arriving in May 1990, it was an instant hit, further swelling rap's mainstream integration. Controversial nonetheless, it drew accusations of misogyny and racism. The album introduces Ice Cube's affirmation of black nationalism and ideology of black struggle.

Cube appointed [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]], a female rapper and guest on the album, to the head his record label, and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. Also in 1990, Cube followed up with an [[Extended Play|EP]]—''[[Kill At Will]]''—critically acclaimed, and rap's first EP certified [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|title=Ice Cube – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p48/biography|pure_url=yes}}|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|year=2007|website=Allmusic|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

The album was split into two themes: the Death Side, "a vision of where we are today," and the Life Side, "a vision of where we need to go."

==== ''The Predator'' (1992) ====
Cube's third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', arrived in November 1992. Referring to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], the "[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]" sing opens, "April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel." ''The Predator'' was the first album ever to debut at No. 1 on both the R&B/hip-hop and pop charts. Singles include "[[It Was a Good Day]]" and "[[Check Yo Self]]," songs having a "two-part" music video. Generally drawing critical praise, the album is his most successful commercially, over three million copies sold in the US. After this album, Cube's rap audience severely diminished.<ref name=":5" />

==== ''Lethal Injection'' (1993) ====
Cube's fourth album, ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', came out in late 1993. Here, Cube borrows from the [[G-Funk]] sound then led by Dr. Dre's album ''[[The Chronic]]'', itself released in December 1992. Although not received well by critics, the album brought successful singles, including "[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]", "[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]", "[[You Know How We Do It]]," and "What Can I Do?" After this album, Ice Cube effectively lost his rap audience.<ref name=":5" />

==== ''War & Peace Vol. 1 & 2'' (1998 & 2000) ====

These albums feature the [[Westside Connection]] and a reunion with his old N.W.A members Dr. Dre and MC Ren.

=== Westside Connection (1996–2007) ===
In 1996, Ice Cube formed with rappers [[Mack 10]] and [[WC (rapper)|WC]] a trio. Feeling neglected by East Coast media, a [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry|longstanding issue in rap's bicoastal rivalry]], the group aimed to reinforce West pride and resonate with the undervalued.

The Westside Connection's first album, ''[[Bow Down]]'', has tracks like "Bow Down" and "Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round" that reflect the group's objectives. The album was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by year's end.

Released in 2003, the group's second album, ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'', fared well critically, but saw lesser sales. "Gangsta Nation," featuring [[Nate Dogg]], the only single released, was a radio hit.

After a rift between Cube and Mack 10 about Cube's film work minimizing the group's touring, the Westwide Connection disbanded.

=== Features & collaborations (1992–) ===
Amid Cube's numerous features on other artists' songs,<ref>In 1992, Cube assisted on [[Del the Funky Homosapien]]'s [[I Wish My Brother George Was Here|debut album]] and on [[Da Lench Mob]]'s [[Guerillas in tha Mist|debut album]], which Cube produced, and featured on the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo song "[[Live and Let Die (album)|Two to the Head]]."

In 1994, Cube teamed with onetime N.W.A groupmate [[Dr. Dre]], who was then leading rap's [[G-funk]] subgenre, for the first time since Cube had left the group, and which had disbanded upon Dre's 1991 departure. The result was the Cube and Dre song "[[Natural Born Killaz]]," on the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, released by Dre's then new label, [[Death Row Records]]. In 2004, Cube featured on the song "[[Real Nigga Roll Call]]" by [[Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz]], then the leaders of rap's [[crunk]] subgenre.
