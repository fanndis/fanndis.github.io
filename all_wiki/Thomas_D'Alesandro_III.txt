Just four months after D'Alesandro's inauguration, the [[Baltimore riot of 1968]] erupted after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], and Maryland Governor [[Spiro Agnew]] called National Guard troops in to control the situation.<ref>{{Cite interview|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89427135|title=Former Baltimore Mayor Looks Back|website=NPR|language=en|access-date=May 21, 2019|interviewer=Michel Martin|last1=D'Alesandro III|first1=Thomas|date=April 7, 2008}}</ref> 

D'Alesandro, who took office vowing to "root out every cause or vestige of discrimination", remained proud throughout his life of his progressive record on civil rights.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Justine |last=Coleman |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/466644-thomas-dalesandro-iii-brother-of-nancy-pelosi-dies-at-90 |title=Thomas D'Alesandro III, brother of Nancy Pelosi, dies at 90 |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=October 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name="vision">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4t8yDV_rMc&feature=youtu.be&t=318 |title=What do you think of Trump's comments on Baltimore and what is your vision to improve cities like it? |date=December 5, 2019 |website=CNN |language=en-US |access-date=July 2, 2020}}</ref> As mayor, he appointed multiple African-Americans to his administration, some of them, such as George Russell Jr., the city solicitor and member of the Board of Estimates, the first African Americans to hold those positions.<ref name=BSobit />

In 1971, D'Alesandro stepped down as mayor and retired from politics and went into private law practice.<ref name=WPobit /><ref name=NYTobit /> Years later, D'Alesandro insisted that the riots were not the reason that he walked away from politics.<ref name="NotRiot" /> He said that the reason was simply that he had five children and his mayoral salary was not sufficient for him to support his family.<ref name="NotRiot" />

In 1998, Jack Eddinger, D'Alesandro's former press secretary, wrote in ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' that "Tommy D'Alesandro was Baltimore's first modern mayor. He not only presided over its emergence as a Renaissance City that it is today, but he gave it unmatched leadership. Much of what other mayors get credit for began in those tumultuous four years, from urban design and labor law reform to streamlined governmental administration and the flowering of the vital alliance between the city and the Greater Baltimore Committee".<ref>{{cite news |first=John W. |last=Eddinger |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1998-04-19-1998109029-story.html |title=Tommy D'Alesandro was Baltimore's first modern mayor |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=April 19, 1998}}</ref>

==Death==
D'Alesandro died after complications from a [[stroke]] at his home in North Baltimore on October 20, 2019, at the age of 90.<ref name=BSobit />

His sister [[Nancy Pelosi]] said upon his death: "Tommy dedicated his life to our city. A champion of civil rights, he worked tirelessly for all who called Baltimore home. Tommy was a leader of dignity, compassion and extraordinary courage, whose presence radiated hope upon our city during times of struggle and conflict".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/102019|title=Pelosi Statement on the Passing of Thomas D'Alesandro III |publisher=Office of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] |date=October 20, 2019}}</ref> At a CNN Town Hall in December 2019, Pelosi also noted that "his vision was to say that I want to rid our society of every vestige of discrimination and that was his call to action."<ref name="vision" />
