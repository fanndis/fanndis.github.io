The '''Monumental Axis''' ({{lang-pt|Eixo Monumental}}) is a central [[Street name|avenue]] in [[Brasília]]'s city design.

The avenue begins on the [[National Congress of Brazil]] building and is considered part of the [[DF-002]] road. Its first section is known as "Ministries Esplanade" ("Esplanada dos Ministérios"), as it is surrounded by ministries buildings.  Many important [[government]] buildings, [[monument]]s and [[memorial]]s are located on the Monumental Axis.

A common [[urban legend]] persists that the Monumental Axis is the widest road in the world, where "[100 to 160] cars can drive side by side".  This is untrue, as the road consists of two avenues with six lanes on either side; a total of twelve lanes. However, the street has been featured in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as having the widest [[central reservation]] of a [[dual carriageway]] in the world.

On April 21, 2008, a year before they formally broke up, the Mexican pop group [[RBD]] performed a free concert to a crowd of 500,000 on the Monumental Axis<ref>{{cite web|title=Show RBD no Brasil|url=http://www.tudoemfoco.com.br/show-rbd-no-brasil.html|website=tudoemfoco.com.br|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> during [[Empezar Desde Cero Tour 2008]]. The show was to celebrate the 48th Anniversary of the founding of [[Brasilia]]. It was recorded and released on DVD with the title ''[[Live in Brasilia]]''. The crowd in attendance was the largest for which the group had performed.
