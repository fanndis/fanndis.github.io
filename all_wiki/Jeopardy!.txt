'''''Jeopardy!''''' is an American television game show created by [[Merv Griffin]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The version airing as of 2020, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.

Both NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978–1979 season. The daily syndicated version featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host from 1984 until his death in 2020, although episodes are scheduled to air until January 2021. A series of interim hosts from the production staff will be used starting with the November 30, 2020 taping, with consulting producer [[Ken Jennings]] being named on November 23, 2020, as the first interim host.<ref name="interim">{{cite web|url=https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/jeopardy-resumes-ken-jennings-interim-host/507-f415b628-6b65-4b8a-b0bf-eea176803acc|title=Ken Jennings to host first 'Jeopardy!' episodes airing in January|work=WUSA-TV|date=November 23, 2020|access-date=November 23, 2020}}</ref> [[Johnny Gilbert]] has been the announcer since 1984.

==Gameplay==
Three contestants each take their place behind a lectern, with the returning champion occupying the leftmost lectern (from the viewer's perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host regularly reminds contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.

All clues in the show are presented as "answers", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} For example, if a contestant were to select "Presidents for $200", the resulting clue could be "This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree", to which the correct response is "Who is/was [[George Washington]]?" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of "who is/are" for people or "what is/are" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the surname is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. For example, in a "Presidents" category, one-word responses such as "Adams", "Harrison", "Johnson", "Roosevelt" or "Bush" are typically deemed too ambiguous; however, other than in Final Jeopardy!, whenever a surname is deemed too ambiguous the contestant is typically allowed to give a more specific response.

===First two rounds===
[[File:Jeopardy!_game_board_US.svg|thumb|300px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round (in the second round, the values are doubled). Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]

The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25 to $125. In the two pilots that led to the 1984 series, the first kept the $25–$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50–$250. The 1984 series' first-round originally ranged from $100 to $500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} and was doubled to $200–$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>

The Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board (for games when there is no returning champion, the starting player is chosen by a random draw). The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to respond to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. Excessively mispronounced responses are usually judged incorrect, particularly if they are missing syllables, contain excessive syllables, or (when relevant) pronounced in the singular form when the only correct form is plural (or vice versa). If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response, and the player who selected the previous clue chooses the next clue.<ref name="Gameplay rules">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Contestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the "Forrest Bounce", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They’re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you’d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April–June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book – here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

From the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the 1984 syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59–60}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer sounded when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was "distracting to the viewers" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59–60}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.

The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name="Gameplay rules"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.

A "Daily Double" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[Daily double|horse-racing term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2–3}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as "Audio Daily Doubles" and "Video Daily Doubles" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a "true Daily Double") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name="Gameplay rules"/><ref name="5-rules">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy! Contestant Should Know|url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/5-rules-every-contestant-should-know|website=Jeopardy! Official Site|publisher=Sony Pictures Digital and Jeopardy Productions|accessdate=October 12, 2016|date=October 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012151913/https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/5-rules-every-contestant-should-know|archive-date=October 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The contestant is given the exclusive right to answer the clue but must do so; a correct response adds the value of the wager to the contestant's score, while an incorrect response deducts it. Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name="Gameplay rules"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host reminds contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name="5-rules" />

If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If an error that may have affected the result is not discovered until after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}

Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

===Final Jeopardy!===
The Final Jeopardy! round features a single clue. At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[#Theme music|"Think!" music]] plays in the background. If either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and respond.

In the rare occurrences where only one contestant remains, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context; otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score. A miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name="Gameplay rules"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>

The contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third receives the third-place prize.

The strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name="gilbert-hatcher">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!'' College Champion Keith Williams, the leader usually wagers such that he or she will have a dollar more than twice the second place contestant's score, guaranteeing a win with a correct response.<ref name="williams-on-wagering">{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Keith|title=Keith Williams on Wagering|url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/wagering-keith-williams|website=Jeopardy! official website|publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=July 16, 2017|date=September 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625160432/https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/wagering-keith-williams|archive-date=June 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Writing about ''Jeopardy!'' wagering in the 1990s, Gilbert and Hatcher said that "most players wager aggressively.”<ref name="gilbert-hatcher" />{{rp|269}}

===Winnings===
The top scorer in each game is paid their winnings in cash and returns to play in the next match. In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222–1224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}

During Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who stopped participating in the game, or avoided wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. This also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score is paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants. ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]].){{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}

===Returning champions===
The winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=''Jeopardy!''

In tournament play, an additional high scoring non-winner advances to the next round (but all three players with a zero score in that game are eligible for that position should the score for that non-winner be zero; all tie-breaker rules apply).

A winner unable to return as champion because of a change in personal circumstances{{snd}}for example, illness or a job offer{{snd}}may be allowed to appear as a co-champion in a later episode.<ref>{{cite episode|title = Show No. 5611 (Michele Lee Amundsen vs. Lori Karman vs. Matt Kohlstedt)|series = Jeopardy!|date=January 19, 2009|network=Syndicated}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Show No. 5669 (Jeff Mangum vs. Priscilla Ball vs. Rick Robbins)|series=Jeopardy!|date=April 9, 2009|network=Syndicated}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title = Show No. 7196 (Shoshana Gordon Ginsburg vs. Jay O'Brien vs. Liz Quesnelle)|series = Jeopardy!|date=December 21, 2015|network=Syndicated}}</ref>

The two challengers participate in a backstage draw to determine lectern positions. In all situations with three new contestants (now a rare occurrence in regular games since the five-episode limit on returning champions was removed, but still routine for first-round games in unseeded tournaments), the draw also determines who takes the champion's position and select first to start the game. In tournament play, the player scoring the highest in the preceding round is given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.

===Variations for tournament play===
Tournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games. Since the removal of the five-game limit in regular gameplay, in the unlikely case of a tie in total winnings between two Tournament of Champions players the player who won the most games receives the higher seed. If still tied, seeding is determined by comparing the tied players' aggregate Double Jeopardy! and (if still tied) Jeopardy! round scores.

The winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners ("wild cards"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1–5 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6–9. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}

To prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are "completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}

If there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances is based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.

If two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.

If none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name="Teen Tournament Semifinal">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name="Teen Tournament Semifinal"/>

In the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.

==Conception and development==
In a 1963 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:
{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York City from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: "5,280"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address. I loved the idea, went straight to [[NBC]] with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show.<ref name="lowry">{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Cynthia|title=Merv Griffin: Question and Answer Man|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[Pasadena Star-News|Independent Star-News]]|date = March 29, 1963}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/05/01/119810/television-for-1000-the-worlds-toughest-game-show-what-is-jeopardy- |title=What Is Jeopardy!'? |last1=Lidz |first1=Franz |date=May 1, 1989 |website=Sports Illustrated |access-date=October 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423161445/http://www.si.com/vault/1989/05/01/119810/television-for-1000-the-worlds-toughest-game-show-what-is-jeopardy- |archive-date=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
}}

Griffin's first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each, but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera, he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each, with five clues in each of six categories.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=2}} He originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing (e.g., only accepting "Who is&nbsp;..." for a person), but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down, he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=4}} Griffin discarded his initial title for the show, ''What's the Question?'', when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, "It doesn't have enough [[wikt:jeopardy|jeopardies]]."{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=2}}{{Sfn|Griffin|Bender|2003|p=71}}

The format of giving contestants the answers and requiring the questions had previously been used by the [[Gil Fates]]-hosted program ''[[CBS Television Quiz]]'', which aired from July 1941 until May 1942.{{Sfn|Abelman|1998|p=270}}

The first three versions of the show were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer for the original NBC version and weekly syndicated version,{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} but when NBC's revival ''The All-New Jeopardy!'' launched in 1978, Pardo's announcing duties were taken over by [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]].{{Sfn|Terrace|1985|p=214}}

[[Alex Trebek]] served as host of the daily syndicated version from its premiere in 1984 until 2020,{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=14}} except when he switched places with ''Wheel of Fortune'' host [[Pat Sajak]] as an [[April Fool's joke]] on the episode aired April 1, 1997.<ref>{{ Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Observances, Holidays, and Celebrations | publisher=MobileReference | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-60501-177-6 }}</ref>

The announcer introduces the challengers followed by the returning champion, stating the champion's total winnings thus far. The announcer then introduces the host. Throughout the show, the announcer provides voice-overs during lead-ins to and exits from a commercial break. Additional duties include announcing any consolation prizes offered and fee plugs for sponsors of the show. Before taping, the announcer handles warm-up duties, exciting the crowd before the commencement of taping. In the daily syndicated version's first pilot, from 1983, [[Jay Stewart]] served as the show's announcer, but [[Johnny Gilbert]] took over the role when that version was picked up as a series and has held it since then, although Sarah Whitcomb Foss of the show's Clue Crew has replaced him in selected taping sessions in recent years, as Gilbert has reduced his schedule because of his age.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=14}} In episodes where Foss is the in-studio announcer, Gilbert's announcing of the contestants and host are added in post-production and is heard in the television broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Podplesky |first1=Azaria |title=Nine Mile Falls' Staci Huffman to appear on 'Jeopardy!' on Friday |url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/dec/06/nine-mile-falls-staci-huffman-to-appear-on-jeopard/ |website=(Spokane, WA) Spokesman-Review |publisher=Spokesman-Review |accessdate=January 10, 2020 |ref=Spokane}}</ref>

On a [[Fox News]] program in July 2018, Trebek said the odds of his retirement in 2020 were 50/50 "and a little less". He added that he might continue if he's "not making too many mistakes" but would make an "intelligent decision" as to when he should give up the emcee role.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alex Trebek says there's a 50/50 chance he'll retire from 'Jeopardy' |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/alex-trebek-jeopardy-retiring-1.20222110 |work= Newsday/AP |date=July 31, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180801064117/https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/alex-trebek-jeopardy-retiring-1.20222110 |archive-date= August 1, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In November 2018, it was announced that he had renewed his contract as host through 2022,<ref>{{cite web |title= Alex Trebek Will Host 'Jeopardy' through 2022 |url= https://people.com/tv/alex-trebek-renews-jeopardy-contract/ |website= People |accessdate= December 5, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181206053223/https://people.com/tv/alex-trebek-renews-jeopardy-contract/ |archive-date= December 6, 2018 |url-status= live }}</ref> stating in January 2019 that the show's work schedule, consisting of 46 taping sessions each year, was still manageable for a man of his age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/jeopardy-alex-trebek-pancreatic-cancer-1.5045984|title='I'm going to fight this': Jeopardy host Alex Trebek announces Stage 4 cancer|agency=Associated Press|date=March 6, 2019|accessdate=March 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307004749/https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/jeopardy-alex-trebek-pancreatic-cancer-1.5045984|archive-date=March 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On March 6, 2019, Trebek announced he had been diagnosed with [[Cancer staging|stage IV]] [[pancreatic cancer]] (the same one that claimed Fleming's life on April 25, 1995). In a prepared video statement announcing his diagnosis, Trebek noted that his prognosis was poor but that he would aggressively fight the cancer in hopes of beating the odds and would continue hosting ''Jeopardy!'' for as long as he was able, joking that his contract obligated him to do so for three more years regardless of health.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeopardy host Alex Trebek says he has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer'|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5028385/jeopardy-alex-trebek-pancreatic/|work=Global News|date=March 6, 2019|access-date=March 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307031708/https://globalnews.ca/news/5028385/jeopardy-alex-trebek-pancreatic/|archive-date=March 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Trebek was still serving as the show's host when he died on November 8, 2020. His last episodes were taped on October 29, 2020, and the show's producers declined to discuss any plans to introduce his successor while stating that they had enough new episodes with Trebek as host to run through [[Christmas Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wvnstv.com/news/local-news/jeopardy-host-alex-trebek-dead-at-80-tmz-reports/|title=Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek dead at 80|accessdate=November 8, 2020|date=November 8, 2020|work=[[WVNS-TV]]}}</ref> 

On November 9, 2020, the first episode after Trebek's death, executive producer Mike Richards paid tribute to Trebek, after a few seconds of silence where the lights on the ''Jeopardy!'' set slowly dimmed. That episode, as well as subsequent episodes that aired after Trebek's death, also included a dedication screen at the end of the credits, "Dedicated to Alex Trebek: Forever in our Hearts, Always our Inspiration."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mackie |first1=Johnni |title='Jeopardy!'

To compensate for the delay caused by cancellation of most November production dates (Season 37 production had previously been delayed by the pandemic) and pre-emptions caused by holiday week specials and sports, Sony announced on November 23, 2020, that the air dates of Trebek's final week will be postponed, with episodes scheduled for the week of December 21-25 being postponed to January 4-8, 2021. Reruns of Trebek's ten most notable episodes air from December 21 to January 1, before his final episodes air January 4-8, 2021. Interim hosts begin hosting on November 30, 2020, with those episodes airing January 11, 2021.

Various technological and aesthetic changes have been made to the ''Jeopardy!'' set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} ''The All-New Jeopardy!''{{-'}}s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on one side and the clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=100}} In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall,<ref name="officialannouncement"/> which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by [[Sony Electronics]].<ref name="2009 Set"/>

From 1985 to 1997, the sets were designed to have a background color of blue for the Jeopardy! round and red for the Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy! rounds. At the beginning of season 8 in 1991, a brand new set was introduced that resembled a grid.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=100}} On the episode aired November 11, 1996, two months after the start of season 13, ''Jeopardy!'' introduced the first of several sets designed by Naomi Slodki, who intended the set to resemble "the foyer of a very contemporary library, with wood and sandblasted glass and blue granite".{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=150}}

Shortly after the start of season 19 in 2002, the show switched to yet another new set,{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=210}} which was given slight modifications when ''Jeopardy!'' and sister show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' transitioned to [[high-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]] in 2006.<ref name="officialannouncement"/> During this time, the show began to feature [[virtual tour]]s of the set on its official web site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/jeopardy/mini_sites/archive_header/index.html?/tv/shows/jeopardy/mini_sites/jeopardy_set_03/ |title=2003 ''Jeopardy!'' set official web page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213025724/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/jeopardy/mini_sites/archive_header/index.html?%2Ftv%2Fshows%2Fjeopardy%2Fmini_sites%2Fjeopardy_set_03%2F |archive-date=February 13, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The various HD improvements for ''Jeopardy!'' and ''Wheel'' represented a combined investment of approximately $4&nbsp;million, 5,000 hours of labor, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} of cable.<ref name="officialannouncement">{{cite web|title=Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune go hi def!|date=September 7, 2006|publisher=Sony Pictures Television|url=http://www.jeopardy.com/announcement_20060907HD.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122125715/http://www.jeopardy.com/announcement_20060907HD.php|archive-date=January 22, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2007}}</ref> Both shows had been shot using HD cameras for several years before beginning to broadcast in HD.

Major modifications to the set were implemented in Season 37, to start September 14, 2020, with a wider studio without any studio audience (Season 36 finished behind closed doors), and new lecterns for contestants and the host. The lecterns are spaced considerably apart to comply with California state regulations imposed when filming resumed after the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television in the United States|coronavirus pandemic ended Season 36 early]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jeopardy!

===Theme music===
Since the debut of ''Jeopardy!'' in 1964, several songs and arrangements have served as the theme music for the show, most of which were composed by Griffin.

"Placing himself in ''Jeopardy!'' tonight", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', p. 54.</ref> "Think!" has always been used for the 30-second period in Final Jeopardy! when the contestants write down their responses, and since the syndicated version debuted in 1984, a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=10}} "Think!" has become so popular that it has been used in many different contexts, from sporting events to weddings;{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=17}} "its 30-second countdown has become synonymous with any deadline pressure".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/arts/television/alex-trebek-dead.html |title=Alex Trebek, Longtime Host of 'Jeopardy!,' Dies at 80 |first= Katharine Q. |last=Seelye |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 8, 2020 |accessdate=November 9, 2020}}</ref> Griffin estimated that the use of "Think!" had earned him royalties of over $70&nbsp;million throughout his lifetime.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Richard Natale|title=Hollywood legend Merv Griffin dies: Media mogul known for game shows, talk show|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/news/hollywood-legend-merv-griffin-dies-1117970093/|date=August 12, 2007|accessdate=July 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225002153/http://variety.com/2007/scene/news/hollywood-legend-merv-griffin-dies-1117970093/|archive-date=December 25, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> "Think!" led Griffin to win the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] (BMI) President's Award in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233747|title = For Merv Griffin, 14 Seconds Can Last a Lifetime|publisher = bmi.com|date = June 17, 2003|accessdate = October 18, 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007141601/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233747|archive-date = October 7, 2011|url-status = live}}</ref> and during GSN's ''[[2009 Game Show Awards]]'' special, it was named "Best Game Show Theme Song".<ref>{{Cite AV media |type=TV production | title = Game Show Awards | publisher = GSN |year = 2009}}</ref> In 1997, the main theme and Final Jeopardy! recordings of "Think!" were rearranged by Steve Kaplan, who served as the show's music director until his December 2003 death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/422033337.html|title=Pilot Killed in Crash Was TV, Film Composer; Steve Kaplan, who died when his plane crashed into a Claremont home, had written music for 'Jeopardy!' and 'Wheel of Fortune.'|last=Morin|first=Monte|date=December 17, 2003|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=May 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726004254/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/422033337.html|archive-date=July 26, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, Chris Bell Music and Sound Design overhauled the ''Jeopardy!'' music package for the show's 25th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeopardy!|url=http://www.chrisbellmusicandsounddesign.com/id78.html|work=Chris Bell Music and Sound Design|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708150055/http://www.chrisbellmusicandsounddesign.com/id78.html|archive-date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>

===Audition process===
{{Main|Jeopardy! audition process}}
For the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, prospective contestants called the show's office in New York to arrange an appointment and to preliminarily determine eligibility. They were briefed and auditioned together in groups of ten to thirty individuals, participating in both a written test and mock games. Individuals who were successful at the audition were invited to appear on the program within approximately six weeks.{{Sfn|Fleming|1979|pp=14–15}}

Auditioning for the 1984–present version of the show begins with a written exam, comprising 50 questions. This exam is administered online periodically, as well as being offered at regional contestant search events. Since season 15 (1998–99) the show has used a [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] recreational vehicle called the "Jeopardy! Brain Bus" to conduct regional events throughout the United States and Canada.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=170}} Participants who correctly answer at least 35 out of 50 questions advance in the audition process and are invited to attend in-person group auditions throughout the country. At these auditions, a second written exam is administered, followed by a mock game and interviews. Those who are approved are notified at a later time and invited to appear on the show. Eligibility is limited to people who have never been on the show, and have not been to an in-person audition for at least 18 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jeopardy.com/be-on-j/faqs|title=Jeopardy! – FAQs|website=jeopardy.com|language=en|access-date=January 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073316/https://www.jeopardy.com/be-on-j/faqs|archive-date=January 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Many of the contestants who appear on the series, including a majority of Teen Tournament contestants and nearly half of all College Tournament contestants, participated in [[quiz bowl]] competitions during their time in high school. The [[National Academic Quiz Tournaments]] has been described by [[Ken Jennings]] as a ''de facto'' "minor league" for game shows such as ''Jeopardy!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/jeopardy-quiz-bowl-connection-ken-jennings.html|title=The Jeopardy!

In 1989, Fleming expressed dissatisfaction with the daily syndicated ''Jeopardy!'' series in an essay published in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. He confessed that he only watched the Trebek version infrequently, and then only for a handful of questions; and also criticized this new iteration mainly for its Hollywood setting. Fleming believed that in contrast to New Yorkers who Fleming considered being more intelligent and authentic, moving the show to Hollywood brought both an unrealistic glamour and a dumbing-down of the program that he disdained. He also disliked the decision to not award losing contestants their cash earnings (believing the parting gifts offered instead to be cheap) and expressed surprise that what he considered to be a parlor game had transformed into such a national phenomenon under Trebek.<ref name="autogenerated89">''[https://www.si.com/vault/1989/05/01/119810/television-for-1000-the-worlds-toughest-game-show-what-is-jeopardy- What is Jeopardy!?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827165803/https://www.si.com/vault/1989/05/01/119810/television-for-1000-the-worlds-toughest-game-show-what-is-jeopardy- |date=August 27, 2017 }}'', 05.01.89 – ''Sports Illustrated''</ref> In television interviews, Fleming expressed similar sentiments while also noting that he approved of Trebek's approach to hosting, that Fleming and Trebek were personal friends and that, despite the modern show's flaws, it was still one of the best television shows.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G6UKm2adEI Perception with Don Johnson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908235749/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G6UKm2adEI&gl=US&hl=en |date=September 8, 2019 }} interview with Art Fleming, 1987.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E26Mz6o2oY ''Later with Bob Costas'' interview with Art Fleming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812193903/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E26Mz6o2oY&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999 |date=August 12, 2019 }}, early 1990s, posted by [[Wink Martindale]] on YouTube.</ref>

''Jeopardy!''{{-'}}s record for the longest winning streak is held by [[Ken Jennings]], who competed on the show from June 2 through November 30, 2004, winning 74 matches before being defeated by Nancy Zerg in his 75th appearance.

Both Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings have been the two biggest game show winners in international television history since 2005 thanks to ''Jeopardy!''. Rutter passed Jennings for all-time game show winnings in 2005 when he defeated Jennings in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions final, Jennings regained the all-time game show record in 2008 after accumulating winnings in various non-''Jeopardy!'' shows, then Rutter regained the all-time game show record in 2014 when he defeated Jennings in the ''Jeopardy!'' Battle of the Decades final, and extended his margin when he defeated captain-Jennings' team in the ''Jeopardy!'' All-Star Games. Jennings later regained the title in 2020 by winning the ''Jeopardy!'' The Greatest of All Time tournament. Having played each other in five different ''Jeopardy!'' special events, Rutter has three wins and two third-place finishes, while Jennings has one win and four second-place finishes.

===Portrayals and parodies===
''Jeopardy!'' has been featured in several films, television shows and books over the years, mostly with one or more characters participating as contestants, or viewing and interacting with the game show from their own homes.
*On "Questions and Answers", a season 7 episode of ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' aired February 8, 1992, [[Dorothy Zbornak]] ([[Bea Arthur]]) auditions for ''Jeopardy!'', but despite her excellent show of knowledge, she is rejected by a contestant coordinator who feels that America would not root for her. In a dream sequence, Dorothy competes against roommate [[Rose Nylund]] ([[Betty White]]) and neighbor Charlie Dietz ([[David Leisure]]), in a crossover from ''[[Empty Nest]]''. Trebek and Griffin appear as themselves in the dream sequence, and Gilbert provides a voice-over.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Questions and Answers |series=The Golden Girls |network=NBC |airdate=February 1992}}</ref>
*A 1988 episode of ''[[Mama's Family]]'' titled "Mama on Jeopardy!" features the titular Mama, [[Thelma Harper]] ([[Vicki Lawrence]]), competing on the show after her neighbor and friend [[Iola Boylan]] ([[Beverly Archer]]) is rejected.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Mama on Jeopardy! |series=Mama's Family |network=Syndication |date=February 3, 1988 |season=4 |number=23}}</ref> For most of the game the questions given by Mama are incorrect, but she makes a miraculous comeback near the end and barely qualifies for ''Final Jeopardy!'' Her final question given is also incorrect, but she finishes in second place by $1 and wins a trip to Hawaii for herself and her family. Again, Trebek guest stars and Gilbert provides a voice-over.
*In the ''[[Cheers]]'' episode "[[What Is... Cliff Clavin?]]" (1990), [[Cliff Clavin|the titular mailman]], portrayed by [[John Ratzenberger]], appears on the show and racks up an impressive $22,000 going into the Final Jeopardy! round, well ahead of his competitors. Despite having a total that his competitors cannot reach in Final Jeopardy!, Cliff risks all of his winnings on the final clue, which is revealed to be "Archibald Leach, Bernard Schwartz, and Lucille LeSueur" (the real names of [[Cary Grant]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Joan Crawford]], respectively). Cliff's response, "Who are three people who've never been in my kitchen?", is deemed incorrect, and he leaves with no money.{{Sfn|Bjorklund|1997|p=231}}
*In "[[I Take Thee Quagmire]]", a season 4 episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' aired March 12, 2006, Mayor [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Adam West]] appears as a contestant on ''Jeopardy!''.

In November 2009, ''Jeopardy!'' launched a viewer loyalty program called the "Jeopardy! Premier Club", which allowed home viewers to identify Final Jeopardy! categories from episodes for a chance to earn points, and play a weekly ''Jeopardy!'' game featuring categories and clues from the previous week's episodes. Every three months, contestants were selected randomly to advance to one of three quarterly online tournaments; after these tournaments were played, the three highest-scoring contestants would play one final online tournament for the chance to win $5,000 and a trip to Los Angeles to attend a taping of ''Jeopardy!''<ref>{{cite news|title=The New Jeopardy!

{{anchor|J! Archive}}
There is an unofficial ''Jeopardy!'' fansite known as the "J! Archive", which transcribes games from throughout ''Jeopardy!'''s daily syndicated history. In the archive, episodes are covered by ''Jeopardy!''-style game boards with panels which, when hovered over with a mouse, reveal the correct response to their corresponding clues and the contestant who gave the correct response. The site makes use of a "wagering calculator" that helps potential contestants determine what amount is safest to bet during Final Jeopardy!, and an alternative scoring method called "[[Karl Coryat|Coryat]] scoring" that disregards wagering during Daily Doubles or Final Jeopardy! and gauges one's general strength at the game. The site's main founding archivist is Robert Knecht Schmidt, originally a student from [[Cleveland]], Ohio when he started the site around 2003, and then a [[patent attorney]], and supported by a team of moderators.<ref name="J!
