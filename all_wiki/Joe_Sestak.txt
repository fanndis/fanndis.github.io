==Early life, education and early career==
Sestak was born in [[Secane, Pennsylvania]], the son of Kathleen L. (Schlichte) and Joseph Ambrose Sestak <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/joseph-sestak-obituary?pid=132737810|title=Joseph A.

Sestak's father graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1942, and then fought in both the Atlantic and the Pacific during [[World War II]], attaining the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].<ref name="philly">Fitzgerald, Thomas.

<blockquote>I remember going to the window and watching him. And the admiration that I had—just that strong determination of his. Never give in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Joseph-Sestak-587188 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118140049/http://www.biography.com/articles/Joseph-Sestak-587188 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-18 |title=Joseph Sestak Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=2011-08-10 }}</ref></blockquote>

Following in his father's footsteps, Sestak was accepted into the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] immediately after graduating from high school, during the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1974 Sestak graduated second in his class of over 900 midshipmen, with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in American political systems.<ref name=navy>VADM Joseph Sestak, USN Ret., Officer Bio File, United States Navy Operational Archives, [[U.S. Naval Historical Center]], Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.</ref> Between tours at sea he earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] and a [[Doctor of philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[political economy]] and government from the [[John F.

==Naval career==
[[File:US Navy 070902-N-1810F-324 Guided-missile frigate USS Samuel B.

Roberts|FFG-58|6}} to the title of best surface vessel in the Atlantic Fleet in the 1993 competition for the [[Battenberg Cup]].]]
As a [[surface warfare]] officer Sestak served division officer tours as damage control assistant, combat information center officer and weapons officer on the [[guided missile destroyer]] [[USS Richard E. Byrd (DDG-23)|USS ''Richard E. Byrd'']], and later as weapons officer on the guided missile destroyer [[USS Hoel (DDG-13)|USS ''Hoel'']]. He then served as aide and flag lieutenant to the admiral in charge of United States Navy surface forces in the Pacific.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In January 1986 Sestak became executive officer of the guided missile frigate [[USS Underwood (FFG-36)|USS ''Underwood'']] and was instrumental in the Underwood's winning the coveted [[Battle Efficiency Award|battle E]] and the [[Battenberg Cup]] (awarded to the best ship in the Atlantic fleet). He then served in the Politico-Military Assessment Division of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. On August 30, 1991, Sestak took command of the guided missile frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']], which was named the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]'s best [[surface combatant]] in the 1993 [[Battenberg Cup]] competition.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In July 1993 Sestak became the head of the Strategy and Concepts Branch in the office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. From November 1994 to March 1997 he was the Director for Defense Policy on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff at the [[White House]], where he was responsible for the Clinton Administration's national security strategy, policies, programs, inter-agency and congressional coordination and regional political-military advice. In May 1997 he became the commander of Destroyer Squadron 14.<ref name=navy/>

Sestak then directed the CNO's Strategy and Policy Division (N51), and led the navy's efforts toward the 2000 Quadrennial Defense Review, for which he analyzed military strategic requirements and the economic value of U.S. defense spending. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] attacks he became the first director of the Navy Operations Group (Deep Blue), the navy's strategic anti-terrorism unit,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126990200|title=Filling In The Blanks On Senate Hopefuls Paul, Sestak|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref> which sought to redefine strategic, operational and budgetary policies in the Global [[War on Terrorism]], reporting directly to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO) [[Admiral]] [[Vern Clark]]. In 2002 Sestak assumed command of the [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|George Washington]] Aircraft Carrier Battle Group of 10 U.S. ships and 10,000 sailors, [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]], marines, and 100 aircraft. He integrated it with a coalition of 20 allied ships and 5,000 sailors. It conducted combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Sestak became the director of the CNO's Analysis Group, again reporting directly to CNO Clark as policy adviser and administrator, where he directed independent analysis on strategy, warfare requirements, and resources for the CNO outside of the normal bureaucratic process of the Navy staff. Under Clark, Sestak worked to rein in military spending by maximizing fleet efficiency.<ref name="philly" /> In 2004 he was appointed Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs (N6/N7), where he implemented his ideas and analyses in the Navy's $350 billion Five Year Defense Plan to transform the Navy from a less effective, expensive platform-centric force structure to a more effective capabilities-based force posture with cyber and sensors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/challenging-the-navys-numbers/2011/12/29/gIQANfTSPP_story.html|title=Challenging the Navy's numbers|last=Pincus|first=Walter|date=29 December 2011|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}</ref> It resulted in a shipbuilding plan that departed from the traditional goal for a 375-ship level to one as low as 260.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/NHC/CRS/force_structure.htm#table1|title=Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress|last=O'Rourke|first=Ronald|date=14 August 2006|website=DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY -- NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER}}</ref>

In 2005 Sestak pushed for the addition of a second aircraft carrier in the Pacific to support allies, deter challenges from an emerging China, and be closer to potential hotspots such as the Koreas and the Taiwan Strait, saying, "if you don’t have the speed to get to the conflict when you really need to be there, you’re interesting, but irrelevant.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/navy-pushing-for-addition-of-second-aircraft-carrier-in-pacific-1.31147|title=Navy pushing for addition of second aircraft carrier in Pacific|last=Anderson|first=Jon|date=31 March 2005|work=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Controversy over reassignment===
[[File:VADM Joseph A. Sestak, Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Sestak as a vice admiral and serving as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs.]]
In the summer of 2005, after CNO Clark retired, Sestak was administratively removed from his position as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs (N6/N7), a three-star position.<ref name="removal">Jacobson, Louis. [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/06/09/sestak_damn_the_torpedoes_full_speed_ahead_96907.html Sestak: Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead]. ''Real Clear Politics''. 9 June 2009.</ref> His removal was one of the first changes made by [[Admiral]] [[Michael Mullen]] when he took over as the new [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in July 2005, according to ''[[Navy Times]]''.

Sestak was reassigned as a Special Assistant to the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]], and then opted to retire when his three-year-old daughter was diagnosed with malignant brain cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/bio.asp?bioID=257 |title=Official U.S. Navy bio |publisher=Navy.mil |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2011-06-02}}</ref> Controversy ensued over his departure: it was reported that he was pushed out because he "ruffled feathers" within the Bush Administration and came into conflict with [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] over Sestak's advocacy for spending cuts; Sestak's plan to change the Navy's force structure goals from 375 to as low as 260 by commanding the new emerging capability of cyberspace was controversial.<ref name="biography1" />

100 senior and junior officers as well as enlisted personnel who served with Sestak later signed a letter supporting him as “a leader of the highest caliber, a man of tremendous character, and a military officer of uncommon compassion.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WXCUtef9eA|title=Veterans Speak Out 2010|website=YouTube}}</ref>

In an investigative report by ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Chief of Naval Operations [[Vern Clark]] said of Sestak:

<blockquote>"He did what I asked him to do; I wanted straight talk, and this put him in the cross-hairs. People are going to say what they want to say, but [Sestak] challenged people who did not want to be challenged. The guy is courageous, a patriot's patriot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pa2012.com/2010/04/veterans-tell-specter-to-take-down-ad-against-sestak/ |title=Veterans tell Specter to take down ad against Sestak (VIDEO REPORT) |publisher=Pa2012.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323154958/http://www.pa2012.com/2010/04/veterans-tell-specter-to-take-down-ad-against-sestak/ |archivedate=2012-03-23 }}</ref></blockquote>

Clark told that Associated Press that Sestak "was an incredible officer, the best I've ever seen. Incredible moral courage, the courage to take the independent stand. When everybody else was saying, 'This is what we ought to do,' he would stand up and say, 'I don't see it that way.'"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcotimes.com/news/sestak-profile-unusual-democrat-seeks-pa-senate-seat/article_d1f4813d-cf0e-507e-be24-dad9006bd9b1.html|title=Sestak Profile: Unusual Democrat seeks Pa.

After Sestak retired from the [[United States Navy]], his daughter made a full recovery from cancer. He retired as a [[Rear admiral (upper half)|two-star admiral]], not having maintained the rank of [[Vice admiral (United States)|three-star admiral]] long enough to retain it in retirement.<ref name="biography1" />

===Military decorations===

===2006 election===
[[File:Joe Sestak and Chris Dodd at children's issues event.jpg|thumb|left|Sestak and Senator [[Chris Dodd]] at a children's issues talk in August 2006]]
Sestak was the second Democrat to win in Pennsylvania's traditionally [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The race was in the national spotlight, as it was profiled in [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] as the harbinger of the national political climate of the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 elections]] and the most-watched [[Electoral district#Swing seats and safe seats|swing district]] in the country.<ref>{{cite news |last=Klein |first=Joe |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535816,00.html |title=In Pennsylvania, it's the Admiral vs. the Firefighter |work=Time |date=2006-09-17 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>

In 2006, with his daughter's recovery going smoothly, Sestak was motivated to run for Congress by the benefits he received under the [[United States Military]]'s [[TRICARE]] health care program, which gave his daughter the care she needed to treat her brain tumor. Sestak stated that, during his travels to find the best treatment for his daughter, he saw children who did not have the same quality of care, or could not afford the necessary care. Sestak made health-care reform a pillar of his campaign in hopes of giving everyone the same care his family had. He called his congressional service a continuation of his military service, "paying back" the country that took care of his daughter.

Sestak began laying the groundwork for a Congressional run in his home district in Pennsylvania as a Democrat. He was then told he had to first receive the endorsement of the "DCCC." Sestak first thought this meant his hometown's [[Delaware County Community College]], but he was eventually steered toward the correct DCCC, the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], and informed its head, [[Rahm Emanuel]], of his candidacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/297056-6|title=Labels Conference Closing Speeches, Dec 13 2010 – Video – C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> Emanuel told Sestak he was not ready for the election.

In the second quarter of 2006, he raised $704,000 to Weldon's $692,000; in the third, $1.14 million to $912,000. As of September 30, 2006, Sestak had $1.53 million cash on hand, while Weldon had $1.12 million in the bank after making a $500,000 TV ad buy that had not started as of the close of the third quarter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=17280041&BRD=1675&PAG=461&dept_id=18171&rfi=8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313030526/http://www.delcotimes.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=17280041&BRD=1675&PAG=461&dept_id=18171&rfi=8|url-status=dead|title=Source: Delaware County Daily Times, Oct 4, 2006|archivedate=March 13, 2007}}</ref> Sestak received campaign donations from people around the world,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} including performer [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[John Grisham]], [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and many Naval officers.

A late September 2006 poll showed Sestak and Weldon locked in a statistical dead heat. Sestak led Weldon 44-43 among likely voters in a [[Franklin & Marshall College]] [[Keystone Poll]] released September 29. The poll also found that 49% of registered voters in the district felt it was time for change in the district and only 37% said Weldon deserved reelection.<ref>Bender, William. Sestak's coffers continue to grow. ''Delaware County Daily Times''. 4 October 2006.</ref> The numbers suggested Sestak had seriously eroded Weldon's previous lead; an April 2006 poll conducted by the pro-Democratic Party organization Democracy Corps had Weldon leading 51% to 41%.

In 2008 Sestak faced Republican nominee [[Wendell Craig Williams]], a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] and attorney. Sestak defeated him by a 20-point margin (59.6% to 40.4%), eight points more than his 2006 margin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&ElectionID=28&OfficeID=11#7 |title=Sestak V.

===Legislation and key votes===
Sestak wrote various pieces of bipartisan legislation that successfully passed Congress. In 2008 the ''[[National Journal]]'' placed him "at the ideological center of the House."<ref>[http://nj.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/pdf/08centrists.pdf The Centrists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616091241/http://nj.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/pdf/08centrists.pdf |date=June 16, 2012 }} ''National Journal''. 3 March 2008.</ref> [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Steny Hoyer]] named Sestak the most productive freshman member of Congress in 2007,<ref>Rose, Alex.

Most significantly, Sestak created the House Pediatric Cancer Caucus, which he co-chaired; extended benefits for those seeking work ([[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]]) as a part of the JOBS bill; co-wrote the amendment to give small businesses tax credits, as a part of [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|health care reform]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joesestak.com/issues |title=Web Page Under Construction |publisher=Joesestak.com |accessdate=2011-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202173910/http://joesestak.com/issues |archivedate=2010-12-02 }}</ref> and moved the first significant federal funds into [[autism]] care and research, nicknamed the "Sestak Amendment."<ref name="Web Page Under Construction">{{cite web|url=http://joesestak.com/aboutjoe |title=Web Page Under Construction |publisher=Joesestak.com |accessdate=2011-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023173415/http://joesestak.com/AboutJoe |archivedate=2010-10-23 }}</ref>

As Congress's senior veteran, Sestak was an original cosponsor of the repeal of [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] as well as the repeal of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]. He also strongly advocated ending bailouts to banks in the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Wall Street Reform]] Bill.<ref name="Web Page Under Construction"/> Sestak voted for the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] but lamented that it did not provide enough accountability measures.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll046.xml Final Vote Results for Roll Call 46].

===Social media===
In 2007 Sestak's campaign was the first federal campaign to create a [[Facebook]] Fan Page.<ref>{{cite web | title=The few, the proud, the tweet-less |url=https://www.politicopro.com/go/?id=21636}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref> Sestak joined [[Twitter]] shortly before he was sworn in for his second term.

Sestak is said to have been a prime example of the ''[[Colbert Bump]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Sestak Hopes For Another Colbert Bump|url=http://lezgetreal.com/2009/08/representative-sestak-hopes-for-another-colbert-bump/|publisher=Lez Get Real|access-date=2014-03-20|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140320224214/http://lezgetreal.com/2009/08/representative-sestak-hopes-for-another-colbert-bump/|archive-date=2014-03-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> After appearing on "[[The Colbert Report]]" in 2008, Sestak spoke of the positive impact of social media and viral video clips of the appearance. He appeared on the show even after Democratic leaders [[Rahm Emanuel]] and [[Nancy Pelosi]] instructed Democrats not to.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emanuel to new Democratic members of Congress: Avoid Colbert|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Emanuel_to_new_Dem_members_of_0315.html|publisher=Raw Story}}</ref> After his first appearance,<ref>{{cite web|title=Better Know A District – Pennsylvania's 7th – Joe Sestak|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/166773/april-22-2008/better-know-a-district---pennsylvania-s-7th---joe-sestak|publisher=Colbert Report}}</ref> Sestak won his election in a landslide in a Republican majority district, and after appearing again in 2009<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Sestak|url=http://colbertnation.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/colbert_report/videos/season5/05106/cr_05106_02_v6.jpg?width=133&height=71&quality=0.91&crop=true|publisher=Colbert Report}}</ref> as a part of his announcement of his candidacy against incumbent Senator [[Arlen Specter]] in the 2010 Democratic primary, Sestak won by a surprising eight points. He did not appear on the show during the 2010 general election, which he narrowly lost. The day after the loss, host [[Stephen Colbert]] lamented the loss on air, calling Sestak a "friend".<ref>{{cite web|title=We Hardly Knew Ye|url=http://colbertnation.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/colbert_report/videos/season6/06140/cr_06140_02_16x9.jpg?width=133&height=71&quality=0.91&crop=true|publisher=Colbert Report}}</ref>

===Congressional staff===
Sestak and his staff were recognized for their successful tenure and he was voted "The Most Productive Member of Congress."<ref name="dailycollegian">{{cite news | url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_862abb1b-32d1-5f6c-95b9-98e22d9921a6.html?mode=jqm |title=Sestak to meet with students |newspaper=The Daily Collegian |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref>

Sestak focused heavily on the constituent services his office provided the people of his district as he entered Congress just as the Great Recession began, homes were being foreclosed, and health care and other services were being denied as people lost their jobs and missed payments. During his four years in Congress from 2007 to 2011, Sestak's office handled 18,000 cases,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/02/joe_sestak_senate_walk.html|title=Walking with Sestak: 'Joe marches to his own drum' in Senate race|last=McKelvey|first=Wallace|date=11 February 2016|work=The Patriot News|access-date=}}</ref> between three<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/scorecard/1009/Sestak_Specter_puts_politics_ahead_of_governing.html#|title=Sestak: Specter puts politics ahead of governing|last=Kraushaar|first=Josh|date=2 October 2009|work=POLITICO|access-date=}}</ref> to four<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2016/04/ive_got_your_six_pennsylvania.html|title=I've got your six, Pennsylvania: Joe Sestak|last=Sestak|first=Joseph|date=19 April 2016|work=The Patriot News|access-date=}}</ref> times the number of the average congressional office.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-xpm-2010-09-25-mc-dc-sestak-profile-20100925-story.html|title=Election Profile: Joe Sestak|last=Itkowitz|first=Colby|date=25 September 2010|work=The Morning Call|access-date=}}</ref> "Every person who has worked for me has been tremendous," he said. Sestak hosted an average of 15 large summit gatherings in his district each year on key issues.<ref name="realclearpolitics1"/>

Some critics were quick to cite Sestak's handling of his Congressional staff as supporting "the perception that he is a taskmaster with a prickly streak." During his first term in office, Sestak employed 61 people as staff in his official congressional office, while comparable representatives employed a total of 28, 26, and 25 staff members, indicating that Sestak had a high turnover rate, although a number of them were interns or had been hired as temporary staff members. ''The Hill'' reported that several former staffers said that "aides are expected to work seven days a week, including holidays, often 14 hours each day, going for months without a day off. These are very long hours even by Capitol Hill standards". A former aide added that Sestak's staff turnover was not as much of a drawback as one might expect. "Other Members rely on their staff to keep themselves informed, but with him, it's top-down," the former aide said. "He knows what he wants to accomplish, so in a sense, he just needs people to dictate to." Sestak acknowledged that his aides spend long hours on duty and that the work is "pretty demanding." He added that the staff was becoming stabler over time,<ref name="realclearpolitics1">{{cite web| url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/06/09/sestak_damn_the_torpedoes_full_speed_ahead_96907.html |title=Sestak: Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead? |publisher=Real Clear Politics |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref> with the turnover rate normalizing by the end of his second term.

Contemporaneous staff accounts were published in the [[Delaware County Daily Times|Delaware County Times]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Current, ex-Sestak workers refute staff turnover claims|last=Rose|first=Alex|date=5 September 2007|work=The Delaware County Daily Times|access-date=}}</ref> including Clarence Tong, a spokesman who had been with Sestak since the campaign, who said "They're getting off. The only person who does work Sunday is someone who travels with the congressman when he goes to different constituent meetings... I think the reality is, my boss doesn't deny he asks a lot of people who work for him ... I think he's someone who's very fair to work for"; Ashley Miller, a former aide, who said, "We were working long hours, there's no doubt about that, but it was absolutely what was needed to do it. None of us were happy leaving things half done at the end of the day"; Bryan Branton, Sestak's former chief of staff, who said, "Every freshman office has to work that much harder because you're starting an office from scratch. The people who have since left the campaign have done so because they had other things they were planning on doing"; and Ryan Rudominer, Sestak's communications director during the campaign, who said, "Just like it took hard work to defeat a 20-year incumbent ... it takes hard work to pass as much legislation as Joe has passed as a first-term congressman, to hold as many summits and town halls as Joe has held and to be as responsive to constituents as Joe is."

===2008 presidential election===
Sestak endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for president in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primaries]] and served as her campaign national security adviser, specializing in veterans.<ref name=wpo1>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/documents/the-war-over-the-wonks.html|title=The War Over the Wonks|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> He told [[Stephen Colbert]] on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' that he trusted her leadership after serving with her in the White House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/shows/the-colbert-report|title=The Colbert Report|website=Comedy Central}}</ref> In addition to being Clinton's foreign policy adviser, Sestak served as her superdelegate and was a surrogate throughout the primary, making appearances at several rallies and on television, including in an ad emphasizing Clinton's foreign policy strengths.<ref name=wpo1/>

Whispers of a possible [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] campaign appeared in 2008 after Sestak's [[landslide victory]] and $3 million campaign surplus after his reelection. Even before [[Arlen Specter]]'s announcement to switch parties, draft efforts were organized. But after Specter switched from a Republican to a Democrat to ensure that (once [[Al Franken]] was seated) Democrats had a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority,<ref name="vox.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/4/26/11479708/pennsylvania-senate-democrat-primary|title=This candidate could be one of the Democrats' best Senate picks.

Almost 8,000 votes were cast nationwide, with 86% responding yes, including 85% of Pennsylvanians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boldprogressives.org/sestakpollresults.html |title=Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC) |publisher=Boldprogressives.org |accessdate=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731175057/http://boldprogressives.org/sestakpollresults.html |archivedate=July 31, 2009 }}</ref>

Sestak faced significant opposition to his candidacy from President [[Barack Obama|Obama]], Vice President [[Joe Biden]], the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the state party, even though Sestak pointed out Specter's humiliation of Anita Hill during her testimony about her harassment by Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/specter-leads-money-fight-sestak-raises-money-with-anita-hill|title=Specter Leads Money Fight, Sestak Raises Money With Anita Hill|last=McMorris-Santoro|first=Evan|date=15 October 2009|work=Talking Points Memo|access-date=}}</ref> and other votes of Specter's.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/05/sestak-hits-specter-over-kagan-037006|title=Sestak hits Specter over Kagan|last=Kraushaar|first=Josh|date=10 May 2010|work=Politico|access-date=}}</ref> Then-Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] said on national television, "Joe Sestak should not run for the Senate in the Democratic primary."<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31046903 'The Ed Show' for Friday, May 29].

On May 27, 2009, Sestak indicated that he intended to challenge Specter in the [[United States Senate Democratic primary election in Pennsylvania, 2010|2010 Democratic primary]] (pending a final family decision because he had not "had the time to sit down with my eight-year-old daughter or my wife to make sure that we are all ready to get in").<ref>{{cite news| url= http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/27/sestak-i-intend-to-get-in-this-race/ |title=Sestak: 'I intend to get in this race' |publisher=Politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate= 2010-06-13}}</ref> In June he was overheard saying "[i]t would take an act of God for me to not get in now".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hirschhorn |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Hirschhorn |url=http://www.pa2010.com/2009/06/sestak-only-an-act-of-god-will-keep-him-out-of-senate-race/ |title=Sestak: Only an 'act of God' will keep him out of Senate race |publisher=pa2010.com |accessdate=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615164134/http://www.pa2010.com/2009/06/sestak-only-an-act-of-god-will-keep-him-out-of-senate-race/ |archivedate=2009-06-15 }}</ref> In a [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll conducted May 20–26, Specter led the Democratic primary with 50 percent, with Sestak at 21 percent and 27 percent undecided.

====Democratic opposition====
Throughout the [[primary election]] the Obama administration and the Democratic Party campaigned heavily against Sestak, as the [[Barack Obama|President]], [[Joe Biden|Vice President]], and numerous [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet members]] and Senators hosted many fundraisers and events for Specter. On September 19, 2009, [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] even shut down the entire [[United States Senate]], as he, the President, and many Senators instead flew to Philadelphia to host a prominent fundraiser for Specter.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/16/specter-fundraisers-stall-senate-voting/?feat=home_headlines |title=Specter fundraiser stalls Senate voting |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref> The event drew controversy for closing federal business and because the money raised during the event would be given to Republicans and conservative [[Political action committee|PACs]] that asked for refunds of contributions given before Specter's party switch.<ref>{{cite web|author=MinistryOfTruth |url=http://www.progressiveelectorate.com/diary/1655/specter-uses-dem-donations-to-refund-gop-donors |title=Specter uses Dem donations to refund GOP donors |publisher=The Progressive Electorate |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref> Obama's presidential campaign, called "Organizing for America" during the off years, also led efforts against Sestak.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/05/president-obamas-campaign-arm-tries-to-get-grassroots-democrats-to-defeat-fellow-progressive.html |title=President Obama's Campaign Arm Tries to Get Grass-Roots Democrats to Defeat Fellow Progressive&nbsp;— Political Punch |website=ABC News |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref> Even the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) decided to spend the maximum "coordinated funds" for Specter, which differ from most party spending in that the committee can use the money to work with the candidate and supplement his or her ad buys.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/95897-dscc-spending-money-to-save-specter-in-primary|title=DSCC spending money to save Sen.

====Primary result====
Specter held a 20-point lead in polls as late as April 2010, and enjoyed support from the Democratic establishment, including Rendell and Philadelphia Mayor [[Michael Nutter]], with the latter trying to mobilize voters in that city for Specter. A moderate Republican, Specter had switched parties after polls showed him likely being defeated by the more conservative [[Pat Toomey]] in the Republican primary, a rematch of the 2004 nomination contest where Specter narrowly defeated Toomey. Sestak attacked Specter's switch as "self-interested", and the move was disapproved of by a majority of registered Democrats in Pennsylvania, while a "fervent anti-incumbent mood" prevailed nationwide in the 2010 midterm elections. The Sestak campaign also ran an ad showing Specter with President [[George W. Bush]], which seriously damaged Specter's standing. Sestak gained momentum in the last days of the primary contest as the turnout in Philadelphia for Specter failed to meet expectations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/18/AR2010051806233.html|title=Arlen Specter's party switch and subsequent fall|first=Paul|last=Kane|date=19 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arlen-specter-loses-pennsylvania-democratic-senate-primary-to-joe-sestak/|title=Arlen Specter Loses Pennsylvania Democratic Senate Primary to Joe Sestak|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>

At a little after 10 p.m. on May 18 the Associated Press called the primary for Sestak, 53% to 47%.<ref name="admiral">Toeplitz, Shira. [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/37464.html The admiral sinks Arlen Specter]. ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]''. 18 May 2010.</ref>

===General election===
{{main|2010 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania}}
Many cited the Pennsylvania Senate general election as the "marquee race of 2010", a bellwether of the national stage. After securing the Democratic Party's nomination, calling it "a win for the people, over the establishment, over the status quo, even over Washington, DC," Sestak enjoyed a slight lead in the polls against the Republican nominee, former Congressman and [[Club for Growth]] President [[Pat Toomey]]. But while Sestak tried to recoup his financial losses after a long primary, Toomey had not faced a competitive primary and aired TV ads much earlier than Sestak. Toomey's effective fundraising and advertising allowed him to rise in the polls, at one point gaining a double-digit lead, causing political pundits to move the race from "Toss Up" to "Lean Republican."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/senate/pennsylvania-senate-race-moves.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Chris | last= Cilizza | title=Pennsylvania Senate race moves to "Lean Republican" | date=2011-09-22}}</ref> Many stopped short of calling the race "Solid Republican" as Sestak had a reputation for campaigning until he "sees the whites of their eyes" and 11th-hour comebacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/pa/pennsylvania_senate_sestak_vs_toomey-1059.html|title=2010 – Pennsylvania Senate – Sestak vs. Toomey – RealClearPolitics|website=realclearpolitics.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>

Sestak began airing ads in mid-fall and overcame his deficit in opinion polls, closing to within the margin of error. Toomey had been running unanswered ads depicting Sestak as a liberal for several months before the DSCC purchased airtime toward the end of the campaign.<ref name=":0" /> At the beginning of election night Sestak led in the exit polls by a wide margin, but as more votes were counted and central Pennsylvania's "red T" area began reporting, Toomey caught up. Counting continued until early morning, as the numbers were too close for a winner to be declared. As the percentages stabilized, it became clear Toomey was the winner. Sestak conceded the race to a ballroom full of his supporters at the [[Radnor Hotel]]. Toomey defeated Sestak, 51% to 49%, a margin of 80,229 votes out of almost four million cast, a margin large enough to avoid a recount. Percentage-wise, it was the smallest losing margin of any Pennsylvania Democratic candidate in 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/02/AR2010110208465.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Marc | last=Levy | title=Pa.

The total spent on the race was $20 million, the most of any federal election in 2010. After [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]] was decided, conservative [[Political action committees|Political Action Committees]] and corporations broke the record for outside spending, airing ads on Toomey's behalf and causing Sestak to be outspent 3 to 1.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.politicspa.com/corbett-and-toomey-had-twice-as-many-ads-as-onorato-and-sestak-en-route-to-victory/20147/ | work=PoliticsPA | first=Tom | last= Mulkeen | title=Corbett and Toomey had twice as many ads as Onorato and Sestak | date=2011-01-16}}</ref> Sestak received little help from the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee|Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)]], which had spent significantly to assist Specter in the primary.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/harrisburg_politics/DSCC_Cavalry_spending_more_on_Sestak.html|title=DSCC Cavalry spending more on Sestak|last=Fitzgerald|first=Thomas|date=20 August 2010|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=}}</ref> The gap between pro-Toomey and pro-Sestak ads was the largest of any Senate race in the nation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Erika|date=January 2011|title=Advertising Trends in 2010|journal=The Forum - A Journal of Applied Research in Contemporary Politics|volume=8| issue = 4|pages=7|doi=10.2202/1540-8884.1411|s2cid=145451241}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicspa.com/corbett-and-toomey-had-twice-as-many-ads-as-onorato-and-sestak-en-route-to-victory/20147/|title=UPDATED: Corbett and Toomey had twice as many ads as Onorato and Sestak; Sestak: "It shows…a voice of reason can still break through"|last=Mulkeen|first=Tom|date=17 January 2011|work=PoliticsPA|access-date=}}</ref> Sestak responded to this outside spending at Philadelphia Constitution Hall, arguing, "It is we, the people.

Sestak taught courses on "Ethical Leadership" and "Restoring the American Dream."

Sestak remained active in public service through the Center for Refugee and Disaster Response at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]; the [[Ploughshares Fund]] working on nuclear disarmament; the Lenfest Foundation focused on education in Philadelphia, pre-K through early childhood, and those in danger of leaving or having left high school; co-chair with former Republican governor [[Mark Schweiker]] of the Pennsylvania State Advisory Committee of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, focused on U.S. diplomacy and development; and then-Secretary of State Clinton's Advisory Committee on U.S. educational programs.

===Medical marijuana===
Sestak voted to allow states to regulate [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] by voting for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008, which would have barred the Department of Justice from preventing the implementation of state laws regarding the distribution, possession, and cultivation of medical marijuana.

Sestak supported the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], which critics contended continued the Bush administration's policy of [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless wiretapping]] and provided retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies who participated in the [[National Security Agency|National Security Agency's]] "[[terrorist surveillance program]]."<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll437.xml Roll Call Vote for HR 6304, FISA Amendments Act].

==Nonprofit work==
In 2017, Sestak became the first president of [[FIRST Global]], a nonprofit founded by [[Dean Kamen]] with the objective of promoting [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education and careers in the developing world through Olympics-style robotics competitions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zietlow|first1=Alex|title=Robot challenge promotes STEM education around the world, even in least-developed countries|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/9/first-global-robot-challenge-brings-stem-students-/|work=The Washington Times|date=July 9, 2017}}</ref>

In July 2017, the inaugural FIRST Global Challenge brought together high school student teams from 157 countries. [[Afghanistan]]'s team made headlines when its visa requests were denied twice and it almost missed the competition, until President [[Donald Trump]] intervened to urge the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] authorities to reconsider. The five girls were granted entry to the U.S. less than a week before the competition. Each country that applied to be in the competition, including those on the Trump Administration's travel ban list—from Iran to a Syrian Refugee team—obtained U.S. visas to attend the competition.

Women were responsible for leading, organizing, or funding 60% of all nations' teams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://first.global/press-releases/women-of-stem-organize-over-100-teams-participating-in-worlds-first-robot-olympics/|title=Women of STEM Organize over 100 Teams Participating in World's First Robot Olympics|website=FIRST Global}}</ref> 84 of the teams had not had either STEM education or robotics. Sestak established "The Global STEM Corps" of approximately 800 U.S. and international college, high school, and other STEM volunteers to "adopt" a team for online assistance in the engineering and electronics "best assemblage" of their robot for the game competition.

==Personal life==
Sestak is married to the former Susan L. Clark, who works in international environmental issues from [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Mozambique]]; Russian relations, including the U.S. team searching for clues for [[Prisoners of War]]/[[Missing in Action]] within [[Soviet Union]] archives; and on suicide prevention for the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. In childhood, their daughter [[List of brain tumor patients#Miscellaneous|Alexandra]] survived [[brain tumor|brain cancer]] twice, at four years old and again near adulthood.<ref>{{cite news|author=Joe Klein |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20100516/us_time/08599198895000 |title=Arlen Specter&nbsp;– Joe Sestak Race Heats Up in Pennsylvania |work=Time |date=2010-05-16 |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520075419/http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20100516/us_time/08599198895000 |archivedate=May 20, 2010 }}</ref>
