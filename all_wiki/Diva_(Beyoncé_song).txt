"'''Diva'''" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter [[Beyoncé]]. The song was written and produced by Knowles, Shondrae "Bangladesh" Crawford, and [[Sean Garrett]] for the singer's third studio album ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). It was released as the album's third overall single in the United States alongside the third international single "[[Halo (Beyoncé song)|Halo]]". "Diva" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, which is set in a hip hop [[Groove (music)|groove]], and carries a stuttering [[Beat (music)|beat]]. Its lyrics deliver messages of independence and female empowerment. The song boasts a beat and a [[bassline]] similar to those of another Bangladesh 2008 production, "[[A Milli]]" by American rapper, [[Lil' Wayne]]; critics coined "Diva" as a "female companion" to the latter.

"Diva" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who had polarized opinions concerning its affiliation with "A Milli". Despite being released to rhythmic and urban radios only in the US, the song peaked at number 19 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart, and attained a peak position of number three on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. "Diva" was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipment of 500,000 copies. Although it was only officially released in the US, the song appeared on the singles charts in Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

The accompanying [[music video]] for "Diva" was directed by [[Melina Matsoukas]]. It shows the singer and backup dancers in a warehouse, and presents a choreography similar to that of her previous single "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" (2008). Beyoncé also appears in different [[Thierry Mugler]] couture pieces. The video received mixed response from critics, who were not pleased by its concept as they believed it portrayed Beyoncé's [[alter ego]] Sasha Fierce ineffectively. It was ranked at number 13 on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009'' countdown. Although Beyoncé did not perform the song in any televised appearances, it was a part of her [[set list]] on the [[I Am... World Tour]] (2009–10) and her [[revue|revue show]], [[Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live]] (2012).

[[File:Diva (Beyoncé Knowles music video screenshot).jpg|alt=A woman is walking away from an exploding car underneath a bridge.

===Synopsis===
The video begins with a dictionary definition of the word "[[diva]]", before cutting to a parking lot outside of a warehouse. Beyoncé, wearing a pair of "dangle shades", walks past a car full of mannequin parts into the warehouse. From here, she is accompanied by her two dancers and a variety of high fashion outfits. When she states "Diva's gettin' money..." she waves a fan made of $100 bills. During the bridge to the climax, Beyoncé dances on a single light and then during the climax, she is seen very glossy in another wardrobe choice dancing in robotic movements to the beat with gold punctuating the black and white scene. In one scene, Beyoncé is seen dancing robotically in front of a set of gold-tinted mannequins; while in another, she dances against a wall with two large chains hanging from the ceiling. During the last chorus, Beyoncé is in her last wardrobe change in front of window which is where the paparazzi had taken photos of her. At the end of the song, Beyoncé walks back out to the parking lot. She lights up a cigar and throws the lighter into the car, letting it explode. As she walks away, the intro to "[[Video Phone (song)|Video Phone]]" (a track from ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'') plays. The explosion retains its original fiery colors in contrast with the black and white.

===Reception===
A writer of ''Rolling Stone'' described the video as "quite a hot mess", further comparing the dancers with the ones from the video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".<ref name="rollvideo" /> The writer finished the review calling it "a four-minute art-school film unworthy of her Sasha Fierceness".<ref name="rollvideo">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonce-is-fiercely-confusing-in-baffling-video-for-diva-20081223#ixzz1eunnX5Wm |title=Beyonce Is Fiercely Confusing in Baffling Video for "Diva" |work=Rolling Stone  |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref> Jennifer Cady of E!
