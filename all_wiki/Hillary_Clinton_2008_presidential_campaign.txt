The '''2008 presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton''', then [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[List of United States Senators from New York|United States Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], was announced on her website on January 20, 2007. [[Hillary Clinton]] was previously the [[First Lady of the United States]] and [[List of Governors of Arkansas|First Lady of Arkansas]] prior to [[2000 United States Senate election in New York|her election]] as U.S. Senator from New York. She is also the wife of former President [[Bill Clinton]]. Clinton was the source of much media speculation since having expressed interest in being a candidate in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] since at least October 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/27/content_285278.htm |title=Maybe, says Hillary Clinton to 2008 presidency |date=November 27, 2003 |newspaper=[[China Daily]] |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209060014/http://chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/27/content_285278.htm |archive-date=December 9, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = Can Hillary Upgrade?|page = A27|newspaper = New York Times|url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0813FF3B5C0C718CDDA90994DA404482|date = October 2, 2002|author = Dowd, Maureen|accessdate = August 22, 2006|author-link = Maureen Dowd}} (preview only)</ref>

Following her announcement of an [[exploratory committee]] and candidacy filing on January 20, 2007 with the FEC, she began fundraising and campaigning activities. For several months Clinton led opinion polls among Democratic candidates by substantial margins until Senator [[Barack Obama]] pulled close to or even with her. Clinton then regained her polling lead, winning many polls by double digits; by autumn 2007 she was leading all other Democratic candidates by wide margins in national polls.<ref name="cnn101607">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/16/schneider.poll/index.html | title= Poll: As Thompson's star fades, Clinton's on the rise | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | author=[[Bill Schneider (journalist)|Bill Schneider]] | date=October 16, 2007 | accessdate=October 17, 2007}}</ref>  She placed third in the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa caucus]] to Barack Obama and [[John Edwards]],<ref name="nyt01/03/08">{{cite news | url=http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/states/IA.html | title= Election Guide 2008 : Iowa Caucus Results | newspaper=[[nytimes.com]] | date=January 3, 2008 | accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref> and trailed considerably in polls shortly thereafter in New Hampshire before staging a comeback and finishing first in the [[2008 New Hampshire Democratic primary|primary there]].<ref name=hampshire>{{cite news | url=http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/states/NH.html | title= Election Guide 2008 : Iowa Caucus Results | newspaper=[[nytimes.com]] | date=January 3, 2008 | accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref> 
She went on to win a plurality of votes in Nevada, but won fewer delegates in Nevada than Obama, then lost by a large margin in [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestate.com/presidential-politics/story/297566.html |publisher=The State | date=January 27, 2008 | title=Obama routs Clinton in South Carolina |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130033317/http://www.thestate.com/presidential-politics/story/297566.html |archive-date=2008-01-30}}</ref> On [[Super Tuesday (2008)|Super Tuesday]], Clinton won the most populous states such as California and New York, while Obama won more states total. The two gained a nearly equal number of delegates and a nearly equal share of the total popular vote. Clinton then lost the next eleven caucuses and primaries to Obama, and lost the overall delegate lead to him for the first time. On March 4, his consecutive wins increased to twelve when [[Vermont]] went his way. After an increasingly aggressive round of campaigning, Clinton broke the string of losses with wins in the [[2008 Rhode Island Democratic primary|Rhode Island]], [[2008 Ohio Democratic primary|Ohio]], and [[2008 Texas Democratic primary and caucuses|Texas]] primaries.<ref name = "CNN20080304">{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/dates/index.html#val=20080304 | title=Results: March 4 - Multi-state events | publisher=CNN | date=March 4, 2008 | accessdate=March 4, 2008}}</ref>

Clinton subsequently lost in [[2008 Wyoming Democratic caucuses|Wyoming]], [[2008 Mississippi Democratic primary|Mississippi]], [[2008 Montana Democratic primary|Montana]], [[2008 North Carolina Democratic primary|North Carolina]] and [[2008 Oregon Democratic primary|Oregon]], and won in [[2008 Pennsylvania Democratic primary|Pennsylvania]], [[2008 Indiana Democratic primary|Indiana]], [[2008 West Virginia Democratic primary|West Virginia]], [[2008 Kentucky Democratic primary|Kentucky]], [[2008 Puerto Rico Democratic primary|Puerto Rico]] and [[2008 South Dakota Democratic primary|South Dakota]]. On the final day of primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough pledged- and super-delegates to become the [[presumptive nominee]];<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.democrats/index.html | title= CNN projects Obama clinches nomination | publisher=CNN | date=June 3, 2008 | accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> she then suspended her campaign on June 7, 2008, and endorsed Barack Obama.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.hillaryclinton.com/about/bio/|title =Hillary's story|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160204172958/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/about/bio/|archive-date =February 4, 2016|url-status =dead|df =mdy-all}}</ref>

While losing the delegate count, and thus the nomination, she earned more popular votes than Barack Obama (though unlike Clinton's name, Obama's name wasn't actually on the ballot in the [[2008 Michigan Democratic primary]]; had all of the "Uncommitted" votes in the Michigan primary been counted as votes for Obama, Obama would have very narrowly won the popular vote as well). In the general election, Barack Obama defeated Senator and Republican nominee [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]], and nominated Clinton as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], an office in which she served until February 2013.

== Staff and policy team==

===Initial team===
Clinton's campaign was run by a team of advisers and political operatives.

=== February 2008 reorganization===
On February 10, 2008, Solis Doyle ceased duties as campaign manager, and become a senior adviser, traveling with Clinton. Although Solis Doyle claimed the unanticipated length of the primary campaign led to her to resign the post, campaign insiders confirmed that she was ousted.

[[Maggie Williams]] was appointed campaign manager; she had been Clinton's chief of staff at the White House.

In two in-depth accounts by [[Joshua Green (journalist)|Joshua Green]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', he attributed Solis Doyle's downfall to her failure to manage campaign spending, her inability to prevent factional disputes within the campaign, and her not recognizing Obama's candidacy as a serious threat earlier.<ref name="atlantic"/><ref name='Green-Atlantic-2008-09'/>  Henry's departure was expected, as Solis Doyle had originally brought him in to the campaign.<ref name="wapo021208fx"/>

=== April 2008 strategist change===
Chief campaign strategist [[Mark Penn]] resigned on April 6, 2008, amid controversy surrounding his work with the Colombian government and the free trade bill opposed by many big unions. Penn resigned after news surfaced he had met with the Colombian ambassador, not as Clinton's adviser but as CEO of his P.R. firm, though he admitted the subject of the meeting was the trade bill. Penn was replaced with [[Geoff Garin]], a respected pollster, who became the chief strategist.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mooney|first=Alexander|title=Clinton: Penn flap won't hurt us|publisher=CNN|date=April 8, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/04/08/clinton.penn/index.html#cnnSTCText|accessdate=April 9, 2008|quote=I don't think [it will hurt], because I think people want to know where I stand," Clinton said on CNN's American Morning}}</ref>  He was slated to continue work for the campaign via his polling firm.

=== Methods and goals===
In January 2007 Clinton announced that she would forgo public financing for both the primary and general elections due to the spending limits imposed when accepting the federal money.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/us/politics/23donate.html?_r=1&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fClinton%2c%20Hillary%20Rodham&oref=slogin: Death Knell May Be Near For Public Funds], ''[[New York Times]]'', January 23, 2007</ref>  She had $14 million left from her 2006 Senate race, which put her in a good starting position compared to other Democratic candidates. Clinton insiders said the senator's goal was to raise at least $60 million in 2007.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/06/AR2007020601580.html Clinton Fundraising Goes Full Force], Washington Post, February 7, 2007</ref>  Longtime Democratic political and finance leader

On April 1, 2007, Clinton announced she had raised $26 million during the preceding three months, along with an additional transfer of $10 million from her Senate campaign account to her presidential account.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/01/clinton.money/index.html | title= Record millions roll in for Clinton White House bid | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=April 1, 2007 | accessdate=October 19, 2007}}</ref>  This dwarfed the previous record for the comparable quarter, which was $9 million by [[Al Gore]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/01/AR2007040101143.html | title=Clinton Shatters Record for Fundraising | author=[[Anne E.

In April, it was revealed that the Clinton campaign began the month $1 million in debt. While the campaign had $20 million cash on hand, only $9 million was available for the primary and the campaign had $10 million in debt. Clinton adviser Howard Wolfson acknowledged the debt, but noted that "The money continues to come in strongly" and that the campaign would be paying off the debts.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/04/21/clintons-primary-campaign-begins-april-in-debt/#more-6564 | title=Clinton's primary campaign begins April in debt | author=Alexander Mooney | publisher=CNN | date=April 21, 2008 | accessdate=April 21, 2008}}</ref>

===Campaign finance irregularities===
[[Norman Hsu]] was a businessman with a background in the [[apparel industry]]. By 2007 he was a prominent fundraiser for the Clinton campaign, having achieved [[HillRaiser]] status, having co-hosted a $1 million fundraiser at wealthy Democratic Party supporter [[Ron Burkle]]'s [[Beverly Hills]] estate,<ref name="wsj20070828"/> and having been scheduled to co-host a major gala fundraising event featuring music legend [[Quincy Jones]].<ref name="nyt083007"/>

On August 28, 2007, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Hsu may have engaged in improper actions during the collection of "bundled" campaign contribution.<ref name="wsj20070828" />  The Clinton campaign rose to Hsu's defense, saying "Norman Hsu is a longtime and generous supporter of the Democratic party and its candidates, including Senator Clinton. During Mr. Hsu's many years of active participation in the political process, there has been no question about his integrity or his commitment to playing by the rules, and we have absolutely no reason to call his contributions into question."<ref name="wsj20070828"/>

The next day, on August 29, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Hsu was a longtime fugitive, having failed to appear for sentencing for a 1992 fraud conviction.<ref name="lat082907">{{cite news

The political watchdog organization [[Judicial Watch]] said it would try to get the [[U.S. Justice Department]] and the [[Senate Ethics Committee]] to investigate the Hsu matter.<ref name="nydn091207"/> Clinton aides stressed that Hsu had never received favorable treatment from her: "The Senate office had no official contact with him, and undertook no actions on his behalf."<ref name="nydn091207"/>  Clinton herself called the whole affair "a rude awakening to all of us," meaning other campaigns as well.<ref name = "NPR20070918">"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14503634 Clinton Sees Better Chances for Health Overhaul]".

A February 13, 2008, ''[[NPR]]'' article stated (with regard to mailing lists) that "Last year, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton took the unusual step of renting out some of her lists."

An October 29, 2007 study by the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] and the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] found that Clinton had received the most media coverage of any of the 2008 presidential candidates, being the subject of 17 percent of all stories.<ref name="pej"/>  The study found that 27 percent of the stories had a favorable tone towards her, 38 percent had an unfavorable tone, with the balance neutral.<ref name="pej">{{cite web | url=http://journalism.org/node/8187 | title=A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign | publisher=[[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] | date=October 29, 2007 | accessdate=November 3, 2007}}</ref>

A November 12, 2007 assessment by Michael Crowley of ''[[The New Republic]]'' of relations between the Clinton campaign and the press found that regarding published stories, "the Clinton media machine [is] hyper-vigilant [and that] that no detail or editorial spin is too minor to draw a rebuke."<ref name="tnr111207">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=6e01fdce-ad97-4dab-a07d-bf98dc52f681 | author=[[Michael Crowley (journalist)|Michael Crowley]] | title=Bunker Hillary | magazine=[[The New Republic]] | date=November 12, 2007 | accessdate=December 6, 2007}}</ref>  The Clinton camp was also reported to engage in retribution regarding stories they did not like, complaining to reporters' editors or withholding access in other areas:<ref name="tnr111207"/> "Even seasoned political journalists describe reporting on Hillary as a torturous experience."<ref name="tnr111207"/>  In spite of this, Crowley measured the press corps as giving Clinton "strikingly positive coverage".<ref name="tnr111207"/>

There's no one rooting for her to come back."<ref name="wapo121907"/>

After Clinton's loss in Iowa and in the run-up to her apparent loss in New Hampshire and campaign collapse to come, negative media coverage of her became intense; as [[The Politico]] phrased it in retrospect, "She is carrying the burden of 16 years of contentious relations between the Clintons and the news media. ...

[[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]] singled out [[MSNBC]]'s [[Chris Matthews]] for his consistently harsh coverage of Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|author=J.M. |url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200801110011?f=h_top |title=Media Matters on Chris Matthews Remarks |publisher=Mediamatters.org |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://mediamatters.org/items/200712180005?f=h_top Chris Matthews on Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani] Media Matters, December 18, 2007</ref>  During the primaries, and especially after the Iowa caucuses, Matthews was openly enthusiastic about Obama's candidacy.

[[Air America Radio]] host [[Rachel Maddow]] and political analyst [[Patrick Buchanan]] both noted the high turnout among women, and asserted that the media coverage made Clinton a sympathetic figure to female voters. Buchanan stated that the media had "virtually canonized" Obama and behaved as if he'd been "born in [[Bethlehem]]." Maddow told Matthews that several blogs were citing him as "a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to Hillary Clinton." She added that sites such as [[Talking Points Memo|TalkingPointsMemo.com]] indicated that voters felt that the media were "piling on" Clinton, and were "coming to her defense with their votes." Matthews replied sarcastically, "My influence in American politics looms over the people. I'm overwhelmed myself."<ref>[http://mediamatters.org/items/200801090006 Matthews on Clinton's performance: "good enough here for women who wanted to root for her anyway"] MediaMatters.org, January 9, 2008</ref>  He added, "I will never underestimate Hillary Clinton again."<ref name=swoon/>  The next day, Matthews appeared on [[Joe Scarborough]]'s MSNBC morning show and said, "I'll be brutal, the reason she's a U.S. senator, the reason she's a candidate for president, the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around.

Clinton got an ironic supporter in conservative radio show host [[Rush Limbaugh]]. Limbaugh executed a plan for the listeners of Limbaugh's radio program to vote for Clinton in their states' respective primaries. Limbaugh started his Operation Chaos in order to "politically bloody up Barack Obama". This was known as "Rush the Vote" among the "Drive-by Media", a derogatory term used by Limbaugh when referencing the mainstream media, of which he does not consider himself to be a part.<ref>[http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_050508/content/01125111.guest.html Operation Chaos Goals Restated for All You Nervous Conservatives] May 5, 2008</ref> Though, Limbaugh wasn't supporting Clinton in hopes she would win the presidency, rather wanting to help divide the Democratic Party, so they wouldn't be well organized when the general election came.

Later in January 2008, Clinton backed out of a cover photo shoot with ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' over concerns by the Clinton camp that she would appear "too feminine,"<ref>''Women's Wear Daily'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20080120151630/http://www.wwd.com/issue/article/121588?page=0 Memo Pad: Sharp Words...

The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying. How has our culture come to this? How is it that ''[[The Washington Post]]'' recoils from the slightest hint of cleavage on a senator? This is America, not Saudi Arabia. It's also 2008: [[Margaret Thatcher]] may have looked terrific in a blue power suit, but that was 20 years ago.

===Sarah Palin comparison===
Following the nomination of [[Sarah Palin]] for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention, Palin and Clinton were compared and contrasted with one another in the media, due to their status as women running in the 2008 presidential election. A ''New York Times'' article stated, "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. Mrs. Clinton always faces high expectations; Mrs. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. Mrs. Clinton can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Mrs. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. Mrs. Clinton has a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. Mrs. Clinton is pantsuits; Mrs. Palin is skirts."<ref>Patrick Healey.[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/us/politics/06web-healy.html "The Real ’08 Fight: Clinton v. Palin?"]; ''The New York Times'', September 5, 2008</ref> Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it was "insulting" for Republicans to compare Palin to Clinton.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/01/clinton-advisers-palin-pi_n_122911.html "Clinton Advisers: Palin Pick Means Bigger Role For Hillary"]; Huffington Post, September 1, 2008</ref> A ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit, "[[A Nonpartisan Message From Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton]]", counterposed Palin, played by [[Tina Fey]], against Hillary Clinton, played by [[Amy Poehler]]. Fey presented Palin as a dimwit unable to understand global politics, as emphasized by the line: "I can see Russia from my house." Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive and McCain advisor [[Carly Fiorina]] blasted that one of the [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Sarah Palin]] in a television interview: "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial,"<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iBqRMwm8pDt4bbIHnsfzUWyl_e8g "Palin imitators flood YouTube with mocking videos"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921034048/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iBqRMwm8pDt4bbIHnsfzUWyl_e8g |date=September 21, 2008 }}; AFP, September 17, 2008</ref> and an [[ABC News]] headline soon after ran, "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'".<ref>Jake Tapper.[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/now-the-mccain.html "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'"]; ABC, September 17, 2008</ref>  However, Palin stated that she found the skit amusing.

It was Senator Clinton's experience, skill and commitment to change, especially in the areas of [[health care]] and [[energy policy]], that drew such strong support. Sarah Palin's opposition to [[Roe v.

In mid September 2008, a flurry of articles circulated announcing that "Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin plan to appear next week at the same rally in New York City – perhaps the closest the two history-making women will be to each other before Election Day."<ref>[http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/16/clinton-palin-to-find-common-ground-at-iran-protest/ "Clinton, Palin to Find Common Ground at Iran Protest"]; Foxnews, September 16, 2008</ref> However, Clinton pulled out of her scheduled appearance at the rally protesting Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] when she found out Palin would also be there.<ref>[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/17/clinton-cancels-appearance-over-palin/ "Clinton cancels appearance over Palin"]; CNN, September 17, 2008</ref> "Clinton decided not to attend because she did not want to take part in a "partisan political event"," her aide said.
