'''Americans United for Separation of Church and State''' ('''Americans United''' or '''AU''' for short) is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] that advocates [[separation of church and state]]. The [[separation of church and state in the United States]] is often accepted to be provided in the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], which states "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

AU has been labeled "liberal" by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) and a "liberal activist" group by [[Fox News]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bush Judicial Nominee May Survive Senate Panel Vote|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/bush-judicial-nominee-may-survive-senate-panel-vote|date=2015-03-25|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=March 24, 2005|title=Pols Sharpen Rhetoric Over Schiavo Case|work=Associated Press|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/pols-sharpen-rhetoric-over-schiavo-case.amp|access-date=May 15, 2020}}</ref>

==Organization==
Americans United describes itself as officially non-sectarian and non-partisan. According to ''The Praeger Handbook of Religion and Education in the United States'' "It includes members from a broad religious, and non-religious, spectrum, including Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and atheists."  Its national headquarters are in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Its former executive director, [[Barry W. Lynn]], is an ordained minister in the [[United Church of Christ]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.au.org/about/authors/barry-lynn.html |title=About &#124; Americans United |website=Au.org |accessdate=2017-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130054120/http://au.org/about/authors/barry-lynn.html/ |archive-date=2016-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as an attorney involved with civil liberties issues.

==History==
Americans United for Separation of Church and State was founded on January 11, 1948,<ref name= newgroup>"New Protestant Group Seeks Taylor Recall From Vatican". ''The Baltimore Sun''. January 12, 1948. p. 1.</ref> as '''Protestants and Other Americans United for Separation of Church and State''' (POAU) by a coalition of religious, educational and civic leaders. It was made in response to proposals pending in the U.S. Congress to extend government aid to private religious schools, particularly Catholic parochial schools, which was at the time, and continues to be, the largest system of private schools in the United States.<ref name=records>{{cite web|url=http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=MC185&kw=|title=Americans United for Separation of Church and State Records (MC185): Americans United for Separation of Church and State Records|website=Diglib.princeton.edu|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611071905/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=MC185&kw=|archive-date=11 June 2011}}</ref> They believed that government support for religious education would violate church-state separation and force taxpayers to subsidize sectarian education. The decision was made to form a national organization to promote and defend this point of view.  It successfully protested against the appointment of a U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican.  They denounced the Catholic Church for disdaining democracy in the U.S. and worldwide.<ref>{{cite book|author=Elesha J.

''Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs''. [[Government of the District of Columbia]].

Its original founding members were [[Charles Clayton Morrison]], [[Glenn L. Archer]],<ref name= founders1>{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.princeton.edu/names/151868621|title=Biography: Americans United for Separation of Church and State|work=Princeton}}</ref> Edwin McNeill Poteat, [[Garfield Bromley Oxnam|G.

==Notable work==
Americans United was one of three national organizations that opposed the teaching of [[intelligent design]] in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], public schools. A federal judge struck down the policy in December 2005 (see ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]]''). More recently, Americans United has worked to secure marriage equality for gays and lesbians and has opposed religious freedom laws that would permit government officials, such as county clerks who issue marriage licenses, to refuse to serve the LGBT community. Americans United runs a project called Protect Thy Neighbor to oppose such legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protectthyneighbor.org/ |title=Protect Thy Neighbor |publisher=Protect Thy Neighbor |date=2017-04-25 |accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref>

Americans United represented residents of [[Greece, New York]], who opposed that city's practice of opening its council meetings with mostly Christian prayers. The case, ''[[Town of Greece v. Galloway]]'', went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. After the decision was issued, Americans United launched Operation Inclusion to ensure that such council prayers were as inclusive as possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://au.org/content/operation-inclusion |title=Operation Inclusion &#124; Americans United |website=Au.org |accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref>

In recent years, Americans United has worked to uphold the federal law that bars non-profit groups, including houses of worship, from intervening in partisan politics. In 1992, the group reported a New York church, the Church at Pierce Creek, to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) after the church ran newspaper ads telling people not to vote for [[Bill Clinton]]. The IRS subsequently stripped the church of its 501(c)(3) determination letter. After the church filed suit in federal court to get the determination letter back, the court noted, "because of the unique treatment churches receive under the Internal Revenue Code, the impact of the revocation is likely to be more symbolic than substantial.... Contributions will remain tax deductible as long as the donors are able to establish that the Church meets the requirements of section 501(c)(3)."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Branch Ministries and Dan Little, Pastor, Appellants v.

In May 2013, Americans United released a parody video starring [[Jane Lynch]] and [[Jordan Peele]] as "Church" and "State", respectively, undergoing a humorous musical breakup.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRBrHowWXMU|title=Jane Lynch and Jordan Peele's Epic Church-State Breakup!|date=30 May 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>

==Reception by religious community==
In its first years, a main focus of AU's activity was opposition to the political activities of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and was thus seen by critics as a Protestant-based anti-Catholic organization.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Wall of Separation | journal = Time | date = 1949-02-07 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799797,00.html}}</ref> The AU's executive director for 25 years, Reverend [[Barry W. Lynn]], is a critic of religious fundamentalism on the [[Christian right]].<ref name="WTBL">{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/13/rep-louie-gohmert-challenges-the-rev-barry-lynn-on/ | title=Rep.

Professor [[Daniel Dreisbach]] argues:
:In the mid-20th century, the rhetoric of separation was revived and ultimately constitutionalized by anti-Catholic elites, such as...Protestants and other Americans United for the Separation of Church and State...who feared the influence and wealth of the Catholic Church and perceived parochial education as a threat to public schools and democratic values.<ref>Daniel L. Dreisbach, "The Meaning of the Separation of Church and State" in {{cite book|author=Derek H. Davis, ed.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Church and State in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WX2LcraS1EgC&pg=PA219|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=219|isbn=9780195326246}}</ref>

The Catholic [[lay apostolate]] [[Church Militant (website)|Church Militant]] classifies AU as a "hate group" based on the claim that AU advances "the hateful policies based on wrong interpretations of the relationship between Church and State."<ref>https://www.churchmilitant.com/hategroups</ref>
