==History==

===1960s===
[[File:Peter Benenson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Peter Benenson]], the founder of Amnesty International. He worked for Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters|GC&CS]] at [[Bletchley Park]] during World War II.]]
Amnesty International was founded in London in July 1961 by English barrister [[Peter Benenson]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2002 |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture |publisher= Routledge |location= London |editor1-first =Peter |editor1-last= Childs |editor2-first =Mike |editor2-last= Storry |title= Amnesty International |pages= 22–23}}</ref> According to Benenson's own account, he was travelling on the [[London Underground]] on 19 November 1960 when he read that two Portuguese students from [[Coimbra]] had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in Portugal for allegedly "having drunk a toast to liberty".{{efn|name=fn1}}<ref name= Keane>{{cite book | title=An Irish Statesman and Revolutionary: The Nationalist and Internationalist Politics of Sean MacBride| first =Elizabeth | last = Keane |isbn= 978-1-84511-125-0 | year=2006 |publisher= I.B. Tauris}}</ref> Researchers have never traced the alleged newspaper article in question.{{efn|name= fn1}} In 1960, Portugal was ruled by the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] government of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]].<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Douglas L | last1 = Wheeler | first2 = Walter C | last2 = Opello | title = Historical Dictionary of Portugal | page = xxvi | publisher = Scarecrow Press | year = 2010}}.</ref> The government was authoritarian in nature and strongly [[anti-communist]], suppressing enemies of the state as anti-Portuguese. In his significant newspaper article "The Forgotten Prisoners", Benenson later described his reaction as follows: <blockquote>Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a story from somewhere of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government... The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust could be united into common action, something effective could be done.<ref name=Forgotten /></blockquote>

Benenson worked with friend [[Eric Baker (activist)|Eric Baker]]. Baker was a member of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] who had been involved in funding the British [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] as well as becoming <!--/who would also become - was this before or after 1948? --> head of [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]], and in his memoirs Benenson described him as "a partner in the launching of the project".<ref>Benenson, P. (1983). Memoir</ref> In consultation with other writers, academics and lawyers and, in particular, Alec Digges, they wrote via [[Louis Blom-Cooper]] to [[David Astor]], editor of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, who, on 28 May 1961, published Benenson's article "The Forgotten Prisoners".  The article brought the reader's attention to those "imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government"<ref name= Forgotten /> or, put another way, to violations, by governments, of articles 18 and 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). The article described these violations occurring, on a global scale, in the context of restrictions to press freedom, to political oppositions, to timely [[public trial]] before impartial courts, and to asylum. It marked the launch of "Appeal for Amnesty, 1961", the aim of which was to mobilize public opinion, quickly and widely, in defence of these individuals, whom Benenson named "Prisoners of Conscience". The "Appeal for Amnesty" was reprinted by a large number of international newspapers. In the same year, Benenson had a book published, ''Persecution 1961'', which detailed the cases of nine [[prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]] investigated and compiled by Benenson and Baker (Maurice Audin, [[Ashton Jones]], [[Agostinho Neto]], [[Patrick Duncan (anti-apartheid activist)|Patrick Duncan]], [[Olga Ivinskaya]], [[Luis Taruc]], [[Constantin Noica]], Antonio Amat and [[Hu Feng]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Buchanan | first = T. |year=2002 | title= The Truth Will Set You Free: The Making of Amnesty International | journal= Journal of Contemporary History | volume=37 | issue= 4 | pages= 575–97| doi= 10.1177/00220094020370040501 | jstor= 3180761| s2cid = 154183908 }}</ref>  In July 1961, the leadership had decided that the appeal would form the basis of a permanent organization, Amnesty, with the first meeting taking place in London. Benenson ensured that all three major political parties were represented, enlisting members of parliament from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|the Conservative Party]], and [[Liberal Party (UK)|the Liberal Party]].<ref name="guardian1">{{cite news| first =Tracy | last = McVeigh |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/29/amnesty-international-marks-50th-birthday |title=Amnesty International marks 50 years of fighting for free speech |work= The Observer |date= 29 May 2011 |location= London}}</ref> On 30 September 1962, it was officially named "Amnesty International". Between the "Appeal for Amnesty, 1961" and September 1962 the organization had been known simply as "Amnesty".<ref>{{cite book |title= Report 1962 | publisher =Amnesty International |year= 1963}}</ref>

What started as a short appeal soon became a permanent international movement working to protect those imprisoned for non-violent expression of their views and to secure worldwide recognition of Articles 18 and 19 of the UDHR. From the very beginning, research and campaigning were present in Amnesty International's work. A library was established for information about prisoners of conscience and a network of local groups, called "THREES" groups, was started.  Each group worked on behalf of three prisoners, one from each of the then three main ideological regions of the world: [[communist world|communist]], [[capitalist world|capitalist]], and [[developing world|developing]].

By the mid-1960s, Amnesty International's global presence was growing and an International Secretariat and International Executive Committee were established to manage Amnesty International's national organizations, called "Sections", which had appeared in several countries. They were secretly supported by the British government at the time.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Sellars|first=Kirsten|title=Peter Benenson in David P. Forsythe (ed.), (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), pp. 162-165.|url=https://www.academia.edu/1969187|journal=The Encyclopaedia of Human Rights|language=en}}</ref> The international movement was starting to agree on its core principles and techniques. For example, the issue of whether or not to adopt prisoners who had advocated violence, like [[Nelson Mandela]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=A flame in barbed wire : the story of Amnesty International|last=Larsen|first=Egon|publisher=Norton|year=1979|isbn=978-0393012132|edition=1st American|location=New York|oclc=4832507|url=https://archive.org/details/flameinbarbedwir00lars}}</ref> brought unanimous agreement that it could not give the name of "Prisoner of Conscience" to such prisoners. Aside from the work of the library and groups, Amnesty International's activities were expanding to helping prisoners' families, sending observers to trials, making representations to governments, and finding asylum or overseas employment for prisoners. Its activity and influence were also increasing within intergovernmental organizations; it would be awarded consultative status by the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]] and [[UNESCO]] before the decade ended.

In 1966, Benenson suspected that the British government in collusion with some Amnesty employees had suppressed a report on British atrocities in Aden.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2005-02-28|title=Peter Benenson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-benenson-13233.html|access-date=2020-10-23|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref> He began to suspect that many of his colleagues were part of a British intelligence conspiracy to subvert Amnesty, but he could not convince anybody else at AI.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Power|first=Jonathan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VegiAQAAMAAJ|title=Amnesty International, the Human Rights Story|date=1981|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-050597-1|language=en}}</ref>  Later in the same year there were further allegations, when the US government reported that [[Seán MacBride]], the former Irish foreign minister and Amnesty's first chairman, had been involved with a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] funding operation.<ref name=":1" /> MacBride denied knowledge of the funding, but Benenson became convinced that MacBride was a member of a CIA network.<ref name=":2" /> Benenson resigned as Amnesty's president on the grounds that it was bugged and infiltrated by the secret services, and said that he could no longer live in a country where such activities were tolerated.<ref name=":3" /> ''(See [[#Relationship with the british Government|Relationship with the British Government]])''

===1970s===
During the 1970s, [[Seán MacBride]] and [[Martin Ennals]] led Amnesty International. While continuing to work for prisoners of conscience, Amnesty International's purview widened to include "[[fair trial]]" and opposition to long [[detention without trial]] (UDHR Article 9), and especially to the torture of prisoners (UDHR Article 5). Amnesty International believed that the reasons underlying torture of prisoners by governments, were either to acquire and obtain information or to quell opposition by the use of terror, or both. Also of concern was the export of more sophisticated torture methods, equipment and teaching by the superpowers to "client states", for example by the United States through [[CIA transnational human rights actions|some activities of the CIA]].

Amnesty International drew together reports from countries where torture allegations seemed most persistent and organized an international conference on torture. It sought to influence public opinion to put pressure on national governments by organizing a campaign for the "Abolition of Torture", which ran for several years.

Amnesty International's membership increased from 15,000 in 1969<ref>{{cite book |title= Amnesty International Report 1968-69 |publisher= Amnesty International |year=1969}}</ref> to 200,000 by 1979.<ref>{{cite book |title= Amnesty International Report 1979 |publisher= Amnesty International |year=1980}}</ref> This growth in resources enabled an expansion of its program, "outside of the prison walls", to include work on [[forced disappearance|"disappearances"]], the death penalty and the rights of refugees. A new technique, the "Urgent Action", aimed at mobilizing the membership into action rapidly was pioneered. The first was issued on 19 March 1973, on behalf of Luiz Basilio Rossi, a Brazilian academic, arrested for political reasons.

At the intergovernmental level Amnesty International pressed for application of the UN's [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] and of existing humanitarian conventions; to secure ratifications of the two [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|UN Covenants on Human Rights]] in 1976; and was instrumental in obtaining additional instruments and provisions forbidding the practice of maltreatment. Consultative status was granted at the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] in 1972.

In 1976, Amnesty's British Section started a series of fund-raising events that came to be known as ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls]]'' series. They were staged in London initially as comedy galas featuring what the ''Daily Telegraph'' called "the crème de la crème of the British comedy world"<ref name="Monahan">{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/3561631/Hot-ticket-The-Secret-Policemans-Ball-at-the-Royal-Albert-Hall-London.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | first=Mark | last=Monahan |title= Hot ticket: The Secret Policeman's Ball at the Royal Albert Hall, London | date=4 October 2008}}</ref> including members of comedy troupe [[Monty Python]], and later expanded to also include performances by leading rock musicians. The series was created and developed by [[Monty Python]] alumnus [[John Cleese]] and entertainment industry executive [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] working closely with Amnesty staff members [[Peter Luff (Campaigner)|Peter Luff]] (Assistant Director of Amnesty 1974–78) and subsequently with Peter Walker (Amnesty Fund-Raising Officer 1978–82). Cleese, Lewis and Luff worked together on the first two shows (1976 and 1977). Cleese, Lewis and Walker worked together on the 1979 and 1981 shows, the first to carry what the ''Daily Telegraph'' described as the "rather brilliantly re-christened" ''Secret Policeman's Ball'' title.<ref name="Monahan"/>

The organization was awarded the 1977 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for its "defence of human dignity against [[torture]]"<ref name="AINobelLec">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1977/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1977 - Presentation Speech|publisher=Nobel Prize}}</ref> and the [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] in 1978.<ref name="AIUNAward">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/previous_recipients.pdf |title=United Nations Prize in the field of Human Rights }}</ref>

===1980s===

By 1980, Amnesty International was drawing more criticism from governments. The [[Soviet Union]] alleged that Amnesty International conducted espionage, the [[Moroccan government]] denounced it as a defender of lawbreakers, and the [[Government of Argentina|Argentinian government]] banned Amnesty International's 1983 annual report.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/russia/pdfs/justice-report-eng.pdf Amnesty International is accused of espionage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325142753/https://www.amnesty.org/russia/pdfs/justice-report-eng.pdf |date=25 March 2009}}</ref>

Throughout the 1980s, Amnesty International continued to campaign against torture, and on behalf of prisoners of conscience. New issues emerged, including [[extrajudicial killing]]s, military, security and police transfers, political killings, and disappearances.

Towards the end of the decade, the growing number of refugees worldwide became a focus for Amnesty International. While many of the world's refugees of the time had been displaced by war and [[famine]], in adherence to its mandate, Amnesty International concentrated on those forced to flee because of the human rights violations it was seeking to prevent. It argued that rather than focusing on new restrictions on entry for asylum-seekers, governments were to address the human rights violations which were forcing people into exile.

Apart from a second campaign on torture during the first half of the decade, two major musical events took place to increase awareness of Amnesty and of human rights (particularly among younger generations) during the mid- to late-1980s. The 1986 [[Conspiracy of Hope]] tour, which played five concerts in the US, and culminated in a daylong show, featuring some thirty-odd acts at Giants Stadium, and the 1988 [[Human Rights Now!]] world tour. Human Rights Now!, which was timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), played a series of concerts on five continents over six weeks. Both tours featured some of the most famous musicians and bands of the day.

===1990s===
Throughout the 1990s, Amnesty continued to grow, to a membership of over seven million in over 150 countries and territories,<ref name="whoai">{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are |title=Who we are |publisher=Amnesty International |access-date=16 March 2015}}</ref> led by Senegalese Secretary General [[Pierre Sané]]. Amnesty continued to work on a wide range of issues and world events. For example, South African groups joined in 1992 and hosted a visit by Pierre Sané to meet with the [[apartheid]] government to press for an investigation into allegations of police abuse, an end to arms sales to the [[African Great Lakes]] region and the abolition of the death penalty. In particular, Amnesty International brought attention to violations committed on specific groups, including [[refugee]]s, racial/ethnic/religious minorities, women and those executed or on [[Death Row]]. The death penalty report ''When the State Kills''<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/When-State-Kills-Penalty-Rights/dp/0862101646/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1467710016&sr=8-3&keywords=When+the+state+kills ''When the State Kills: The Death Penalty Vs. Human Rights''], Amnesty International, 1989 ({{ISBN|978-0862101640}}).</ref> and the "Human Rights are Women's Rights" campaign were key actions for the latter two issues.

During the 1990s, Amnesty International was forced to react to human rights violations occurring in the context of a proliferation of armed conflict in [[Angola]], [[East Timor]], the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Rwanda]], and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Amnesty International took no position on whether to support or oppose external military interventions in these armed conflicts. It did not reject the use of force, even lethal force, or ask those engaged to lay down their arms. Instead, it questioned the motives behind external intervention and selectivity of international action in relation to the strategic interests of those who sent troops. It argued that action should be taken to prevent human-rights problems from becoming human-rights catastrophes, and that both intervention and inaction represented a failure of the [[international community]].

In 1995, when AI wanted to promote how [[Shell Oil Company]] was involved with the execution of an environmental and human-rights activist [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] in Nigeria, it was stopped. Newspapers and advertising companies refused to run AI's ads because Shell Oil was a customer of theirs as well. Shell's main argument was that it was drilling oil in a country that already violated human rights and had no way to enforce human-rights policies. To combat the buzz that AI was trying to create, it immediately publicized how Shell was helping to improve overall life in Nigeria. [[Salil Shetty]], the director of Amnesty, said, "Social media re-energises the idea of the global citizen".<ref name="guardian1"/> James M. Russell notes how the drive for profit from private media sources conflicts with the stories that AI wants to be heard.<ref name=Russell>{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=James M. |title=The Ambivalence about the Globalization of Telecommunications: The Story of Amnesty International, Shell Oil Company and Nigeria |journal=Journal of Human Rights |year=2002 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=405–416|doi=10.1080/14754830210156625 |s2cid=144174755 }} Retrieved 3 March 2013.</ref>

Amnesty International was proactive in pushing for recognition of the universality of human rights. The campaign 'Get Up, Sign Up' marked 50 years of the UDHR. Thirteen million pledges were collected in support, and the Decl music concert was held in Paris on 10 December 1998 ([[Human Rights Day]]). At the intergovernmental level, Amnesty International argued in favour of creating a [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (established 1993) and an [[International Criminal Court]] (established 2002).

After his arrest in London in 1998 by the [[Metropolitan Police]], Amnesty International became involved in the legal battle of Senator [[Augusto Pinochet]], former Chilean dictator, who sought to avoid extradition to Spain to face charges. [[Lord Hoffman]] had an indirect connection with Amnesty International, and this led to an important test for the appearance of bias in legal proceedings in UK law. There was a suit<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/617425.stm |title=Legal lessons of Pinochet case |work=BBC News | date=2 March 2000 | access-date=23 April 2010}}</ref> against the decision to release Senator Pinochet, taken by the then British [[Home Secretary]] Jack Straw, before that decision had actually been taken, in an attempt to prevent the release of Senator Pinochet. The English [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] refused<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/625198.stm |title=Pinochet appeal fails |work=BBC News |date=31 January 2000 |access-date=9 February 2009 |author=uncredited}}</ref> the application, and Senator Pinochet was released and returned to Chile.

===2000s===
After 2000, Amnesty International's primary focus turned to the challenges arising from [[globalization]] and the reaction to the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the United States. The issue of globalization provoked a major shift in Amnesty International policy, as the scope of its work was widened to include economic, social and cultural rights, an area that it had declined to work on in the past. Amnesty International felt this shift was important, not just to give credence to its principle of the indivisibility of rights, but because of what it saw as the growing power of companies and the undermining of many nation states as a result of globalization.<ref>Amnesty International News Service [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/org10/005/2003/en/ "Amnesty International 26th International Council Meeting Media briefing"], 15 August 2003. Retrieved 9 January 2011.</ref>

In the aftermath of 11 September attacks, the new Amnesty International Secretary General, [[Irene Khan]], reported that a senior government official had said to Amnesty International delegates: "Your role collapsed with the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York."<ref>{{cite book|title=Amnesty International Report 2002|publisher=Amnesty International|year=2003}}</ref> In the years following the attacks, some{{Who|date=January 2010}} believe that the gains made by human rights organizations over previous decades had possibly been eroded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/articles_papers_reports/185.html|title=Revisiting Humanitarian Intervention: Post-September 11|last=Saunders|first=Joe|date=19 November 2001|publisher=Carnegie Council for Ethics in international Affairs |access-date=24 April 2016}}</ref> Amnesty International argued that human rights were the basis for the security of all, not a barrier to it. Criticism came directly from the [[Presidency of George W.

During the first half of the new decade, Amnesty International turned its attention to [[violence against women]], controls on the world [[arms industry|arms trade]], concerns surrounding the effectiveness of the UN, and ending torture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa19/001/2003/en/ |title=endtorture.org International Campaign against Torture |format=PDF }}</ref> With its membership close to two million by 2005,<ref>{{cite book|title=Amnesty International Report 2005: the state of the world's human rights|publisher=Amnesty International|year=2004|isbn=978-1-887204-42-2}}</ref> Amnesty continued to work for prisoners of conscience.

Amnesty International reported, concerning the [[Iraq War]], on 17 March 2008, that despite claims the security situation in Iraq has improved in recent months, the human rights situation is disastrous, after the start of the war five years earlier in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reports: 'Disastrous' Iraqi humanitarian crisis|publisher=CNN|date=17 March 2008|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.humanitarian/index.html|access-date=17 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080321214850/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.humanitarian/index.html| archive-date= 21 March 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==== 2016 ====
In February 2016, Amnesty International launched its annual report of human rights around the world titled "The State of the World's Human Rights". It warns from the consequences of "us vs them" speech which divided human beings into two camps. It states that this speech enhances a global pushback against human rights and makes the world more divided and more dangerous. It also states that in 2016, governments turned a blind eye to war crimes and passed laws that violate [[Free Expression Policy Project|free expression]]. Donald Trump signed an executive order in an attempt to prevent refugees from seeking resettlement in the [[United States]]. Elsewhere, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Thailand and [[Turkey]] carried out massive crackdowns, while authorities in other countries continued to implement security measures represent an infringement on rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/02/amnesty-international-annual-report-201617/|title='Politics of demonization' breeding division and fear|publisher=Amnesty International |access-date=26 February 2017}}</ref> In June 2016, Amnesty International has called on the United Nations General Assembly to "immediately suspend" [[Saudi Arabia]] from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]].<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/06/suspend-saudi-arabia-from-un-human-rights-council/ "Suspend Saudi Arabia from UN Human Rights Council"].

Amnesty International published its annual report for the year 2016–2017 on 21 February 2017. Secretary General [[Salil Shetty]]'s opening statement in the report highlighted many ongoing international abuses as well as emerging threats. Shetty drew attention, among many issues, to the [[Syrian Civil War]], the use of [[chemical weapons]] in the [[War in Darfur]], outgoing United States President [[Barack Obama]]'s expansion of [[drone warfare]], and the successful 2016 presidential election campaign of Obama's successor [[Donald Trump]]. Shetty stated that the Trump election campaign was characterized by "poisonous" discourse in which "he frequently made deeply divisive statements marked by misogyny and xenophobia, and pledged to roll back established civil liberties and introduce policies which would be profoundly inimical to human rights." In his opening summary, Shetty stated that "the world in 2016 became a darker and more unstable place."<ref>Shetty, Salil (February 2017) Amnesty International Report 2016/17, Part 1: Foreword and Regional Overviews, p. 12</ref>

In July 2017, [[Turkey|Turkish]] police detained 10 human rights activists during a workshop on digital security at a hotel near [[Istanbul]]. Eight people, including [[Idil Eser]], Amnesty International director in Turkey, as well as German [[Peter Steudtner]] and Swede Ali Gharavi, were arrested. Two others were detained but released pending trial. They were accused of aiding armed terror organizations in alleged communications with suspects linked to [[Kurd]]ish and left-wing militants, as well as the movement led by US-based Muslim cleric [[Fethullah Gulen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/amnesty-international-turkey-chief-charged-human-rights-1.4345995|title=Amnesty International's director in Turkey charged with helping terror groups|publisher=[[Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]}}</ref>

Amnesty International supported the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].

Aakar Patel, the Executive Director of the Indian branch claimed, "The Enforcement Directorate's raid on our office today shows how the authorities are now treating [[human rights organizations]] like criminal enterprises, using heavy-handed methods.

There were claims that Amnesty's inaction had been driven by undue deference to the [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Qatar]]i regimes. A hunger strike was declared by the occupiers.  On 26 April Amnesty called on the Police forcibly to eject the demonstrators, and the offices were cleared.

Amnesty International is largely made up of voluntary members, but retains a small number of paid professionals. In countries in which Amnesty International has a strong presence, members are organized as "sections". Sections co-ordinate basic Amnesty International activities normally with a significant number of members, some of whom will form into "groups", and a professional staff. Each have a board of directors. 
In 2019 there were 63 sections worldwide. "Structures" are aspiring sections. They also co-ordinate basic activities but have a smaller membership and a limited staff. In countries where no section or structure exists, people can become "international members". Two other organizational models exist: "international networks", which promote specific themes or have a specific identity, and "affiliated groups", which do the same work as section groups, but in isolation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Statute of Amnesty International |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are/accountability/statute-of-amnesty-international |publisher=Amnesty International}}</ref>

The highest governing body is the Global Assembly which meets annually. Each Section sends its Chair and Executive Director to the GA. The GA process is governed and managed by the PrepCom (Preparatory Committee).

The International Board (formerly known as the International Executive Committee [IEC]), led by the International Board Chairperson (Sarah Beamish) consists of nine members and the International Treasurer. Two members are co-opted.

The IB is elected by, and accountable to, the Global Assembly. The International Board meets at least two times during any one year and in practice meets face to face at least four times a year. Other board and sub committee meetings are undertaken via video conferencing.

The role of the International Board is to take decisions on behalf of Amnesty International, govern the International Secretariat including regional offices, implement the strategy laid out by the Global Assembly and ensure compliance with the organization's statutes.

The International Secretariat (IS) is responsible for the conduct and daily affairs of Amnesty International under direction from the International Board.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amnesty International: Founding, Structure, and Lost Vision |url= http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article.php?id=4424 |publisher=NGO Monitor |access-date=4 December 2014}}</ref> It is run by approximately 500 professional staff members and is headed by a Secretary General. The Secretariat operates several work programmes; International Law and Organizations; Research; Campaigns; Mobilization; and Communications. Its offices have been located in London since its establishment in the mid-1960s.

===Charitable status===
In the UK Amnesty International has two principal arms, Amnesty International UK and Amnesty International Charity Ltd. Both are UK-based organizations but only the latter is a charity.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1057803/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH | title = Amnesty issues public apology over golden handshakes | last =Ainsworth | first = David | date = 2011 | work = Third Sector Online | access-date = 1 August 2011}}.</ref>

==Principles==
The core principle of Amnesty International is a focus on [[prisoners of conscience]], those persons imprisoned or prevented from expressing an opinion by means of violence. Along with this commitment to opposing repression of freedom of expression, Amnesty International's founding principles included non-intervention on political questions, a robust commitment to gathering facts about the various cases and promoting human rights.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Clarke|first = Anne Marie|title = Diplomacy of Conscience: Amnesty International and Changing Human Rights Norms|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-691-05743-9|url = https://archive.org/details/diplomacyofconsc00clar}}</ref>

One key issue in the principles is in regards to those individuals who may advocate or tacitly support resorting to violence in struggles against repression. AI does not judge whether recourse to violence is justified or not. However, AI does not oppose the political use of violence in itself since [[The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], in its preamble, foresees situations in which people could "be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression". If a prisoner is serving a sentence imposed, after a fair trial, for activities involving violence, AI will not ask the government to release the prisoner.

AI neither supports nor condemns the resort to violence by political opposition groups in itself, just as AI neither supports nor condemns a government policy of using military force in fighting against armed opposition movements. However, AI supports minimum humane standards that should be respected by governments and armed opposition groups alike. When an opposition group tortures or kills its captives, takes hostages, or commits deliberate and arbitrary killings, AI condemns these abuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty-volunteer.org/aihandbook/ch3.html#violence |title=AI's Focus |publisher=Amnesty-volunteer.org }}</ref>{{Dubious|reason=www.amnesty-volunteer.org is not an official site, it's managed by members. It's unclear whether this represents AI policies accurately. A better source would help|date=July 2011}}

Amnesty International opposes capital punishment in all cases, regardless of the crime committed, the circumstances surrounding the individual or the method of execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty|title=Death Penalty|website=www.amnesty.org}}</ref>

Additionally, Amnesty International has developed ways to publicize information and mobilize public opinion. The organization considers the publication of impartial and accurate reports as one of its strengths. Reports are researched by: interviewing victims and officials, observing trials, working with local human rights activists, and monitoring the media. It aims to issue timely press releases and publishes information in newsletters and on web sites. It also sends official missions to countries to make courteous but insistent inquiries.

Campaigns to mobilize public opinion can take the form of individual, country, or thematic campaigns. Many techniques are deployed, such as direct appeals (for example, letter writing), media and publicity work, and public demonstrations. Often, fund-raising is integrated with campaigning. In 2018, the organization started to adopt a new communications strategy based on [https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/amnesty-international-wants-make-human-rights-popular/1592146 a message of shared humanity and a hope-based communications approach].

In situations which require immediate attention, Amnesty International calls on existing urgent action networks or crisis response networks; for all other matters, it calls on its membership. It considers the large size of its human resources to be another of its key strengths.

The role of Amnesty International has a significant impact on getting citizens on board with focusing on human rights issues. These groups influence countries and governments to give their people justice with pressure and in human resources. An example of Amnesty International's work is writing letters to free imprisoned people that were put there for non-violent expressions. The group now has power, attends sessions, and became a source of information for the UN. The increase in participation of non-governmental organizations changes how we live today. [[Felix Dodds]] states in a recent document: "In 1972 there were 39 democratic countries in the world; by 2002, there were 139."{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This shows that non-governmental organizations make enormous leaps within a short period of time for human rights.

Amnesty International launched a free human rights learning mobile application on called Amnesty Academy in October 2020. It offered learners across the globe access to courses both, online and offline.

Amnesty reports disproportionately on relatively more democratic and open countries,<ref name="amnesty.org">[http://www.bookdownloading.com/article/detail/document-colombia-amnesty-international-response-to-andres-ballesteros-jorge-a-restrepo-michael-spagat-juan-f-vargas-the-work-of-amnesty-international-and-human-rights-watch/ "Colombia: Amnesty International response to Andrés Ballesteros et al."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906000547/http://www.bookdownloading.com/article/detail/document-colombia-amnesty-international-response-to-andres-ballesteros-jorge-a-restrepo-michael-spagat-juan-f-vargas-the-work-of-amnesty-international-and-human-rights-watch/ |date=6 September 2015 }}, ''AMR 23/006/2007'', 21 February 2007. Retrieved on 20 January 2012.</ref> arguing that its intention is not to produce a range of reports which statistically represents the world's human rights abuses, but rather to apply the pressure of public opinion to encourage improvements.

The [[demonstration effect]] of the behaviour of both key Western governments and major non-Western states is an important factor: as one former Amnesty Secretary-General pointed out, "for many countries and a large number of people, the United States is a model," and according to one Amnesty manager, "large countries influence small countries."<ref name="ISQ05" /> In addition, with the end of the [[Cold War]], Amnesty felt that a greater emphasis on human rights in the North was needed to improve its credibility with its Southern critics by demonstrating its willingness to report on human rights issues in a truly global manner.<ref name="ISQ05" />

According to one academic study, as a result of these considerations the frequency of Amnesty's reports is influenced by a number of factors, besides the frequency and severity of human rights abuses. For example, Amnesty reports significantly more (than predicted by human rights abuses) on more economically powerful states; and on countries which receive US military aid, on the basis that this Western complicity in abuses increases the likelihood of public pressure being able to make a difference.<ref name="ISQ05" /> In addition, around 1993–94, Amnesty consciously developed its media relations, producing fewer background reports and more press releases, to increase the impact of its reports. Press releases are partly driven by news coverage, to use existing news coverage as leverage to discuss Amnesty's human rights concerns. This increases Amnesty's focus on the countries the media is more interested in.<ref name="ISQ05" />

In 2012, [[Kristyan Benedict]], Amnesty UK's campaign manager whose main focus is Syria, listed several countries as "regimes who abuse peoples' basic universal rights": [[Burma]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[North Korea]] and [[Sudan]]. Benedict was criticized for including Israel in this short list on the basis that his opinion was garnered solely from "his own visits", with no other objective sources.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dysch|first=Marcus|title=Amnesty International defends official accused of anti-Israel bias|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/70222/amnesty-international-defends-official-accused-anti-israel-bias|publisher=Amnesty International|date=19 July 2012|access-date=27 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="Peretz">{{Cite journal|last=Peretz|first=Martin|title=Amnesty International Official Calls Israel A 'Scum State'|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/77239/amnesty-international-official-calls-israel-scum-state |journal=The New Republic|date=26 August 2010|access-date=5 July 2016}}</ref>

Amnesty's country focus is similar to that of some other comparable NGOs, notably [[Human Rights Watch]]: between 1991 and 2000, Amnesty and HRW shared eight of ten countries in their "top ten" (by Amnesty press releases; 7 for Amnesty reports).<ref name="ISQ05" /> In addition, six of the 10 countries most reported on by Human Rights Watch in the 1990s also made ''[[The Economist]]''<nowiki/>'s and ''[[Newsweek]]''<nowiki/>'s "most covered" lists during that time.<ref name="ISQ05" />

==Funding==
Amnesty International is financed largely by fees and donations from its worldwide membership. It says that it does not accept donations from governments or governmental organizations.

=== Relationship with the British Government ===
During the early history of Amnesty international, as it is now proven by various documents, it was secretly supported by the Foreign Office. In 1963, the FO instructed its operatives abroad to provide “discreet support” for Amnesty's campaigns. In the same year, Benenson wrote to Colonial Office Minister Lord Lansdowne a proposal to prop up a “refugee counsellor” on the border of what now is Botswana and apartheid South Africa. Amnesty intended to assist people fleeing across the border from neighboring South Africa, but not those who were actively engaged in the struggle against apartheid. Benenson wrote:<blockquote>I would like to reiterate our view that these [British] territories should not be used for offensive political action by the opponents of the South African Government (...) Communist influence should not be allowed to spread in this part of Africa, and in the present delicate situation, Amnesty International would wish to support Her Majesty’s Government in any such policy.<ref name=":3" /></blockquote>The year after, the AI dropped [[Nelson Mandela]] as a “prisoner of conscience”, because he was convicted of violence by the South African Government. [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]] had also been a member of the [[South African Communist Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mandela and the South African Communist Party {{!}} South African History Online|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/mandela-and-south-african-communist-party|access-date=2020-10-27|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>

In a trip to Haiti, the British FO had also assisted Benenson in his mission to Haiti, where he was disguised because of fear of the Haitians finding out that the British government sponsored his visit. When his disguise was revealed, Benenson was severely criticized by the media.<ref name=":3" />

In the British colony of Aden, a province in Yemen, a Swedish amnesty employee wrote a report on torture in a British prison. The report wasn't published by Amnesty. There were different allegations as to why it didn't get published. According to Benenson, Amnesty general secretary [[Robert Swann (human rights campaigner)|Robert Swann]] had suppressed it in deference to the Foreign Office. According to co-founder [[Eric Baker (activist)|Eric Baker]], both Benenson and Swann had met Foreign Secretary [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] in September and told him that they were willing to hold up publication if the Foreign Office promised this wouldn't occur again. A memo by Lord Chancellor [[Gerald Gardiner, Baron Gardiner|Gerald Gardiner]], a labour politician, states that: <blockquote>Amnesty held the Swedish complaint as long as they could simply because Peter Benenson did not want to do anything to hurt a Labour government.<ref name=":3" /></blockquote>Benenson then travelled to Aden and reported that he had never seen an "uglier situation" in his life. He then said that British agents had infiltrated Amnesty and repressed the report. Later, documents surfaced implicating Benenson had connections to the British government, which started the [[Harry letters affair]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> He then resigned, claiming that British and American intelligence had infiltrated Amnesty and subverted its values.<ref name=":1" /> After this set of events, which were dubbed by some the "Amnesty Crisis of 1966-67",<ref>{{Cite book|last=BUCHANAN|first=TOM|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article-abstract/15/3/267/1702572|title=Amnesty International in Crisis, 1966–7|publisher=Oxford Academic}}</ref> the relationship between Amnesty and the British Government was suspended. AI vowed that in future, it “must not only be independent and impartial but must not be put into a position where anything else could even be alleged” and the Foreign Office cautioned that “for the time being our attitude to Amnesty International must be one of reserve”.<ref name=":3" />

===Approval of Iraq Incubator falsities===
{{main|Nayirah testimony}}
In 1990, when the United States government was deciding whether or not to invade [[Iraq]], a Kuwaiti woman, known to Congress by her first name only, Nayirah, told the congress that when Iraq invaded [[Kuwait]], she stayed behind after some of her family left the country. She said she was volunteering in a local hospital when Iraqi soldiers stole the [[Incubator (neonatal)|incubators]] with children in them and left them to freeze to death. Amnesty International, which had human rights investigators in Kuwait, confirmed the story and helped spread it. The organization also inflated the number of children who were killed by the robbery to over 300, more than the number of incubators available in the city hospitals of the country. It was often cited by people, including the [[Member of Congress|members of Congress]] who voted to approve the [[Gulf War]], as one of the reasons to fight. After the war, it was found that the woman was lying, the story was made up, and her last name was not given because her father was a delegate for Kuwait's government at the same congressional hearing.<ref>{{Citation|last=Democracy Now!|title=How False Testimony and a Massive U.S. Propaganda Machine Bolstered George H.W.

Retrieved 21 February 2011.</ref> Peter Pack, the chairman of Amnesty's International Executive Committee (IEC), initially stated on 19 February 2011: "The payments to outgoing secretary general Irene Khan shown in the accounts of AI (Amnesty International) Ltd for the year ending 31 March 2010 include payments made as part of a confidential agreement between AI Ltd and Irene Khan"<ref name=expr/> and that "It is a term of this agreement that no further comment on it will be made by either party."<ref name=civsoc/>

The payment and AI's initial response to its leakage to the press led to considerable outcry. [[Philip Davies]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Shipley (UK Parliament constituency)|Shipley]], criticized the payments, telling the ''[[Daily Express]]'': "I am sure people making donations to Amnesty, in the belief they are alleviating poverty, never dreamed they were subsidising a fat cat payout. This will disillusion many benefactors."<ref name=expr/> On 21 February 2011, Peter Pack issued a further statement, in which he said that the payment was a "unique situation" that was "in the best interest of Amnesty's work" and that there would be no repetition of it.<ref name=civsoc/> He stated that "the new secretary general, with the full support of the IEC, has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again."<ref name=civsoc/> Pack also stated that Amnesty was "fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights".<ref name=civsoc/>

On 25 February 2011, Pack sent a letter to Amnesty members and staff. In 2008, it stated, the IEC decided not to prolong Khan's contract for a third term. In the following months, IEC discovered that due to British employment law, it had to choose between three options: offering Khan a third term; discontinuing her post and, in their judgement, risking legal consequences; or signing a confidential agreement and issuing a pay compensation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pack |first=Peter |title=A letter to all AI members and staff from the International Executive Committee. |url=http://www.amnesty.se/upload/files/2011/05/19/IEC%20letter%20to%20the%20movement%2025.2.11.pdf |access-date=25 January 2012 |archive-date=10 December 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CnRS7gz0?url=http://www.amnesty.se/upload/files/2011/05/19/IEC%20letter%20to%20the%20movement%2025.2.11.pdf |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

===2019 Report on workplace bullying within Amnesty International===
{{Main|Criticism of Amnesty International#2019 Bullying Report}}

In February 2019, Amnesty International's management team offered to resign after an independent report found what it called a "toxic culture" of [[workplace bullying]]. Evidence of [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[sexism]] and [[racism]] was uncovered after two 2018 suicides were investigated: that of 30-year Amnesty veteran [[Gaëtan Mootoo]] in Paris in May 2018 (who left a [[Suicide note|note]] citing work pressures); and that of 28-year-old intern Rosalind McGregor in Geneva in July 2018.<ref name=RTE2019-02-23a/> An internal survey by the Konterra group with a team of psychologists was conducted in January 2019, after the 2 employees had killed themselves in 2018. The report stated that Amnesty had a toxic work culture and that workers frequently cited mental and physical health issues as a result of their work for the organization. The report found that: "39 per cent of Amnesty International staff reported that they developed mental or physical health issues as the direct result of working at Amnesty". The report concluded, "organisational culture and management failures are the root cause of most staff wellbeing issues.".<ref>[https://unitetheunion.org/news-events/news/2019/february/radical-change-needed-at-amnesty-international-after-new-report-reveals-toxic-work-culture/ Radical change needed at Amnesty International after new report reveals ‘toxic’ work culture], ''[[Unite the Union]]'', 7 February 2019</ref>

Elaborating on this the report mentioned that bullying, public humiliation and other abuses of power are common place and routine practice by the management. It also claimed the us versus them culture among employees and the severe lack of trust in the senior management at Amnesty.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/amnesty-international-has-toxic-working-culture-report-finds|title=Amnesty International has toxic working culture, report finds|last=McVeigh|first=Karen|date=6 February 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 September 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/document/?indexNumber=org60%2f9763%2f2019&language=en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=20 September 2019}}</ref> By October 2019 five of the seven members of the senior leadership team at Amnesty's international secretariat left the organization with "generous" redundancy packages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anger-over-big-payoffs-for-bosses-at-toxic-amnesty-8hzzkxlbm|title=Anger over big payoffs for bosses at toxic Amnesty|last=O’Neill|first=Sean|date=28 May 2019|work=The Times|access-date=18 October 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> Among them, Anna Neistat, who was Gaëtan Mootoo's senior manager directly implicated in the independent report on Mootoo's death. According to Mootoo's former collaborator, Salvatore Saguès, "Gaëtan’s case is merely the tip of the iceberg at Amnesty. A huge amount of suffering is caused to employees. Since the days of Salil Shetty, when top management were being paid fabulous salaries, Amnesty has become a multinational where the staff are seen as dispensable. Human resources management is a disaster and nobody is prepared to stand up and be counted. The level of impunity granted to Amnesty’s bosses is simply unacceptable."<ref>[http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20190525-boisbouvier-translation Can Amnesty recover from this tragic death?], ''[[Radio France Internationale|RFI]]'', 26 May 2019</ref> After none of the managers responsible of bullying at Amnesty were held accountable a group of workers petitioned for Amnesty's chief [[Kumi Naidoo]] to resign. On 5 December 2019 Naidoo resigned from his post of Amnesty's Secretary General citing ill health<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and appointing Julie Verhaar as an interim Secretary General. In their petition, workers demanded her immediate resignation as well.

===Kurdish Hunger Strike occupation===

In April 2019, 30 [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] activists, some of whom are on an indefinite [[hunger strike]], occupied Amnesty International's building in [[London]] in a peaceful protest, in order to speak out against Amnesty's silence on the isolation of [[Abdullah Öcalan]] in a Turkish prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/04/protest-at-amnesty-international-office/|title=Protest at Amnesty International office|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref> The hunger strikers have also spoken out about "delaying tactics" by Amnesty, and being denied access to toilets during the occupation, despite this being a human right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bylinetimes.com/2019/04/26/kurdish-hunger-strikers-occupy-amnesty-international-hq/|title=Kurdish Hunger Strikers Occupy Amnesty International HQ|last=Times|first=Byline|date=26 April 2019|website=Byline Times|language=en-GB|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/hunger-strikers-accuse-amnesty-international-of-hypocrisy|title=Hunger-strikers accuse Amnesty International of hypocrisy|last1=SabinFriday|first1=Lamiat|last2=April 26|date=26 April 2019|website=Morning Star|language=en|access-date=17 June 2019|last3=2019}}</ref> Two of the hunger strikers, Nahide Zengin and Mehmet Sait Zengin, received [[paramedic]] treatment and were taken to hospital during the occupation.

===2019 Budgetary crisis controversy===

In May 2019 Amnesty International's Secretary General [[Kumi Naidoo]] admitted to a hole in the organization's budget of up to £17m in donor money to the end of 2020. In order to deal with the budgetary crisis Naidoo announced to staff that the organization's headquarters would have cut almost 100 jobs as a part of urgent restructuring. [[Unite the Union]], the UK's biggest trade union, said the redundancies were a direct result of "overspending by the organisation’s senior leadership team" and have occurred "despite an increase in income".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/06/amnesty-international-to-make-almost-100-staff-redundant Amnesty International to make almost 100 staff redundant], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 June 2019</ref> Unite, which represents Amnesty's staff, feared that cuts would fall heaviest on lower income staff. It said that in the previous year the top 23 highest earners at Amnesty International were paid a total of £2.6m– an average of £113,000 per year. Unite demanded a review of whether it is necessary to have so many managers in the organisation.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/27/amnesty-international-staff-braced-for-redundancies Amnesty International staff braced for redundancies], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 April 2019</ref>

Amnesty's budgetary crisis became public after the two staff suicides in 2019. A subsequent independent review of workplace culture found a “state of emergency” at the organization after a restructuring process. Following several reports that labelled Amnesty a toxic workplace, in October 2019 five of the seven high-paid senior directors at Amnesty's international secretariat in London left the organization with "generous" redundancy packages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anger-over-big-payoffs-for-bosses-at-toxic-amnesty-8hzzkxlbm|title=Anger over big payoffs for bosses at toxic Amnesty|last=O’Neill|first=Sean|date=28 May 2019|work=The Times|access-date=30 January 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref> This included Anna Neistat, who was a senior manager directly implicated in the independent report on the suicide of Amnesty's West Africa researcher Gaëtan Mootoo in the organization's Paris office. The size of exit packages granted to former senior management caused anger among other staff and an outcry among Amnesty's members.

After the resignation of Amnesty International's Secretary General [[Kumi Naidoo]] in December 2019, a new International Board was elected. In addition to leading the recovery period of the international secretariat, the Board also has to recruit a new Secretary General, manage costs, develop a new global strategy, and ensure delivery of Amnesty's activities. A new senior director, Chief Financial Officer Nigel Armitt, was appointed to the International Secretariat, to manage budgetary crisis. The company stated that Armitt "oversees financial management at the International Secretariat and is responsible for supporting and fostering the organisation’s financial literacy and capability".<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/about-us/secretary-general-and-senior-leadership-team/ Secretary General and Coalition Leadership Team], ''Amnesty International'', 31 January 2020</ref>

===2020 Secret payout controversy===

In September 2020 The Times reported that Amnesty International paid £800,000 in compensation over the workplace suicide of [[Gaëtan Mootoo]] and demanded his family keep the deal secret.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/amnestys-secret-800-000-payout-after-suicide-of-gaetan-mootoo-lqnq79c99|title=Amnesty's secret £800,000 payout after suicide of Gaetan Mootoo|website=www.thetimes.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-10-11}}</ref> The pre-trial agreement between London-based Amnesty's International Secretariat and Motoo's wife was reached on the condition that she keeps the deal secret by signing NDA. This was done particularly to prevent discussing the settlement with the press or on social media. The arrangmenent led to criticism on social media, with people asking why an organisation such as Amnesty would condone the use of non-disclosure agreements. Shaista Aziz, co-founder of the feminist advocacy group NGO Safe Space, questioned on Twitter why the “world’s leading human rights organisation” was employing such contracts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/amnesty-international-criticised-using-non-disclosure-agreement-relation-alleged-800k-payment/governance/article/1695969|title=Amnesty International criticised for using non-disclosure agreement in relation to alleged £800k payment|website=www.thirdsector.co.uk/|language=en|access-date=2020-10-11}}</ref> The source of the money was unknown. Amnesty stated that the payout to Motoo's family "will not be made from donations or membership fees".

==Cultural impact==
===Human rights concerts===
{{main|Human rights concerts}}
[[File:HumanRightsNowPhiladelphia.jpg|225px|thumb|Opening stages of the 19 September 1988 show at [[Philadelphia]]'s [[JFK Stadium]].]]
''[[A Conspiracy of Hope]]'' was a short tour of six [[benefit concert]]s on behalf of Amnesty International that took place in the United States during June 1986.  The purpose of the tour was not to raise funds but rather to increase awareness of human rights and of Amnesty's work on its 25th anniversary. The shows were headlined by [[U2]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Bryan Adams]] and also featured [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[The Neville Brothers]]. The last three shows featured a reunion of [[The Police]]. At a press conferences in each city, at related media events, and through their music at the concerts themselves, the artists engaged with the public on themes of human rights and human dignity.  The six concerts were the first of what subsequently became known collectively as the Human Rights Concerts – a series of music events and tours staged by [[Amnesty International USA]] between 1986 and 1998.

''[[Human Rights Now!]]'' was a worldwide tour of twenty [[benefit concert]]s on behalf of Amnesty International that took place over six weeks in 1988.  Held not to raise funds but to increase awareness of both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] on its 40th anniversary and the work of Amnesty International, the shows featured [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tracy Chapman]], and [[Youssou N'Dour]], plus guest artists from each of the countries where concerts were held.

===Artists for Amnesty===
Amnesty International, through its "Artists for Amnesty" programme has also endorsed various cultural media works for what its leadership often consider accurate or educational treatments of real-world topics that fall within the range of Amnesty's concern:
