The '''Forbes 400''' or '''400 Richest Americans''' is a list published by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine of the wealthiest 400 [[Citizenship of the United States|American citizens]] who own assets in the U.S., ranked by [[net worth]]. The 400 was started by [[Malcolm Forbes]] in 1982 and the list is published annually around September.<ref>Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes Oct. 2010 p.17. Print.</ref> Peter W. Bernstein and [[Annalyn Swan]] describe the Forbes 400 as capturing "a period of extraordinary individual and entrepreneurial energy, a time unlike the extended postwar years, from 1945 to 1982, when American society emphasized the power of corporations." Bernstein and Swan also describe it as representing "a powerful argument – and sometimes a dream – about the social value of wealth in contemporary America."<ref name="Bernstein, Peter W. 2007">Bernstein, Peter W., and Annalyn Swan, eds.

[[Inherited wealth]] may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head start".<ref name="Salon-20140324">{{cite web |last=Bruenig |first=Matt |title=You call this a meritocracy?

==Criteria==
The Forbes 400 reports who has the most wealth in the [[United States]]. They annually create a list of the richest people in America to exhibit the shape of the economy. The magazine displays the story of someone's rise to fame, their company, age, industrial residence, and education. The list portrays the financial shift of trends, leadership positions, and growing philanthropy intentions.<ref name="2010p23">Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes October 2010 p.23.

===First list (1982)===
In the first Forbes 400 list,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/seankilachand/2012/09/20/the-forbes-400-hall-of-fame-36-members-of-our-debut-issue-still-in-ranks/|title=The Forbes 400 Hall Of Fame: 36 Members Of Our Debut Issue Still In Ranks|first=Sean|last=Kilachand}}</ref> there were only 13 billionaires, and a net worth of {{US$|75}} million secured a spot on the list. The 1982 list represented 2.8% of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] of the United States. The 1982 Forbes 400 had 22.8% of the list composed of oil fortunes, with 15.3% from manufacturing, 9% from finance and only 3% from technology-driven fortunes. The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] had the most representation on the list with 77 members followed by [[California]] with 48.<ref>Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes October 2010 p.20. Print.</ref>

===2000===
In the year 2000, Forbes 400 saw the highest percent of the Gross Domestic Product represented by the list at 12.2% driven by the internet boom.<ref>Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes October 2010 p.19. Print.</ref>

===Controversies===

In April 2018, an ex-''Forbes'' reporter Jonathan Greenberg alleged that [[Donald Trump]] had inflated his actual wealth in order to be included on the Forbes 400 listing. Greenberg provided original audio recordings of his 1984 exchange with "John Barron", one of the [[pseudonyms of Donald Trump]], and eventually included Trump at the end of the Forbes 400 list at $100 million, one fifth of the $500 million which "Barron" was claiming as Donald Trump's net worth. This figure was later corrected and, following civil proceedings years later, Trump admitted the name was fabricated.<ref name="Borchers">{{cite news|last=Borchers|first=Callum|title=The amazing story of Donald Trump's old spokesman, John Barron – who was actually Donald Trump himself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/21/the-amazing-story-of-donald-trumps-old-spokesman-john-barron-who-was-actually-donald-trump-himself/|accessdate=July 20, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-lied-to-me-about-his-wealth-to-get-onto-the-forbes-400-here-are-the-tapes/2018/04/20/ac762b08-4287-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|title=Perspective Trump lied to me about his wealth to get onto the Forbes 400.

==Demographics==

Over the first 25 years of the Forbes 400 list, 1,302 distinct people made the list. In that time period, 97 immigrants (7.5%) and 202 women (15.5%) made the list. Four of the top five richest people in the United States in 2006 were college dropouts: [[Bill Gates]], [[Sheldon Adelson]], [[Larry Ellison]], and [[Paul Allen]].<ref name="Bernstein, Peter W. 2007"/>

A few articles draw on data of the Forbes 400 to test an evolutionary hypothesis referred to as the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]. This hypothesis predicts that parents of high socioeconomic status produce more male offspring than parents of lower socioeconomic status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|last2=Willard|first2=Dan E.|s2cid=29326420|year=1973|title=Natural selection of parental ability to vary the sex ratio of offspring|journal=Science|volume=179|issue=4068|pages=90–92|doi=10.1126/science.179.4068.90|pmid=4682135|bibcode=1973Sci...179...90T}}</ref> Whereas an earlier study using data on the Forbes 400 shows a strong effect for U.S. billionaires that is consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cameron | first1 = E. Z. | last2 = Dalerum | first2 = F. | editor1-last = Reby | editor1-first = David | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004195 | title = A Trivers-Willard Effect in Contemporary Humans: Male-Biased Sex Ratios among Billionaires | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4195 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19142225| pmc =2614476 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4195C }}</ref> a more recent study shows some caveats: First, the result is only consistent for male, but not female, billionaires. Second, it can only be found among heirs and not self-made billionaires.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal | last1 = Schnettler | first1 = S. | editor1-last = Sorci | editor1-first = Gabriele | title = Revisiting a Sample of U.S. Billionaires: How Sample Selection and Timing of Maternal Condition Influence Findings on the Trivers-Willard Effect | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0057446 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = e57446 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23437389| pmc = 3578789| bibcode = 2013PLoSO...857446S }}</ref>

This has to do with the timing of wealth accumulation: some self-made billionaires had their children before they were rich, but heirs, by definition, were rich before ever becoming parents (see also <ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cameron | first1 = E. Z. | title = Facultative adjustment of mammalian sex ratios in support of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis: Evidence for a mechanism | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2773 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 271 | issue = 1549 | pages = 1723–1728| year = 2004 | pmid =  15306293| pmc = 1691777}}</ref>). Third, the size of the effect was largely overestimated, given that the male offspring of billionaires as compared to female offspring is easier to find on the Web: Women sometimes change their last name upon marriage which makes some harder to find. Therefore, earlier reports on the male bias among billionaire offspring were partially an artifact of sample selection.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 2010, a [[Business Insider]] ethnic-demographic breakdown of the Forbes 400 richest Americans found 3 gay people, 4 [[Indian Americans|Indians]], 6 [[Asian Americans|(non-Indian) Asians]], and 34 women on the list.<ref name="businessinsider2010">{{cite web | last=Nolan | first=Hamilton | title=The Forbes 400: A Demographic Breakdown | website=Business Insider | date=September 23, 2010 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-forbes-400-a-demographic-breakdown-2010-9 | access-date=December 30, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, [[American Jews]] made up as many as 30% of the richest 100,<ref name="businessinsider2010"/> and (at least, in 2009) 139 of the Forbes 400.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2009/10/05/fundermentalist/at-least-139-of-the-forbes-400-are-jewish#ixzz2XBm3uBTN|title=At least 139 of the Forbes 400 are Jewish - Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org}}</ref> In 2017, just two [[African Americans]] made the Forbes 400: [[media proprietor]] [[Oprah Winfrey]] and tech investor [[Robert F.
