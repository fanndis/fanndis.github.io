The '''Pontiac Firebird''' is an American automobile that was built and produced by [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] from the 1967 to 2002 model years. Designed as a [[pony car]] to compete with the [[Ford Mustang]] and [[Mercury Cougar]], it was introduced on February 23, 1967, simultaneous with [[General Motors|GM's]] [[Chevrolet]] division [[automobile platform|platform-sharing]] [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]].<ref name="Red Book" /> This also coincided with the release of the 1967 [[Mercury Cougar]], Ford's upscale, platform-sharing version of the Mustang.<ref>{{cite web|title=1967 Cougar |url= http://www.musclecarfacts.com/mercury-cougar/383-1967-cougar |access-date=June 10, 2015 |publisher=Muscle Car Facts |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610172036/http://www.musclecarfacts.com/mercury-cougar/383-1967-cougar |archive-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Montievo |first=Andrew |title=How the Mercury Cougar shaped today's luxury cars |url= http://techgenmag.com/2015/06/02/how-mercury-cougar-shaped-luxury-cars/ |magazine=Tech Gen Magazine |date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>

The name "Firebird" was also previously used by GM for the [[General Motors Firebird]] in the 1950s and early 1960s [[concept car]]s.

The first generation Firebird had characteristic [[Coke bottle styling]] shared with its cousin, the [[Chevrolet Camaro]]. Announcing a Pontiac styling trend, the Firebird's bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end, giving it a more streamlined look than the Camaro. The Firebird's rear "slit" taillights were inspired by the 1966–1967 [[Pontiac GTO]]. Both a two-door [[hardtop]] and a [[convertible]] were offered through the 1969 model year. Originally, the car was a "consolation prize" for Pontiac, which had desired to produce a two-seat sports car based on its original [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee]] concept car. However, GM feared this would cut into [[Chevrolet Corvette]] sales, and gave Pontiac a piece of the "[[pony car]]" market through sharing the [[GM F platform|F-body]] platform with [[Chevrolet]].

The 1967 base model Firebird came equipped with the [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#Overhead cam|Pontiac {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} SOHC inline-six]]. Based on the standard 
[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|Chevrolet {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} inline-six]], it was fitted with a single-barrel [[carburetor]] and rated at {{cvt|165|hp}}.<ref name="Red Book" /> The "Sprint" model six came with a four-barrel carburetor, developing {{cvt|215|hp}}.<ref name=Kowalke_oldCars>{{cite news|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=The Six-cylinder Firebird Sprint: Slouch or sleeper?|url= http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/features/bill-krause-1967-firebird-sprint |publisher=Old Cars Weekly |date=26 May 2010}}</ref> Most buyers opted for one of three [[V8 engine|V8]]s: the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1}} with a two-barrel carburetor producing {{cvt|250|hp|0|abbr=}}; the four-barrel "HO" (high output) 326, producing {{cvt|285|hp}}; or the {{cvt|325|hp}} {{cvt|400|CID|L|1}} from the GTO. All 1967–1968 400&nbsp;CI engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetors' second barrels from fully opening.<ref name="Red Book" /> A "Ram Air" option was also available, providing functional hood scoops, higher flow heads with stronger valve springs, and a hotter [[camshaft]]. Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the conventional 400&nbsp;HO, but peaked at 5,200 rpm.

The {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines were subsequently replaced in 1968 by the [[Chevrolet Inline 6 engine#250|Chevrolet {{cvt|250|CID|L|1}}]] stroked {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines, the first developing an increased {{cvt|175|hp}} using a single-barrel carburetor, and the other the same 215&nbsp;hp with a four-barrel carburetor. Also for the 1968 model, the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was replaced by the [[Pontiac V8 engine#350|Pontiac {{cvt|350|CID|L|1}} V8]], which actually displaced {{cvt|355|CID|L|1}}, and produced {{cvt|265|hp}} with a two-barrel carburetor. An HO version of the {{cvt|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with a revised cam was also offered starting in that year, which developed {{cvt|320|hp|0|abbr=}}. Power output of the other engines was increased marginally.<ref name="Red Book" />

There was an additional [[Ram-air intake|Ram Air]] IV option for the {{cvt|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]]s during 1969, complementing the Ram Air III; these generated {{convert|345|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|430|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 3400 rpm;<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=224763|title=Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, 1970 MY 2887|website=Carfolio.com |date=2014-05-01| access-date= August 6, 2018}}</ref> and {{convert|335|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The {{Convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} HO engine was revised again with a different cam and [[cylinder head]]s resulting in {{cvt|325|hp}}. During 1969 a special {{cvt|303|CID|L|1}} engine was designed for [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] road racing applications that was not available in production cars.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pontiac Firebird |url= https://musclecarclub.com/pontiac-firebird/ |website=Muscle Car Club |date=30 March 2015 |access-date=21 September 2020}}</ref>

The styling difference from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of [[Automotive lighting#Lateral|federally-mandated side marker lights]]: for the front of the car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door [[Quarter glass|vent-windows]] were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system. The 1969 model received a major [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] with a new front end design but unlike the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM's new locking ignition switch/steering wheel.<ref name="Red Book" />

In March 1969, a $1,083<ref>Hemmings Motor News, Terry Shea July 2013</ref> optional handling package called the "Trans Am performance and appearance package", UPC "WS4", named after the [[Trans Am Series]], was introduced. A total of 689 hardtops and eight convertibles were made.<ref name="Red Book" />

Due to engineering problems that delayed the introduction of the all-new 1970 Firebird beyond the usual fall debut, Pontiac continued production of 1969 model Firebirds into the early months of the 1970 model year (the other 1970 Pontiac models had been introduced on September 18, 1969). By late spring of 1969, Pontiac had deleted all model-year references on Firebird literature and promotional materials, anticipating the extended production run of the then-current 1969 models.

The second-generation debut for the 1970 model year was delayed until February 26, 1970, because of tooling and engineering problems; thus, its popular designation as a 1970½ model, while leftover 1969s were listed in early Pontiac literature without a model-year identification.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1970-pontiac-firebird.htm |title=1970s Pontiac Firebird |author=Editors of Publications International |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=December 21, 2007 |access-date=February 27, 2011}}</ref> This generation of Firebirds were available in coupe form only; after the 1969 model year, convertibles were not available until 1989.

Replacing the "Coke bottle" styling was a more "swoopy" body style, while still retaining some traditional elements. The top of the rear window line going almost straight down to the lip of the trunk lid, a look that was to epitomize F-body styling for the longest period during the Firebird's lifetime. The new design was initially characterized by a large [[Pillar (car)|B-pillar]], until 1975 when the rear window was enlarged.

===1970===
There were two [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|Ram Air]] [[Pontiac V8 engine#400|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines]] for 1970: the {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}} L74 [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air III|Ram Air III]] ({{convert|366|hp|abbr=on}} in GTO) and the {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} LS1 [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air IV|Ram Air IV]] ({{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}} in GTO) that were carried over from 1969. The difference between the GTO and Firebird engines was that the secondary carburetor's throttle linkage had a restrictor which prevented the rear barrels from opening completely,<ref name="Red Book" /> adjusting the linkage could allow full carburetor operation resulting in identical engine performance.

For the 1970 and 1971 model years, all Firebirds equipped with radios had the antennas mounted "in-glass" in the windshield.<ref name="Red Book" />

===1971===
[[File:'71 Pontiac Trans Am (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|right|1971 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]

The [[Pontiac V8 engine#455|Pontiac {{convert|455|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] first became available in the second generation Firebird in 1971. The 455 engine was available in the L75 {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}} version and the LS5 335&nbsp;hp HO version, which was the standard, and only engine option, for the Trans Am. The HO engine also included Ram Air IV.<ref name="Red Book" />

===1972===
During a 1972 strike, the Firebird (and the similar [[GM F platform|F-body]] [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]]) were nearly dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flory |first=J. Kelly |title=American Cars, 1960–1972: Every Model, Year by Year |url= https://archive.org/details/americancarsever00flor_944 |url-access=limited | publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7864-1273-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americancarsever00flor_944/page/n886 881]}}</ref>

Again the 455HO was the only engine available for the Trans Am.<ref name="Red Book" />

Starting in 1972, and continuing until 1977, the Firebird was only produced at the [[Norwood Assembly|Norwood, Ohio]], facility.<ref name="Red Book" />

===1973===
Actual production cars yielded 1/4 mile results in the high 14 to 15.0 second/98&nbsp;mph range (sources: ''Motor Trend Magazine'', July '73 and Roger Huntington's book, ''American Supercar'') – results that are consistent with a 3,850 pound car (plus driver) and the engine equipped with a 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]] rated at a maximum power of {{convert|290|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm figure.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hotrod.com/articles/pontiac-trans-sd-455-pontiac-save-best-muscle-car-last/ |title=Hot Rod: Pontiac save best muscle car last |website=hotrod.com |access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref> An original rating of {{convert|310|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net]] had been assigned to the SD-455, though that rating was based on the emissions non-compliant "pre-production" engines, as mentioned above. That rating appeared in published 1973 model year Pontiac literature, which had been printed prior to the "pre-production" engines "barely passing" emissions testing, and the last minute switch to what became the production engine. The 1974 model year production literature listed the specifications of the production engine (290 SAE net horsepower).

In 1973 and 1974, a special version of the 455, called the Super Duty 455 (SD-455), was offered. The SD-455 consisted of a strengthened cylinder block that included four-bolt main bearings and added material in various locations for improved strength. Original plans called for a forged [[crankshaft]], although actual production SD455s received nodular iron crankshafts with minor enhancements. Forged rods and forged aluminum [[piston]]s were specified, as were unique high-flow cylinder heads.

The 480737 code cam (identical grind to the RAIV "041" cam) was originally specified for the SD455 engine and was fitted into the "pre-production" test cars (source: former Pontiac special projects engineer McCully), one of which was tested by both ''Hot Rod'' and ''Car and Driver'' magazines. However, actual production cars were fitted with the milder 493323 cam and 1.5:1 rocker ratios, due to the ever-tightening emissions standards of the era. This cam and rocker combination, combined with a low compression ratio of 8.4:1 advertised (7.9:1 actual) yielded 290 SAE net horsepower. Production SD455 cars did not have functional hood scoops, while the "pre-production" test cars did.

A production line stock SD455 produced 253 rear wheel HP on a chassis dyno, as reported by ''High Performance Pontiac'' magazine (January 2007). This is also consistent with the 290 SAE net horsepower factory rating (as measured at the crankshaft). Skip McCully verified that no production SD455s released to the public were fitted with the 480737 cam. When asked about the compromises for the production SD455 engine, McCully responded, "Compression, camshaft, jetting, and vacuum advance." He followed by stating that he would have preferred a [[compression ratio]] of 10.25:1, a camshaft with 041 valve timing, slightly richer carburetor jetting, and as much vacuum advance as the engine would tolerate. However, that proved to be impossible due to the emissions regulations of the era. A June 1974 test of a newly delivered, privately owned SD-455 Trans Am. This appeared in ''Super Stock and Drag Illustrated''. With an unmodified car and a test weight of 4,010&nbsp;lbs the testers clocked 14.25 seconds at 101&nbsp;mph. The car had an automatic and A/C.<ref>Super Stock and Drag Illustrated June 1974</ref> Also, the factory rating of 290&nbsp;hp was listed at 4,400 rpm while the factory tachometer has a 5,750 rpm redline.

Pontiac offered the 455 through the 1976 model year, but the engine could not meet tightening restrictions on vehicle emissions. A total of 7,100 were produced with the 455 engine.

===1974===
[[File:74bird.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Pontiac Firebird Formula]]

Curb weights rose dramatically in the 1974 model year due to the implementation of {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} telescoping bumpers and various other crash and safety related structural enhancements; SD455 Trans Ams weighed in at {{convert|3850|lb|0|abbr=on}} in their first year of production (1974 model year; actually 1973).

The 1974 models featured a redesigned "shovel-nose" front end and new wide "slotted" taillights. In 1974, Pontiac offered two base engines for the Firebird: a {{convert|100|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-6 and a {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. Available were {{convert|175|to|225|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engines, as well as the {{convert|455|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} produced {{convert|215|or|250|hp|abbr=on}}, while the SD-455 produced {{convert|290|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The 400, 455, and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974.

A 1974 Firebird was driven by [[Jim Rockford (television character)|Jim Rockford]] in the pilot movie and the first season (1974–1975) of ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', and every following season, Rockford would change to the next model year. However, in the sixth season (1979–1980), Rockford continued to drive the 1978 Firebird from season five, as [[James Garner]] disliked the 1979 model's restyled front end. The cars in the show were badged as lower-tier Esprit models, but were Formulas with the twin-scoop hood replaced with a scoopless one. Another hint was the twin exhausts and rear anti-roll bars that were not used on Esprit.

===1975===
The 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window with a revised roofline and the turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which distinguished it from the previous year model. The Super Duty engine, Muncie four-speed, and TurboHydramatic 400 automatic were no longer available in 1975. Due to the use of catalytic converters starting in 1975, the THM 400 would not fit alongside the catalytic converter underneath the vehicle. The smaller TurboHydramatic 350 automatic was deemed enough. The 400 was standard in the Trans Am and the 455 was optional for both 1975 and 1976 models.

===1976===
Pontiac celebrated its 50th anniversary year in 1976.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flory Jr. |first=J.

===1977===
[[File:Pontiac Trans Am 1977.jpg|thumb|1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]

A slanted-front facelift occurred in 1977. Early 1977-built versions were supplied with an off-center scoop. Another production change was that early W72 cars came with the standard 180&nbsp;hp air cleaner. 

Pontiac offered the [[Pontiac V8 engine#400 T/A 6.6|T/A {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] with a single 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]] [[Regular Production Option|RPO]] W72 rated at {{convert|200|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm and a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of {{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm, as opposed to the regular 6.6&nbsp;Litre 400 (RPO L78) rated at {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The T/A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve covers, while the base 400 engines had painted valve covers. In addition, California and high-altitude cars received the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Olds 403]] engine, which offered a slightly higher [[compression ratio]] and a more usable torque band than the Pontiac engines of 1977.

From 1977 to 1981, the Firebird used four square headlamps, while the Camaro continued to retain the two round headlights that had been shared by both second-generation designs. The 1977 Trans-Am Special Edition became famous after being featured in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''. The 1980 Turbo model was used for ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.

===1978===
[[File:Pontiac Firebird front.jpg|thumb|right|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]
[[File:400ci Pontiac.JPG|thumb|Pontiac 400CID V8]]

Changes for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most obvious from the outside.<ref name=HBG1>{{citation | url = http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2011/08/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html |title=1977–'78 Pontiac Firebird Formula |work =Buyer's Guide from Hemmings Muscle Machines |first=David Traver |last=Adolphus |date=August 2011 }}</ref> Beginning in 1978, the Pontiac group introduced a new special edition vehicle. The Firebird Formula LT Sport Edition which featured a revised 10% raised compression Chevy 305 V8 powertrain producing 155&nbsp;hp (same as 1977 Chevy Monza Mirage) combined with a floor center console four-speed manual T-10 BW transmission coupled to a limited-slip differential final drive. The limited touring package (LT) also included a cabin roof, door, fender and hood graphics scheme, the Trans-Am sports handling package with HD gas shocks, modular alloy wheels, and the SE Trans-Am rear deck spoiler with "Formula" word graphic detail. T-tops in 1978 transitioned from Hurst units to Fisher (GM) in mid-year. In 1978 Pontiac also made available the Red Bird package on the Firebird Esprit model. Painted in Roman Red with a matching red interior it had a Gold pinstripe treatment with Red Bird graphics on the b-pillars. It also utilized the Trans-Am style steering wheel and dash except these were finished with gold spokes and a gold dash face which was unique to the Red Bird option.

The engineers also revised the compression ratio in the 400ci through the installation of different cylinder heads with smaller combustion chambers (1977 Pontiac 400 engines also had the 350 heads bolted to the 400 blocks, these heads were known as the 6x-4 heads and were taken from the Pontiac 350). This increased power by 10% for a total of 220 during the 1978–79 model years. The 400/403 options remained available until 1979, when the 400&nbsp;CID engines were only available in the 4-speed transmission Trans Ams and Formulas (the engines had actually been stockpiled from 1978, when PMD had cut production of the engine).

===1979===
[[File:Pair of 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AMs.jpg|thumb|1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AM, in T-top and coupe versions]]

The front end was restyled for 1979, which also marked the 10th anniversary of the Trans Am. A limited-edition anniversary package was made available: platinum silver paint with charcoal gray upper paint accents and mirrored t-tops, and a special interior featuring silver leather seats with custom-embroidered Firebird emblems and aircraft-inspired red lighting for the gauges. The 10th-anniversary cars also featured special 10th-anniversary decals, including a Firebird hood decal that extended off of the hood and onto the front fenders. Pontiac produced 7,500 10th anniversary cars, of which 1,817 were equipped with the high-output Pontiac T/A 6.6 W72 400 engine, the last of the line of the Pontiac large displacement V8 engines (and coupled with the four-speed Borg Warner Super T-10 manual transmission). The only option on these cars was the engine (the 400 was not certified for California, nor was cruise control available with it), which dictated the transmission and the gear ratio (3.23 on the 400 cars, 2.73 on the cars with the Oldsmobile-produced 403 engine and the TH350 automatic transmission). Two 10th Anniversary Trans Ams were the actual pace cars for the 1979 Daytona 500, which has been called the race that made NASCAR. ''Car and Driver'' magazine named the Trans Am with the WS6 performance package the best handling car of 1979. During period dyno testing, the National Hot Rod Association rated the limited-availability T/A 6.6 high-output Pontiac 400 engine at 260–280 net horsepower, which was significantly higher than Pontiac's conservative rating of 220&nbsp;hp. In 1979 Pontiac sold 116,535 Trans Ams, the highest sold in a year.

===1980===
In 1980, due to ever-increasing emissions restrictions, Pontiac dropped all of its large displacement engines.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtzK7Hm77sUC&pg=PA20|title=Automotive Atrocities: Cars You Love to Hate|last=Peters|first=Eric|page=20|isbn=9780760317877|year=2004}}</ref> 1980 therefore saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am. The [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|301]], offered in 1979 as a credit option, was now the standard engine. Options included a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 301 or the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet 305]] small block. The turbocharged 301 used a Garrett TB305 turbo forcing air through a single Rochester Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor, which was, however, too antiquated to take full advantage of the forced air from the turbo. Also, the low-octane (87–90) fuels would have led to severe detonation, had it not been for the ECU, which led to the cars feeling not very powerful at all. Some owners have claimed quite reasonable performance numbers with the modern fuels though.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://oldcarmemories.com/1980-1981-pontiac-trans-turbo-4-9l-v8-better-think/ | title=1980-1981 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo 4.9L V8 - It's Better Than You Think| date=2018-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.2gta.com/1980ta.html |title = 1980 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am}}</ref>

A 1980 Turbo Trans Am was featured in [[Smokey and the Bandit II]]. However, due to the turbocharger problems, the cars used for the filming had to be fitted with [[nitrous oxide]] tanks by Marvin Miller Systems to get the desired performance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.transam.me/y84_info.html |title =Y84 Special Edition TRANS AM Info |work=transam.me |date=2017 |access-date=21 September 2020}}</ref>

===1981===
[[File:1981 Pontiac Trans Am 1.jpg|thumb|right|1981 Pontiac Firebird Turbo Trans Am]]

In the final year of the second-generation Firebirds (1981), Trans Am still used the same engines as it had in the previous model year, with the only change being the addition of a new electronic carburetion system.

The assembly plant code for Norwood, OH is "N" (from 1972 to 1980 this would be the fifth VIN digit, for 1981 it is the 11th digit), and for Van Nuys, CA it is "L" (for Los Angeles, of which [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles]] is a district). In the later second-generation cars, Norwood used lacquer-based paint (there is an "L" on the cowl tag), and Van Nuys used water-based paint (there is a "W" on the cowl tag), due to California's tightening pollution regulations. The water-based paint often failed and delaminated during the warranty period and subsequently, cars had to be repainted.

The availability and cost of gasoline (two fuel crises had occurred by this time) meant the weight and the fuel consumption of the third-generation had to be considered in the design. In F-body development, both the third generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front-wheel drive platforms, but the idea was scrapped. Computerized engine management was in its infancy, and with fuel efficiency being the primary objective, it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers. They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better than the 1981 models. They also succeeded in reducing fuel consumption, offering a four-cylinder Firebird that would provide {{convert|34|mpgus|l/100km}}.<ref>fueleconomy.gov "Find a Car; 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 Firebird 2.5 L 5-speed fuel economy Official EPA Window Sticker MPG" Web. July 4, 2010</ref> GM executives decided that engineering effort would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development. They created a modern platform so that when engine technology advanced, they would have a well-balanced package with acceleration, braking, handling, and aerodynamics.

The Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the windshield slope set at 62 degrees, (about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form (a styling characteristic carried into the fourth generation's design). In addition to being about {{convert|500|lb|kg}} lighter than the previous design, the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form the new F-Body platform's shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler.

=== 1988 ===
[[File:1988GTA1.jpg|alt=1988 Trans Am GTA|thumb|1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA with Notchback option]]
In 1988 the Trans Am GTA, which was built with the standard 350 cu in 5.7 L V8 engine, was offered with the option of removable roof "T-Tops". However, any buyer ordering this option could only order the 305 cu in 5.0 L V8 engine, because the roof would not have the support for all the extra torque from the engine, requiring a power trade-off for those who wanted this option. Pontiac also introduced a rare option for the Trans Am GTA in the 1988 model year. This notable option on the 1988 Trans Am GTA was the $800 "Notchback", which replaced the standard long large, glass-dominated hatchback to make the Firebird design look less like the Camaro design, and shared an appearance with the [[Pontiac Fiero]]. The Notchback was a special fiberglass rear deck lid, replacing the long-sloped window with a short vertical rear window, resembling the back of a Ferrari 288 GTO.

Approximately 700 of these Notchbacks were built in 1988 and offered for sale by Pontiac. Promotion was only in the form of a sheet in the back of a notebook of available options. The Notchbacks were made by Auto-Fab of Auburn Hills, MI. Problems with incorrect fitting of the Notchbacks to the GTAs at the Van Nuys plant often resulted in delays of several months for buyers who wanted this option.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hppp-0809-1988-trans-am-gta-notchback/|title=1988 Trans Am GTA Notchback – Hatch-22 |date=2008-09-01|website=Hot Rod Network |first=Christopher R. |last=Phillip |access-date=2020-09-21}}</ref> Furthermore, quality control problems plagued the Notchback, many owners complained of rippling and deforming of the fiberglass rear deck, and others complained of large defects resembling acne forming in the Notchbacks. Pontiac had to repair them under warranty, sanding down the imperfections, and repainting them, only to have more flaws resurface months later. Because of the poor quality and numerous expensive warranty repairs and repainting, the Notchback was subsequently canceled for the 1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am, although a few were produced.

The fourth-generation Firebird amplified the aerodynamic styling initiated by the previous generation. While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the same, ninety percent of the Firebird's parts were all-new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Road & Track Special Series: Guide to the All-New 1993 Pontiac Firebird |date=1992 |publisher=Hachette Magazines |pages=2–3}}</ref> Overall, the styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee IV]] concept car than the 1991 "facelift" did. As with the Camaro, major improvements included standard dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, 16-inch wheels, rack-and-pinion power steering, short/long-arm front suspension, and several non-rusting composite body panels. Throughout its fourth generation, trim levels included V6-powered Firebird, and V8-powered Formula and Trans Am. Standard manual transmissions were the T5 five-speed manual for the V6s, Borg-Warner's T56 six-speed manual for the V8s. The 4L60 four-speed automatic was optional for both in 1993, becoming the 4L60E with built-in electronic controls in 1994.

===1993–1997===
From 1993 until 1995 (1995 non-California cars), Firebirds received a {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on|0}} 3.4&nbsp;L V6, an enhanced version of the third-generation's 3.1&nbsp;L V6. Beginning mid-year 1995 onward, a Series II 3.8&nbsp;L V6 with {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} became the Firebird's sole engine. From 1993 to 1997, the sole engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7&nbsp;L LT1 V8, essentially identical to the LT1 in the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4|C4 Corvette]] except for more flow-restrictive intake and exhaust systems.
Steering wheel audio controls were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems.

Beginning with 1994 model year cars, "Delco 2001"-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco units.<ref name="Flammang">{{cite book|last1=Flammang|first1=James|last2=Kowalke|first2=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 |date=1999 |publisher=Krause |isbn=0-87341-755-0 |edition=third}}</ref>{{rp|898}} This revised series, also introduced for other Pontiac car lines, featured ergonomically-designed control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven-band graphic equalizer. Also in 1994, the fourth-generation convertible was available; every Firebird (and Camaro) convertible featured a glass rear window with a built-in electric defroster.

The 1995 models were the same as those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: acceleration slip regulation) was available for LT1 Firebirds, controlled by a switch on the console. The steering wheels in all Firebirds were also changed; their optional built-in audio controls were more closely grouped on each side. The "Trans Am GT" trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year run in 1994. For 1995, all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z-rated tires. 1995 was also the first year of the vented version of the Opti-Spark distributors on LT1 F-cars, addressing a common mechanical fault with the unit. The 'transmission perform' button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the unused connections remain available for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. While 1995 cars still used the OBD-I (on-board diagnostic) computer system (the last year of any American car including the F-body to use OBD-I), a majority of them had OBD-II connector ports under the dash.

Firebird performance levels improved for 1996, with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8&nbsp;L V6 as the new base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996, due to its new dual catalytic-converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first model year of the OBD-II computer system. Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level; the Y87 performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups, such as four-wheel disc brakes, faster-response steering, limited-slip rear differential, and dual tailpipes.<ref name="Flammang"/>{{rp|904}} For Formulas and Trans Ams, functional dual-inlet "Ram Air" hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package. The optional package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305, and torque from 325&nbsp;lb·ft to 335. Also included were 17x9-wheels wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires, suspension improvements, oval dual tailpipe tips, and a WS6 badge. Bilstein shocks were a further option with the package.

The 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps (utilizing the front turn signal lamps), digital odometers, and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo systems to all Firebird trim levels.<ref name="Flammang"/>{{rp|907}} For V6 Firebirds, a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level. The WS6 "Ram Air" performance package was now also an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles, although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch wheel-and-tire combination. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced from 1996 to 1997 with the WS6 package.

===1998–2002===
In 1997, in relation to the Camaro, the Firebird received a mid-cycle refresh for the 1998 model year. Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes, retracting quad halogen headlights, circular turn signals and fog lamps, a front license plate pocket, lower fender air vents, unified-style lower door raised lettering for each trim level, and a new "honeycomb" rear light panel, with circular reverse lamps. In the dashboard, "next-generation" reduced-force dual airbags became standard. As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette's 5.7&nbsp;L V8, the LS1 of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5|C5 Corvette]], as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued.<ref name="Flammang"/>{{rp|911}} The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered.

Beginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased the potential traveling range. GM's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position, and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment.<ref name="Flammang"/>{{rp|915}} In 1999, a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds.

In 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants.

For 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment, while cassette stereos were phased out.

===Special editions===
'''Firehawk'''
The special-edition extra-performance Firehawk (available in Formula trim for 1993–1997, and again in both Formula and Trans Am trims for 1999–2002) was produced by SLP Engineering, Inc., and sold through Pontiac dealerships. Featuring 17-inch wheels with namesake [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk 275/40ZR17 tires along with a functional twin-inlet hood above a specific air cleaner box, its rated power increased to {{cvt|300|hp|0|abbr=}} and 330&nbsp;lb·ft (445 Nm) of torque. A total of 201 Firehawks were built for 1993. In 1994, the Firehawk package was expanded to include options for a suspension upgrade as well as a larger-diameter exhaust system that could boost power to {{cvt|315|hp|0|abbr=on}}. T-top Formula coupes and convertibles could also be optioned as Firehawks beginning in 1995. For 1996 and 1997, the Firehawk gained rectangular driving lights mounted inside the front scoops and (except Firehawk convertibles) the Trans Am's elevated rear wing. In 1997, an LT4 Firehawk was also available, utilizing the same {{cvt|330|hp|0|abbr=on}}, balanced-and-blueprinted LT4 V8 engine as found in the manual-transmission 1996 Corvette. A total of 29 LT4-powered Firehawks were produced.

Power levels for the 1999 Firehawk, powered by the LS1 V8, rose to {{cvt|327|hp|0|abbr=on}} (330 in 2000, 335 in 2001, and 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the "Blackwing" intake). A 10th-anniversary Firehawk was available in 2001, distinguished as a black Trans Am coupe (123 units) and convertible (16 units) with gold-painted hood stripes (prototype only), gold vinyl stripes on hood and spoiler (production), gold 17-inch wheels, and gold tailpipe tips.

'''1994 Trans Am GT'''
In 1994 only, a "Trans Am GT" option was available. Trans Am GTs did not receive any special badging, graphics, or emblems, and looked externally identical to the base Trans Am cars. The GT package included 245/50ZR16 tires and a 155-mph speedometer. Non-GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received 235/55R16 tires, a 115-mph speedometer, and a much lower top-speed limiter. The "highrise spoiler", leather, and T-tops were not standard on the Trans Am GT cars in 1994, nor any year of LT1 Trans Am. RPO code T43 "uplevel spoiler" was an option on all Trans Ams, and while the mass majority of 1994 Trans Am GT cars received the T43 spoiler (along with the majority of all 1993–1997 Trans Ams), it was not part of the Trans Am GT package. Both base Trans Ams and Trans am GTs could be ordered as a coupe, T-top, or convertible versions and were both available with automatic or manual transmissions. While the GT package was a cost option on the 1994 Trans Am, a majority of 1994 Trans Ams were made with the GT package.

All of the 1994 Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995–2002 as part of the Trans Am package, and the GT name/package was dropped for 1995. Some of the early fourth-generation Trans Am and Formula Firebirds list "GT" on the vehicle's title or registration. The reason behind this is because the VIN does not specify a "package" (Formula, Trans Am, Trans Am GT, Firehawk, etc.); it only specifies the engine (5.7&nbsp;L V8 LT1). Because the title is based on the VIN alone, titles and registrations often list all of the packages, but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package.

'''1994 25th-Anniversary Trans Am'''
The 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am, and another anniversary edition was released, painted white with a single dark blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am. It also featured white-painted, five-spoke, 16-inch alloy wheels, and white leather seats and door trim. This edition was available in either coupe or convertible form.

'''1999 30th-Anniversary Trans Am'''
As with the previous 25th-anniversary edition, the 30th-anniversary edition was either a white WS6 convertible or WS6 T-top coupe, with twin dark blue stripes from hood to tail, and distinct blue anodized five-spoke 17-inch alloy A-mold wheels, with white leather seats and door trim.

The Trans Am was a specialty package for the Firebird, typically upgrading [[Car handling|handling]], [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and [[horsepower]], as well as minor appearance modifications such as exclusive [[Hood (vehicle)|hoods]], [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoilers]], fog lights and wheels. Four distinct generations were produced between 1969 and 2002. These cars were built on the [[GM F platform|F-body platform]], which was also shared by the [[Chevrolet Camaro]].

Despite its name, the Trans Am was not initially used in the [[Trans Am Series]], as its smallest engine exceeded the SCCA's five-liter displacement limit.

The second generation was available from 1970 to 1981. The Firebird Trans Am was selected as the Official Pace Car for the [[1980 Indianapolis 500]]. 

The Trans Am GTA (Gran Turismo Americano) was an options package available on the Firebird Trans Am which added gold 16-inch diamond-spoke alloy wheels, a monochromatic paint scheme, and special cloisonné GTA badges. The GTA (along with the Formula model that was intended to fill the gap between the base model Firebird and mid-level Trans Am) was the brainchild of former Pontiac marketing manager Lou Wassel. It was intended to be the "ultimate" Trans Am and was the most expensive Firebird available. The GTA equipment package officially went on sale in 1987 and avoided a gas-guzzler tax thanks to its lightweight PW 16-inch gold cross-lace wheels. The high-performance WS6 suspension package was also re-tuned to offer a more compliant ride while still maintaining tight handling characteristics. Engine choices consisted of an L98 5.7&nbsp;L (350 ci) TPI V8 mated to GM's corporate 700R4 automatic transmission or the 5.0&nbsp;L (305 ci) TPI V8. A five-speed manual was available but was mated to the 5.0&nbsp;L only. The GTA trim level was available from 1987 through the 1992 model year.

For 1989, the 20th-anniversary turbo Trans Am project (originally conceived by Bill Owen of Pontiac) was outsourced to PAS, Inc., an engineering firm led by Jeff Beitzel. Beitzel and his team did most of the TTA development work. The 3.8&nbsp;L turbocharged V6 engines were built by PAS at their 40,000 square foot City of Industry, CA plant. From there, they went to GM's plant in Van Nuys, CA to be installed into GTAs on the F-Body assembly line. The cars were then shipped back to PAS for final assembly, testing, and quality control. Incidentally, the GTA chassis were selected at random, thus there is no correlation between the VIN and production sequence number. The initial number of cars to be produced had ranged from 500 to 2,500 until GM finally settled on 1,500. In all, a total of 1,555 Turbo Trans Ams were manufactured. One of these served as the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]] pace car.

=== Burt Reynolds collection of Firebirds ===
On April 14, 2018, at the [[Barrett-Jackson]] collector car auction in Palm Beach, FL, just 5 months before his death, actor Burt Reynolds presided over the sale of 3 Pontiac Firebird Trans Ams from his personal collection, sold via Bandit Movie Cars of Florida, the custodian of the Burt Reynolds collection. He was also an avid Firebird collector after filming the movies [[Hooper (film)|Hooper]] and also the [[Smokey and the Bandit]] movie series. The first car was a red 1977 Firebird Trans Am survivor car from the Restore a Muscle Car Collection with a price of $57,200. The second vehicle was a rare 1974 Pontiac Trans AM 455 Super Duty, which was another survivor that reached $100,000 plus 10% buyer commission. The third car Reynolds sold was a 1980 Indianapolis pace car turbo Trans Am, which was also $100,000, plus 10% buyer commission.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.carbuyingtips.com/articles/blog/burt-reynolds-at-record-2018-barrett-jackson-palm-beach-auction.htm |title=Burt Reynolds adds fuel to the fire at record Barrett-Jackson Palm Beach Auto Auction |website=www.carbuyingtips.com |date=April 18, 2018 |first=Jeff |last=Ostroff |access-date=October 20, 2020}}</ref>

== Racing ==
Firebirds were used in the [[Trans-Am series]] in the 1960s and 1970s. When the Firebird Trans Am was released, there was controversy over the model's inability to compete in the Trans-Am because the smallest available engine was too large for use in the series at 400 cubic inches (6.6&nbsp;L). The name also caused controversy because it was used without permission from the [[SCCA]], who threatened suit. GM settled the dispute by paying $5 to the SCCA for each car they sold. When the Trans-Am was last seen, the model year 2002 Firebirds were in use. From 1996 to 2006, a WS6 Trans Am coupe provided the body style for the mechanically identical racing cars used in the [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC).

During the 1995, 1996, and 1997 [[NHRA]] seasons, 14-time [[funny car]] champion [[John Force]] used a Firebird body to replace the obsolete [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] and [[Chevrolet Lumina]] bodies he had used since 1988. He used it for three seasons, winning the championship in all three years. The Firebird was also used by drivers such as Del Worsham, Tim Wilkerson, Frank Pedregon, and Jerry Toliver. The Firebird body also replaced the Oldsmobile Cutlass in the pro stock class in 1995, forcing drivers [[Warren Johnson]], Jerry Eckman, and Mark Pawuk to replace their body styles for the 1996 year. None of them would win with the first year of the Firebird body, but pro stock driver Jim Yates, a second-year driver, using the Firebird body, did.
