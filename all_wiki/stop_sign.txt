[[File:STOP sign.jpg|thumb|A stop sign in Australia]]

A '''stop sign''' is a [[traffic sign]] designed to notify drivers that they must come to a complete stop and make sure the [[intersection (road)|intersection]] is safely clear of vehicles and pedestrians before continuing past the sign.<ref>Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, 1968. United Nations Publication. {{ISBN|978-92-1-116973-7}}</ref>

==Design and configuration==
The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] allows for two types of stop sign as well as several acceptable variants. Sign B2a is a red octagon with a white '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''' legend. The European Annex to the convention also allows the background to be "light yellow". Sign B2b is a red circle with a red inverted triangle with either a white or yellow background, and a black or dark blue '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''' legend. The Convention allows for the word "STOP" to be in either English or the national language of the particular country. The finalized version by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]'s Conference on Road Traffic in 1968 (and [[coming into force|in force in 1978]]) proposed standard stop sign diameters of 600, 900 or 1200&nbsp;mm.

The [[United Kingdom]] and [[New Zealand]] stop signs are 750, 900 or 1200&nbsp;mm, according to sign location and traffic speeds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tss/tsmanual/tsmchapter3.pdf |title=UK Department of Transport.

==History==
[[Image:Yellow stop sign.jpg|framed|Yellow U.S. 1924–1954 stop sign]] Stop signs originated in [[Michigan]] in 1915.<ref name="signalfan">Signalfan. [http://signalfan.freeservers.com/road%20signs/stopsign.htm History of the Stop Sign in America]. 1997.{{Better source|date=July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greenbaum |first1=Hilary |last2=Rubinstein |first2=Dana |date=9 December 2011|title=The Stop Sign Wasn't Always Red|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/magazine/stop-sign.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> The first ones had black lettering on a white background and were {{convert|24|x|24|in|cm}}, somewhat smaller than the current sign. As stop signs became more widespread, a rural-dominated committee supported by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO) met in 1922 to standardize them and selected the octagonal shape that has been used in the United States ever since. The unique eight-sided shape of the sign allows drivers facing the back of the sign to identify that oncoming drivers have a stop sign and prevent confusion with other traffic signs.{{says who|date=May 2020}} It was also chosen so that it could be identified easily at night since the original signs were not reflective.{{CN|date=May 2020}} The more urban-oriented National Conference on Street and Highway Safety (NCSHS) advocated a smaller red-on-yellow stop sign.<ref name="signalfan" /> These two organizations eventually merged to form the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which in 1935 published the first [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) detailing the stop sign's specifications.

The MUTCD's stop sign specifications were altered eight times between 1935 and 1971. From 1924 to 1954, stop signs bore a red or black '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''' legend on a yellow field.<ref name="signalfan" /> Yellow was chosen because fade-resistant red materials were not available.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Felton|first1=Ryan|title=Here's Why Stop Signs Are Red|url=https://jalopnik.com/heres-why-stop-signs-are-red-1819456333|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=Jalopnik|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=14 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Manaul on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|date=1954|publisher=Department of Commerce|page=2|url=https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ghawkins/MUTCD-History_files/1948%20MUTCD/1954%20Revision%20to%201948%20MUTCD.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> [[retroreflector|Retro-reflective]] or self-lit signs were permitted in the 1935 MUTCD; retro-reflective ones were first required by the 1948 edition of the MUTCD, which also called for a {{convert|2+1//2|ft|m|2|abbr=off|adj=on}} height from the road crown to the bottom of the stop sign.<ref>Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 1948 Edition. Part 1A, Section 31. "[A stop sign] shall be mounted so that its bottom will be 2{{frac|1|2}} feet above the crown of the roadway."</ref> The 1954 MUTCD newly specified a white {{Smallcaps|stop}} legend on a red field, and increased the mount height specification to 5 feet in rural areas.<ref name="signalfan" /> Red [[traffic signals|traffic lights]] signify ''stop'', so the new specification unified red as a stop signal whether given by a sign or a light. The current mounting height of {{convert|7|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} was first specified in 1971;<ref name="signalfan" />

===US mandate, international adoption===
The MUTCD stop sign was already widely deployed in the United States when its use became mandatory in 1966.<ref name="signalfan" /> In 1968, this sign was adopted by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] as part of [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]'s effort to standardize road travel across borders. The Convention specifies that '''{{Smallcaps|stop}}''' be written in [[English language|English]] or the national language, and also allows a circular sign with red legend. Forty European countries<ref>{{cite web |title=Convention on Road Signs and Signals |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XI-B-20&chapter=11&Temp=mtdsg3&lang=en |website=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=United Nations}}</ref> are party to the Convention.

==Stop signs around the world==
[[File:BlueStopsign.svg|thumb|Blue stop signs are sometimes used on private property in [[Hawaii]]<ref>[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/09/20/news/kokualine.html Malls Can Erect Non-Red Stop Signs]</ref>]]
The red octagonal field with white English-language '''{{Smallcaps|stop}}''' legend is the most common stop sign used around the world, but it is not universal; Japan uses an inverted solid red triangle, for example, and Zimbabwe until 2016 used a disc bearing a black cross. Moreover, there are many variants of the red-and-white octagonal sign. Although all English-speaking and many other countries use the word '''{{Smallcaps|stop}}''' on stop signs, some jurisdictions use an equivalent word in their primary language instead, or in addition; the use of native languages is common on U.S. native reservations, especially those promoting [[language revitalization]] efforts,{{CN|date=May 2020}} for example, and Israel uses no word, but rather a pictogram of a hand in a palm-forward "stop" gesture.

===Asia===
Countries in Asia generally use a native word, often in a non-[[Latin script]].

===Europe===
Countries in Europe generally have stop signs with the text {{Smallcaps|stop}}, regardless of local language. There were some objections to this when introduced around the 1970s, but now this is accepted. Turkey is a notable exception to this, instead using the Turkish word for stop: "dur".  

===Latin America===
In most [[Caribbean]], Central and [[South America]]n countries ([[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]]), signs bear the legend '''{{lang|es|{{smallcaps|pare}}|italic=no}}''' ("stop" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]n countries bear the legend '''{{lang|es|{{smallcaps|alto}}|italic=no}}''' ("halt") instead.

===Canada===
[[Image:Bilingualstopsign.jpg|thumb|[[Bilingual]] stop sign in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]
In the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]], modern signs read either '''{{lang|fr|{{smallcaps|arrêt}}|italic=no}}''' or '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''';<ref name="P-010">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtqsignalisation.mtq.gouv.qc.ca/default.asp?operateur=panneau&panneau=P-010 |title=Répertoire des dispositifs de signalisation routière du Québec, Transports Québec |publisher=Mtqsignalisation.mtq.gouv.qc.ca |accessdate=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222121748/http://www.mtqsignalisation.mtq.gouv.qc.ca/default.asp?operateur=panneau&panneau=P-010 |archivedate=22 February 2012  }}</ref> however, it is not uncommon to see older signs containing both words in smaller lettering, with '''{{lang|fr|{{smallcaps|arrêt}}|italic=no}}''' on top.<ref name="masterfile">{{cite web|url=http://www.masterfile.com/stock-photography/image/610-00256529/Canada-Quebec-Montreal-bilingual-Stop-sign |title=Canada, Quebec, Montreal, bilingual Stop sign Stock Photos |publisher=Masterfile.com |accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> Both ''stop'' and ''arrêt'' are considered valid [[French language|French]] words and the [[Office québécois de la langue française]] (OQLF) notes that the use of "stop" on stop signs is attested in French since 1927.<ref name="panneau STOP">[http://www.granddictionnaire.com/ficheOqlf.aspx?Id_Fiche=8366697 ''panneau ARRÊT''], Office québécois de la langue française, granddictionnaire.com.</ref> At the time of the debates surrounding the adoption of the [[Charter of the French Language]] ("Bill 101") in 1977, the usage of "stop" on the older dual-word signs was considered to be English and therefore controversial; some signs were occasionally vandalized with red [[spray paint]] to turn the word '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''' into "101".<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/imagesdistributioncanada/4684364804/ Photo] by Flickr.com user "imagesdistributioncanada"</ref> However, it was later officially determined by the OQLF that "stop" is a valid French word in this context, and the older dual '''{{lang|fr|{{smallcaps|arrêt}}|italic=no}}''' / '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''' usage is therefore not considered bilingual but merely redundant and therefore deprecated (''à éviter''). All newly installed signs thus use either one word or the other, but not both. In practice, the vast majority of signs use '''{{Smallcaps|arrêt}}''' in Québec, while '''{{Smallcaps|stop}}''' is usually seen in predominantly English-speaking areas. Bilingual signs with '''{{lang|fr|{{smallcaps|stop arrêt}}|italic=no}}''' are placed in English-speaking areas of [[New Brunswick]], [[Acadia]]n regions of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Manitoba]], [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] and all border crossings of the [[Canada–United States border]].{{CN|date=May 2020}} On [[First Nations]] or [[Inuit]] territories, stop signs sometimes use the local aboriginal language in addition or instead of English, French, or both. All other English-speaking areas of Canada use '''{{smallcaps|stop}}'''.

===Other countries===
*[[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking countries use {{lang|ar|قف}} {{transl|ar|qif}} (except for [[Lebanon]], which only uses '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''')
*[[Australia]], New Zealand and the USA use the standard version of the sign

==Application==
{{Globalize|article|Northern|2name=the [[Northern Hemisphere]]|date=August 2013}}

Stop signs are used all over the world, but most countries outside of North America and South Africa use relatively few of them because [[all-way stop]]s are never used and in some countries are legally prohibited.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223943/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-03.pdf|title= Traffic Signs Manual, Chapter 3: Regulatory Signs, Section 3.4|publisher=UK Department of Transport|date = 8 September 2008}}&nbsp;{{small|(2.0&nbsp;MB)}}</ref> In a majority{{CN|date=May 2020}} of Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled by stop signs on minor roads and by [[Priority to the right|white, yellow and black priority diamond signs]] on the major road. In Europe and Australia, stop signs are restricted to places where coming to a dead stop is deemed necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At the vast majority of minor intersections in these countries [[yield sign|give way]] signs and/or equivalent road markings are used, or the intersections are no-priority; [[roundabouts]] also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle.

===North America===
Stop signs are often used in North America to control conflicting traffic movements at intersections that are deemed not busy enough to justify the installation of a [[traffic signal]] or [[roundabout]]. In the United States, the stop sign is not intended as a [[traffic calming]] device,<ref name="MUTCD03_2B"/> but is meant to be installed mainly for safety or to assign right-of-way. Stop signs may be erected on all intersecting roads, resulting in an [[all-way stop]].<ref name="MUTCD03_2B"/> Some research has concluded that stop signs do not offer measurable safety benefits over the [[give Way|Yield]] approach.<ref>Some factors influencing the road behaviour of vehicle drivers. R.J. Smeed, UK Road Research Laboratory. Operational Research Quarterly, Journal of the Operational Research Society, Birmingham, England, 1952.</ref><ref>"Driver behaviour and accident records at unsignalized urban intersections". Abishai Polusa, Department of Civil Engineering & Transportation Research Institute, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel. June 1984. Available online 4 July 2002.</ref> Other research has concluded that multiway stop signs do not effectively control traffic speeds, and can give rise to negative effects including increased traffic noise and pollution from braking and accelerating vehicles, enforcement problems, and reduced sign compliance.<ref>Bretherton, M. "Multi-Way Stops—The MUTCD Is Correct!" 1999 ITE Compendium

====On school buses====
{{main|School bus traffic stop laws}}
[[File:Thomas School Bus Bus.jpg|thumb|An American [[school bus]] displaying front and rear folding stop signs]]
A stop sign on a pivoting arm is required equipment on North American [[School bus#Warning lights and safety devices|school buses]]. The sign normally stows flat on the left side of the bus, and is deployed by the driver when opening the door for picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The stop sign is retroreflective and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the '''{{smallcaps|stop}}''' legend or with a legend that is illuminated by [[Light emitting diode|LEDs]]. Unlike a normal stop sign, this sign indicates a two-way absolute stop, requiring other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain stopped until the sign is retracted.{{CN|date=May 2020}}

===Europe===
In Europe, stop signs are generally placed at sites where visibility is severely restricted, or where a high crash rate has been noted. In some European countries, stop signs are placed at level crossings to mark the stop line. For most situations, Europe uses the [[yield sign|give way]] sign instead.<ref>https://www.rd.com/article/paris-stop-sign/</ref><ref>https://blogs.transparent.com/dutch/dutch-traffic-why-the-stop-sign-is-so-rare-in-the-netherlands/</ref> All-way stops, which are common in North America, are exceedingly rare in Europe. Comparatively, no-priority intersections are more common.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, stop signs may only be placed at junctions with tramways or sites with severely restricted visibility.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/782724/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-03.pdf|title=Traffic Signs Manual|publisher=TSO|year=2019|isbn=978-0-11-553223-8|location=London|pages=18|chapter=Chapter 3: Regulatory Signs|access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref> Until 2016, each stop sign had to be individually approved by the [[Secretary of State for Transport]].<ref>UK [[Department of Transport]].

Section 79 of the [[Highways Act 1980]] enables the government to improve visibility at junctions, as by removing or shortening walls or hedges. The Department for Transport considers improving visibility to be preferable to installing a stop sign.<ref name=":0" /> The former UK practice of using "Halt" or "Slow" at Major Road Ahead signs was discontinued in 1965 at the recommendation of the [[Worboys Committee]].<ref>Great Britain. ''Report of the Traffic Signs Committee'' [Chairman, Sir Walter Worboys], 18 April 1963.</ref> Instead of replacing all the old {{Smallcaps|halt}} signs with the new Vienna Convention {{Smallcaps|stop}} sign, the {{Smallcaps|give way}} sign became the standard one at UK priority junctions.<ref>"New traffic signs demonstrated on road at Birmingham." The Surveyor and Municipal Engineer, vol 122, p880, 1963.</ref>

==Compliance requirements==
Laws and regulations regarding how drivers must comply with a stop sign vary by jurisdiction. In the United States and Canada, these rules are set and enforced at the state or provincial level. At a junction where two or more traffic directions are controlled by stop signs, US and Canada practice generally has the driver who arrives and stops first continue first. If two or three drivers in different directions stop simultaneously at a junction controlled by stop signs, generally the drivers on the left must yield the right-of-way to the driver on the far right.

In all countries, the driver must come to a ''complete'' stop before passing a stop sign, even if no other vehicle or pedestrian is visible. If a [[Stop and Yield lines|stop line]] is marked on the pavement, drivers must stop before crossing the line. Slowing but not completely stopping is called a "rolling stop", sometimes nicknamed after a city or region where it is considered endemic (e.g., "Rhode Island roll" or "California stop"<ref>{{cite news |title=Cheaper fines for right turn on red? No way, governor says |first=Mike |last=Rosenberg |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=30 September 2010 |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_16222935 |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>) – slowing down significantly but not stopping completely at the sign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rolling%20stop?r=14 |title=Dictionary.com definition |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> This partial stop is not acceptable to most law enforcement officials, and can result in a traffic citation. However, enforcement of this rule varies widely among countries.

In some countries such as Czechia and Russia, stopping is required only at a place where a driver has a sufficient view into the intersection, not at the border of the intersection (where a "STOP" line is not present). Therefore, if multiple drivers come from the same direction and all of them stop at appropriate place, they can continue without stopping again.<ref>https://www.autoskolaprikasky.cz/news/musim-na-stopce-zastavit-za-dalsim-vozidlem/</ref>

In some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. state of [[Idaho]], the [[traffic code]] allows for bicyclists approaching a stop sign to slow down and yield to conflicting traffic, then proceed without stopping unless safety requires a full stop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bicycle-related Idaho Code|url=http://itd.idaho.gov/bike_ped/Idaho_Vehicle_Code_for_Bikes.pdf|work=Idaho Vehicle Code Title 49, Chapter 7|publisher=Idaho Transportation Department|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> The Idaho law has been in effect since 1982 and has not been shown to be detrimental to safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bikeleague.org/content/bike-law-university-idaho-stop |title= Bike Law University: Idaho Stop |publisher=The League of American Bicyclists |date= 22 August 2013 }}</ref> Cyclist advocacy groups have sought similar laws for other jurisdictions in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maus|first=Jonathan|title=Exclusive: BTA will go for "Idaho style" stop sign law|url=http://bikeportland.org/2009/01/14/exclusive-bta-will-go-for-idaho-style-stop-sign-law-13382|work=BikePortland.org|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Idaho-style STOP law|url=http://www.sfbike.org/?idaho|publisher=San Francisco Bicycle Coalition|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>

==Disadvantages==
Stop sign placement can pose difficulties and hazards in applications where cross traffic is not controlled by a sign or light. Relatively long distance between the stop sign and the crossroad facilitates accurate perception of the speed of approaching cross traffic, but lengthens the time and distance required to enter and clear the junction. Relatively short distance between the stop sign and the crossroad shortens the time required for safe passage through the intersection, but degrades the ability of the stopped driver to accurately perceive the speed of approaching cross traffic. Specifically, drivers approaching an intersection from beyond the [[Visual acuity#Subtended Angular Velocity Detection Threshold .28SAVT.29|subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT)]] limit may be perceived by a stopped driver as standing still rather than approaching, <ref name="Weinberger">{{cite journal |title=Conjecture on the Visual Estimation of Relative Radial Motion |author=Hershel Weinberger |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=229 |issue=5286 |page=562 |date=19 February 1971 |doi=10.1038/229562a0 |pmid=4925353 |s2cid=4290244 }}</ref> which means the stopped driver may not make an accurate decision as to whether it is safe to proceed past the stop sign.<ref name="looming"/> Whether the distance between the stop sign and the crossroad is officially short or is shortened by drivers creeping past the stop line, they can lose the [[Visual acuity#Lateral Motion|visual acuity of lateral motion]],<ref name="JoV">{{cite journal |title=Spatial and temporal limits of motion perception across variations in speed, eccentricity, and low vision. |author1=Joseph S.
