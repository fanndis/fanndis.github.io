'''White-collar crime''' (or [[corporate crime]], more accurately) refers to financially motivated, nonviolent [[crime]] committed by businesses and government professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/white_collar|title=FBI — White-Collar Crime|work=FBI}}</ref> It was first defined by the sociologist [[Edwin Sutherland]] in 1939 as "a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of their occupation".<ref>Sutherland, Edwin Hardin (1949). ''White Collar Crime''. New York: Dryden Press, p. 9.</ref> Typical white-collar crimes could include [[wage theft]], [[fraud]], [[bribery]], [[Ponzi scheme]]s, [[insider trading]], [[racketeering|labor racketeering]], [[embezzlement]], [[cybercrime]], [[copyright infringement]], [[money laundering]], [[identity theft]], and [[forgery]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mycaliforniadefenseattorney.com/white-collar/|title=White Collar Criminal Defense Guide|newspaper=Law Offices of Randy Collins|language=en-US|access-date=23 December 2016}}</ref>

==Definitional issues==
Modern criminology generally rejects a limitation of the term by reference{{technical statement|date=September 2020}}, rather it classifies the type of crime and the topic:
*By the type of offense, e.g., [[property crime]], [[Financial crimes|economic crime]], and other corporate crimes like [[environmental law|environmental]] and health and safety law violations. Some crime is only possible because of the identity of the offender, e.g., transnational money laundering requires the participation of senior officers employed in banks. But the [[FBI]] has adopted the narrow approach, defining white-collar crime as "those illegal acts which are characterized by deceit, concealment, or violation of trust and which are not dependent upon the application or threat of physical force or violence" (1989, 3). While the true extent and cost of white-collar crime are unknown, the FBI and the [[Association of Certified Fraud Examiners]] estimate the annual cost to the United States to fall between $300 and $660 billion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friedrichs|first=David O.|title=Trusted Criminals: White Collar Crime In Contemporary Society|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=978-0495600824|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Trusted_Criminals.html?id=ZQGmgHjovawC|edition=4}} citing Kane and Wall, 2006, p. 5</ref>
* By the type of offender, e.g., by social class or high socioeconomic status, the occupation of positions of trust or profession, or academic qualification, researching the motivations for criminal MAFIA behavior, e.g., greed or fear of loss of face if economic difficulties become obvious.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Michael L.|date=1985|title=Denying the Guilty Mind: Accounting for Involvement in a White-Collar Crime*|journal=Criminology|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=583–607|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1985.tb00365.x|issn=1745-9125}}</ref> Shover and Wright point to the essential neutrality of a crime as enacted in a [[statute]].<ref>Shover, Neal & Wright, John Paul (eds.) (2000). ''Crimes of Privilege: Readings in White-Collar Crime''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513621-7}}</ref> It almost inevitably describes conduct in the abstract, not by reference to the character of the persons performing it. Thus, the only way that one crime differs from another is in the backgrounds and characteristics of its perpetrators.
* By organizational culture rather than the offender or offense which overlaps with [[organized crime]]. Appelbaum and Chambliss offer a twofold definition:<ref name=appelbaum>{{cite book |authors=Appelbaum, Richard & Chambliss, William J.|title=Sociology: A Brief Introduction|year=1997|publisher=Longman Pub Group|location=New York|isbn=9780673982797|page=[https://archive.org/details/globalreadertoac00phil/page/117 117]|url=https://archive.org/details/globalreadertoac00phil|url-access=registration}}</ref>
** Occupational crime which occurs when crimes are committed to promote personal interests, say, by altering records and overcharging, or by the cheating of clients by professionals.
** Organizational or corporate crime which occurs when corporate executives commit criminal acts to benefit their company by overcharging or [[price fixing]], [[false advertising]], etc.

== History ==
White-collar crime had been going on prior to Sutherland's definition and his research done in 1939. Sutherland wanted to find a general theory of the typical criminal and by reading other researchers work, getting the idea that all criminals were stereotyped as impoverished or of low social standing he found that hard to believe considering people of high social standing committed crime as well.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://law.jrank.org/pages/2312/White-Collar-Crime-History-an-Idea-evolution-white-collar-crime.html|title=White-Collar Crime: History of an Idea - The Evolution Of White-collar Crime|website=law.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref>In his book Sutherland said "White collar crime may be defined as approximately as a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation."<ref name=":0" />There were many factors going into the establishment of White-collar crime but the main issue was industrialization.<ref>  Berghoff, H., & Spiekermann, U. (2018). Shady business: On the history of white-collar crime. Business History, 60(3), 289–304. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1080/00076791.2018.1414735</nowiki></ref>There is a White collar crime registry identifying those who've committed white-collar crime to the public trying to deter possible victims from being victimized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/utah-white-collar-crime/475896/|title=Why Is Utah the First State to Have a White-Collar Crime Registry?|last=Lam|first=Bourree|date=2016-03-29|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref>The first [https://www.utfraud.com/RegistryLists White Collar Crime Offender Registry] was established in [[Utah]] in 2016.

==Relationship to other types of crime==

===Blue-collar crime===
{{main|Blue-collar crime}}
The types of crime committed are a function of what is available to the potential offender. Thus, those employed in relatively unskilled environments have fewer opportunities to exploit than those who work in situations where large financial transactions occur.<ref name=clarke>{{cite book |last=Clarke|first=R. V. G.|title=Situational Crime Prevention: Successful Case Studies|year=1997|publisher=Harrow and Heston|isbn=9780911577389|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ax7FzCWL978C|edition=2}}</ref> Blue-collar crime tends to be more obvious and thus attracts more active police attention such as [[vandalism]] or [[shoplifting]].<ref>Shover, Neal; Hunter, Ben W. (2013-01-11). "Blue-collar, white-collar: crimes and mistakes". ''Offenders on Offending''. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.4324/9781843927785-24. Retrieved 2020-02-20.</ref> In contrast, white-collar employees can incorporate legitimate and criminal behavior, thus making themselves less obvious when committing the crime. Therefore, blue-collar crime will more often use physical force, whereas in the corporate world, the identification of a victim is less obvious and the issue of reporting is complicated by a culture of commercial confidentiality to protect [[shareholder]] value. It is estimated that a great deal of white-collar crime is undetected or, if detected, it is not reported.

===Corporate crime===
{{Main|Corporate crime}}
Corporate crime deals with the company as a whole. The crime benefits the investors or the individuals who are in high positions in the company or corporation. White-collar crime and corporate crime are similar because they take place within the business world. The difference is that white-collar crime benefits the individual(s) involved, and corporate crime benefits the company or the corporation, usually high-ranking individuals within the corporation.<ref>Monday, On behalf of Darryl A. Goldberg posted in Federal Crimes on; December 11; 2017. "White collar vs. corporate crime". ''Darryl A. Goldberg''. Retrieved 2020-02-25.</ref>

One well-known insider trading case in the United States is the [[ImClone stock trading case]]. In December 2001, top-level executives sold their shares in [[ImClone Systems]], a pharmaceutical company that manufactured an anti-cancer drug. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) investigated numerous top-level executives, as well as [[Martha Stewart]], a friend of ImClone's former chief executive who had also sold her shares at the same time. The SEC reached a settlement in 2005.<ref name="o'grady">{{cite book |last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime in Canadian Context: Debates and Controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195433784|url=https://archive.org/details/crimeincanadianc0000ogra|url-access=registration|edition=2|access-date=1 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Anderson|first=Jenny|title=S.E.C. Settles ImClone Insider Trading Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/20/business/20imclone.html|access-date=1 June 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 January 2005}}</ref>

===State-corporate crime===
The negotiation of agreements between a state and a corporation will be at a relatively senior level on both sides, this is almost exclusively a white-collar "situation" which offers the opportunity for crime. Although law enforcement claims to have prioritized white-collar crime,<ref>{{cite news |last=Anzalone|first=Charles|title=White-Collar Crime Has Become Priority of Law Enforcement|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=28 April 1991}}</ref> evidence shows that it continues to be a low priority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/states-white-collar-convicts-get-lighter-sentences-9311|title=State's white collar convicts get lighter sentences|work=California Watch}}</ref>

When senior levels of a corporation engage in criminal activity using the company this is sometimes called [[control fraud]].

===Organized transnational crime===
Organized [[transnational crime]] is organized criminal activity that takes place across national jurisdictions, and with advances in transportation and information technology, law enforcement officials and policymakers have needed to respond to this form of crime on a global scale. Some examples include [[human trafficking]], [[money laundering]], [[drug smuggling]], illegal arms dealing, [[terrorism]], and [[cybercrime]]. Although it is impossible to precisely gauge transnational crime, the [[The Millennium Project|Millennium Project]], an international think tank, assembled statistics on several aspects of transnational crime in 2009:<ref name="o'grady" />
*World illicit trade of almost $780 billion
*Counterfeiting and piracy of $300 billion to $1 trillion
*Global drug trade of $321 billion 

===Occupational crime===
Individuals may commit crime during employment or unemployment. The two most common forms are [[theft]] and [[fraud]]. Theft can be of varying degrees, from a pencil to furnishings to a car. [[Insider trading]], the trading of stock by someone with access to publicly unavailable information, is a type of fraud.<ref name="o'grady" />

===Crimes related to national interests===
The crimes related to the national interests consist mainly of treason.  In the modern world, there are a lot of nations which divide the crimes into some laws. "Crimes Related to Inducement of Foreign Aggression" is the crime of communicating with [[alien (law)|aliens]] secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. "Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression" is the treason of co-operating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. "Crimes Related to Insurrection" is the internal treason. Depending on a country, criminal conspiracy is added to these. One example is [[Jho Low]], a mega thief and traitor who stole billions in USA currency from a [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|Malaysian government fund]] and is now on a run as a fugitive.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sukumaran |first1=Tashny |title=What's the deal with Jho Low, Malaysia's most wanted man? |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2171428/whats-deal-jho-low-malaysias-most-wanted-man |access-date=25 February 2019 |agency=South China Morning Post |publisher=South China Morning Post Publishers |date=16 February 2019}}</ref>

==Demographics==
According to a 2016 study,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kimberly D.|last2=Klenowski|first2=Paul M.|date=2016-05-01|title=Who Commits White-Collar Crime, and What Do We Know About Them?|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199925513.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199925513-e-6|journal=The Oxford Handbook of White-Collar Crime|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199925513.013.6|editor1-last=Van Slyke|editor1-first=Shanna R|editor2-last=Benson|editor2-first=Michael L|editor3-last=Cullen|editor3-first=Francis T}}</ref> <blockquote>A considerable percentage of white-collar offenders are gainfully employed middle-aged Caucasian men who usually commit their first whitecollar offense sometime between their late thirties through their mid-forties and appear to have middle-class backgrounds. Most have some higher education, are married, and have moderate to strong ties to community, family, and religious organizations. Whitecollar offenders usually have a criminal history, including infractions that span the spectrum of illegality, but many do not overindulge in vice. Recent research examining the five-factor personality trait model determined that white-collar offenders tend to be more neurotic and less agreeable and conscientious than their non-criminal counterparts.</blockquote>

==Punishment==
In the United States, sentences for white-collar crimes may include a combination of [[imprisonment]], [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[restitution]], [[Community service#Alternative sentencing|community service]], [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]], [[probation]], or other alternative punishment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rubino, Esq. PA|first=Frank|title=White Collar Crime - An Overview|url=http://www.frankrubino.com/CM/FSDP/PracticeCenter/Criminal-Law/White-Collar-Crime.asp?focus=overview|access-date=30 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Penalties for White Collar Crime|url=http://www.azblumberglaw.com/CM/FSDP/PracticeCenter/Criminal-Law/White-Collar-Crime.asp?focus=topic&id=4|publisher=Blumberg & Associates}}</ref> These punishments grew harsher after the [[Jeff Skilling|Jeffrey Skilling]] and [[Enron scandal]], when the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 was passed by the [[United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]], defining new crimes and increasing the penalties for crimes such as [[mail and wire fraud]]. Sometimes punishment for these crimes could be hard to determine due to the fact that convincing the courts that what the offender has done is challenging within itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hagan|first=John|last2=Parker|first2=Patricia|date=1985|title=White-Collar Crime and Punishment: The Class Structure and Legal Sanctioning of Securities Violations|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=50|issue=3|pages=302–316|doi=10.2307/2095541|jstor=2095541|issn=0003-1224}}</ref> In other countries, such as [[China]], white-collar criminals can be given the [[death penalty]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202427517680/Is-Chinas-WhiteCollar-Death-Penalty-Fair|title=Is China's White-Collar Death Penalty Fair?|publisher=The American Lawyer|access-date=30 January 2012}}</ref> yet some countries have a maximum of 10–25 years imprisonment. Certain countries like [[Canada]] consider the relationship between the parties to be a significant feature on sentence when there is a breach of trust component involved.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Breach of Trust in Canada?|url=http://www.aelaw.ca/charges/fraud-under-5000-and-fraud-over-5000/#fraud-under-breach-of-trust|publisher=Alexander Ejsmont|access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> Questions about [[sentencing disparity]] in white-collar crime continue to be debated.<ref>{{cite web |last=Podger|first=Prof. Ellen S.|title=Throwing Away the Key|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/throwing-away-the-key|publisher=Yale Law Journal|access-date=30 January 2012|date=21 February 2007}}</ref> The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]],  concerned with identifying this type of offense, collects annual statistical information on only three categories: fraud, counterfeiting/forgery, and embezzlement.

In the United States, the longest sentences for white-collar crimes have been for the following: [[Sholam Weiss]] (845 years for racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering in connection with the collapse of [[National Heritage Life Insurance Company]]); Norman Schmidt and Charles Lewis (330 years and 30 years, respectively, for "high-yield investment" scheme); [[Bernard Madoff]] (150 years for [[Madoff investment scandal|$65 billion fraud scheme]]); Frederick Brandau (55 years for $117 million [[Ponzi scheme]]); Eduardo Masferrer (30 years for accounting fraud); Chalana McFarland (30 years for [[mortgage fraud]] scheme); Lance Poulsen (30 years for $2.9 billion fraud).<ref>Liz Moyer, [https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/24/bernie-madoff-prison-sentence-business-beltway-madoff_slide.html#75d1e5095432 In Pictures: The Longest White-Collar Prison Sentences], ''Forbes'' (June 24, 2009).</ref>
