Tarbell]]'s classic exposé ''[[The History of the Standard Oil Company|The History of the Standard Oil Co.]]'' in 1904, leading to a growing outcry for the government to take action against the company. By 1911, with public outcry at a climax, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]'' that Standard Oil must be dissolved and split into 34&nbsp;companies.

Over the next few decades, Jersey Standard and Socony grew significantly. John Duston Archbold was the first president of Jersey Standard. Archbold was followed by [[Walter C. Teagle]] in 1917, who made it the largest oil company in the world.<ref name="vassiliou" />  In 1919, Jersey Standard acquired a 50% share in [[Humble Oil|Humble Oil & Refining Co.]], a Texas oil producer.<ref name="Historical Note" />  In 1920, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.<ref name="vassiliou" /> In the following years it acquired or established Tropical Oil Company of Colombia (1920), Standard Oil Company of Venezuela (1921), and Creole Petroleum Company of Venezuela (1928).<ref name="britannica-exxon" />

[[Henry Clay Folger]] was head of Socony until 1923, when he was succeeded by [[Herbert L. Pratt]]. The growing [[automobile|automotive]] market inspired the product trademark Mobiloil, registered by Socony in 1920.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  After dissolution of Standard Oil, Socony had refining and marketing assets but no production activities. For this reason, Socony purchased a 45% interest in [[Magnolia Petroleum Co.]], a major refiner, marketer and pipeline transporter, in 1918. In 1925, Magnolia became wholly owned by Socony. In 1926, Socony purchased General Petroleum Corporation of California.<ref name="Historical Note" /><ref name="vassiliou" />  In 1928, Socony joined the [[Turkish Petroleum Company]] (Iraq Petroleum Company).<ref name="vassiliou" />  In 1931, Socony merged with [[Vacuum Oil Company]], an industry pioneer dating back to 1866, to form Socony-Vacuum.<ref name="Historical Note" /><ref name="vassiliou" /><ref name="time100831">{{cite news

In the Asia-Pacific region, Jersey Standard has established through its Dutch subsidiary an exploration and production company ''Nederlandsche Koloniale Petroleum Maatschappij'' in 1912.

===1972 to 1998===
In 1972, Exxon was unveiled as the new, unified brand name for all former Enco and Esso outlets. At the same time, the company changed its corporate name from Standard Oil of New Jersey to Exxon Corporation, and Humble Oil became Exxon Company, U.S.A.<ref name="Historical Note" />  The rebranding came after successful test-marketing of the Exxon name, under two experimental logos, in the fall and winter of 1971–72. Along with the new name, Exxon settled on a rectangular logo using red lettering and blue trim on a white background, similar to the familiar color scheme on the old Enco and Esso logos. Exxon replaced the [[Esso]], [[Enco (oil company)|Enco]], and [[Humble Oil|Humble]] brands in the United States on January 1, 1973.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Due to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargo of 1973]], Exxon and Mobil began to expand their exploration and production into the [[North Sea]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Africa, and Asia. Mobil diversified its activities into retail sale and packaging by acquiring the parent company of [[Montgomery Ward]] and [[Container Corporation of America]].<ref name="Historical Note" />

In 1998, Exxon and Mobil signed a US$73.7&nbsp;billion merger agreement forming a new company called Exxon Mobil Corp.

At the time of the merge, Exxon was the world's largest energy company while Mobil was the second-largest oil and gas company in the United States. The merger announcement followed shortly after the merge of [[British Petroleum]] and [[Amoco]], which was the largest industrial merger at the time.<ref name=bbc021298>{{cite news

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ExxonMobil has received a lot of criticism along with [[BP]], [[China National Petroleum Corporation]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Lukoil]], for increasing oil production facilities in the [[Rumaila oil field]] and [[West Qurna Field]] following the Iraqi government's lack of power and instability resulting from the Iraq War. ExxonMobil alone produces 2,325,000 bpd or $967,432,500 per year of gross revenue in Iraq to maintain low prices. This practice is considered to be beneficial to the big oil consumer countries and allows Exxon to produce higher profit crude oil products such as plastic, fertilizer, medication, lubricant, and clothing.

In 2002, the company sold its stake in the [[Cerrejón]] coal mine in Colombia, and copper-mining business in Chile.<ref name="cerrejon" /><ref name="wsj030502">{{cite news

==Geopolitical influence==
A July 2012 ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' review of [[Steve Coll]]'s book, ''Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power'', says that he thinks that ExxonMobil is "able to determine American foreign policy and the fate of entire nations".<ref name="tel12" /> ExxonMobil increasingly drills in terrains leased to them by [[dictatorships]], such as those in [[Chad]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]].<ref name="tel12" /> Steve Coll describes [[Lee Raymond]], the corporation's chief executive until 2005, as "notoriously skeptical about climate change and disliked government interference at any level".<ref name="tel12">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9429215/Private-Empire-ExxonMobil-and-American-Power-by-Steve-Coll.html |title=Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power |author=Ian Thompson |date=July 30, 2012 |work=The Telegraph |location=London |access-date=April 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211214237/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9429215/Private-Empire-ExxonMobil-and-American-Power-by-Steve-Coll.html |archive-date=February 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The book was also reviewed in ''[[The Economist]]'', according to which "ExxonMobil is easy to caricature, and many critics have done so.... It is to Steve Coll's credit that ''Private Empire'', his new book about ExxonMobil, refuses to subscribe to such a simplistic view."  The review describes the company's power in dealing with the countries in which it drills as "constrained".  It notes that the company shut down its operations in Indonesia to distance itself from the abuses committed against the population by that country's army and that it decided to drill in Chad only after the World Bank agreed to ensure that the oil royalties were used for the population's benefit.  The review closes by noting that "A world addicted to ExxonMobil's product needs to look in the mirror before being too critical of how relentlessly the company supplies it."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21560226 |title=Oozing success |work=The Economist |date=August 11, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404133003/http://www.economist.com/node/21560226 |archive-date=April 4, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

As of 2001, oil remained on or under more than half the sound's beaches, according to a 2001 federal survey. The government-created Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council concluded that the oil disappears at less than 4 percent per year, adding that the oil will "take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely". Of the 27 species monitored by the council, 17 have not recovered.

After a trial, a jury ordered Exxon to pay $5&nbsp;billion in punitive damages, though an appeals court reduced that amount by half.
