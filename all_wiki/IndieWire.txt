==History==
[[File:IndieWire_logo.svg|thumb|Former Indiewire logo]]
The original IndieWire newsletter launched on July 15, 1996, billing itself as "the daily news service for [[independent film]]." Following in the footsteps of various web- and [[AOL]]-based editorial ventures, IndieWire was launched as a free daily email publication in the summer of 1996 by New York- and Los Angeles-based filmmakers and writers [[Eugene Hernandez]], Mark Rabinowitz, Cheri Barner, [[Roberto A. Quezada]], and Mark L. Feinsod.<ref>{{cite web

Initially distributed to a few hundred subscribers, the readership grew rapidly, passing 6,000 in late 1997.<ref name="Wired97">{{cite news

In January 1997, IndieWire made its first appearance at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] to begin their coverage of film festivals; it offered ''indieWIRE: On The Scene'' print dailies in addition to online coverage. Printed on site, in low tech black and white style, the publication was able to scoop traditional Hollywood trade dailies ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' due to the delay these latter publications had for being printed in Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The site was acquired by [[Snagfilms]] in July 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Gregg |title=SnagFilms acquires IndieWire |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snagfilms-acquires-indiewire-115818 |accessdate=11 December 2019 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=16 July 2008}}</ref> On January 8, 2009, IndieWire editor Eugene Hernandez announced that the site was going through a re-launch that has been "entirely re-imagined." In 2011, with the launch of a redesign, the site changed the formal spelling of its name from indieWIRE to IndieWire.

[[Penske Media Corporation|Penske Media]] acquired IndieWire on January 19, 2016. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.<ref name=Variety/>

==Reception==
In ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', in 1997, Janelle Brown wrote: "Currently, IndieWire has little to no competition: trades like ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' may cover independent film, but from a Hollywood perspective, hidden by a huge amount of mainstream news. As filmmaker Doug Wolens points out, IndieWire is one of the few places where filmmakers can consistently and reliably keep on top of often-ignored small film festivals, which films are opening and what other filmmakers are thinking."<ref name="Wired97"/>

In 2002, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine recognized IndieWire, along with seven other entrants, in the "Cinema Appreciation" category, as a "Best of the Web Pick," describing its best feature as "boards teeming with filmmakers" and its worst as "glacial search engine."<ref>{{cite news |title= Forbes Best of the Web - IndieWire |work= [[Forbes]] |date= March 25, 2002 |accessdate=2010-05-21 |url=https://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=6296|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217131631/https://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=6296|archive-date=17 February 2012}}</ref> IndieWire has been praised by [[Roger Ebert]].<ref name="Ebert">{{cite journal| title= Rule of Thumb: Best Indie Crossroads| first= Roger |last=Ebert| author-link=Roger Ebert| work= Yahoo Internet Life - Summer Movies Guide| publisher= ZDNet| volume= 5 |issue= 6| date= June 1999| url= http://www.zdnet.com/yil/content/mag/9906/ebert7.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/19991113073103/http://www.zdnet.com/yil/content/mag/9906/ebert7.html| archive-date= 1999-11-13 |url-status=dead | access-date=2011-05-22}}</ref>
