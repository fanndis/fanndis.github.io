Also in 2017, YouTube added [[MLB Network]] and regional deals with the [[Seattle Sounders]] and [[Los Angeles FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-tv-seattle-sounders-exclusive-rights-1202713547/|title=YouTube TV Nabs Exclusive Streaming Rights to Seattle Sounders Games, Its Second MLS Deal|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=February 28, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=April 29, 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505122343/http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-tv-seattle-sounders-exclusive-rights-1202713547/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-tv-soccer-rights-los-angeles-football-club-1202682004/|title=YouTube TV Strikes Unprecedented Deal for Pro Sports TV Rights (EXCLUSIVE)|first=Andrew|last=Wallenstein|first2=Todd|last2=Spangler|date=January 31, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=April 29, 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=May 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502194326/http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-tv-soccer-rights-los-angeles-football-club-1202682004/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 29, 2019, at the [[Television Critics Association]] Summer Press Tour in [[Pasadena, California]], YouTube TV announced it had signed a landmark multi-year deal with [[PBS]] to allow carriage of live streams of PBS member stations and [[PBS Kids#Network|PBS Kids Channel]] beginning as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 (just before or after the November pledge drives of select PBS stations). The deal – which is PBS’s first distribution agreement with a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) – would allow PBS stations the option of providing the direct over-the-air signals of local stations if they are able to clear the rights to at least 90% of their programming, a YouTube TV-exclusive dedicated feed in which shows that local PBS members are not able to clear for digital streaming would be replaced with separate programming or a PBS-provided national feed that would include programs fully cleared by the public broadcaster and localized [[station identification|station ID]] inserts (omitting local programs or [[pledge drive]]s), and would allow YouTube TV to provide streams of up to three PBS member stations within a given [[media market|market]]. 

Stations that choose to offer their main signal must notify YouTube TV if they plan to air a show without rights clearances, in which the service will replace the program with a [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] notice screen.<ref>{{cite news|title=PBS forges deal with YouTube TV for localized live streams|url=https://current.org/2019/07/pbs-forges-deal-with-youtube-tv-for-localized-live-streams/|author=Jill Goldsmith|newspaper=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]]|date=July 29, 2019|access-date=July 30, 2019|archive-date=July 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730133745/https://current.org/2019/07/pbs-forges-deal-with-youtube-tv-for-localized-live-streams/|url-status=live}}</ref> On December 15, 2019, the first PBS affiliate stations were added to YouTube TV.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/about/blogs/news/pbs-member-stations-now-live-on-youtube-tv/ | title=PBS Member Stations Now Live on YouTube TV &#124; PBS About | access-date=January 8, 2020 | archive-date=December 30, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230194850/http://www.pbs.org/about/blogs/news/pbs-member-stations-now-live-on-youtube-tv/ | url-status=live }}</ref>
