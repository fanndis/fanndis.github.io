'''David Richard Cunliffe''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO}} (born 30 April 1963) is a New Zealand management consultant and former politician who was [[Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] from September 2013 to September 2014. He was [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Titirangi (New Zealand electorate)|Titirangi]] and then [[New Lynn (New Zealand electorate)|New Lynn]] for the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] between 1999 and 2017. He served as the [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]], Minister for Communications and Information Technology and Minister of Immigration for the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]] from October 2007 until November 2008.

Cunliffe was first elected to [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] in the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]], standing as the Labour candidate for the [[Titirangi (New Zealand electorate)|Titirangi]] seat. Labour formed [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|a new Government]] and Cunliffe served as Chair of the Commerce Select Committee and sat on the Finance and Expenditure and Regulations Review select committees. 

Due to boundary changes for the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]] Cunliffe contested the seat of [[New Lynn (New Zealand electorate)|New Lynn]], which he won. Cunliffe's party continued in Government for its second term and he was made a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the Ministers of Commerce, Finance and Revenue before being elevated to the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]] as a Minister outside of Cabinet in 2003. At the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]], Cunliffe was returned in New Lynn with 18,087 votes (8,000 more than his nearest opponent) or 55% of the electorate vote,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://2005.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-31.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614043512/http://2005.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-31.html |archivedate=14 June 2007  }}</ref> and also promoted into [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]].

Cunliffe retained his seat in the {{NZ election link year|2008}}, {{NZ election link year|2011}}, and {{NZ election link|2014}}s, during which the Labour Party was in Opposition. He served various senior roles, including as Finance Spokesperson, but was regarded as "a destablising force" undermining the leadership of Labour Party leaders [[Phil Goff]] and [[David Shearer]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Manhire|first=Toby|date=2016-11-01|title=David Cunliffe is quitting politics.

Cunliffe's intention to retire from politics was announced by his successor, [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]], on 1 November 2016. Cunliffe officially resigned from Parliament in April 2017, near enough to the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 election]] to avoid the need for a [[List of New Zealand by-elections|by-election]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1 November 2016|title=David Cunliffe to retire from politics|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11739785|accessdate=1 November 2016|publisher=NZ Herald}}</ref>

===Cabinet minister (2005–2008)===
Cunliffe was appointed to the [[Cabinet of New Zealand]] in 2005 for the third term of the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]], initially as the [[Minister of Immigration (New Zealand)|Minister of Immigration]], Minister of Communications, Minister for Information Technology, and Associate Minister for Economic Development. He had previously held the Communications and Information Technology portfolios outside of Cabinet. A Cabinet reshuffle in 2007 saw him lose the Immigration portfolio in exchange for the more senior position as [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]].

==== Immigration ====
[[File:David Cunliffe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cunliffe closing the 2005 Auckland [[BioBlitz]]]]
As Immigration Minister in 2006, Cunliffe initiated a major review of the Immigration Act 1987 which, under the oversight of his successors, resulted in the eventual replacement of that Act with the new Immigration Act 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4157379a10.html|title=Immigration Act to drop 'Zaoui' law|publisher=[[NZPA]]|date=8 August 2007|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Immigration law change takes New Zealand forward|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/immigration-law-change-takes-new-zealand-forward|access-date=2020-06-10|website=The Beehive|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Immigration Bill reported back|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/immigration-bill-reported-back|access-date=2020-06-10|website=The Beehive|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=A new Act - a new era for immigration|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-act-new-era-immigration|access-date=2020-06-10|website=The Beehive|language=en}}</ref>

==== Communications and Information Technology ====
Cunliffe served as an Associate Minister for Communications and Associate Minister for Information Technology from 2003 before being promoted to the primary portfolios in 2004. The two portfolios were merged into a single ministerial role in 2007.

As Minister for Communications and Information Technology he announced extensive pro-competitive reform of the telecommunications sector, including [[Unbundling#New Zealand|local loop unbundling]] and operational separation of then Telecom New Zealand.<ref>{{cite press|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0606/S00543.htm|accessdate=22 March 2008|title=Cunliffe: Vision 2011 – Roadmap to the Top|publisher=New Zealand Government|date=28 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920195505/http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0606/S00543.htm|archivedate=20 September 2012}}</ref> 

In May 2006 Cunliffe was referred to the [[Securities Commission of New Zealand|Securities Commission]] by the [[NZX]] for commenting on [[Telecom New Zealand|Telecom]]'s future dividend plans,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.techday.co.nz/telecommunicationsreview/news/nzx-reports-cunliffe-to-securities-commission/8867/ |title=NZX reports Cunliffe to Securities Commission |first=David |last=Dickens |work=techday |date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130223024950/http://www.techday.co.nz/telecommunicationsreview/news/nzx-reports-cunliffe-to-securities-commission/8867/ |archivedate=23 February 2013  }}</ref> causing Telecom's stock price to drop.

On 30 June 2008 Cunliffe was conferred the title of ''Honorary Fellow of the NZCS'' (HFNZCS) by the [[New Zealand Computer Society]], the [[professional body]] of the [[information communication technology|ICT]] profession in recognition of his significant contribution to the ICT sector.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/7A0A42B6729524E6CC2574730081E642 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018055502/http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/7A0A42B6729524E6CC2574730081E642 |archivedate=18 October 2008  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nzcs.org.nz/tools/events/event.asp?SECT=wellington&ID=3061]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}</ref>

====Health====
Cunliffe was promoted to the Health portfolio in 2007, replacing [[Pete Hodgson]]. He received some attention when, early in the portfolio, he said to his opposition counterpart [[Tony Ryall]], "Mr Ryall, why don't you stay in your box. I'm running this show."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Noted|title=David Cunliffe: politician and poet - a 2008 profile|url=https://www.noted.co.nz/archive/archive-listener-nz-2013/david-cunliffe-politician-and-poet-a-2008-profile|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.noted.co.nz|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=17 December 2007|title=Pollies for wallies and winners|url=https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/the-dominion-post/20071217/282037617827342|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.pressreader.com|publisher=Dominion Post}}</ref>

===In Opposition (2008–2013)===
After the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] defeat of the Labour Party, Cunliffe was made Labour's spokesman for Finance, shadowing National's [[Finance Minister (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]], [[Bill English]]. Cunliffe had been touted as a future leader of the party, and party insiders had suggested he seriously considered challenging [[Phil Goff]] as leader in the aftermath of the 2008 election. Speculation of a leadership challenge again arose during the June 2010 expenses scandal and again after [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]]'s resignation from the party.

After Labour lost the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]] and Goff stood down, Cunliffe [[2011 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|ran for the party leadership]] with [[Nanaia Mahuta]] on a ticket for deputy leader. [[Grant Robertson]] and [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]] also entered the race, but subsequently backed [[David Shearer]], who won the high-profile race. Robertson became Deputy Leader, while Parker took Cunliffe's finance spokesmanship. Shearer retained Cunliffe in a senior role on the front bench, with the Economic Development and Associate Finance roles.<ref>{{cite web |title=David Cunliffe |url=http://www.labour.org.nz/davidcunliffe |work=New Zealand Labour Party |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503041252/http://www.labour.org.nz/davidcunliffe |archivedate=3 May 2012  }}</ref>

In November 2012 during a Labour Party conference, there was much media speculation Cunliffe would launch a challenge against David Shearer for leadership of the party.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Labours-Shearer-still-under-pressure/tabid/1607/articleID/277129/Default.aspx | work= 3 News NZ | title= Labour's Shearer still under pressure | date= 18 November 2012 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173931/http://www.3news.co.nz/Labours-Shearer-still-under-pressure/tabid/1607/articleID/277129/Default.aspx | archivedate= 14 October 2013 | df= dmy-all | access-date= 18 November 2012 }}</ref> On the morning of 19 November, Cunliffe confirmed he was not challenging Shearer, and would indeed back him if a vote was taken.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Cunliffe-Im-backing-Shearer/tabid/1607/articleID/277142/Default.aspx| archive-url= https://archive.today/20130222232330/http://www.3news.co.nz/Cunliffe-Im-backing-Shearer/tabid/1607/articleID/277142/Default.aspx| url-status= dead| archive-date= 22 February 2013| work= 3 News NZ| title= Cunliffe: I'm backing Shearer| date= 19 November 2012}}</ref>

====Labour Party leadership contest, 2013====
On 22 August 2013, Shearer announced his resignation as leader of the Labour Party. Cunliffe was expected to make another bid for the leadership but did not confirm his candidacy immediately.<ref>Stuff.co.nz "David Shearer quits as Labour leader." (22/08/13, retrieved 23/08/13)</ref> Victoria University of Wellington's [[iPredict]] online predictions market showed the probability of Cunliffe becoming the next leader of the Labour Party at 66%, compared to under 26% support for Shearer's deputy [[Grant Robertson]]; social development spokesperson [[Jacinda Ardern]] polled at 5%, and list MP [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] was on 2%.<ref>MSN NZ.co.nz "Cunliffe leading iPredict stakes."

[[Stuff.co.nz]] (26/08/13, retrieved 26/08/13).</ref>  His announcement came in the wake of a ONE News Colmar Brunton poll released by the current affair program Q+A which showed Cunliffe winning the support of 29% of the eligible voters asked, and 32% of those polled who support Labour.

Cunliffe received strong backing from the party's [[grassroots]] membership, although his leadership bid was supported by only one-third of the caucus.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Solutions|first1=EIU Digital|title=New Labour leader chosen|url=http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=200964404&Country=New%20Zealand&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=2024544386&oid=2024544386&uid=1|website=country.eiu.com|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=17 September 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924082128/http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=200964404&Country=New%20Zealand&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=2024544386&oid=2024544386&uid=1|archivedate=24 September 2016}}</ref> Cunliffe's leadership was opposed by many Labour MPs; several of his colleagues came to see him as "divisive, ambitious, self-absorbed and self-confident to a messianic level".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vowles |first1=Jack |last2=Coffé |first2=Hilde |last3=Curtin |first3=Jennifer |title=A Bark But No Bite: Inequality and the 2014 New Zealand General Election |date=2017 |publisher=ANU Press |isbn=978-1-76046-136-2 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mX44DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA133 |accessdate=18 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> He was described as a "polarising" politician,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vance |first1=Andrea |title=Loved and loathed: the polarising politician |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/editors-picks/9164503/Loved-and-loathed-the-polarising-politician |accessdate=8 May 2020 |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=14 September 2013 |language=en}}</ref> however his election as leader resulting in an initial increase in support for Labour; it rose to 37% in opinion polls.<ref name="herald2" />

In a speech to a women's symposium in July 2014, Cunliffe stated, "I am sorry for being a man".<ref name="herald2" /> He was commenting on [[domestic violence]] against women by men. His apology was regarded as insensitive, with Prime Minister [[John Key]] criticising the remark as "a bit insulting to imply that all men are abusive".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rutherford |first1=Hamish |last2=Dennett |first2=Kelly |title=David Cunliffe: I'm sorry for being a man |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10232457/David-Cunliffe-I-m-sorry-for-being-a-man |accessdate=8 May 2020 |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=4 July 2014 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>

With little time to make the structural changes needed to build a proper campaign and a party marked by continued infighting, Labour performed poorly in the [[Opinion polling for the 2014 New Zealand general election|public opinion polls]] during the run-up to the 2014 general election. It was, as Cunliffe was to say later, "the craziest and in some ways the most unfortunate campaign in recorded memory".<ref>{{cite news |author=Toby Manhire |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/20/new-zealand-election-john-keys-national-party-on-course-for-victory |title=New Zealand election: John Key's National party on course for victory &#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=1 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321172247/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/20/new-zealand-election-john-keys-national-party-on-course-for-victory |archivedate=21 March 2017  }}</ref>

====2014 general election====
Labour formally launched its campaign for [[2014 New Zealand general election]] in Auckland on 21 July. Cunliffe announced several flagship election policies, including a promise of free [[General practitioner|GP]] visits and prescriptions to pregnant women and those aged under 13 and over 65.<ref name="3news">{{cite news |title= Labour promises free GP visits |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/politics/labour-promises-free-gp-visits-2014081007 |publisher= 3 News |date= 10 August 2014 |accessdate= 4 September 2016 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150113053304/http://www.3news.co.nz/politics/labour-promises-free-gp-visits-2014081007 |archivedate= 13 January 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> In a speech he stated, "We are basing our policies on a very old idea. That your healthcare is based on your health need, not on the size of your wallet."<ref name="3news" />

He was criticised for taking a three-day skiing holiday in [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] at the start of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cunliffe 'regrets' taking ski holiday |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/250362/cunliffe-%27regrets%27-taking-ski-holiday |accessdate=8 May 2020 |work=[[RNZ]] |date=22 July 2014 |language=en-nz}}</ref>

His performance in the leadership debates was viewed as mixed. Key claimed a win in the 2 September ''[[The Press]]'' leaders' debate after Cunliffe could not answer whether family homes held in a trust would be exempt under Labour's [[capital gains tax]] policy,<ref>{{cite web|title=Key lands hit on Cunliffe over capital gains tax|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/archive/key-lands-hit-on-cunliffe-over-capital-gains-tax-6069749.html|publisher=Television New Zealand|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=2 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921220152/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/archive/key-lands-hit-on-cunliffe-over-capital-gains-tax-6069749.html|archivedate=21 September 2016}}</ref> but then went on to recover in the second and third debates.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vernon Small |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10452464/Leaders-debate-reveals-more-even-contest |title=Leaders debate reveals more even contest |website=Stuff.co.nz |date=2 September 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2017}}</ref>

Cunliffe's Labour Party received 25.1% of the party vote and 32 seats, its worst general election result since 1922.<ref name="Peters2014">{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Tom|title=New Zealand election: Labour's worst defeat in 92 years – World Socialist Web Site|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/09/22/nzel-s22.html|website=www.wsws.org|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=22 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916074445/https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/09/22/nzel-s22.html|archivedate=16 September 2016}}</ref> The National Party returned to power with 48.1% of the vote (its best result since 1951) while Labour claimed just 24.7%.<ref name="Peters2014" /> Cunliffe initially vowed to remain as the party leader, in spite of the poor election result. On 27 September Cunliffe formally resigned as leader but announced he was re-contesting in the [[2014 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|2014 leadership election]].<ref name="herald2">{{cite news|title=Labour leadership's turbulent ride|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11341685|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=13 October 2014|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref> Later on 13 October, he announced he was pulling out of the leadership race.<ref name="herald2" />

===Political views===
Cunliffe is generally liberal when it comes to conscience issues. He voted in favour of the [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003|decriminalisation of prostitution]], the [[Civil Union Act 2004|establishment of civil unions]], and the [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007|criminalisation of parental corporal punishment]]. He voted against [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand#Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill 2005|defining marriage as between one man and one woman]], and voted in favour of [[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013|legalising same-sex marriage]]. In 2006, he voted in favour of raising the legal drinking age from 18 to 20, but voted against it in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title= Parliamentary Conscience Votes Database – David Cunliffe |url= http://votes.wotfun.com/mp/David+Cunliffe/votes |accessdate= 11 August 2014 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714175039/http://votes.wotfun.com/mp/David+Cunliffe/votes |archivedate= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

Cunliffe has expressed a view that New Zealand will become a Commonwealth republic in the future. During the Address-In-Reply debate on 4 September 2002, Cunliffe said: "A New Zealand where we journey together towards maturity as a nation, and to the [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth republic]] I personally believe we will become before the Treaty turns 200".<ref name="republicquote">{{cite web|url=http://www.cunliffe.org.nz/6.news/articles/detail.asp?id=41 |title=David Cunliffe: Address-In-Reply speech |accessdate=1 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009001351/http://www.cunliffe.org.nz/6.news/articles/detail.asp?id=41 |archivedate=9 October 2007  }}</ref>

In the [[2018 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2018 New Year Honours]], Cunliffe was appointed a [[Companion of the Queen's Service Order]], for services as a member of Parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2018 |title=New Year honours list 2018 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=9 June 2018 |date=30 December 2017}}</ref>

In February 2020, Cunliffe was also appointed as chair of the Selwyn Foundation,<ref>{{cite web |title=Cunliffe appointed as Chair of The Selwyn Foundation BoT |url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO2002/S00026/cunliffe-appointed-as-chair-of-the-selwyn-foundation-bot.htm/ |work=[[Scoop.co.nz]] |date=3 February 2020}}</ref> one of New Zealand's largest independent charitable providers of services to older people and their families.

Seddon, New Zealand's [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand by term|longest serving]] prime minister, was thus Cunliffe's great-(great-)uncle.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greystar.co.nz/content/cunliffe%E2%80%99s-great-uncle-dick|title=Cunliffe's great-uncle Dick|work=Grey Star|accessdate=14 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123151158/http://greystar.co.nz/content/cunliffe%E2%80%99s-great-uncle-dick|archivedate=23 January 2015}}</ref>
