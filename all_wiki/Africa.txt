Early human civilizations, such as [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Phoenicia]] emerged in [[History of North Africa|North Africa]]. Following a subsequent long and complex history of civilizations, migration and trade, Africa hosts a large diversity of [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|ethnicities]], [[Culture of Africa|cultures]] and [[Languages of Africa|languages]]. The last 400 years have witnessed an increasing European influence on the continent. Starting in the 16th century, this was driven by trade, including the [[Slavery in Africa|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], which created large [[African diaspora]] populations in the Americas. In the [[New Imperialism|late 19th century]], European countries [[Scramble for Africa|colonized almost all of Africa]], extracting resources from the continent and exploiting local communities; most present states in Africa emerged from a process of [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] in the 20th century.

''[[Afri]]'' was a [[Latin]] name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the [[Nile]] river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean ([[Ancient Libya]]).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Georges|first1=Karl Ernst|editor1-last=Georges|editor1-first=Heinrich|encyclopedia=Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch|date=1913–1918|location=Hannover|edition=8th|url=http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|accessdate=20 September 2015|language=German|title=Afri|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116044500/http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|archivedate=16 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|date=1879|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer|accessdate=20 September 2015|title=Afer}}</ref> This name seems to have originally referred to a [[Ancient Libya|native Libyan]] tribe, an ancestor of modern [[Berbers]]; see [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion.

A Berber tribe was called ''Beni-Ifren'' in the Middle Ages and ''Ifurace'' was the name of a Tripolitan people in the 6th century. The name is from the Berber language ''ifri'' 'cave'. Troglodytism was frequent in northern Africa and still occurs today in southern Tunisia. Herodote wrote that the Garamantes, a North African people, used to live in caves. The Ancient Greek called ''troglodytēs'' an African people who lived in caves. ''Africa'' was coined by the Romans and {{'}}''Ifriqiyeh''{{'}} is the arabized Latin name.

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, [[Carthage]] became the capital of the province it then named ''[[Africa Proconsularis]]'', following its defeat of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Africa African Africanus Africus |publisher=Consultos.com }}</ref> The Latin suffix ''[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]'' can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''[[Gallia Celtica|Celtica]]'' from ''[[Celts|Celtae]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim region of [[Ifriqiya]], following its conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman)]] Empire's ''[[Exarchate of Africa|Exarchatus Africae]]'', also preserved a form of the name.

According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85–165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the isthmus of Suez and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
* The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Isidore of Seville]] in his 7th-century ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the [[Latin]] ''aprica'', meaning "sunny".
* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The [[Egyptian soul#Ka|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|title=Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey|publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk|date=29 October 1907|accessdate=18 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130200159/http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|archive-date=30 January 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fruyt, M. |title= D'Africus ventus a Africa terrain |journal=Revue de Philologie|volume= 50|year= 1976|pages= 221–38}}</ref> linking the Latin word with ''africus'' "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
* Robert R. Stieglitz of [[Rutgers University]] in 1984 proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew [[Ophir]]."<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3209914|jstor=3209914|title=Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume=47|issue=3|pages=134–142|year=1984|last1=Stieglitz|first1=Robert R.|s2cid=130072563}}</ref>

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.<ref name =Ayoub>{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|authorlink=Mahmoud M.

In West Africa, [[Dhar Tichitt]] and [[Oualata]] in present-day [[Mauritania]] figure prominently among the early urban centers, dated to 2,000 BC. About 500 stone settlements litter the region in the former savannah of the Sahara. Its inhabitants fished and grew millet. It has been found by Augustin Holl that the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] of the [[Mandé peoples]] were likely responsible for constructing such settlements. Around 300 BC the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline, most likely relocating to [[Koumbi Saleh]].<ref name="HollA1985">{{cite journal | vauthors = Holl, Augustin | title = Background to the Ghana Empire: archaeological investigations on the transition to statehood in the Dhar Tichitt region (Mauritania) | journal = Journal of Anthropological Archaeology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–115 | date = 1985 |url = https://www.academia.edu/2558381 | doi = 10.1016/0278-4165(85)90005-4 }}</ref> Architectural evidence and the comparison of pottery styles suggest that Dhar Tichitt was related to the subsequent [[Ghana Empire]].

Farther south, in central [[Nigeria]], around 1,500 BC, the [[Nok culture]] developed on the [[Jos Plateau]]. It was a highly centralized community. The Nok people produced lifelike representations in [[terracotta]], including human heads and human figures, elephants, and other animals. By 500 BC, and possibly earlier, they were smelting iron. By 200 AD the Nok culture had vanished.<ref name="PB 2014"/> and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years. Based on stylistic similarities with the Nok terracottas, the bronze figurines of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] kingdom of [[Ife]] and those of the [[Bini people|Bini]] kingdom of [[Benin]] are suggested to be continuations of the traditions of the earlier Nok culture.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 39.</ref><ref name="FB 1969"/>

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[San people]] of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Bantu peoples|peoples]] of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]]; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]]; [[Kingdom of Benin|Edo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people]] in [[West Africa]]; and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[Southeast Africa]].

By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Gao Region|Gao]], and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]].  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]] which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.

In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the [[Islam|Muslim]] north. The [[Kingdom of Nri]] was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day [[Nigeria]] and was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]]. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate [[Igbo-Ukwu#Bronzes|bronzes]], found at the town of [[Igbo-Ukwu]].

The [[Ifẹ|Kingdom of Ife]], historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly [[oba (ruler)|oba]] ('king' or 'ruler' in the [[Yoruba language]]), called the ''Ooni of Ife''. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the [[Oyo Empire]], where its obas or kings, called the ''Alaafins of Oyo'', once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the [[Fon people|Fon]] ''Kingdom of [[Dahomey]]'' was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.

Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named [[Sonni Ali]] (1464–1492) founded the [[Songhai Empire]] in the region of middle [[Niger]] and the western [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor [[Askia Mohammad I]] (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.<ref name="multiple">Lapidus, Ira M.

The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Jo Loosemore, Sailing against slavery]. BBC</ref>

Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of [[Lagos]]", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS|title=The West African Squadron and slave trade|publisher=Pdavis.nl|accessdate=18 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030306/http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm|archivedate=10 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift.

The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.<ref>Simon, Julian L. (1995) ''State of Humanity'', Blackwell Publishing. p. 175. {{ISBN|1-55786-585-X}}</ref>

Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of [[World War II]], when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bély, Lucien |title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltzav890zpIC&pg=PA118|year=2001|publisher=Editions Jean-paul Gisserot|isbn=978-2-87747-563-1|page=118}}</ref> [[Ghana]] followed suit the next year (March 1957),<ref>{{cite book|author1=Aryeetey, Ernest |author2=Harrigan, Jane |author3=Nissanke Machiko |title=Economic Reforms in Ghana: The Miracle and the Mirage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87V55ZHppSYC&pg=PA5|year=2000|publisher=Africa World Press|isbn=978-0-86543-844-6|page=5}}</ref> becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation Revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===
{{see|Decolonisation of Africa}}
[[File:African nations order of independence 1950-1993.gif|upright=1.2|thumb|An animated map shows the order of [[Decolonisation of Africa|independence of African nations]], 1950–2011]]
Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'état|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.
[[File:Africa’s wars and conflicts, 1980–96.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Africa's wars and conflicts, 1980–1996]]
[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=International Monetary Fund.|title=International Monetary Fund.|publisher=IMF|oclc=40951957}}</ref> also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In [[Rhodesia]], Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Patriotic Front]] waged a brutal [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] against the country's white government. There was a [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia|date=6 April 2000|accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>Robert G.

Another notable tragic event is the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war in Angola]] came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from [[China]],<ref name=Africa/> which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as [[Africa Rising]], can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.<ref>Jenny Aker, Isaac Mbiti, [https://ssrn.com/abstract=1693963 "Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa"] SSRN</ref> [[Human migration|Migration]] from African nations has increased dramatically in the last decade.<ref>{{cite news |title=At Least a Million Sub-Saharan Africans Moved to Europe Since 2010 |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/03/22/at-least-a-million-sub-saharan-africans-moved-to-europe-since-2010/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=22 March 2018 |access-date=8 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301003547/http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/03/22/at-least-a-million-sub-saharan-africans-moved-to-europe-since-2010/ |archive-date=1 March 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth.

The coastline is {{convert|26,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only {{convert|10,400,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} – about a third of the surface of Africa – has a coastline of {{convert|32,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=MW/> From the most northerly point, [[Ras ben Sakka]] in [[Tunisia]] (37°21' N), to the most southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in South Africa (34°51'15" S), is a distance of approximately {{convert|8,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>Lewin, Evans.

The African Plate is a major [[tectonic plate]] straddling the [[equator]] as well as the [[prime meridian]]. It includes much of the [[continent]] of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges.

Geologically, Africa includes the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; the [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran and the [[Anatolian Plateau]] of Turkey mark where the [[African Plate]] collided with Eurasia. The [[Afrotropical realm]] and the [[Saharo-Arabian Region|Saharo-Arabian desert]] to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] unites the north linguistically.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Africa}}
The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]], or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] plains and dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as [[sahel]] and [[steppe]] dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on Earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.<ref name="environmentalatlas">[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html "Africa: Environmental Atlas, 06/17/08."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105193432/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html |date=5 January 2012 }} [http://www.africa.upenn.edu African Studies Center], University of Pennsylvania.

===Ecology and biodiversity===
[[File:Vegetation Africa.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The main biomes in Africa.]]
Africa has over 3,000 [[protected area]]s, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and [[arable land]]. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa.

Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s.

In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in Addis Ababa.

The African Union, not to be confused with the [[African Union Commission|AU Commission]], is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan-African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan-African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union, regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's poorest and [[Human Development Index|least-developed]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla warfare]] to [[genocide]]).<ref>Sandbrook, Richard (1985) ''The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation'', Cambridge University Press.  passim</ref> Its total nominal GDP remains behind that of the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, India and France.

Africa is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries.  The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC).  The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa.  About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into debt.  A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/15/zambias-looming-debt-crisis-is-a-warning-for-the-rest-of-africa|title=Zambia's looming debt crisis is a warning for the rest of Africa|work=The Economist|accessdate=19 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>

From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably [[Angola]], [[Sudan]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], all of which had recently begun extracting their [[petroleum]] reserves or had expanded their [[oil extraction]] capacity.

In a recently published analysis based on [[World Values Survey]] data, the Austrian political scientist [[Arno Tausch]] maintained that several African countries, most notably [[Ghana]], perform quite well on scales of mass support for [[democracy]] and the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite document |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3214715 |ssrn=3214715|title=Africa on the Maps of Global Values: Comparative Analyses, Based on Recent World Values Survey Data|date=2018|last1=Tausch|first1=Arno|s2cid=158596579|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/87966/1/MPRA_paper_87966.pdf}}</ref>

Tausch's global value comparison based on the [[World Values Survey]] derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data, Tausch concluded "is really amazing". While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in [[Ghana]], the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]], and especially for Africa's leading economy, [[South Africa]]. High [[Human Inequality]], as measured by the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Report]]'s [[Index of Human Inequality]], further impairs the development of [[Human Security]]. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and [[human rights]] data, emerging from Africa, is reflected in the development of a [[civil society]].

Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa.

The peoples of West Africa primarily speak [[Niger–Congo languages]], belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some [[Nilo-Saharan]] and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Fulani]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] or [[Mande languages|Mande]] groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Zarma people|Zarma]], are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering [[Central Africa]].

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the [[Arabic language]] and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Berbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 March 2004}}</ref> The Berber-speaking [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and other often-[[nomad]]ic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Linguistic Prehistory of the Sahara|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/burials-migration-and-identity-in-the-ancient-sahara-and-beyond/linguistic-prehistory-of-the-sahara/76E34016357D7694FCF23CCF9A7F29D3|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa:
[[File:Map of African language families.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A simplistic view of language families spoken in Africa]]
* The [[Afroasiatic languages|''Afroasiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger–Congo languages|''Niger-Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps one of the largest in the world.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by approximately 400,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Khoisan Languages|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Khoisan.html|website=The Language Gulper|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref> Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, English and French (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres.

More than 85% of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products. The [[Organisation of African Unity|Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s decade as the African Decade on [[African traditional medicine|African Traditional Medicine]] in an effort to promote The WHO African Region’s adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kofi-Tsekpo|first=Mawuli|date=2004|title=Institutionalization of African traditional medicine in health care systems in Africa|journal=African Journal of Health Sciences|volume=11|issue=1–2|pages=i–ii|issn=1022-9272|pmid=17298111|doi=10.4314/ajhs.v11i1.30772}}</ref>  Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of populations, and the social-economic development of nations within sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunlop|first=David W.|date=November 1975|title=Alternatives to "modern" health delivery systems in Africa: Public policy issues of traditional health systems|journal=Social Science & Medicine|volume=9|issue=11–12|pages=581–586|doi=10.1016/0037-7856(75)90171-7|pmid=817397|issn=0037-7856}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Africa}}

Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.<ref name="pearsonhighered.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501070358/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Pearsonhighered.com|archivedate=1 May 2015}}</ref> Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.<ref name="pearsonhighered.com"/>

There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the [[African Renaissance]], led by [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Afrocentrism]], led by a group of scholars, including [[Molefi Asante]], as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and other forms of spirituality.

[[File:World cup african countries best results and hosts.png|thumb|Best results of African men's national football teams at the FIFA World Cup]]

Fifty-four African countries have [[Association football|football]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team and previously had [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] (ODI) status (from [[President's Cup 1997-98|10 October 1997]], until [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier#Super Six|30 January 2014]]). The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.
