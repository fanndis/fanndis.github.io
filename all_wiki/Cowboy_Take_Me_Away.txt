"'''Cowboy Take Me Away'''" is a song by recorded American [[country music]] group [[The Chicks|Dixie Chicks]], written by [[Martie Maguire]] and [[Marcus Hummon]].  It was released in November 1999 as the second single from their album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]''.  The song's title is derived from a famous [[Calgon#"Calgon, take me away!"|slogan]] used in commercials for [[Calgon]] bath and beauty products. It reached number one on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles and Tracks chart in February 2000.

Driven by co-writer [[Martie Maguire|Martie Seidel]]'s [[fiddle]], [[Emily Robison]]'s [[banjo]], and [[Natalie Maines]]' [[vocals]], "Cowboy Take Me Away" quickly became one of the trio's [[signature song]]s.  The lyric deals with a mixture of yearning for greater tranquility:

:''I wanna walk and not run, I wanna skip and not fall
:''I wanna look at the horizon, and not see a building standing tall

with plaintive desire for emotional, romantic connection, and simple joyous acceptance against a minor chord turning into major:

:''Oh it sounds good to me, yeah it sounds so good to me
:''Cowboy, take me away ...

Starting with a quiet opening, the record ramps up to a mid-tempo country-pop groove and features fiddle breaks from Seidel as well as an exuberant outro.  Maines was praised for a "sincere" vocal that escaped the clichés of "Nashville music-factory tearjerkers".<ref>[http://www.dixie-chicks.com/fly.shtml Dixie Chicks: Fly<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905145730/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/fly.shtml |date=2012-09-05 }}</ref> "Cowboy Take Me Away" has become a staple of the Chicks' concert [[set list]]s, appearing from the [[Fly Tour]] onwards.

Cowboy Take Me Away played on a number of local Christian radio stations in Uganda

==Music video==
The first scene of the [[music video]] for "Cowboy Take Me Away" shows a car stopping on a busy street, with Robison's high hot pink cowboy boot splashing through a puddle, and Maines waiting in a crowded elevator until reaching the top floor of an empty industrial-looking loft, joining the other two Chicks. The three begin singing the song and playing their instruments up there at the building-top in the center of a large city, resembling [[New York City]].  Gradually, the scene around them begins to slowly melt (via various [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] backdrops) of forest floors and snow-covered mountains and the like appear, while the trio dance and sing. The city does not ever disappear entirely, but the point is made.

The filming captured them at the height of their early days, when all three women had hair either naturally or dyed blonde. Maines' hair was cropped so short she looked like the country [[Cyndi Lauper]] and [[Martie Maguire|Martie Seidel]] with cross-colored braids and locks. Looking back, Robison commented, "You have three girls, so automatically you get the roll-the-eyes, you know; it's the band that's been put together," Robison says. "And at the time we were all blonde. And, you know, it was just so - it was so packageable. You know, it was just so easy for people to say, 'Oh, this is something manufactured.'"<ref name="drather1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/23/60II/main243501.shtml?source=search_story|title=Dixie Chicks Not Whistling Dixie|last=Rather|first=Dan|date=September 6, 2002|work=60 Minutes II|publisher=CBS News|pages=1–3|accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref>
