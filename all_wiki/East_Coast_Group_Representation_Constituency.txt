The '''East Coast Group Representation Constituency''' is a five-member [[Group Representation Constituency]] in the [[East Region, Singapore|eastern]] area of [[Singapore]]. The areas of the Group Representation Constituency consists of locations such as [[East Coast Park]], [[Bedok]], [[Changi]], [[Simei]], [[Siglap]], [[Tampines]], [[Pasir Ris]], [[Chai Chee]], [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] and the offshore [[island]]s of [[Pulau Tekong]], [[Pulau Ubin]] and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|Pedra Branca]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lai |first1=Linette |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/registers-of-electors-to-be-updated-pedra-branca-included-under-east-coast-electoral |title=Registers of electors to be updated, Pedra Branca included under East Coast electoral division |website=The Straits Times |access-date=14 November 2019 |date=1 February 2019}}</ref> The GRC also covers a large portion of Singapore's eastern territorial waters. The five divisions are [[Bedok]], [[Siglap]], Fengshan,  [[Changi]]-[[Simei]] and [[Kampong Chai Chee]].

East Coast GRC is led by [[Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Finance Minister]] [[Heng Swee Keat]]. Heng is also the [[Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies]]. He co-leads with [[Maliki Osman]], Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Foreign Affairs]] and Second Minister of [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Education]].

==History==

East Coast GRC was formed in [[1997 Singaporean general election|1997]] as a six-member Group Representation Constituency. East Coast GRC was formed with a merger of [[Bedok Group Representation Constituency]] and [[Eunos Group Representation Constituency]].

[[Joo Chiat Single Member Constituency]] was formerly part of the GRC until 2001, and subsumed into [[Marine Parade GRC]] as of the [[2015 Singapore general election|2015 elections]]. A large portion of the [[Kaki Bukit, Singapore|Kaki Bukit]] division and 60% of [[Chai Chee|Kampong Chai Chee]] was transferred from East Coast GRC to [[Marine Parade GRC]] and saw the removal of Chew Heng Ching, [[Tan Soo Khoon]] and [[Lee Yock Suan]] due to the advanced age in 2006, followed by [[S Jayakumar]] and [[Abdullah Tarmugi]] in 2011. It was downsized from six members to five members following the redrawing of divisions into the [[Marine Parade GRC]] in 2006. The offshore island of [[Pulau Serangoon|Coney Island]] was transferred to Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC in 2015, while [[Fengshan Single Member Constituency|Fengshan SMC]] was carved out and East Coast GRC was left with four members. East Coast GRC was increased in size to five after Fengshan SMC has been absorbed back into East Coast GRC for the [[2020 Singaporean general election|2020 general election]].

The [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) won in a walkover in the [[1997 Singapore general election|1997]] and [[2001 Singapore general election|2001 general elections]]. It saw its first contest in the [[2006 Singapore general election|2006 general election]] from the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]]. This GRC is a perennial battleground between the two parties. In 2011 and 2015, the PAP received numerous close fights with the WP and won both times, though the results allowed WP candidates to enter parliament as Non-Constituency MPs both times. 

In October 2015, Kampong Chai Chee MP, [[Lee Yi Shyan]] stepped down from his ministerial post after suffering from a mini stroke in May 2015. Prior to the [[2020 Singaporean general election|2020 general election]], [[Lee Yi Shyan]] and [[Lim Swee Say]] retired and were succeeded by [[Tan Kiat How]] and Deputy Prime Minister [[Heng Swee Keat]], the latter who was transferred from [[Tampines GRC]]. The resulting election saw the PAP retaining East Coast GRC, albeit with the second closest marginal result after [[West Coast GRC]]; WP candidates did not enter parliament as NCMPs this time as the offer was made to the [[Progress Singapore Party]] in West Coast as the best performing losers.
