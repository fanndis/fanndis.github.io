The '''Isle of Man''' ({{lang-gv|Mannin}} {{IPA-gv|ˈmanɪnʲ|}}, also {{lang|gv|Ellan Vannin}} {{IPA-gv|ˈɛlʲan ˈvanɪnʲ|}}), also known as '''Mann''' ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|n}}), is a self-governing British [[Crown dependencies|Crown dependency]] situated in the [[Irish Sea]] between [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. The [[head of state]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]], holds the title of [[Lord of Mann]] and is represented by a [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|lieutenant governor]]. The [[United Kingdom]] has responsibility for the island's military defence. 

Humans have lived on the island since before 6500 BC. [[Gaels|Gaelic]] cultural influence began in the 5th century AD, and the [[Manx language]], a branch of the [[Goidelic languages]], emerged. In 627 King [[Edwin of Northumbria]] conquered the Isle of Man along with most of [[Mercia]]. In the 9th century [[Norsemen]] established the [[thalassocratic]] [[Kingdom of the Isles]], which included the Isle of Man. [[Magnus Barefoot|Magnus III]], King of Norway from 1093 to 1103, reigned also as [[King of Mann and the Isles]] between 1099 and 1103.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 September 2014 |title=Magnus 3 Olavsson Berrføtt – Norsk biografisk leksikon |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Magnus_3_Olavsson_Berrf%C3%B8tt |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=Store norske leksikon |language=no}}</ref>

In 1266 the island became part of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] under the [[Treaty of Perth]], after being ruled by [[Norway]]. After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the island came under the feudal lordship of the [[The Crown|English Crown]] in 1399. The lordship [[Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765|revested]] in the British Crown in 1765, but the island never became part of the 18th-century [[kingdom of Great Britain]], nor of its successors, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the present-day [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. It has always retained its internal self-government.

In 1881 the Isle of Man [[parliament]], [[Tynwald]], became the first national [[legislative body]] in the world to give [[Women's suffrage|women the right to vote]] in a general election, although this excluded married women.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017 |title=Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man: Adult suffrage |url=http://www.tynwald.org.im/education/women/Pages/VotesForWomen.aspx |access-date=2 December 2017 |website=Tynwald.org.im}}</ref><ref>In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to grant ''all'' women the vote.</ref> In 2016, [[UNESCO]] awarded the Isle of Man [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|biosphere reserve status]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=UNESCO: Isle of Man biosphere reserve |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland/isle-of-man/ |access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref>

== Name ==
The Manx name of the Isle of Man is ''{{lang|gv|Ellan Vannin}}'': ''{{lang|gv|ellan}}'' ({{IPA-gv|ɛlʲan}}) is a Manx word meaning "island"; ''{{lang|gv|Mannin}}'' ({{IPA-gv|manɪnʲ|IPA}}) appears in the [[genitive case]] as ''{{lang|gv|Vannin}}'' ({{IPA-gv|vanɪnʲ|IPA}}), with [[Consonant mutation#Celtic languages|initial consonant mutation]], hence ''{{lang|gv|Ellan Vannin}}'', "Island of Mann". The short form used in English is spelled either Mann or Man. The earliest recorded Manx form of the name is ''{{lang|gv|Manu}}'' or ''{{lang|gv|Mana}}''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kinvig |first=R. H. |title=The Isle of Man: A Social, Cultural and Political History |date=1975 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=0-85323-391-8 |edition=3rd |page=18}}</ref>

The [[Old Irish]] form of the name is ''{{lang|sga|Manau}}'' or ''{{lang|sga|Mano}}''. [[Old Welsh]] records named it as ''{{lang|owl|Manaw}}'', also reflected in ''{{lang|owl|[[Manaw Gododdin]]}}'', the name for an ancient district in north Britain along the lower [[Firth of Forth]].<ref name="Koch2006">{{Cite book |last=Koch |first=John T. |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |date=2006 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-440-0 |page=676}}</ref>
The oldest known reference to the island calls it ''{{lang|la|Mona}}'', in [[Latin]] ([[Julius Caesar]], 54&nbsp;BC); in the 1st century AD, [[Pliny the Elder]] records it as ''{{lang|la|Monapia}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Monabia}}'', and [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century) as ''Monœda'' ({{lang|grc|Mοναοιδα}}, ''Monaoida'') or {{lang|grc|Mοναρινα}} (''Monarina''), in [[Koine Greek]].
Later Latin references have ''{{lang|la|Mevania}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Mænavia}}'' ([[Orosius]], 416),<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rivet |first=A. L. F. |last2=Smith |first2=Colin |date=1979 |title=The Place Names of Roman Britain |publisher=Batsford |pages=410–411}}</ref>
and ''{{lang|la|Eubonia}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Eumonia}}'' by Irish writers. It is found in the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] as ''{{lang|is|Mön}}''.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Moore|1903|p=84}}

The name is probably cognate with the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of the island of [[Anglesey]], ''{{lang|cy|Ynys Môn}}'',<ref name="Koch2006" />
usually derived from a [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic]] word for 'mountain' (reflected in Welsh ''{{lang|cy|mynydd}}'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''{{lang|br|menez}}'', and [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|monadh}}''),<ref>''[[Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch]]'': Record number 1277 (Root / lemma: men-1)</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Koch |first=John T. |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |date=2006 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-440-0 |page=679}}</ref>
from a [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*moniyos''.

The name was at least secondarily associated with that of [[Manannán mac Lir]] in [[Irish mythology]] (corresponding to Welsh ''{{lang|owl|[[Manawydan]] fab Llŷr}}'').<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kneale |first=Victor |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |date=2006 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |editor-last=Koch |editor-first=John T. |location=Santa Barbara |page=676 |chapter=Ellan Vannin (Isle of Man). Britonia}} The Old Irish name ''{{lang|sga|Manandán}}'' is often interpreted as 'He of [the isle of] Mann'. If the name of Mann reflects the generic word for 'mountain', it is impossible to distinguish this from a generic 'he of the mountain'; but the patronymic ''{{lang|sga|mac Lir}}'', interpreted as 'son of the Sea', is taken to reinforce the association with the island. See, e.g.: Wagner, Heinrich. "Origins of Pagan Irish Religion". ''Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie''. v. 38. 1-28.</ref> In the earliest Irish mythological texts, Manannán is a king of the [[otherworld]], but the 9th-century ''[[Sanas Cormaic]]'' identifies a [[Euhemerism|euhemerised]] Manannán as "a famous merchant who resided in, and gave name to, the Isle of Man".<ref>Cited after ''Catholic World'' 37 (1883) p. 261.<!--where I found this; I am sure we can attribute it to the ms. text more directly with some extra effort--></ref> Later, a Manannán is recorded as the first [[king of Mann]] in a Manx poem (dated 1504).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih4YAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA83 |title=The Dublin Review |publisher=W.

The island was cut off from the surrounding islands around 8000&nbsp;BC as sea levels rose following the end of the ice age. Humans colonised it by travelling by sea some time before [[Mesolithic|6500&nbsp;BC]].<ref name="Brad8">{{Cite book |last=Bradley |first=Richard |title=The prehistory of Britain and Ireland |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-84811-4 |page=8}}</ref> The first occupants were [[hunter-gatherer]]s and fishermen.

The [[Neolithic Period]] marked the beginning of farming, and the people began to build [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]], such as Cashtal yn Ard near [[Maughold (parish)|Maughold]], [[Godred Crovan|King Orry]]'s Grave at [[Laxey]], Meayll Circle near [[Cregneash]], and Ballaharra Stones at [[St John's, Isle of Man|St John's]].

During the [[Bronze Age]], the size of burial mounds decreased. The people put bodies into stone-lined graves with ornamental containers. The Bronze Age burial mounds survived as long-lasting markers around the countryside.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home - Manx National Heritage |url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/bronzeage/ |access-date=10 November 2017 |website=Manx National Heritage}}</ref>

Around the 5th century AD, large-scale migration from Ireland precipitated a process of [[Gaelicisation]], evidenced by [[Ogham]] inscriptions, and the [[Manx language]] developed. It is a [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic language]] closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-03-16 |title=Celtic Farmers |url=http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/ironage/ |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316143141/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/archaeology/ironage/ |archive-date=2012-03-16 |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage}}</ref>

[[Vikings]] arrived at the end of the 8th century. They established [[Tynwald]] and introduced many land divisions that still exist. In 1266 [[Magnus VI of Norway|King Magnus VI of Norway]] ceded the islands to Scotland in the Treaty of Perth. But Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established until 1275, when the Manx were defeated in the [[Battle of Ronaldsway]], near [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]].

In 1290 King [[Edward I of England]] sent [[Walter de Huntercombe, 1st Baron Huntercombe|Walter de Huntercombe]] to take possession of Mann. It remained in English hands until 1313, when [[Robert the Bruce|Robert Bruce]] took it after besieging [[Castle Rushen]] for five weeks. In 1314, it was retaken for the English by John Bacach of Argyll. In 1317, it was retaken for the Scots by [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray]] and Lord of the Isle of Man. It was held by the Scots until 1333. For some years thereafter control passed back and forth between the kingdoms until the English took it for the final time in 1346.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Barron |first=Evan MacLeod |title=The Scottish War of Independence |date=1997 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |page=411}}</ref> The English Crown delegated its rule of the island to a series of lords and magnates. [[Tynwald]] passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the [[Lord of Mann]].

In 1866, the Isle of Man obtained limited home rule, with partly democratic elections to the [[House of Keys]], but the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] was appointed by the Crown. Since then, democratic government has been gradually extended.

The Isle of Man has designated more than 250 historic sites as [[Registered Buildings of the Isle of Man|registered buildings]].

At the 2016 census,<ref name="census-2016" /> the Isle of Man was home to 83,314 people, of whom 26,997 resided in the island's [[capital city|capital]], [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], and 9,128 in the adjoining village of [[Onchan]]. The population decreased by 1.4% between the 2011 and 2016 censuses. By country of birth, those born in the Isle of Man were the largest group (49.8%), while those born in the United Kingdom were the next largest group at 40% (33.9% in [[England]], 3% in [[Scotland]], 2% in [[Northern Ireland]] and 1.1% in Wales), 1.8% in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and 0.75% in the [[Channel Islands]]. The remaining 8.5% were born elsewhere in the world, with 5% coming from EU countries (other than Ireland).

The island's parliament, [[Tynwald]], is claimed to have been in continuous existence since 979 or earlier, purportedly making it the oldest continuously governing body in the world, though evidence supports a much later date.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Taking Liberties - Star Items - Chronicle of Mann |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/322chronicleofmann.html |access-date=28 February 2015 |website=BL.uk}}</ref> Tynwald is a [[Tricameralism#Isle of Man|bicameral or tricameral]] legislature, comprising the [[House of Keys]] (directly elected by universal suffrage with a voting age of 16 years) and the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] (consisting of indirectly elected and [[Ex officio member|ex-officio members]]). These two bodies also meet together in joint session as Tynwald Court.

The executive branch of government is the [[Council of Ministers of the Isle of Man|Council of Ministers]], which is composed of members of the House of Keys. It is headed by the [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man|Chief Minister]], currently (November 2020) [[Howard Quayle]] [[Member of the House of Keys|MHK]].

[[Vice-regal]] functions of the head of state are performed by a [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|lieutenant governor]].

=== External relations and security ===
{{Main|External relations of the Isle of Man}}
In various laws of the United Kingdom, "the United Kingdom" is defined to exclude the Isle of Man. Historically, the UK has taken care of its external and defence affairs, and retains paramount power to legislate for the Island. However, in 2007, the Isle of Man and the UK signed an agreement<ref name="framework">{{Cite web |title=Framework for developing the international identity of the Isle of Man |url=http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/cso/iominternationalidentityframework.pdf |access-date=14 November 2018}}</ref> that established frameworks for the development of the international identity of the Isle of Man. There is no separate Manx citizenship. Citizenship is covered by UK law, and Manx people are classed as British citizens. The Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the European Union, and lies outside the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). There is a long history of relations and cultural exchange between the Isle of Man and Ireland. The Isle of Man's historic [[Manx language]] (and its modern revived variant) are closely related to both Scottish Gaelic and the Irish language, and in 1947, Irish Taoiseach [[Éamon de Valera]] spearheaded efforts to save the dying Manx language.

==== Defence ====
Under [[British law]], the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom. However, the UK takes care of its external and defence affairs.<ref>{{Cite report |title=Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969–1973, Volume I, Report (Cmnd 5460) |date=1973 |location=London}}</ref> There are no independent military forces on the Isle of Man, although [[HMS Ramsey (M110)|HMS ''Ramsey'']] is affiliated with the [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|town of the same name]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009 |title=HMS Ramsey |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/mine-countermeasure/sandown-class/hms-ramsey/ |access-date=11 September 2011 |publisher=Royal Navy}}</ref> From 1938 to 1955 there was the [[Manx Regiment]] of the British [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], which saw extensive action during the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Regimental Museum – History |url=http://www.iomguide.com/douglas/regimental-museum.php |access-date=11 September 2011 |website=Isle of Man Guide}}</ref> In 1779, the [[Royal Manx Fencibles|Manx Fencible Corps]], a [[fencible]] regiment of three companies, was raised; it was disbanded in 1783 at the end of the [[American War of Independence]].

====Manxman status====
{{Main|Manx passport}}
[[File:Isle of man passport.jpg|thumb|right|''British passport (Isle of Man)'']]

There is no citizenship of the Isle of Man as such under the British Nationality Acts [[British Nationality Act 1948|1948]] and [[British Nationality Act 1981|1981]].

The Passport Office, Isle of Man, Douglas, accepts and processes applications for the [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man]], who is formally responsible for issuing Isle of Man–issued British passports, entitled "''British Islands – Isle of Man''{{-"}}.

British citizens who have 'Manxman status', not being either born, naturalised or registered in the United Kingdom, and without a parent or grandparent who has, or if they have not themselves personally been resident in the United Kingdom for more than five consecutive years, do not have the same rights as other British citizens with regard to employment and establishment in other parts of the EU (other than the UK and Ireland).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Isle of Man Relationship with the European Union |url=https://www.gov.im/media/624101/protocol3relationshipwiththeeu.pdf |website=www.gov.im}}</ref>

Isle of Man-issued British passports can presently be issued to any British citizen resident in the Isle of Man, and also to British citizens who have a qualifying close personal connection to the Isle of Man but are now resident either in the UK or in either one of the two other Crown Dependencies.

==== European Union ====
{{update|section|Needs updating to reflect Brexit|date=January 2020}}
The Isle of Man was never part of the [[European Union]], nor did it have a [[Special member state territories and the European Union|special status]], and thus it did not take part in the 2016 [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on the UK's [[European Union|EU]] membership.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36618855 EU referendum: Brexit sends IoM on 'unknown journey], [[BBC News]], 24 June 2016</ref> However, Protocol 3 of the UK's Act of Accession to the [[Treaty of Rome]] included the Isle of Man within the [[EU's customs area]], allowing for trade in Manx goods without tariffs throughout the EU.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manx government explanation of Protocol 3 |url=http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/ebusiness/advantages/protocol3.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910004526/http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/ebusiness/advantages/protocol3.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2008 |access-date=10 November 2017 |website=Gov.im}}</ref> As it is not part of the [[EU's internal market]], there are still limitations on the movement of capital, services and labour.

EU citizens are entitled to travel and reside, but not work, in the island without restriction. British citizens with Manxman status are under the same circumstances and restrictions as any other non-EU European relating country to work in the EU.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Isle of Man Facts & Economic Data |url=http://www.gov.im/categories/business-and-industries/iom-key-facts-guide/island-facts/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050532/https://www.gov.im/categories/business-and-industries/iom-key-facts-guide/island-facts/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=12 September 2010 |website=Isle of Man Finance |publisher=Isle of Man Government}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=October 2006 |title=Immigration in the Isle of Man |url=http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/cso/immigrationintheisleofmanpub.pdf |access-date=12 September 2010 |publisher=Isle of Man Government |page=12}}</ref>

The political and diplomatic impacts of [[Brexit]] on the island are still uncertain. The UK has confirmed that the Crown Dependencies' positions were included in the [[Brexit negotiations]].<ref name="GRBWP">{{Cite web |date=30 March 2017 |title=Legislating for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/604514/Great_repeal_bill_white_paper_print.pdf |publisher=Department for Exiting the European Union}}</ref> The [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]] explicitly includes the Isle of Man in its territorial scope, but makes no other mention of it.<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 November 2018 |title=Draft Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf |publisher=European Commission}}</ref> The island's government website states that after the end of the implementation period, the Isle of Man's relationship with the EU will depend on the agreement reached between the UK and the EU on their future relationship.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Isle of Man Government - EU Exit and the Transition Period |url=https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/departments/cabinet-office/eu-exit-and-the-transition-period/ |access-date=2020-04-30 |website=www.gov.im}}</ref>

==== Commonwealth of Nations ====
The Isle of Man is not itself a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. By virtue of its relationship with the United Kingdom, it takes part in several Commonwealth institutions, including the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]]. The [[Government of the Isle of Man]] has made calls for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth,<ref>{{Cite web |title=The role and future of the Commonwealth |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/114/11410.htm |access-date=18 March 2013 |publisher=House of Commons}}</ref> including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Written evidence from the States of Guernsey |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/114/114we18.htm |access-date=18 March 2013 |publisher=Policy Council of Guernsey}}</ref> The [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man]] has said: "A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the island's international relationships."<ref>{{Cite news |date=23 November 2012 |title=Isle of Man welcomes report on Commonwealth future |work=Isle of Man Government |url=http://www.gov.im/lib/news/cso/isleofmanwelcome5.xml |url-status=dead |access-date=19 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302143313/http://www.gov.im/lib/news/cso/isleofmanwelcome5.xml |archive-date=2 March 2013}}</ref>

== Politics ==
[[File:IsleOfMan SheadingsAndParishes-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Local authorities and [[Local government in the Isle of Man#Sheadings|sheadings]] ]]

{{Main|Politics of the Isle of Man}}
{{See also|List of political parties in the Isle of Man|Elections in the Isle of Man}}
Most Manx politicians stand for election as independents rather than as representatives of political parties. Although political parties do exist, their influence is not nearly as strong as in the United Kingdom.

There are three political parties in the Isle of Man:
* The [[Liberal Vannin Party]] (established 2006) has one seat in the House of Keys; it promotes greater Manx autonomy and more accountability in government.
* The [[Manx Labour Party]] is active, and for much of the 20th century had several MHKs, but currently has no seats in either branch of Tynwald.
* The [[Isle of Man Green Party]] was established in 2016, but currently only has representation at [[Local government in the Isle of Man|local government]] level.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Isle of Man Green Party elects first councillor Andrew Bentley |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-45128963 |access-date=10 August 2018}}</ref>

There are also a number of pressure groups on the island. [[Mec Vannin]] advocate the establishment of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[republic]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mec Vannin |url=http://www.mecvannin.im/ |access-date=28 February 2015 |website=Mecvannin.im}}</ref> The [[Positive Action Group]] campaign for three key elements to be introduced into the governance of the island: open accountable government, rigorous control of public finances, and a fairer society.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PAG - Positive Action Group - Isle of Man - Positive Action Group - Isle of Man - Pag, Credit, Agreement, User, February |url=http://www.positiveactiongroup.org/ |access-date=28 February 2015 |website=Positiveactiongroup.org}}</ref>

=== Local government ===
{{Main|Local government in the Isle of Man}}
Local government on the Isle of Man is based partly on the island's 17 ancient parishes. There are two types of local authorities:
* a [[municipal corporation|corporation]] for the Borough of Douglas, and bodies of commissioners for the town districts of [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]], [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] and [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]], and
* the village districts of [[Kirk Michael]], [[Onchan]], [[Port Erin]] and [[Port St Mary]], and the 14 "parish districts" (those parishes or parts of parishes which do not fall within the districts previously mentioned). Each of these districts also has its own body of commissioners.

Local authorities are under the supervision of the Isle of Man Government's Department of Local Government and the Environment (DOLGE).

==Public services==
=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in the Isle of Man}}
Public education is under the Department of Education, Sport & Culture. Thirty-two primary schools, five secondary schools and the [[University College Isle of Man]] function under the department.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-11-21 |title=Department of Education and Children Home Page |url=http://www.gov.im/education/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121125241/http://www.gov.im/education/ |archive-date=2010-11-21 |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=Isle of Man Government Department of Education and Children}}</ref>

=== Health ===
{{Main|Health in the Isle of Man}}
Health and social care on the Isle of Man is the responsibility of the [[Department of Health and Social Care (Isle of Man)|Department of Health and Social Care]]. Healthcare is free for residents and visitors from the UK.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Healthcare on the Isle of Man |url=https://www.locate.im/article/practical-advice/healthcare-on-the-isle-of-man/ |access-date=4 October 2017 |website=LOcate IM}}</ref>

* [[Isle of Man Coastguard]]
* [[Isle of Man Fire and Rescue Service]]
* [[Isle of Man Ambulance Service]]
* [[Isle of Man Civil Defence Corps]]

All of these services are controlled directly by the [[Department of Home Affairs (Isle of Man)|Department of Home Affairs]] of the Isle of Man Government, and are independent of the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the Isle of Man Constabulary voluntarily submits to inspection by the British inspectorate of police,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Welcome to the Isle of Man Constabulary |url=http://www.gov.im/dha/police/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303101639/http://www.gov.im/dha/police/ |archive-date=3 March 2007 |access-date=11 September 2011 |publisher=Isle of Man Government}}</ref> and the Isle of Man Coastguard contracts Her Majesty's Coastguard (UK) for air-sea rescue operations.

===Crematorium===
The island's sole crematorium is in Glencrutchery Road, Douglas and is operated by Douglas Borough Council. Usually staffed by four, in March 2020 an increase of staff to 12 was announced by the council leader, responding to the threat of coronavirus which could require more staff.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2020-03-13 |title=More staff trained to operate island's crematorium |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-51861337 |access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref>

The Isle of Man [[Department for Enterprise (Isle of Man)|Department for Enterprise]] manages the diversified economy in 12 key sectors.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Isle of Man: Key sectors |url=http://www.whereyoucan.com/sectors |access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref> The largest sectors by GNP are insurance and [[Online gambling|eGaming]] with 17% of GNP each, followed by [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] and banking with 9% each.

The sector provides laser optics, industrial diamonds, electronics, plastics and aerospace precision engineering. Tourism, agriculture, fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, now make very little contributions to the island's GDP.

The unemployment rate is around 5%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Isle of Man Government - Unemployment |url=https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/departments/cabinet-office/economic-affairs-division/unemployment/ |access-date=2020-09-08 |website=www.gov.im}}</ref>

Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide income basis rather than a [[remittance]] basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the island.

The standard rate of [[corporate tax|corporation tax]] for residents and non-residents is 0%. Retail business profits above £500,000 and banking business income are taxed at 10%, and rental (or other) income from land and buildings situated on the Isle of Man is taxed at 20%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Isle of Man Government: Corporate Tax Rules |url=https://www.gov.im/categories/tax-vat-and-your-money/income-tax-and-national-insurance/business-and-corporations/corporate-tax-rates/ |access-date=2 December 2017 |website=Gov.im}}</ref>

Trade takes place mostly with the United Kingdom. The island is in customs union with the UK, and related revenues are pooled and shared under the [[Common Purse Agreement]]. This means that the Isle of Man cannot have the lower excise revenues on alcohol and other goods that are enjoyed in the [[Channel Islands]].

The Manx government [[Isle of Man Film|promotes island locations for making films]] by offering financial support.

Tourist numbers peaked in the first half of the 20th century, prior to the boom in cheap travel to Southern Europe that also saw the decline of tourism in many similar English seaside resorts. The Isle of Man tourism board has recently invested in "Dark Sky Discovery" sites to diversify its tourism industry. It is expected that dark skies will generally be nominated by the public across the UK. However, the Isle of Man tourism board tasked someone from their team to nominate 27 places on the island as a civil task. This cluster of the highest quality "Milky Way" sites<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dark Sky Discovery Sites |url=http://www.darkskydiscovery.org.uk/dark-sky-discovery-sites/map.html#sites |access-date=10 November 2017 |website=Darkskydiscovery.org.uk}}</ref> is now well promoted within the island. This government push has effectively given the island a headstart in the number of recognised Dark Sky sites. However, this has created a distorted view when compared to the UK where this is not promoted on a national scale. There, Dark Sky sites are expected to be nominated over time by the public across a full range of town, city and countryside locations rather than ''en masse'' by government departments.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stargazing Sites in the Isle of Man - Isle of Man |url=http://www.visitisleofman.com/placestovisit/darkskysites/darkskies.xml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911125709/http://www.visitisleofman.com/placestovisit/darkskysites/darkskies.xml |archive-date=11 September 2016 |access-date=10 November 2017 |website=Visitisleofman.com}}</ref>

=== Communications ===
{{Main|Communications on the Isle of Man}}
The main telephone provider on the Isle of Man is [[Manx Telecom]]. The island has two mobile operators: Manx Telecom, previously known as Manx Pronto, and [[Sure (company)|Sure]]. [[Cloud9 (service provider)|Cloud9]] operated as a third mobile operator on the island for a short time, but has since withdrawn.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Broadband internet services are available through four local providers: Wi-Manx, Domicilium, Manx Computer Bureau and [[Manx Telecom]]. The island does not have its own [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] [[list of country calling codes|country code]], but is accessed via the British country code (+44), and the island's telephone numbers are part of the [[Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom|British telephone numbering plan]], with local dialling codes 01624 for landlines and 07524, 07624 and 07924 for mobiles. Calls to the island from the UK however, are generally charged differently from those within the UK, and may or may not be included in any "inclusive minutes" packages.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Phone Tariff Residential |url=http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/consumer/assets/downloads/BT_PhoneTariff_Residential.pdf |website=BT.com |publisher=[[BT Group]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Calling abroad from the UK |url=http://international.o2.co.uk/internationaltariffs/calling_abroad_from_uk |website=O2.com |publisher=Telefónica Europe}}</ref>

In 1996, the Isle of Man Government obtained permission to use the [[.im]] national [[top-level domain]] (TLD), and has ultimate responsibility for its use. The domain is managed from day to day by Domicilium, an island-based internet service provider.

In December 2007, the [[Manx Electricity Authority]] and its telecommunications subsidiary, e-llan Communications, commissioned the laying of a new fibre-optic link that connects the island to a worldwide fibre-optic network.

The Isle of Man has three radio stations: [[Manx Radio]], [[Energy FM (Isle of Man)|Energy FM]] and 3 FM.

There is no insular television service, but local transmitters retransmit British mainland digital broadcasts via the free-to-air [[digital terrestrial]] service [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. The Isle of Man is served by [[BBC North West]] for [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] television services, and [[ITV Granada]] for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

Many television services are available by satellite, such as [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]], and [[Freesat]] from the group of satellites at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° East]], as well as services from a range of other satellites around Europe such as the [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellites at [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]] and [[Hotbird]].

The Isle of Man has three newspapers, all weeklies, and all owned by [[Isle of Man Newspapers]], a division of the Edinburgh media company [[Johnston Press]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our Business |url=http://www.johnstonpress.co.uk/jpplc/ourbusiness/publishingdivision/division.jsp |access-date=12 September 2011 |publisher=Johnston Press}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The ''[[Isle of Man Courier]]'' (distribution 36,318) is free and distributed to homes on the island. The other two newspapers are ''[[Isle of Man Examiner]]'' (circulation 13,276) and the ''[[Manx Independent]]'' (circulation 12,255).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Isle of Man Newspapers |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/newspaper.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822194758/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/newspaper.aspx |archive-date=22 August 2008 |access-date=4 September 2008 |website=IOMToday |publisher=[[Isle of Man Newspapers]]}}</ref>

Postal services are the responsibility of [[Isle of Man Post]], which took over from the British [[General Post Office]] in 1973.

=== Transport ===

=== Electricity supply ===
The electricity supply on the Isle of Man is run by the [[Manx Electricity Authority]]. The Isle of Man is connected to [[National Grid (Great Britain)|Great Britain's national grid]] by a 40&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] [[alternating current]] link ([[Isle of Man to England Interconnector]]). There are also hydroelectric, natural gas and diesel generators. The government has also planned a 700 MW offshore wind farm, roughly half the size of [[Walney Wind Farm]].<ref name="4coff">{{Cite web |date=1 February 2017 |title=Isle of Man Offshore Wind Farm |url=https://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/windfarms.aspx?windfarmid=IM01 |access-date=14 November 2018 |website=4C Offshore}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of the Isle of Man}}
The culture of the Isle of Man is often promoted as being influenced by its [[Celt]]ic and, to a lesser extent, its [[Norsemen|Norse]] origins. Proximity to the UK, popularity as a UK tourist destination in Victorian times, and immigration from Britain has meant that the cultures of Great Britain have been influential at least since [[Revestment (Isle of Man)|Revestment]]. Revival campaigns have attempted to preserve the surviving vestiges of Manx culture after a long period of [[Anglicisation]], and there has been significantly increased interest in the Manx language, history and musical tradition.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Languages of the Isle of Man}}
[[File:Douglas Isle of Man welcome sign.jpg|thumb|right|A bilingual sign in the Isle of Man featuring [[Manx language|Manx]] and English]]

Manx is closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]], but is orthographically [[sui generis]].

On the island, the [[Manx language|Manx]] greetings ''{{lang|gv|moghrey mie}}'' (good morning) and ''{{lang|gv|fastyr mie}}'' (good afternoon) can often be heard.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Alan |title=An Introduction to Applied Linguistics |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-3354-8 |edition=2nd The Manx}}</ref> As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the concepts of "evening" and "afternoon" are referred to with one word.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manx Culture |url=http://www.visitisleofman.com/culture/ |access-date=17 September 2011 |website=VisitIsleOfMan.com}}</ref> Two other Manx expressions often heard are ''Gura mie eu'' ("Thank you"; familiar 2nd person singular form ''Gura mie ayd'') and ''{{lang|gv|traa dy liooar}}'', meaning "time enough", this represents a stereotypical view of the Manx attitude to life.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Arthur William |first=Moore |title=The Folk-Lore of the Isle of Man |date=1971 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=1-60506-183-2 |edition=Reprint |page=274}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=8 January 2011 |title=Moscow Manx cheese |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/education/moscow_manx_cheese_1_2908142?showResult=true&pollContentId=7.52601 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804201941/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/education/moscow_manx_cheese_1_2908142?showResult=true&pollContentId=7.52601 |archive-date=4 August 2012 |access-date=17 September 2011 |website=IOMToday}}</ref>

=== Symbols ===
[[File:The Legs of Man - Isle of Man Triskelion - kingsley - 19-APR-09.jpg|right|thumb|A sculpture of the Manx [[triskelion]] in front of [[Isle of Man Airport|Ronaldsway Airport]] terminal]]

For centuries, the island's symbol has been the so-called "three legs of Mann" ({{lang-gv|Tree Cassyn Vannin}}), a [[triskelion]] of three legs conjoined at the thigh. The Manx triskelion, which dates back with certainty to the late 13th century, is of uncertain origin. It has been suggested that its origin lies in [[Sicily]], an island which has been associated with the triskelion since ancient times.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Archeologia del Mediterraneo: Studi in onore di Ernesto De Miro |date=2003 |publisher=L'Erma di Bretschneider |isbn=978-88-8265-134-3 |editor-last=Fiorentini |editor-first=Graziella |pages=735–736 |editor-last2=De Miro |editor-first2=Ernesto |editor-last3=Calderone |editor-first3=Anna |editor-last4=Caccamo Caltabiano |editor-first4=Maria}}|date=December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |first=RJA |date=2000 |title=On the Trail of the Triskeles: From the McDonald Institute to Archaic Greek Sicily |journal=[[Cambridge Archaeological Journal]] |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=35–61 |doi=10.1017/S0959774300000020}}</ref>

The symbol appears in the island's [[Flag of the Isle of Man|official flag]] and [[Coat of arms of the Isle of Man|official coat of arms]], as well as [[currency of the Isle of Man|its currency]]. The Manx triskelion may be reflected in the island's motto, {{lang-la|Quocunque jeceris stabit}}, which appears as part of the island's coat of arms.

=== Religion ===
{{See also|Diocese of Sodor and Man}}
[[File:Peel Cathedral 01.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Peel Cathedral]]]]

The predominant religious tradition of the island is [[Christianity]]. Before the Protestant Reformation, the island had a long history as part of the unified [[Western Church]], and in the years following the Reformation, the religious authorities on the island, and later the population of the island, accepted the religious authority of the British monarchy and the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Moore |first=A. |title=Diocesan Histories. Sodor and Mann. |url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/dh1893/index.htm}}</ref> It has also come under the influence of Irish religious tradition. The island forms a separate diocese called [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]], which in the distant past comprised the medieval kingdom of Man and the Scottish isles ("Suðreyjar" in Old Norse). It now consists of 16 parishes,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gumbley |first=Ken |date=2012-03-01 |title=Diocese of Sodor and Man |url=http://www.gumbley.net/diocese.htm |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=Welcome to Kirk Braddan}}</ref> and since 1541<ref>Act of Parliament (1541) 33 Hen.8 c.31</ref> has formed part of the [[Province of York]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-05-28 |title=England-Sodor & Man |url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/diocese.cfm?Idind=214 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528223800/http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/diocese.cfm?Idind=214 |archive-date=2012-05-28 |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=Anglican Communion}}</ref> (These modern ecclesiastical parishes do not correspond to the island's ancient parishes mentioned in this article under "Local Government", but more closely reflect the current geographical distribution of population.)

Other Christian churches also operate on the Isle of Man. The second largest denomination is the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Church]], whose Isle of Man District is close in numbers to the Anglican diocese. There are eight Catholic parish churches, included in the [[Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Archdiocese of Liverpool |url=http://www.liverpoolcatholic.org.uk |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=Liverpool Catholic}}</ref> as well as a presence of [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians. Additionally there are five [[Baptist]] churches, four [[Pentecostal]] churches, the [[Salvation Army]], a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Isle of Man|ward]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], two congregations of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], two [[United Reformed]] churches, as well as other Christian churches. There is a small [[Muslim]] community, with its own mosque in Douglas, and there is also a small [[Jewish]] community; see [[history of the Jews in the Isle of Man]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-05-28 |title=Religious Faiths and Organisations |url=http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608055741/http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml |archive-date=2003-06-08 |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=Isle of Man Government}}</ref>

=== Myth, legend and folklore ===
[[File:Isle of Man Peel Castle.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Peel Castle]]]]
In Manx mythology, the island was ruled by the sea god [[Manannán mac Lir|Manannán]], who would draw his misty cloak around the island to protect it from invaders. One of the principal folk theories about the origin of the name ''Mann'' is that it is named after Manannán.

In the Manx tradition of [[folklore]], there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the {{lang|gv|[[Buggane]]}}, a malevolent spirit which, according to legend, blew the roof off St Trinian's Church in a fit of rage; the {{lang|gv|[[Fenodyree]]}}; the {{lang|gv|[[Glashtyn]]}}; and the {{lang|gv|[[Moddey Dhoo]]}}, a [[black dog (ghost)|ghostly black dog]] which wandered the walls and corridors of [[Peel Castle]].

The Isle of Man is also said to be home to [[mooinjer veggey|fairies]], known locally as "the little folk" or "themselves". There is a famous [[Fairy Bridge (Isle of Man)|Fairy Bridge]], and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the {{lang|gv|Mi'raj}} and the {{lang|gv|[[Arkan Sonney]]}}.

An old Irish story tells how [[Lough Neagh]] was formed when Ireland's legendary giant [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the [[Irish Sea]], thus creating the island.

Peel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian [[Avalon]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Avalon's Location |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/avalon.htm |access-date=28 February 2015 |website=Electricscotland.com}}</ref> or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of [[Lancelot]]'s encounter with the sword bridge of King [[Maleagant]].<ref>King Arthur, Norma Lorre Goodrich, Harper and Row, 1989, p. 318</ref>

One of the most often-repeated myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend which comes from a Scottish legend, which in turn comes from a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created with the opening of the museum.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manx witchcraft and sorcery probed by academic - Isle of Man Today |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227154121/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837 |archive-date=27 December 2015 |access-date=10 November 2017 |website=Iomtoday.co.im}}</ref> However, there has been a strong tradition of herbalism and the use of charms to prevent and cure illness and disease in people and animals.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nisbet |first=Robert A |title=Yn Lioar Manninagh: The Journal of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society |last2=Rhys |first2=John |date=1897 |publisher=Brown & Sons |volume=Vol 3 |location=Douglas |pages=303–314 |language=English |chapter=Folk-Medicine in the Isle of Man – A.

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of the Isle of Man}}

[[File:Bee Gees Plaque - Union Mills IOM - kingsley - 21-APR-09.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bee Gees]] plaque at Maitland Terrace/Strang Road intersection in [[Union Mills]], Isle of Man]]
The music of the Isle of Man reflects [[Celt]]ic, Norse and other influences, including from its neighbours, [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[England]] and [[Wales]]. A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop.

Its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called {{lang|gv|[[Yn Chruinnaght]]}} in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trad music in the Isle of Man |url=http://www.ceolas.org/Regions/Manx-article.html |access-date=28 February 2015 |website=Ceolas.org}}</ref> This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974.

The Isle of Man was mentioned in the [[The Who|Who]] song "[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]" as the homeland of the song's titular character, who is always in a state of ecstasy, no matter what happens to him. The song 'The Craic was 90 in the Isle of Man' by [[Christy Moore]] describes a lively visit during the Island's tourism heyday. The Island is also the birthplace of Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, of the [[Bee Gees]].

=== Food ===
In the past, the basic national dish of the island was ''spuds and herrin'', boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish was supported by the subsistence farmers of the island, who [[Crofting|crofted]] the land and fished the sea for centuries. A more recent claim for the title of national dish could be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to [[poutine]], is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut [[French fried potatoes|chips]], covered in shredded Manx [[Cheddar cheese]] and topped with a thick gravy.<ref>{{Cite web |last=isleofman.com |title=Attractions :: isleofman.com |url=http://www.isleofman.com/attractions/cuisine/ |access-date=10 November 2017 |website=Isleofman.com}}</ref> However, as of the Isle of Man Food & Drink Festival 2018, [[Queen scallop|queenies]] have been crowned the Manx national dish.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Dish of the Isle of Man - Locate Isle of Man |url=https://www.locate.im/articles/national-dish-of-the-isle-of-man- |access-date=2020-05-20 |website=www.locate.im}}</ref>

Seafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet. Although commercial fishing has declined in recent years, local delicacies include Manx [[kipper]]s (smoked herring) which are produced by the smokeries in Peel on the west coast of the island, albeit mainly from [[North Sea]] herring these days.<ref name="Assoc1971">{{Cite journal |date=November 1971 |title=American Motorcyclist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 |journal=American Motorcyclist : The Monthly Journal of the American Motorcyclist Association |publisher=American Motorcyclist Association |page=22 |issn=0277-9358 |access-date=12 September 2011}}</ref> The smokeries also produce other specialities including smoked salmon and bacon.

Crab, lobster and scallops are commercially fished, and the [[queen scallop]] (''queenies'') is regarded as a particular delicacy, with a light, sweet flavour.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Evans |first=Ann |date=30 May 2009 |title=Scallops the main ingredient of unique gathering for foodies; SUN, sea, sand and shellfish |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Scallops+the+main+ingredient+of+unique+gathering+for+foodies%3B+SUN,...-a0200817093 |access-date=12 September 2011 |website=Coventry Evening Telegraph |publisher=Coventry Newspapers |via=TheFreeLibrary.com}}</ref> Cod, [[Common ling|ling]] and mackerel are often angled for the table, and freshwater trout and salmon can be taken from the local rivers and lakes, supported by the government fish hatchery at Cornaa on the east coast.

Cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are all commercially farmed; Manx lamb from the hill farms is a popular dish. The [[Manx Loaghtan|Loaghtan]], the indigenous breed of Manx sheep, has a rich, dark meat that has found favour with chefs,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kallaway |first=Jane |title=Award winning organic lamb |url=http://www.langleychase.co.uk/ |access-date=12 September 2011 |publisher=Langley Chase Organic Farm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Purely Isle of Man |url=http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/iomfinance/factsheets/isleofmanproduce.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012054640/http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/iomfinance/factsheets/isleofmanproduce.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2012 |access-date=12 September 2011 |publisher=Isle of Man Department of Finance}}</ref> featuring in dishes on the BBC's ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' series.

Beer is brewed on a commercial scale by [[Okells|Okells Brewery]], which was established in 1850 and is the island's largest brewer; and also by [[Bushy's Brewery]] and the Hooded Ram Brewery.

Isle of Man teams and individuals participate in many sports both on and off the island including [[rugby union]], [[association football|football]], [[gymnastics]], [[field hockey]], [[netball]], [[taekwondo]], [[bowling]], obstacle course racing and [[cricket]]. It being an island, many types of watersports are also popular with residents.

==== Motorcycle racing ====
{{details|Isle of Man TT}}
The main international event associated with the island is the [[Isle of Man TT|Isle of Man Tourist Trophy]] race, colloquially known as "The TT",<ref>Wright, David. 100 Years of the Isle of Man TT: A Century of Motorcycle Racing. The Crowood Press, 2007</ref> which began in [[1907 Isle of Man TT|1907]]. It takes place in late May and early June. The TT is now an international [[road racing]] event for motorcycles, which used to be part of the World Championship, and is long considered to be one of the "greatest motorcycle sporting events of the world".<ref>Disko, Sasha. The Image of the "Tourist Trophy" and British Motorcycling in the Weimar Republic. International Journal of Motorcycle Studies, Nov 2007</ref> Taking place over a two-week period, it has become a festival for motorcycling culture, makes a huge contribution to the island's economy and has become part of Manx identity.<ref>Vaukins, Simon. The Isle of Man TT Races: Politics, Economics and National Identity. International Journal of Motorcycle Studies, Nov 2007</ref> For many, the Isle carries the title "road racing capital of the world".<ref>Faragher, Martin. "Cultural History: Motor-Cycle Road Racing."

==== Cammag ====
{{Main|Cammag}}
Prior to the introduction of football in the 19th century, [[Cammag]] was the island's traditional sport.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Game of Cammag |url=http://www.celticlife.ca/index.php/Sports/the-game-of-cammag.html |access-date=12 September 2011 |website=Celticlife.ca}}</ref> It is similar to the Irish [[hurling]] and the Scottish game of [[shinty]]. Nowadays there is an annual match at [[St John's, Isle of Man|St John's]].

=== Cinema ===
<!-- Sub-section title is a redirect target -->
The Isle of Man has two cinemas, both in Douglas. The Broadway Cinema is located in the government-owned and -run Villa Marina and [[Gaiety Theatre, Isle of Man|Gaiety Theatre]] complex. It has a capacity of 154 and also doubles as a conference venue.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Broadway Cinema |url=http://www.gov.im/villagaiety/broadway.xml/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306124729/http://www.gov.im/villagaiety/broadway.xml |archive-date=6 March 2013 |access-date=6 March 2013 |website=Gov.im}}</ref>

The Palace Cinema is located next to the derelict [[Castle Mona]] hotel and is operated by the Sefton Group.

=== Fauna ===
{{Main|Manx cat|Manx Loaghtan|Biota of the Isle of Man|Extinct animals from the Isle of Man}}
[[File:Black Manx cat.JPG|Black Manx cat|thumb|left]]
Two domestic animals are specifically connected to the Isle of Man, though they are also found elsewhere.

The [[Manx cat]] is a breed of cat noted for its genetic mutation that causes it to have a shortened tail. The length of this tail can range from a few inches, known as a "stumpy", to being completely nonexistent, or "rumpy". Manx cats display a range of colours and usually have somewhat longer hind legs compared to most cats. The cats have been used as a symbol of the Isle of Man on coins and stamps and at one time the Manx government operated a breeding centre to ensure the continuation of the breed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Commings |first=Karen |url=https://archive.org/details/manxcats00kare/page/7 |title=Manx Cats: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Grooming, and Behavior |date=1999 |publisher=Barron's Educational |isbn=978-0764107535 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manxcats00kare/page/7 7–10] |url-access=registration}}</ref>
[[File:Manx loaghtan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manx Loaghtan]] sheep are bred on the island for their meat.]]
The [[Manx Loaghtan]] sheep is a breed native to the island. It has dark brown wool and four, or sometimes six, horns. The meat is considered to be a delicacy.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2009-11-16 |title=Farming the Manx Loaghtan sheep |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/isleofman/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8333000/8333801.stm |access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> There are several flocks on the island and others have been started in England and [[Jersey]].

A more recent arrival on the island is the [[red-necked wallaby]], which is now established on the island following an escape from the Wildlife Park.<ref>{{Cite news |date=14 August 2016 |title=Wallabies flourishing in the wild on Isle of Man |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/14/wallabies-isle-of-man-wild-australia |access-date=10 November 2017}}</ref> The local police report an increasing number of wallaby-related calls.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Marshall |first=Francesca |date=2018-09-07 |title=Calls for wallaby warning signs to be implemented on the Isle of Man to tackle growing numbers |language=en-GB |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/07/calls-wallaby-warning-signs-implemented-isle-man-tackle-growing/ |access-date=2019-08-15 |issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

There are also many feral goats in [[Garff]], a matter which was raised in Tynwald Court in January 2018.<ref>Tynwald Hansard 16 January 2018, Question 9</ref>

In March 2016, the Isle of Man became the first entire territory to be adopted into UNESCO's Network of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme#Biosphere reserves|Biosphere Reserves]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Morris |first=Hugh |title=Isle of Man awarded UNESCO status |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/isle-of-man/articles/isle-of-man-added-to-unesco-biosphere-reserve-list/ |access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref>

== Climate ==
The Isle of Man has a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''). Average rainfall is higher than averaged over the territory of the British Isles, because the Isle of Man is far enough from Ireland for the prevailing south-westerly winds to accumulate moisture. Average rainfall is highest at [[Snaefell]], where it is around {{convert|1900|mm}} a year. At lower levels it can be around {{convert|800|mm}} a year. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|28.9|C|F}} at [[Ronaldsway]] on 12 July 1983.

On 10 May 2019 Chief Minister Howard Quayle stated that the [[Isle of Man Government]] recognises that a [[state of emergency]] exists due to the threat of anthropogenic [[climate change]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-05-10 |title=This is a climate change emergency |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/article.cfm?id=48378&headline=This%20is%20a%20climate%20change%20emergency§ionIs=NEWS&searchyear=2019 |access-date=2019-08-15 |website=In the Manx Independent this week}}</ref>
