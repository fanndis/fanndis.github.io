'''Recycling''' is the process of converting [[waste]] materials into new materials and objects. The [[Energy recycling|recovery of energy from waste materials]] is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its virgin or original state.<ref> Villalba, G., Segarra, M., Fernandez, A. I., Chimenos, J. M., & Espiell, F. (2002). A proposal for quantifying the recyclability of materials. Resources, Conservation, and Recycling, 37.</ref> It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from [[incineration]]), and water pollution (from [[landfill]]ing).

Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the "[[Waste minimisation|Reduce]], [[Reuse]], and Recycle" [[waste hierarchy]].<ref name="lienig">{{Cite book|author=J.

''Recyclable materials'' include many kinds of glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, [[tire]]s, textiles, batteries, and [[electronics]]. The [[composting]] or other reuse of [[biodegradable waste]]—such as [[food waste|food]] or [[Green waste|garden waste]]—is also a form of recycling.<ref name="gar">{{cite book |last = The League of Women Voters |title = The Garbage Primer |publisher = Lyons & Burford |year = 1993 |location = New York |pages = 35–72 |isbn = 978-1-55821-250-3 }}</ref> Materials to be recycled are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up from curbside bins, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing new products.

In the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material—for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used [[polystyrene]] foam into new polystyrene. This is accomplished when recycling certain types of materials, such as metal cans, which can become a can again and again, indefinitely, without losing purity in the product.<ref name="NG">[https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2018/04/04/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-plastic-and-recycling/ "7 Things You Didn’t Know About Plastic (and Recycling)"] ''National Geographic''.

Another form of recycling is the [[Waste sorting|salvage]] of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from [[car battery|car batteries]], or gold from [[printed circuit board]]s), or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from [[thermometer]]s and [[thermostat]]s).

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Recycling has been a common practice for most of human history, with recorded advocates as far back as [[Plato]] in the fourth century BC.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} During periods when resources were scarce and hard to come by, archaeological studies of ancient waste dumps show less household waste (such as ash, broken tools, and pottery)—implying more waste was being recycled in the absence of new material.<ref name="guide">{{Cite book |last = Black Dog Publishing |publisher = Black Dog Publishing |year = 2006 |location = London, UK |isbn = 978-1-904772-36-1 |title = Recycle : a source book |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/recycleessential0000unse }}</ref>

In [[pre-industrial]] times, there is evidence of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for continuous reuse.<ref name="economisttruth" /> Paper recycling was first recorded in 1031 when Japanese shops sold repulped paper.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Handbook of Energy: Chronologies, Top Ten Lists, and Word Clouds |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ScL77rOCZn0C&q=1031+japan+paper+recycling |publisher = Elsevier |date = 15 November 2013 |isbn = 978-0-12-417019-3 |first1 = Cutler J. |last1 = Cleveland |first2 = Christopher G. |last2 = Morris |page = 461 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title = Sustaining the earth: choosing consumer products that are safe for you, your family, and the earth |publisher = Hearst Books |date = 1 January 1994 |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-688-12335-2 |first = Debra |last = Dadd-Redalia |page = 103 |oclc = 29702410 }}</ref> In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by "[[Waste collector|dustmen]]" and [[downcycling|downcycled]] as a base material used in brick making. The main driver for these types of recycling was the economic advantage of obtaining recycled feedstock instead of acquiring virgin material, as well as a lack of public waste removal in ever more densely populated areas.<ref name="guide" /> In 1813, [[Benjamin Law (inventor)|Benjamin Law]] developed the process of turning rags into "[[shoddy]]" and "[[Glossary of textile manufacturing#M|mungo]]" wool in Batley, Yorkshire. This material combined recycled fibers with virgin [[wool]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Know all about : reduce, reuse, recycle|last=Nongpluh, Yoofisaca Syngkon.|others=Noronha, Guy C.,, Energy and Resources Institute.|isbn=978-1-4619-4003-6|location=New Delhi|oclc=858862026}}</ref> The [[West Yorkshire]] shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early 19th century to at least 1914.

Industrialization spurred demand for affordable materials; aside from rags, ferrous [[scrap]] metals were coveted as they were cheaper to acquire than virgin ore. Railroads both purchased and sold scrap metal in the 19th century, and the growing steel and automobile industries purchased scrap in the early 20th century. Many secondary goods were collected, processed and sold by peddlers who scoured dumps and city streets for discarded machinery, pots, pans, and other sources of metal. By [[World War I]], thousands of such peddlers roamed the streets of American cities, taking advantage of market forces to recycle post-consumer materials back into industrial production.<ref name="cash">{{Cite book |last = Carl A.

New chemical industries created in the late 19th century both invented new materials (e.g. [[Bakelite]] in 1907) and promised to transform valueless into valuable materials. Proverbially, you could not [[wikt:make a silk purse of a sow's ear|make a silk purse of a sow's ear]]—until the US firm Arthur D.

Recycling (or "salvage", as it was then usually known) was a major issue for governments throughout [[World War II]]. Financial constraints and significant material shortages due to war efforts made it necessary for countries to reuse goods and recycle materials.<ref name=PBS>{{cite web |last = Public Broadcasting System (2007) |title = The War Episode 2: Rationing and Recycling |url = https://www.pbs.org/ |access-date = 7 July 2016 }}</ref> These resource shortages caused by the [[world war]]s, and other such world-changing occurrences, greatly encouraged recycling.<ref>''Out of the Garbage-Pail into the Fire: fuel bricks now added to the list of things salvaged by science from the nation's waste'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, February 1919, page 50-51, Scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50</ref> The struggles of war claimed much of the material resources available, leaving little for the civilian population.<ref name=PBS /> It became necessary for most homes to recycle their waste, as recycling offered an extra source of materials allowing people to make the most of what was available to them. Recycling household materials meant more resources for war efforts and a better chance of victory.<ref name=PBS /> Massive government promotion campaigns, such as the [[Paper Salvage 1939–50|National Salvage Campaign]] in Britain and the [[Salvage for Victory]] campaign in the United States, were carried out on the [[home front during World War II|home front]] in every combative nation, urging citizens to donate metal, paper, rags, and rubber as a matter of patriotism.

=== Post-World War II ===

A considerable investment in recycling occurred in the 1970s, due to rising energy costs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.plasticexpert.co.uk/recycling-ages-1970s/ |title = Recycling through the ages: 1970s |date = 30 July 2014 |access-date = 7 March 2015 |website = Plastic Expert |publisher = Plastic Expert }}</ref> Recycling aluminium uses only 5% of the energy required by virgin production; glass, paper and other metals have less dramatic but significant energy savings when recycled feedstock is used.<ref name="economistrecycle" />

Although consumer electronics such as the television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title = CRC History – Computer Recycling Center |url = http://www.crc.org/about/crc_history.php |website = www.crc.org |access-date = 29 July 2015 }}</ref> The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices.<ref>{{cite web |title = About us – Swico Recycling |url = http://www.swicorecycling.ch/en/about-us/ |website = www.swicorecycling.ch |access-date = 29 July 2015 }}</ref> After these schemes were set up, many countries did not have the capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold, during the recycling process.<ref>{{cite web |title = Where does e-waste end up? |url = http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/ |access-date = 29 July 2015 |publisher = Greenpeace |date = 24 February 2009 |website = www.greenpeace.org/ }}</ref> The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002, e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU.<ref name="Kinver">{{Cite news |title = Mechanics of e-waste recycling |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6254816.stm |date = 3 July 2007 |access-date = 29 July 2015 |last = Kinver |first = Mark |publisher = BBC }}</ref> This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |title = Bulgaria opens largest WEEE recycling factory in Eastern Europe |url = http://www.ask-eu.com/Default.asp?Menue=142&Bereich=5&SubBereich=16&KW=130&NewsPPV=8492 |website = www.ask-eu.com |access-date = 29 July 2015 |date = 12 July 2010 |publisher = WtERT Germany GmbH }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = EnvironCom opens largest WEEE recycling facility / waste & recycling news |url = http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/environcom-opens-largest-weee-recycling-facility-in-uk-1195.aspx |website = www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk |access-date = 29 July 2015 |date = 4 March 2010 |publisher = The Sixty Mile Publishing Company |url-status = dead |archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515070836/http%3A//www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/environcom%2Dopens%2Dlargest%2Dweee%2Drecycling%2Dfacility%2Din%2Duk%2D1195.aspx |archive-date = 15 May 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper |title = Where Gadgets Go To Die: E-Waste Recycler Opens New Plant in Las Vegas |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/e-waste-recycling-las-vegas-us-micro-electronics_n_1200527.html |journal = Huffington Post |access-date = 29 July 2015 |last = Goodman |first = Peter S. |date = 11 January 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = New plant tackles our electronic leftovers – BizTech – Technology – smh.com.au |url = https://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/new-plant-tackles-our-electronic-leftovers/2008/11/19/1226770518649.html |website = www.smh.com.au |access-date = 29 July 2015 |date = 19 November 2008 |last = Moses |first = Asher }}</ref>

As of 2014, the [[European Union]] had about 50% of world share of the waste and recycling industries, with over {{formatnum:60000}} companies employing {{formatnum:500000}} persons, with a turnover of €24 billion.<ref>European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/lead-market-initiative/recycling/index_en.htm Recycling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203063401/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/lead-market-initiative/recycling/index_en.htm |date=3 February 2014 }}.</ref> Countries have to reach recycling rates of at least 50%, while the lead countries were around 65% and the EU average was 39% as of 2013.<ref>[http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/what/public-events/competitions/waste-smart-competition/recycling-rates-in-europe/view Recycling rates in Europe], [[European Environment Agency]].</ref>

The United Nations General Assembly, in 2015, set 17 Sustainable Development Goals. [[Sustainable Development Goal 12|Goal 12 Responsible Consumption and Production]] is to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns" and is composed of 11 targets.<ref>United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, [[:File:A RES 71 313 E.pdf|Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] ([https://undocs.org/A/RES/71/313 A/RES/71/313])</ref> The fifth target, [[Sustainable_Development_Goal_12#Target_12.5:_Substantially_reduce_waste_generation|Target 12.5]], is defined as substantially reducing waste generation by 2030, indicated by the National Recycling Rate.

In 2018, changes in the recycling market have sparked a global "crisis" in the industry. On 31 December 2017, China announced its "[[Operation National Sword|National Sword]]" policy, setting new standards for imports of recyclable material and banning materials that were deemed too "dirty" or "hazardous". The new policy caused drastic disruptions in the global market in recycling and reduced the prices of scrap plastic and low-grade paper. Exports of recyclable materials from G7 countries to China dropped dramatically, with many exports shifting to countries in southeast Asia. The crisis generated significant concern about the practices and environmental sustainability of the recycling industry. The abrupt shift caused countries to accept more recyclable materials than they could process, raising fundamental questions about shipping recycling waste from economically developed countries to countries with few environmental regulations—a practice that predated the crisis.<ref>{{Cite newspaper |title = Why the world's recycling system stopped working |url = https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8 |journal = [[Financial Times]] |access-date = 25 October 2018 |last1 = Hook |first1 = Leslie |last2 = Reed |first2 = John |date = 24 October 2018 |url-access = limited |archive-url = https://archive.today/20181025073925/https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8 |archive-date = 25 October 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>

== Legislation ==

=== Supply ===

For a recycling program to work, having a large, stable [[supply and demand|supply]] of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options have been used to create such a supply: mandatory recycling collection, [[container deposit legislation]], and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.<ref name="gar" />

Container deposit legislation involves offering a refund for the return of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling rate.<ref>{{cite web |title = A Beverage Container Deposit Law for Hawaii |url = http://www.opala.org/solid_waste/Container_Deposit_Summary_Oct2002.html |website = www.opala.org |access-date = 31 July 2015 |date = Oct 2002 |publisher = City & County of Honolulu, Department of Environmental Services }}</ref> Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas.<ref name="gar" /> A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.<ref>{{cite web |author = European Council |url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/final_rep_okopol.pdf |title = The Producer Responsibility Principle of the WEEE Directive |access-date = 7 July 2016 }}</ref>

An alternative way to increase the supply of recyclates is to [[ban (law)|ban]] the disposal of certain materials as waste, often including used oil, old batteries, tires, and garden waste. One aim of this method is to create a viable economy for proper disposal of banned products. Care must be taken that enough of these recycling [[service (economics)|services]] exist, or such bans simply lead to increased [[fly-tipping|illegal dumping]].<ref name="gar" />

=== Government-mandated demand ===

Legislation has also been used to increase and maintain a demand for recycled materials. Four methods of such legislation exist: minimum recycled content mandates, utilization rates, [[procurement]] policies, and recycled [[Mandatory labeling|product labeling]].<ref name="gar" />

Both minimum recycled content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that a certain percentage of a new product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob the industry of necessary flexibility.<ref name="gar" /><ref name="DeLong">{{cite web |url = http://jamesvdelong.com/articles/environmental/wasting-away.html |title = Regulatory Policy Center&nbsp;— Property Matters&nbsp;— James V. DeLong |access-date = 28 February 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414205905/http://jamesvdelong.com/articles/environmental/wasting-away.html |archive-date = 14 April 2008 }}</ref>

[[Governments]] have used their own [[purchasing power]] to increase recycling demand through what are called "procurement policies". These policies are either "set-asides", which reserve a certain amount of spending solely towards recycled products, or "price preference" programs which provide a larger [[government budget|budget]] when recycled items are purchased. Additional regulations can target specific cases: in the United States, for example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] mandates the purchase of oil, paper, tires and building insulation from recycled or re-refined sources whenever possible.<ref name="gar" />

The final government regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers are required to label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers are better able to make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient [[buying power]] can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers to increase the amount of recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.<ref name="gar" />

"Recyclate" is a raw material that is sent to, and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility which will be used to form new products.<ref>{{cite web |last = Web-Dictionary.com (2013) |title = Recyclate |url = http://www.web-definition.com/dictionary/r/re/recyclate/ |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070530/http://www.web-definition.com/dictionary/r/re/recyclate/ |archive-date = 7 April 2014 }}</ref> The material is collected in various methods and delivered to a facility where it is processed so that it can be used in the production of new materials or products. For example, [[plastic bottle]]s that are collected can be re-used and made into plastic pellets, a new product.<ref>{{cite web |last = Freudenrich, C. (2014) |title = How Plastics Work |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/plastic5.htm |access-date = 7 July 2016 |date = 14 December 2007 }}</ref>

=== Quality of recyclate ===

The quality of recyclates is recognized as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non-target material and other non-recyclable material.<ref name=GOV.UK>{{cite web |last = DEFRA (2013) |title = Quality Action Plan Proposals to Promote High Quality Recycling of Dry Recyclates |url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221028/pb13875-qap-recycling.pdf }}</ref> For example, steel and metal are materials with a higher recyclate quality. It's estimated that two-thirds of all new steel manufactured comes from recycled steel.<ref>[https://earth911.com/recycling-guide/how-to-recycle-tin-or-steel-cans/ "How to Recycle Tin or Steel Cans"] ''Earth911.com''. Retrieved 26 July 2019.</ref> Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and non-recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling product.<ref name=GOV.UK /> A high proportion of non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve "high-quality" recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled.<ref name=GOV.UK /> For example, to facilitate the re-manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass going into the re-melt process. Another example is the downcycling of plastic, in which products such as plastic food packaging are often downcycled into lower quality products, and do not get recycled into the same plastic food packaging.

The quality of recyclate not only supports high-quality recycling, but it can also deliver significant environmental benefits by reducing, reusing, and keeping products out of landfills.<ref name=GOV.UK /> High-quality recycling can help support growth in the economy by maximizing the economic value of the waste material collected.<ref name=GOV.UK /> Higher income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value which can be significant to local governments, households, and businesses.<ref name=GOV.UK /> Pursuing high-quality recycling can also provide consumer and business confidence in the waste and resource management sector and may encourage investment in that sector.

There are many actions along the recycling supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate.<ref name=Scottish>{{cite web |last = The Scottish Government (2012) |title = Recyclate Quality Action Plan – Consultation Paper |url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/10/6584/6 |date = 5 October 2012 }}</ref> It begins with the waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can affect the quality of final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process.<ref name=Scottish /> The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product.<ref name=Scottish /> Transportation and the compaction of materials can make it more difficult to separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred percent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality.<ref name=Scottish /> The storage of materials outside, where the product can become wet, can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material.<ref name=Scottish /> Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.

=== Quality recyclate action plan (Scotland) ===

The Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland sets out a number of proposed actions that the [[Scottish Government]] would like to take forward in order to drive up the quality of the materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported or sold on to the reprocessing market.<ref name=Scottish />

The plan's objectives are to:<ref name=highland>{{cite web |last = The Highland Council (2013) |title = Report by Director of Transport, Environmental and Community Services |url = http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/255D69BA-079F-4126-9C85-497B221D185A/0/recyclatequalityactionplan.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064459/http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/255D69BA-079F-4126-9C85-497B221D185A/0/recyclatequalityactionplan.pdf |archive-date = 7 April 2014 }}</ref>
* Drive up the quality of recyclate
* Deliver greater transparency about the quality of recyclate
* Provide help to those contracting with materials recycling facilities to identify what is required of them
* Ensure compliance with the Waste (Scotland) regulations 2012
* Stimulate a household market for quality recyclate
* Address and reduce issues surrounding the Waste Shipment Regulations

The plan focuses on three key areas, with fourteen actions which were identified to increase the quality of materials collected, sorted and presented to the processing market in Scotland.<ref name=highland />

The three areas of focus are:<ref name=Scottish />

* Collection systems and input contamination
* Sorting facilities – material sampling and transparency
* Material quality benchmarking and standards

== Recycling consumer waste ==

=== Collection ===

[[File:DeutscheBahnRecycling20050814 CopyrightKaihsuTai Rotated.jpg|thumb|upright|A three-sided bin at a railway station in [[Germany]], intended to separate paper ''(left)'' and plastic wrappings ''(right)'' from other waste ''(back)'']]

A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are "drop-off centers", "buy-back centers", and "curbside collection".<ref name="gar" /> About two-thirds of the cost of recycling is incurred during the collection phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=M. Mitchell|date=2020-10-01|title=One bin future: How mixing trash and recycling can work|url=https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/sustainability/2020/recycle-it-all|journal=Knowable Magazine|doi=10.1146/knowable-092920-3}}</ref>

==== Curbside collection ====
{{Main|Curbside collection}}
[[File:ACT recycling truck.jpg|thumb|A recycling truck collecting the contents of a [[recycling bin]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]]]
[[File:Opróżnianie klatki na odpady z tworzyw sztucznych w 60-tysięcznym Tomaszowie Mazowieckim.jpg|thumb|Emptying of segregated rubbish containers in [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]], Poland]]

Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems, which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables, and source separation.<ref name="gar"/> A [[waste collection vehicle]] generally picks up the waste.

At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.<ref name="gar"/>

In a commingled or [[Single-stream recycling|single-stream system]], all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require [[public education]] on what materials are recyclable.<ref name="gar" /><ref name="economisttruth"/>

=====Source separation=====
Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs additional [[operating cost]]s for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate [[contamination]] is to be avoided.<ref name="gar"/> In [[Oregon]], USA, its environmental authority Oregon DEQ surveyed multi-family property managers and about half of them reported problems including contamination of recyclables due to trespassers such as [[homelessness|transients]] gaining access to the collection areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregon.gov/deq/FilterDocs/recmultistate.pdf|title=The State of Multi-Tenant Recycling in Oregon|date=April 2018}}</ref>

Source separation used to be the preferred method due to the high sorting costs incurred by commingled (mixed waste) collection. However, advances in sorting technology have lowered this overhead substantially. Many areas which had developed source separation programs have since switched to what is called ''co-mingled collection''.<ref name="economisttruth"/>

==== Buy-back centers ====
[[File:Automat do przyjmowania butelek zwrotnych w 60-tysięcznym Tomaszowie Mazowieckim Warszawska róg Szerokiej.jpg|thumb|[[Reverse vending machine]] in Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Poland]]
Buy-back centers differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold. If this is profitable, this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases; if unprofitable, it increases the emission of greenhouse gases. Government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centres a viable enterprise. In 1993, according to the U.S. [[National Waste & Recycling Association]], it costs on average $50 to process a ton of material, which can be resold for $30.<ref name="gar" />

In the US, the value per ton of mixed recyclables was $180 in 2011, $80 in 2015, and $100 in 2017.<ref name=usatoday>{{Cite news |first = Paul |last = Singer |title = Recycling market in a heap of trouble |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/20/weak-markets-make-consumers-wishful-recycling-big-problem/100654976/ |newspaper = USA Today |location = Melbourne, Florida |pages = 1B, 2B |date = 21 April 2017 |access-date = 21 April 2017 }}</ref>

In 2017, glass is essentially valueless, because of the low cost of sand, its major component; low oil costs thwarts plastic recycling.<ref name=usatoday />

In 2017, [[Napa, California]] was reimbursed about 20% of its costs in recycling.<ref name=usatoday />

==== Drop-off centers ====

Drop-off centers require the waste producer to carry the recyclates to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.

==== Distributed recycling ====

For some waste materials such as plastic, recent technical devices called [[recyclebots]]<ref name="RPJ">{{cite journal |last1 = Baechler |first1 = Christian |last2 = DeVuono |first2 = Matthew |last3 = Pearce |first3 = Joshua M. |year = 2013 |title = Distributed Recycling of Waste Polymer into RepRap Feedstock |url = https://www.academia.edu/2643418 |journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal |volume = 19 |issue = 2 |pages = 118–125 |doi = 10.1108/13552541311302978 }}</ref> enable a form of distributed recycling.

=== Sorting ===

[[File:Recycling Video.webm|thumb|Video of recycling facility and processes.|Video of recycling sorting facility and processes]]

Once commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a [[materials recovery facility]], the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truckload of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour.<ref name="economisttruth" /> Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as [[single-stream recycling]]. Automatic sorting may be aided by robotics and machine-learning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://resource-recycling.com/recycling/2019/05/07/how-recycling-robots-have-spread-across-north-america/|title=How recycling robots have spread across North America|date=7 May 2019|website=Resource Recycling News|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therobotreport.com/amp-robotics-announces-largest-deployment-of-ai-guided-recycling-robots/|title=AMP Robotics announces largest deployment of AI-guided recycling robots|date=27 June 2019|website=The Robot Report|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref> In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries.<ref>{{cite web |last = None |first = None |title = Common Recyclable Materials |url = http://www.epa.gov/smm/wastewise/pubs/commonmats.pdf |publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency |access-date = 2 February 2013 |date = 10 August 2015 }}</ref> A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist.<ref>{{cite web |work=ScienceDaily |date=October 1, 2007 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/1002-recycling_without_sorting.htm |title=Recycling Without Sorting: Engineers Create Recycling Plant That Removes The Need To Sort |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831095259/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/1002-recycling_without_sorting.htm |archive-date=31 August 2008 }}</ref> In the United States, there are over 300 materials recovery facilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://resource-recycling.com/recycling/2018/10/01/sortation-by-the-numbers/|title=Sortation by the numbers|date=1 October 2018|website=Resource Recycling News|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>

Initially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of [[corrugated fiberboard]] and [[plastic bag]]s are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.<ref name="economisttruth" />

[[File:Glass and plastic recycling 065 ubt.JPG|thumb|left|Early sorting of recyclable materials: glass and plastic bottles in [[Poland]].]]

Next, automated machinery such as disk screens and air classifiers separate the recyclates by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper and the most common types of plastic, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] (#1) and [[HDPE]] (#2), are collected. This separation is usually done by hand but has become automated in some sorting centers: a [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.<ref name="economisttruth" /> Plastics tend to be incompatible with each other due to differences in [[chemical composition]]. The [[polymer]] molecules repel each other rather than mixing, similar to oil and water. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Goodship|first=Vannessa|title=Introduction to Plastics Recycling|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fMjM0ODU5X19BTg2?sid=95a6a28c-a11e-4ec1-b9f1-5498fcdbc807@pdc-v-sessmgr02&vid=0&format=EB&lpid=lp_41&rid=0|access-date=2020-09-24|website=web.b.ebscohost.com}}</ref>

Strong magnets are used to separate out [[ferrous metal]]s, such as iron, steel, and [[tin can]]s. [[Non-ferrous metal]]s are ejected by magnetic [[eddy current]]s in which a rotating [[magnetic field]] [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic [[eddy current]] is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream.<ref name="economisttruth" />

Finally, glass is sorted according to its color: brown, amber, green, or clear. It may either be sorted by hand,<ref name="economisttruth" /> or via an automated machine that uses colored filters to detect different colors. Glass fragments smaller than {{convert|10|mm|in}} across cannot be sorted automatically, and are mixed together as "glass fines".<ref>{{cite web |last = None |first = None |title = What Happens to My Recycling? |url = http://www.1coast.com.au/page8390/What-happens-to-my-recycling.aspx |publisher = 1coast.com.au |access-date = 21 July 2014 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811010701/http://www.1coast.com.au/page8390/What-happens-to-my-recycling.aspx |archive-date = 11 August 2014 }}</ref>

This process of recycling as well as reusing the recycled material has proven advantageous because it reduces amount of waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and helps create new jobs. Recycled materials can also be converted into new products that can be consumed again, such as paper, plastic, and glass.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/downloads/benefits.pdf |title = Puzzled About Recycling's Value?

== Recycling industrial waste ==

[[File:Shredded tires.JPG|right|thumb|Mounds of shredded rubber tires ready for processing]]

Although many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of waste in the United Kingdom is generated by industry.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/elibrary/Content/Internet/538/755/1929/421459230.pdf |title = UK statistics on waste – 2010 to 2012 |date = 25 September 2014 |access-date = 3 December 2017 |website = UK Government |publisher = UK Government |page = 2 and 6 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171203224604/https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/elibrary/Content/Internet/538/755/1929/421459230.pdf |archive-date = 3 December 2017 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost–effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of [[cardboard]] packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like [[retail store]]s, [[warehouse]]s, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products, depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present.

The glass, lumber, [[wood pulp]] and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials; however, old [[rubber tires]] may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers for a profit.

Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society<ref name="IRP">{{cite web |url = http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |title = Publications – International Resource Panel |website = unep.org |access-date = 7 July 2016 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121111132915/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |archive-date = 11 November 2012 }}</ref> and their recycling rates.<ref name="IRP" /> The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the 21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications within society above ground. For example, the in-use stock of copper in the USA grew from 73 to 238&nbsp;kg per capita between 1932 and 1999.

The report authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground (the term "urban mining" has been coined with this idea in mind<ref>{{cite web |title = How Urban Mining Works |url = http://urbanmining.org/2010/07/07/how-urban-mining-works-2/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100711042131/http://urbanmining.org/2010/07/07/how-urban-mining-works-2/ |url-status = dead |archive-date = 11 July 2010 |access-date = 9 August 2013 }}</ref>). However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are low. The report warned that the recycling rates of some [[Rare-earth element|rare metals]] used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

The military recycles some metals. The [[U.S. Navy]]'s Ship Disposal Program uses [[ship breaking]] to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an [[artificial reef]]. [[Uranium]] is a dense metal that has qualities superior to lead and [[titanium]] for many military and industrial uses. The [[uranium]] left over from processing it into [[nuclear weapon]]s and fuel for [[nuclear reactor]]s is called [[depleted uranium]], and is used by all branches of the U.S. military for the development of such things as armour-piercing shells and shielding.

The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling their waste materials for profit.

Some industries, like the [[renewable energy industry]] and [[solar photovoltaic]] technology, in particular, are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume to their waste streams, anticipating future demand during their rapid growth.<ref>{{cite journal | first1=N. C. | last1=McDonald | first2=J.

Recycling of plastics is more difficult, as most programs are not able to reach the necessary level of quality. Recycling of [[PVC]] often results in [[downcycling]] of the material, which means only products of lower quality standard can be made with the recycled material. A new approach which allows an equal level of quality is the [[Vinyloop]] process. It was used after the [[London Olympics 2012]] to fulfill the PVC Policy.<ref>{{cite web |title = London 2012 seeks sustainable solutions for temporary venues |url = http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/2009/5/london-2012-seeks-sustainable-solutions-for-temporary-ve-1243087.html |publisher = ODA |access-date = 20 August 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120827113019/http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/2009/5/london-2012-seeks-sustainable-solutions-for-temporary-ve-1243087.html |archive-date = 27 August 2012 |date = 24 January 2017 }}</ref>

=== E-waste recycling ===
{{Main|Computer recycling}}

[[File:RetiredCPUs.jpg|thumb|Computer processors retrieved from waste stream]]

[[Electronic waste|E-waste]] is a growing problem, accounting for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU.<ref name="Kinver" /> Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|Khian Sea]] dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in [[Haiti]], the [[Basel Convention]] was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the [[e-Stewards]] certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] of the EU the [[United States]] National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.

In the recycling process, television sets, monitors, cell phones, and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labor is cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to pieces roughly {{convert|10|cm|in}} in size, and manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and [[capacitor]]s which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to {{convert|10|mm|in}} particles and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An [[eddy current]] ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re-processors. Television sets and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove lead from CRTs or the mercury backlight from LCDs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/homehazwaste/Events/AnnualConf/2006/April27/Session4/CompRecTH.pdf |first = Thomas Q. |last = Hogye |title = The Anatomy of a Computer Recycling Process |publisher = California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery |access-date = 13 October 2014 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200011/http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/homehazwaste/Events/AnnualConf/2006/April27/Session4/CompRecTH.pdf |archive-date = 23 September 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Sweeep Kuusakoski – Resources – BBC Documentary |url = http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/resources/bbc.php |website = www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk |access-date = 31 July 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Sweeep Kuusakoski – Glass Recycling – BBC filming of CRT furnace |url = http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/glassrecycling/furness.php |website = www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk |access-date = 31 July 2015 }}</ref>

=== Plastic recycling ===
{{Main|Plastic recycling}}

[[File:Spoon recycling 3d printing.jpg|thumb|upright|A container for recycling used plastic spoons into material for 3D printing]]

Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products, sometimes completely different in form from their original state. For instance, this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables.<ref>{{cite web |last = Layton |first = Julia |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-tech/sustainable/eco-plastic1.htm |title = "Eco"-plastic: recycled plastic |publisher = Science.howstuffworks.com |date = 22 April 2009 |access-date = 9 June 2014 }}</ref> For some types of plastic, the same piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2–3 times before its quality decreases to the point where it can no longer be used.<ref name="NG" />

==== Physical recycling ====

Some plastics are remelted to form new plastic objects; for example, PET water bottles can be converted into polyester destined for clothing. A disadvantage of this type of recycling is that the molecular weight of the polymer can change further and the levels of unwanted substances in the plastic can increase with each remelt.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

A commercial-built recycling facility was sent to the [[International Space Station]] in late 2019. The facility will take in plastic waste and unneeded plastic parts and physically convert them into spools of feedstock for the space station [[additive manufacturing]] facility used for in-space [[3D printing]].<ref name=sn20191021>{{cite news |last=Werner|first=Debra |url=https://spacenews.com/made-in-space-to-launch-commercial-recycler-to-space-station/ |title=Made in Space to launch commercial recycler to space station |work=[[SpaceNews]] |date=21 October 2019 |access-date=22 October 2019 }}</ref>

==== Chemical recycling ====

For some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again. In 2019, [[Eastman Chemical Company]] announced initiatives of [[Transesterification|methanolysis]] and [[syngas]] designed to handle a greater variety of used material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/article/eastman-advances-two-chemical-recycling-options|title=Eastman advances two chemical recycling options|last=Siegel|first=R. P.|date=7 August 2019|website=GreenBiz|language=en|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>

==== Waste plastic pyrolysis to fuel oil ====

Another process involves the conversion of assorted polymers into petroleum by a much less precise thermal [[depolymerization]] process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including [[thermoset]] materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the [[biopolymer]]s in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology<ref>{{cite web |title = RESEM A Leading Pyrolysis Plant Manufacturer |url = http://www.pyrolysisoil.net |publisher = RESEM Pyrolysis Plant |access-date = 20 August 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130218171416/http://www.pyrolysisoil.net/ |archive-date = 18 February 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref> plant of this type in [[Carthage, Missouri]], US, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.
Plastic Pyrolysis can convert petroleum based waste streams such as plastics into quality fuels, carbons. Given below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for [[pyrolysis]]:
* Mixed plastic ([[HDPE]], [[LDPE]], [[polyethylene|PE]], [[polypropylene|PP]], [[Nylon]], [[Teflon]], [[polystyrene|PS]], [[ABS plastic|ABS]], [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|FRP]], etc.)
* Mixed waste plastic from waste paper mill

[[File:RecyclingLoops.png|thumb|Loops for production-waste, product and material recycling]]

The (ideal) recycling process can be differentiated into three loops, one for manufacture (production-waste recycling) and two for disposal of the product (product and material recycling).<ref name="recyclingBook">{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pages=197–199|chapter= Manufacture, Use and Disposal of Electronic Systems in the Circular Economy|publisher=Springer|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0_7}}</ref>

The product's manufacturing phase, which consists of material processing and fabrication, forms the ''production-waste recycling'' loop. Industrial waste materials are fed back into, and reused in, the same production process.

The product's disposal process requires two recycling loops: ''product recycling'' and ''material recycling''.<ref name=recyclingBook/>
The product or product parts are reused in the ''product recycling'' phase. This happens in one of two ways: the product is used retaining the product functionality ("reuse") or the product continues to be used but with altered functionality ("further use").<ref name=recyclingBook/> The product design is unmodified, or only slightly modified, in both scenarios.

Product disassembly requires ''material recycling'' where product materials are recovered and recycled. Ideally, the materials are processed so they can flow back into the production process.<ref name=recyclingBook/>

[[File:Recycling codes on products.jpg|thumb|Recycling codes on products]]

In order to meet recyclers' needs while providing manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a [[Recycling codes|coding system]] was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the [[Society of the Plastics Industry]].<ref>[http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&DID=4645&DOC=FILE.PDF Plastic Recycling codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721103005/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&DID=4645&DOC=FILE.PDF |date=21 July 2011 }}, American Chemistry</ref> Because municipal recycling programs traditionally have targeted packaging—primarily bottles and containers—the [[resin identification code|resin coding system]] offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream.<ref>[http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?cid=1102&did=4644 About resin identification codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019171528/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?cid=1102&did=4644 |date=19 October 2010 }} American Chemistry</ref>

Plastic products are printed with numbers 1–7 depending on the type of resin. Type 1 ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is commonly found in [[soft drink]] and [[water bottles]]. Type 2 ([[high-density polyethylene]]) is found in most hard plastics such as [[Plastic milk container|milk jugs]], laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 ([[polyvinyl chloride]]) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, [[hula hoops]], [[credit cards]], wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 ([[low-density polyethylene]]) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is [[polypropylene]] and makes up syrup bottles, straws, [[Tupperware]], and some automotive parts. Type 6 is [[polystyrene]] and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, cell phone and tablet frames, safety goggles and sunglasses.<ref>{{cite web |title = Recycling Symbols on Plastics&nbsp;– What Do Recycling Codes on Plastics Mean |url = http://www.thedailygreen.com/green-homes/latest/recycling-symbols-plastics-460321?src=soc_fcbk |publisher = The Daily Green |access-date = 29 February 2012 |date = 25 November 2008 }}</ref> Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is.

There is some debate over whether recycling is [[Economic efficiency|economically efficient]]. According to a [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] study, waste collection and landfill disposal creates less than one job per 1,000 tons of waste material managed; in contrast, the collection, processing, and manufacturing of recycled materials creates 6–13 or more jobs per 1,000 tons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/green-jobs-ca-recycling-report.pdf |title=From Waste to Jobs: What Achieving 75 Percent Recycling Means for California |date=March 2014|page=2}}</ref> However, the cost effectiveness of creating the additional jobs remains unproven. According to the U.S. Recycling Economic Informational Study, there are over 50,000 recycling establishments that have created over a million jobs in the US.<ref>{{cite web |last = No Author |first = No Author |title = Recycling Benefits to the Economy |url = http://www.all-recycling-facts.com/recycling-benefits.html |publisher = all-recycling-facts.com |access-date = 1 February 2013 }}</ref>

Two years after New York City declared that implementing recycling programs would be "a drain on the city", New York City leaders realized that an efficient recycling system could save the city over $20 million.<ref>{{cite web |title = A Recycling Revolution |url = http://www.recycling-revolution.com/recycling-benefits.html |publisher = recycling-revolution.com |access-date = 1 February 2013 }}</ref> Municipalities often see [[finance|fiscal]] benefits from implementing recycling programs, largely due to the reduced [[landfill]] costs.<ref>Lavee D.

Fiscal efficiency is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling does not include what economists call [[externality|externalities]], which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced [[hazardous waste]] leaching from landfills, reduced [[energy (society)|energy]] consumption, and reduced waste and [[resource consumption]], which leads to a reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of which only a few hundred are relatively common.<ref>"[http://faculty.uml.edu/Nelson_Eby/89.215/Assignments/Mineral%20Identification.pdf Minerals and Forensic Science]" (PDF).

Certain requirements must be met for recycling to be economically feasible and environmentally effective. These include an adequate source of recyclates, a system to extract those recyclates from the [[waste stream]], a nearby factory capable of reprocessing the recyclates, and a potential demand for the recycled products. These last two requirements are often overlooked—without both an industrial market for production using the collected materials and a consumer market for the manufactured goods, recycling is incomplete and in fact only "collection".<ref name="gar" />

Free-market economist [[Julian Simon]] remarked "There are three ways society can organize waste disposal: (a) commanding, (b) guiding by tax and subsidy, and (c) leaving it to the individual and the market". These principles appear to divide economic thinkers today.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |title = Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Household and Municipal Recycling? |url = http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ejwjournl/v_3a4_3ay_3a2007_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a83-111.htm |journal = Econ Journal Watch |date = 1 January 2007 |pages = 83–111 |volume = 4 |issue = 1 |first = Matthew |last = Gunter |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211203746/http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ejwjournl/v_3a4_3ay_3a2007_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a83-111.htm |archive-date = 11 December 2015 }} [http://www.viewdocsonline.com/document/6eyfmh Alt URL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515041218/http://www.viewdocsonline.com/document/6eyfmh |date=15 May 2019 }}</ref>

[[Frank Ackerman]] favours a high level of government intervention to provide recycling services. He believes that recycling's benefit cannot be effectively quantified by traditional ''laissez-faire'' economics. [[Allen Hershkowitz]] supports intervention, saying that it is a public service equal to education and policing. He argues that manufacturers should shoulder more of the burden of waste disposal.<ref name=":0" />

Paul Calcott and Margaret Walls advocate the second option. A deposit refund scheme and a small refuse charge would encourage recycling but not at the expense of fly-tipping. Thomas C. Kinnaman concludes that a landfill tax would force consumers, companies and councils to recycle more.<ref name=":0" />

Most free-market thinkers detest subsidy and intervention because they waste resources. [[Terry L. Anderson|Terry Anderson]] and Donald Leal think that all recycling programmes should be privately operated, and therefore would only operate if the money saved by recycling exceeds its costs. [[Daniel Benjamin|Daniel K. Benjamin]] argues that it wastes people's resources and lowers the wealth of a population.<ref name=":0" />

The [[National Waste & Recycling Association]] (NWRA) then again reported in May 2015, that recycling and waste made a $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio, U.S., and employed 14,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=187090 |title = Recycling and waste have $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio |author = RecyclingToday |date = 14 May 2015 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100058/http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=187090 |archive-date = 18 May 2015 }}</ref>

=== Trade in recyclates ===
Certain countries trade in unprocessed [[wikt:recyclate|recyclates]]. Some have complained that the ultimate fate of recyclates sold to another country is unknown and they may end up in landfills instead of being reprocessed. According to one report, in America, 50–80 percent of computers destined for recycling are actually not recycled.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/02/25/computer-waste.htm |title = Much toxic computer waste lands in Third World |website = USA Today |date = 25 February 2002 |access-date = 6 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://svtc.igc.org/media/articles/2002/time_march.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031109231707/http://svtc.igc.org/media/articles/2002/time_march.htm |archive-date = 9 November 2003 |title = Environmental and health damage in China |publisher = svtc.igc.org |date = 9 November 2003 |access-date = 6 November 2012 }}</ref> There are reports of illegal-waste imports to China being dismantled and recycled solely for monetary gain, without consideration for workers' health or environmental damage.

Certain regions have difficulty using or exporting as much of a material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass: both Britain and the U.S. import large quantities of wine bottled in green glass. Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled, outside the [[American Midwest]] there is not enough wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re-inserted into the regular waste stream.<ref name="gar" /><ref name="economisttruth" />

Similarly, the northwestern United States has difficulty finding markets for recycled newspaper, given the large number of [[pulp mill]]s in the region as well as the proximity to Asian markets. In other areas of the U.S., however, demand for used newsprint has seen wide fluctuation.<ref name="gar" />

In some U.S. states, a program called [[RecycleBank]] pays people to recycle, receiving money from local municipalities for the reduction in landfill space which must be purchased. It uses a single stream process in which all material is automatically sorted.<ref>Bonnie DeSimone (21 February 2006).

== Criticisms and responses ==
{{anchor|Criticism}}
{{confusing|date=March 2019}}
Critics{{who|date=December 2017}} dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from [[confirmation bias]]. Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.<ref>{{cite book |editor1 = Lynn R.

Much of the difficulty inherent in recycling comes from the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. The concept of [[sustainable design]] aims to solve this problem, and was laid out in the book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' by architect [[William McDonough]] and chemist [[Michael Braungart]].<ref>Afterlife: An Essential Guide To Design For Disassembly, by Alex Diener</ref> They suggest that every product (and all packaging it requires) should have a complete "closed-loop" cycle mapped out for each component—a way in which every component will either return to the natural ecosystem through [[biodegradation]] or be recycled indefinitely.<ref name="economisttruth"/><ref name="Decon_EPA">{{cite web |title=Fact Sheets on Designing for the Disassembly and Deconstruction of Buildings |url=https://www.epa.gov/smm/fact-sheets-designing-disassembly-and-deconstruction-buildings |website=epa.gov |publisher=EPA |access-date=12 March 2019 |language=en |date=14 March 2016}}</ref>

While recycling diverts waste from entering directly into landfill sites, current recycling misses the dispersive components. These critics believe that complete recycling is impracticable as highly dispersed wastes become so diluted that the energy needed for their recovery becomes increasingly excessive. 

As with [[environmental economics]], care must be taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example, [[paperboard]] packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage.<ref name="Tierney">{{cite news |first = John |last = Tierney |title = Recycling Is Garbage |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DF1339F933A05755C0A960958260&pagewanted=all |work = The New York Times |page = 3 |date = 30 June 1996 |access-date = 28 February 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206160552/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DF1339F933A05755C0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |archive-date = 6 December 2008 }}</ref>

=== Energy and material flows ===
{{anchor|Saves energy}}
[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Bales of crushed steel ready for transport to the smelter]]

The amount of energy saved through recycling depends upon the material being recycled and the type of energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with [[life-cycle analysis]] using real energy values, and in addition, [[exergy]], which is a measure of how much useful energy can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials.<ref>Morris, J. (2005). "Comparative LCAs for curbside recycling versus either landfilling or incineration with energy recovery" (12 pp).

Some scholars use [[emergy]] (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, budgets for the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics-based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by [[adaptive reuse]] systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.<ref name="Brown03" />

The [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) states on its website that "a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from recycled paper than it does to make paper from fresh lumber."<ref>Energy Information Administration [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/paperandglass.html#SavingEnergy "Recycling Paper & Glass"]. Retrieved 18 October 2006.</ref> Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled plastic, and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.<ref name="Brown03">{{cite journal |last1 = Brown |first1 = M.

It is difficult to determine the amount of energy consumed or produced in waste disposal processes in broader ecological terms, where causal relations dissipate into complex networks of material and energy flow. For example, "cities do not follow all the strategies of ecosystem development. Biogeochemical paths become fairly straight relative to wild ecosystems, with very reduced recycling, resulting in large flows of waste and low total energy efficiencies. By contrast, in wild ecosystems, one population's wastes are another population's resources, and succession results in efficient exploitation of available resources. However, even modernized cities may still be in the earliest stages of a succession that may take centuries or millennia to complete."<ref name="Decker00">{{Cite journal |title = Energy and Material flow through the urban Ecosystem |first1 = Ethan H. |last1 = Decker |first2 = Scott |last2 = Elliott |first3 = Felisa A. |last3 = Smith |first4 = Donald R. |last4 = Blake |first5 = F.

=== Costs ===
The amount of money actually saved through recycling depends on the efficiency of the recycling program used to do it. The [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance]] argues that the cost of recycling depends on various factors, such as [[gate fee|landfill fees]] and the amount of disposal that the community recycles. It states that communities begin to save money when they treat recycling as a replacement for their traditional waste system rather than an add-on to it and by "redesigning their collection schedules and/or trucks".<ref>Waste to Wealth [https://ilsr.org/the-five-most-dangerous-myths-about-recycling/ The Five Most Dangerous Myths About Recycling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529062928/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/wrrs/fivemyths.html|date=29 May 2009}}.

Comparing the market cost of recyclable material with the cost of new raw materials ignores economic [[externalities]]—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A [[life cycle assessment]] can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a [[carbon tax]]) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.

He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish their forests, large demands for paper lead to large forests while reduced demand for paper leads to fewer "farmed" forests.<ref name="armchair economist">Landsburg, Steven A. ''The Armchair Economist''. p. 81.</ref>
[[File:Agbogbloshie Ghana.jpg|thumb|A metal scrap worker is pictured burning insulated copper wires for copper recovery at Agbogbloshie, Ghana.]]
When foresting companies cut down trees, more are planted in their place; however, such "farmed" forests are inferior to natural forests in several ways. Farmed forests are not able to fix the soil as quickly as natural forests. This can cause widespread [[soil erosion]] and often requiring large amounts of [[fertilizer]] to maintain the soil, while containing little tree and wild-life [[biodiversity]] compared to virgin forests.<ref name="baird">Baird, Colin (2004). ''Environmental Chemistry'' (3rd ed.). W. H. Freeman. {{ISBN|0-7167-4877-0}}.</ref> Also, the new trees planted are not as big as the trees that were cut down, and the argument that there will be "more trees" is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings.

The reduction of greenhouse gas emission reduction also benefits from the development of the recycling industry. In [[Kitakyushu]], the only green growth model city in Asia selected by OECD, recycling industries are strongly promoted and financially supported as part of the [[Eco-town program]] in Japan. Given the industrial sector in Kitakyushu accounts for more than 60% energy consumption of the city, the development of recycling industry results in substantial energy reduction due to the economies of scale effects; the concentration of CO is, thus, found to decline accordingly.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Vuong, Q.-H.; Ho, M-T.; Nguyen, T.

Other non-conventional methods of material recycling, like Waste-to-Energy (WTE) systems, have garnered increased attention in the recent past due to the polarizing nature of their emissions. While viewed as a sustainable method of capturing energy from material waste feedstocks by many, others have cited numerous explanations for why the technology has not been scaled globally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/28/burning-issue-are-waste-to-energy-plants-a-good-idea|title=Burning issue: are waste-to-energy plants a good idea?|last=Towie|first=Narelle|date=28 February 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=23 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== Possible income loss and social costs ===

In some countries, recycling is performed by the entrepreneurial poor such as the [[karung guni]], [[zabbaleen]], the [[rag-and-bone man]], [[waste picker]], and [[junk man]]. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or [[economies of scale]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nrdc.org/cities/recycling/recyc/appenda.asp |title = Too Good To Throw Away – Appendix A |publisher = NRDC |date = 30 June 1996 |access-date = 6 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/police/stations/ParkStation/2007/07feb08%20park%20newsletter.pdf Mission Police Station]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513094320/http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/police/stations/ParkStation/2007/07feb08%20park%20newsletter.pdf |date=13 May 2012 }}</ref> the poor are more likely to be driven out of the recycling and the [[remanufacturing]] job market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor.<ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010">''PBS NewsHour'', 16 February 2010. Report on the Zabaleen</ref> Like the [[parable of the broken window]], there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable, e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.<ref name="Medina, M. 2000 51–69">{{cite journal |author = Medina, M. |year = 2000 |title = Scavenger cooperatives in Asia and Latin America |journal = Resources |volume = 31 |pages = 51–69 |doi = 10.1016/s0921-3449(00)00071-9 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.579.6981 }}</ref>

Because the social support of a country is likely to be less than the loss of income to the poor undertaking recycling, there is a greater chance the poor will come in conflict with the large recycling organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16878461&BRD=1698&PAG=461&dept_id=21849&rfi=6 |title = The News-Herald – Scrap metal a steal |publisher = Zwire.com |access-date = 6 November 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92705125 |title = Raids on Recycling Bins Costly To Bay Area |publisher = NPR |date = 19 July 2008 |access-date = 6 November 2012 }}</ref> This means fewer people can decide if certain waste is more economically reusable in its current form rather than being reprocessed. Contrasted to the recycling poor, the efficiency of their recycling may actually be higher for some materials because individuals have greater control over what is considered "waste".<ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010" />

One labor-intensive underused waste is electronic and computer waste. Because this waste may still be functional and wanted mostly by those on lower incomes, who may sell or use it at a greater efficiency than large recyclers.

Some recycling advocates believe that [[laissez-faire]] individual-based recycling does not cover all of society's recycling needs. Thus, it does not negate the need for an organized recycling program.<ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010" /> Local government can consider the activities of the recycling poor as contributing to the ruining of property.

== Public participation rates ==
[[File:Municipal recycling facilities, Montgomery County, MD. 2007, Credit USEPA (14410405277).jpg|thumb|[[Single-stream recycling]] increases public participation rates, but requires additional sorting.]]
Changes that have been demonstrated to increase recycling rates include:
* [[Single-stream recycling]]
* [[Pay as you throw]] fees for trash

Recycling of metals varies extremely by type. Titanium and lead have an extremely high recycling rates of over 90%. Copper and cobalt have high rates of recycling around 75%. Only about half of aluminum is recycled. Most of the remaining metals have recycling rates of below 35%, while 34 types of metals have recycling rates of under 1%.<ref>{{cite web|website=UNEP|title= Recycling Rates of Metals – A Status Report.

However, recent studies have concluded that social pressure will not work in this context.<ref>{{Cite journal |url = http://sapiens.revues.org/index905.html |title = Social pressure and recycling: a brief review, commentary and extensions |journal = S.A.P.I.EN.S |volume = 3 |issue = 1 |date =  4 February 2010|access-date = 6 November 2012 |last1 = Pratarelli |first1 = Marc E. }}</ref> One reason for this is that social pressure functions well in small group sizes of 50 to 150 individuals (common to nomadic hunter–gatherer peoples) but not in communities numbering in the millions, as we see today. Another reason is that individual recycling does not take place in the public view.

Following the increasing popularity of recycling collection being sent to the same landfills as trash, some people kept on putting recyclables on the recyclables bin.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/recycling-rethink-what-to-do-with-trash-now-china-wont-take-it-11576776536 |title=Recycling Rethink: What to Do With Trash Now That China Won't Take It |first=Saabira |last=Chaudhuri |date=December 19, 2019 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Art objects are more and more often made from recycled material.

In a study done by social psychologist Shawn Burn,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Burn | first1 = Shawn | year = 2006 | title = Social Psychology and the Stimulation of Recycling Behaviors: The Block Leader Approach | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 611–629 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00539.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.462.1934 }}</ref> it was found that personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is the most effective way to increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Oskamp | first1 = Stuart | year = 1995 | title = Resource Conservation and Recycling: Behavior and Policy | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 157–177 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01353.x}}</ref> examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.

Many schools have created recycling awareness clubs in order to give young students an insight on recycling. These schools believe that the clubs actually encourage students to not only recycle at school but at home as well.
