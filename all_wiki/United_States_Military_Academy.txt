The '''United States Military Academy''' ('''USMA'''), also known as '''West Point''', '''Army''', '''Army West Point''',<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.si.com/college-football/2015/04/13/army-football-new-uniforms-logo|title=Army unveils new name, uniforms and logo in athletics rebrand |first = S. I. |last=Wire |website = SI.com }}</ref> '''The Academy''', or simply '''The Point''', is a four-year [[United States service academies|federal service academy]] in [[West Point, New York]]. It was originally established as a fort that sits on strategic high ground overlooking the [[Hudson River]] with a scenic view, {{convert|50|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north of [[New York City]]. It is the oldest of the five American service academies.

The academy was founded in 1802, one year after President [[Thomas Jefferson]] directed that plans be set in motion to establish the United States Military Academy at West Point. The entire central campus is a [[National Historic Landmark|national landmark]] and home to scores of historic sites, buildings, and monuments. The majority of the campus's [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-style buildings are constructed from gray and black granite. The campus is a popular tourist destination, with a visitor center and the oldest museum in the United States Army.

Candidates for admission must apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination, usually from a member of Congress. Other nomination sources include the president and vice president.<ref>United States Military Academy, West Point. "[http://www.usma.edu/admissions/sitepages/apply_nominations.aspx West Point Admissions].</ref> Students are officers-in-training and are referred to as "cadets" or collectively as the "United States Corps of Cadets" (USCC). Tuition for cadets is fully funded by the Army in exchange for an active duty service obligation upon graduation. About 1,300 cadets enter the Academy each July, with about 1,000 cadets graduating.

The academic program grants a bachelor of science degree with a curriculum that grades cadets' performance upon a broad academic program, military leadership performance, and mandatory participation in competitive athletics. Cadets are required to adhere to the [[Cadet Honor Code]], which states that "a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do." The academy bases a cadet's leadership experience as a development of all four pillars of performance: academics, character, physical, and military.

Most graduates are commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army. Foreign cadets are commissioned into the armies of their home countries. Since 1959, cadets have also been eligible for an interservice commission in one of the other armed services provided that they meet that service's eligibility standards. A small number of cadets do this.

The academy's traditions have influenced other institutions because of its age and unique mission. It was the first American college to have an accredited civil engineering program and the first to have class rings, and its technical curriculum became a model for engineering schools. West Point's student body has a unique rank structure and lexicon. All cadets reside on campus and dine together ''en masse'' on weekdays for breakfast and lunch. The academy fields 15 men's and nine women's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) sports teams. Cadets compete in one sport every fall, winter, and spring season at the intramural, club, or intercollegiate level. Its [[Army Black Knights football|football team]] was a national power in the early and mid-20th&nbsp;century, winning three national championships. Among the country's public institutions, the academy is the top producer of [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]] and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]] scholars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/statistics|title=Statistics|website=www.marshallscholarship.org|access-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/office-of-the-american-secretary/us-winners/colleges-and-universities-of-all-us-rhodes-scholars-over-time/|title=US Rhodes Scholars Over Time|website=www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk|access-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref> Its alumni and students are collectively referred to as "The Long Gray Line," and its ranks include two U.S. Presidents; the [[Jefferson Davis|President]] of the [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized breakaway]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-08-28|title=Office of the Historian - Milestones - 1861-1865 - Preventing Diplomatic Recognition of the Confederacy|url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/Confederacy|access-date=2020-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828005906/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/Confederacy|archive-date=28 August 2013}}</ref> [[Confederate States of America]]; presidents of [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], and the [[Philippines]]; numerous famous generals; and 76 [[Medal of Honor]] recipients.

Immediately following the Civil War, the academy enjoyed unprecedented fame as a result of the role its graduates had played.<ref>Crackel (2002), p. 137.</ref> However, the post-war years were a difficult time for the academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former confederate states.<ref name="postcw">{{cite web |url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1865.asp |title=Postwar Change and Contraction|work=USMA Bicentennial|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2 January 2009}}</ref> The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first black cadet, [[James Webster Smith]] of [[South Carolina]].<ref name="postcw"/><ref>Crackel (2002), p. 145.</ref> Smith endured harsh treatment and was eventually dismissed for academic deficiency under controversial circumstances in 1874.<ref>{{cite web|title=COMMISSIONING CEREMONY SCHEDULED IN S.C.

Besides the integration of southern-state and black cadets, the post-war academy also struggled with the issue of [[hazing]]. In its first 65&nbsp;years, hazing was uncommon or non-existent beyond small pranks played upon the incoming freshmen, but took a harsher tone as Civil War veterans began to fill the incoming freshman classes. The upper class cadets saw it as their duty to "teach the plebes their manners."<ref>Ambrose (1966), p. 223.</ref> Hazing at the academy entered the national spotlight with the death of former cadet [[List of hazing deaths in the United States#1900's|Oscar L. Booz]] on 3 December 1900. Congressional hearings, which included testimony by cadet [[Douglas MacArthur]], investigated his death and the pattern of systemic hazing of freshmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citadel.edu/english/bullies&cowards.html|title=Bullies and Cowards: The West Point Hazing Scandal 1898–1901|publisher=Greenwood Press|accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> When MacArthur returned as superintendent, he made an effort to end the practice of hazing the incoming freshmen by placing Army sergeants in charge of training new cadets during freshman summer.<ref>Ambrose, (1966), p. 277.</ref> The practice of hazing continued on some levels well into the late 20th century, but is no longer allowed in the present day.<ref>Lipsky (2002), pp. 21, 27.</ref>

The demand for junior officers during the [[Spanish–American War]] caused the class of 1899 to graduate early, and the [[Philippine–American War]] did the same for the class of 1901. This increased demand for officers led Congress to increase the size of the Corps of Cadets to 481&nbsp;cadets in 1900.<ref name="ww1">{{cite web |url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1890.asp |title=Supporting an Emerging Global Power|work=USMA Bicentennial|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2 January 2009}}</ref> The period between 1900 and 1915 saw a construction boom as much of West Point's old infrastructure was rebuilt.<ref name="ww1"/> Many of the academy's most famous graduates graduated during the 15-year period between 1900 and 1915: [[Douglas MacArthur]] (1903), [[Joseph Stilwell]] (1904), [[Henry "Hap" Arnold]] (1907), [[George S. Patton]] (1909), [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and [[Omar Bradley]] (both 1915). The class of 1915 is known as "[[the class the stars fell on]]" for the exceptionally high percentage of general officers that rose from that class (59 of 164).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_6b.html|title=The Class the Stars Fell On|publisher=Smithsonian National American History Museum|accessdate=16 December 2008}}</ref><ref>Simpson (1982), p. 178.</ref>

The outbreak of America's involvement in World War I caused a sharp increase in the demand for army officers, and the academy accelerated graduation of all four classes then in attendance to meet this requirement, beginning with the early graduation of the First Class on 20 April 1917, the Second Class in August 1917, and both the Third and Fourth Classes just before the Armistice of 11 November 1918, when only freshman cadets remained (those who had entered in the summer of 1918).<ref name="ww1"/> In all, wartime contingencies and post-war adjustments resulted in ten classes, varying in length of study from two to four years, within a seven-year period before the regular course of study was fully resumed.<ref name="cullumIX">{{cite web|editor-last=Branham |editor-first=Charles N. |year=1950 |url=http://digital-library.usma.edu/libmedia/archives/cullum/VOL9_PART0001.PDF |title=Supplement: Volume IX 1940–1950 |work=Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point Since its Establishment in 1802 |publisher=USMA Digital library |accessdate=1 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720103455/http://digital-library.usma.edu/libmedia/archives/cullum/VOL9_PART0001.PDF |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}.

Douglas MacArthur became superintendent in 1919, instituting sweeping reforms to the academic process, including introducing a greater emphasis on history and [[humanities]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_6a.html|title=Restoring the Academy|publisher=Smithsonian National American History Museum|accessdate=17 December 2008}}</ref> He made major changes to the field training regimen and the Cadet Honor Committee was formed under his watch in 1922.<ref>Ambrose (1966), pp. 278–280.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usma.edu/committees/honor/Info/main.htm|title=Overview|publisher=Cadet Honor Committee|accessdate=2 January 2009}}</ref> MacArthur was a firm supporter of athletics at the academy, as he famously said "Upon the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that, upon other fields, on other days, will bear the fruits of victory."<ref name="Ambrose 1966, p. 275">Ambrose (1966), p. 275.</ref> West Point was first officially accredited in 1925, and in 1933 began granting bachelor of science degrees to all graduates.<ref name="prewwII">{{cite web|title=Interwar Expansion|publisher=United States Military Academy|url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1919.asp|accessdate=20 January 2009}}</ref> In 1935, the academy's authorized strength increased to 1,960 cadets.<ref name="prewwII"/>

=== World War II and Cold War ===
As [[World War II]] engulfed Europe, Congress authorized an increase to 2,496 cadets in 1942 and began graduating classes early. The class of 1943 graduated six months early in January 1943, and the next four classes graduated after only three years.<ref name="wwII">{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1939.asp|title=World War II and a Modern Academy|work=USMA Bicentennial|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=20 January 2009}}</ref> To accommodate this accelerated schedule, summer training was formally moved to a recently acquired piece of land southwest of main post. The site would later become Camp Buckner.<ref>Ambrose (1966) p. 208.</ref> The academy had its last serious brush with abolition or major reform during the war, when some members of Congress charged that even the accelerated curriculum allowed young men to "hide out" at West Point and avoid combat duty. A proposal was put forth to convert the academy to an officer's training school with a six-month schedule, but this was not adopted. West Point played a prominent role in WWII; four of the five [[five-star rank|five-star generals]] were alumni and nearly 500&nbsp;graduates died.<ref name="wwII"/> Immediately following the war in 1945, [[Maxwell Taylor]] (class of 1922) became superintendent. He expanded and modernized the academic program and abolished antiquated courses in fencing and horsemanship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_6c.html|title=Making the Modern Academy|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History|accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref>

Unlike previous conflicts, the [[Korean War]] did not disrupt class graduation schedules. More than half of the Army leadership during the war was composed of West Point graduates.

The visitor's center is just outside the Thayer Gate in the village of [[Highland Falls, NY|Highland Falls]] and offers the opportunity to arrange for a guided tour. These tours, which are the only way the general public can access the academy grounds, leave the visitor's center several times a day. The old West Point Visitor's Center was housed in the now-demolished Ladycliff College library building.  On September 9, 2016, West Point broke ground in order to begin construction of the new 31,000 square foot Malek West Point Visitors Center.  It is being built on the location of the former visitor's center.  The Malek West Point Visitors Center is named after Frederic Malek, USMA Class of 1959 and a 2014 Distinguished Graduate.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.usma.edu/pv/Pointer%20View%20Archive/16SEP15.pdf |title=West Point's First Impression |last=Hamel |first=Keith |date=September 15, 2016|newspaper=Pointer View|volume=73|issue=36 |page=5|access-date=January 20, 2017|via=}}</ref>

The commanding officer at the USMA is the [[Superintendents of the United States Military Academy|Superintendent]], equivalent to the president or chancellor of a civilian university. In recent years, the position of Superintendent has been held by a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] (three star general).

The West Point Association of Graduates (WPAOG) also offers scholarship support to people who are qualified but not selected. The scholarships usually cover around $7,000 to civilian universities; the students who receive these scholarships do so under the stipulation that they will be admitted to and attend West Point a year later. Those who do not must repay the AOG. [[Marion Military Institute]], [[New Mexico Military Institute]], [[Georgia Military College]], [[Hargrave Military Academy]], [[Greystone Preparatory School]] at [[Schreiner University]], and [[Northwestern Preparatory School (California)|Northwestern Preparatory School]] are approved programs that students attend on the AOG scholarship prior to admission to West Point.<ref>{{cite web|title=West Point Preparatory Scholarship Program of the West Point Association of Graduates|publisher=West Point Association of Graduates|url=https://www.westpointaog.org/document.doc?id=3351|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>

=== Academics ===
The academy's teaching style forms part of the Thayer method, which was implemented by Sylvanus Thayer during his tour as Superintendent.<ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 521.</ref> This form of instruction emphasizes small classes with daily homework, and strives to make students actively responsible for their own learning by completing homework assignments prior to class and bringing the work to class to discuss collaboratively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shell |first=Amy |title=The Thayer method of instruction at the United States Military Academy: a modest history and a modern personal account |journal=PRIMUS: Problems, Resources, and Issues in Mathematics Undergraduate Studies |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=27–38 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=584623|accessdate=25 January 2009 |doi=10.1080/10511970208984015|s2cid=120391190 }}</ref>

=== Military ===
[[File:USMA Cadets Cross a Rope Bridge.jpg|right|thumb|Cadets cross a rope bridge during summer training]]
As all cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline fall under the purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day or R-day,<ref>Crackel (1991), p. 283.</ref> which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as Beast Barracks, or simply Beast.<ref>Simpson (1982), p. 102.</ref><ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 9.</ref> Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the transition from civilian to military life. Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train in more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they may serve as instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets also spend one-month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon face as new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military schools around the world.<ref>Neff (2007), pp.&nbsp;88–89.</ref> The schools include Airborne, Air Assault, Sapper, Pathfinder, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/89942/|title=West Point cadets compete to earn slots at top-class training programs|author=Mike Strasser, U.S. Military Academy Public Affairs|date=25 October 2012|work=army.mil}}</ref>

[[Active duty]] officers in the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] or [[Major (United States)|major]] serve as Company Tactical Officers (TAC Officers). The role of the TAC is to mentor, train, and teach the cadets proper standards of good order and discipline and be a good role model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/uscc/btd/btdindex.htm|title=Brigade Tactical Department|publisher=Office of the Commandant, USMA|accessdate=19 December 2008}}</ref> There is one TAC for every cadet company. There is also one senior Non-Commissioned Officer to assist each TAC, known as TAC-NCOs.<ref>Lea, p. 190.</ref>

The Department of Military Instruction (DMI) is responsible for all military arts and sciences education as well as planning and executing the cadet summer training.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usma.edu/dmi/|title=Department of Military Instruction|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=19 December 2008}}</ref> Within DMI there is a representative from each of the Army's branches.

=== Physical ===
[[File:Horizontal Ladder and Vertical Rope USMA IOCT.JPG|right|thumb|Indoor obstacle course]]
The [[Department of Physical Education]] (DPE) administers the physical program, which includes both physical education classes, physical fitness testing, and competitive athletics. The head of DPE holds the title of Master of the Sword, dating back to the 19th century when DPE taught swordsmanship as part of the curriculum.<ref>Crowley and Guinzburg, p. 235.</ref>

All cadets take a prescribed series of physical fitness courses such as military movement (applied gymnastics), boxing, survival swimming, and beginning in 2009, [[Modern Army Combatives|advanced combatives]]. Cadets can also take elective physical activity classes such as [[Scuba diving|scuba]], rock climbing, and aerobic fitness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usma.edu/dpe/courseofferings.htm|title=Course Offerings|publisher=USMA Department of Physical Education|accessdate=12 December 2008}}</ref>

As with all soldiers in the Army, cadets also must pass the [[Army Physical Fitness Test]] twice per year. Additionally, every year, cadets must pass the [[Indoor Obstacle Course Test]] (IOCT), which DPE has administered in [[Hayes Gymnasium]] since 1944.<ref>Barkalow (1990), p. 77.</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis|author=Degan, Robert|title=The Evolution of Physical Education at the United States Military Academy|publisher=University of Wisconsin|year=1968}}</ref>

Since [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s tenure as superintendent, every cadet has been required to participate in either an [[NCAA|intercollegiate sport]], a [[sports club|club sport]], or an [[intramural]] (referred to as "company athletics") sport each semester.<ref name="Ambrose 1966, p. 275"/>

=== Moral and ethical training ===
[[File:Cadet Honor Plaze USMA Dec 2008.JPG|right|thumb|Class of '57 honor memorial on which the honor code is inscribed]]
Moral and ethical development occurs throughout the entirety of the cadet experience by living under [[Cadet Honor Code|the honor code]] and through formal leadership programs available at the academy. These include instruction in the values of the military profession through Professional Military Ethics Education (PME<sup>2</sup>), voluntary religious programs, interaction with staff and faculty role models, and an extensive guest-speaker program. The foundation of the ethical code at West Point is found in the academy's motto, "Duty, Honor, Country."<ref name="motto">{{cite web |title =About the Academy |publisher=United States Military Academy |url = http://www.usma.edu/about.asp |accessdate =25 December 2008 }}</ref>

West Point's [[Cadet Honor Code]] reads simply that: "A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.usma.edu/faq_about.html|title=FAQs – About West Point|publisher=USMA Office of Admissions|accessdate=31 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101202604/http://admissions.usma.edu/faq_about.html|archive-date=1 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Cadets accused of violating the Honor Code face an investigative and hearing process.

=== Rank and organization ===
[[File:USMA Cadet Rank -2.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Cadet collar and shoulder sleeve insignia]]
[[File:USMA Cadet Rank -1.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Cadet captains' shoulder sleeve insignia]]
Cadets are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. Instead they are officially called fourth class, third class, second class, and first class cadets. Colloquially, freshmen are ''plebes'', sophomores are ''yearlings'' or ''yuks'', juniors are ''cows'', and seniors are ''firsties''.<ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 43.</ref><ref>Barkalow (1990), pp. 23, 81, 109, 124.</ref> Some of the origins of the class names are known, some are not. [[plebs|Plebeians]] were the lower class of ancient Roman society, while yearling is a euphemism for a year-old animal. The origin of cow is less known. There are a number of theories for the origin of the term ''cow''; however the most prevalent and probably accurate one is that cadets in years past had no leave until the end of their yearling year, when they were granted a summer-long furlough. Their return as second classmen was heralded as "the cows coming home."<ref>Shellum, Brian (2006). ''Black cadet in a White bastion: Charles Young at West Point''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, pp. 94–5. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9315-1}}.</ref>

The Corps of Cadets is officially organized into a brigade. The senior ranking cadet, the Brigade Commander, is known traditionally as the ''First Captain''. The brigade is organized into four regiments. Within each regiment there are three battalions, each consisting of three companies.<ref name=PA>{{cite web|last=Public Affairs Office|title=Class of 2015 Parents Almanac|url=http://www.westpoint.edu/Class/2015/parents_almanac.pdf|work=Page 12|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=1 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905004614/http://www.westpoint.edu/Class/2015/parents_almanac.pdf|archive-date=5 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Companies are lettered A through I, with a number signifying which regiment it belongs to. For example, there are four "H" companies: H1, H2, H3, and H4. First class cadets hold the leadership positions within the brigade from the First Captain down to platoon leaders within the companies. Leadership responsibility decreases with the lower classes, with second class cadets holding the rank of cadet sergeant, third class cadets holding the rank of cadet corporal, and fourth class cadets as cadet privates.<ref>Neff (2007), pp.&nbsp;62–63</ref>

Due to West Point's age and its unique mission of producing Army officers, it has many time-honored traditions. The list below are some of the traditions unique to or started by the academy.

=== Cullum number ===
The Cullum number is a reference and identification number assigned to each graduate. It was created by [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] Major General [[George Washington Cullum|George W. Cullum]] (USMA Class of 1833) who, in 1850, began the monumental work of chronicling the biographies of every graduate. He assigned number one to the first West Point graduate, [[Joseph Gardner Swift]], and then numbered all successive graduates in sequence. Before his death in 1892, General Cullum completed the first three volumes of a work that eventually comprised 10&nbsp;volumes, titled ''General Cullum's Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, and covering USMA classes from 1802 through 1850''. From 1802 through the Class of 1977, graduates were listed by general order of Merit. Beginning with the Class of 1978, graduates were listed alphabetically, and then by date of graduation. Seven graduates have an "A" suffix after their Cullum Number. For various reasons these graduates were omitted from the original class roster, and a suffix letter was added to avoid renumbering the entire class and subsequent classes.<ref name="cullum#">{{cite web|url=http://www.aogusma.org/CLASS/Handbook/cullum.htm|title=Annex G: Class and Cullum Files|work=Handbook for Graduated Officers|publisher=AOG|accessdate=1 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20030920091116/http://www.aogusma.org/CLASS/Handbook/cullum.htm|archivedate=20 September 2003|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Class ring ===
{{Main|United States Military Academy class ring}}
[[File:West Point 2012 Ring.JPG|thumb|2012 [[United States Military Academy class ring|West Point class ring]]]]
West Point began the collegiate tradition of the class ring, beginning with the class of 1835.<ref name="ring">{{cite web|url=http://digital-library.usma.edu/collections/photographs/classrings/|title=USMA Class Rings|publisher=USMA Library Special Collections|accessdate=31 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114221417/http://digital-library.usma.edu/collections/photographs/classrings/|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The class of 1836 chose no rings, and the class of 1879 had cuff links in lieu of a class ring. Before 1917, cadets could design much of the ring individually, but now only the center stone can be individualized.<ref name="ring"/> One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest and the center stone ring bears the words ''West Point'' and the class year. The academy library has a large collection of cadet rings on display.<ref>Neff (2007), p. 284.</ref> Senior cadets receive their rings during [[Ring Weekend]] in the early fall of their senior year. Immediately after senior cadets return to the barracks after receiving their rings, fourth class cadets take the opportunity to surround senior cadets from their company and ask to touch their rings. After reciting a poem known to cadets as the ''Ring Poop'', the senior usually grants the freshmen permission to touch the ring.<ref>Hulse (1994), p. 264.</ref> In 2002, the Memorial Class ring donor program began. Donations of class rings are melted and merged. A portion of the original gold is infused with gold from preceding melts to become part of the rings for each 'Firstie' class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/44212/new-tradition-at-west-point-adds-bit-of-molten-history-into-each-new-class-ring/|title=New tradition at West Point adds bit of 'molten' history into each new class ring|author=Mike Strasser, West Point Directorate of Public Affairs and Communications|date=25 August 2010|work=army.mil}}</ref>

=== Thayer Award ===
{{Main|Sylvanus Thayer Award}}
West Point is home to the Sylvanus Thayer Award. Given annually by the academy since 1958, the award honors an outstanding citizen whose service and accomplishments in the national interest exemplify the academy's motto, "Duty, Honor, Country."<ref name="thayeraward">{{cite web|url=https://www.westpointaog.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=946|title=The Sylvanus Thayer Award|publisher=Association of Graduates|accessdate=1 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201231450/http://westpointaog.org/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=946|archivedate=1 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Currently, the award guidelines state that the recipient not be a graduate of the academy. The award has been awarded to many notable American citizens, to include [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Tom Brokaw]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Barry Goldwater]], [[Carl Vinson]], [[Barbara Jordan]], [[William J. Perry]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Condoleezza Rice]]<ref name="thayeraward"/> and [[Leon E. Panetta]].

=== Sedgwick's spurs ===
[[File:Sedgwick's Spurs.JPG|right|thumb|[[John Sedgwick|Sedgwick's]] spurs]]
A monument to Civil War Union General [[John Sedgwick]] stands on the outskirts of the [[The Plain (West Point)|Plain]]. Sedgwick's bronze statue has [[spur]]s with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as fast as he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course.<ref>Lea (2003), p. 409.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tour of West Point Monuments & Statues|publisher=United States Military Academy |url=http://www.usma.edu/Tour/SedgwickMonument.asp|accessdate=8 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107193437/http://www.usma.edu/Tour/SedgwickMonument.asp |archivedate=7 January 2009}}</ref> Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.<ref>Barkalow (1990), p. 78.</ref>

=== Goat-Engineer game ===
[[File:West Point Goat Engineer Game &nbsp;9&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2009.JPG|thumb|2009 Goat-Engineer game]]
As part of the run-up to the Navy football game, the Corps of Cadets plays the Goat-Engineer game.<ref name="gogoats">{{cite web |title =Early days of spirit: first Goat-Engineer game |work=Pointer View |url =http://www.usma.edu/Dcomm/PV/991203/bonfire.htm |accessdate =12 January 2009}}</ref> First played in 1907, it is a game between the "Goats" (the bottom half of the senior (Firstie) class academically), and the "Engineers" (the top half). The game is played with full pads and helmets using [[eight-man football]] rules. The location has changed over the years, with recent venues being [[Shea Stadium]], [[Michie Stadium]], and [[Daly Field]]. Legend states that Army will beat Navy if the goats win, and the opposite if the engineers win.<ref name="gogoats"/> In recent years, female cadets have begun playing a [[flag football]] contest, so there are now two Goat-Engineer games, played consecutively the same night.<ref>{{cite web |title =Army-Navy Spirit Activities |publisher=West Point Public Affairs Office |url =http://www.usma.edu/Dcomm/PressReleasesbd/nr40-07ArmyNavySpiritWeek.htm |accessdate =12 January 2009}}</ref>

=== Walking the area ===
[[File:West Point Cadet walking the Area, May&nbsp;98.jpg|right|thumb|"Walking the area"]]
From the earliest days of the academy, one form of punishment for cadets who commit regulatory infractions has been a process officially known as ''punishment tours''.<ref name="AR210-26">{{cite web|title=Army Regulation (AR) 210–26: United States Military Academy |publisher=US Army Publishing Activity (USAPA) |url=http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r210_26.pdf |accessdate=23 December 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090811130131/http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r210_26.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This process is better known to the cadets as "hours" because as punishment, cadets must walk a specified number of hours in penalty. Cadets are "awarded" punishment tours based upon the severity of the infraction. Being late to class or having an unkempt room may result in as little as 5 hours while more severe misconduct infractions may result in upwards of 60 to 80 hours. In its most traditional form, punishment tours are "walked off" by wearing the dress gray uniform under arms and walking back and forth in a designated area of the cadet barracks courtyard, known as "Central Area." Cadets who get into trouble frequently and spend many weekends "walking off their hours" are known as "area birds."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Glossary of Army Slang|journal=American Speech|date=October 1941|volume=16|issue=3 |pages=163–169|jstor=486883|doi=10.2307/486883}}</ref> Cadets who walk more than 100 total hours in their career are affectionately known as "Century Men."<ref>{{cite web |title=Commencement Speech (c/o 2006)|author=President G.W. Bush|publisher=USMA.edu|url=http://www.usma.edu/Class/2006/GradSpeech06.asp|accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref> An alternate form of punishment to walking hours is known as "fatigue tours," where assigned hours may be "worked off" by manual labor, such as cleaning the barracks. Certain cadets whose academics are deficient may also conduct "sitting tours," where they have to "sit hours" in a designated academic room in a controlled study environment, for which they receive half credit towards their reduction of tours. Cadets' uniforms are inspected before their tours begin each day.  The inspection process is arduous and considered part of the punishment, but the time spent does not count against the awarded number of tours.<ref>{{cite web |author=Tim Brooks |title=Kicking Pennies in the Rain |publisher=Vocal |url=https://vocal.media/serve/kicking-pennies-in-the-rain|accessdate=17 November 2020 | date = December 2019}}</ref> A small number of cadets may be relieved of their tours that day if their uniforms are exceptionally presentable. Another tradition associated with punishment tours is that any visiting head of state has the authority to grant "amnesty," releasing all cadets with outstanding hours from the remainder of their assigned tours.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rick Hampson|title=West Point offers gravitas, rapt audience|publisher=USA Today.com|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2009-12-02-west-point-obama_N.htm|accessdate=24 December 2009 | date=2 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=John Wooley  |author2=Gerhard Peters |name-list-style=amp |title=Remarks Announcing a Proclamation of Amnesty for Cadets at the Military Academy|publisher=The American Presidency Project|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3030|accessdate=24 December 2009}}</ref>

===Sandhurst Military Skills Competition===
In 1967 the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] presented West Point with a [[British Army]] officer's sword for use as a trophy in a [[Sandhurst Competition|military skills competition]] at West Point. In 2019 the Sandhurst competition spans two days, April 12 and 13, with teams from USMA, the ROTC programs, the Naval, Coast Guard, and the Air Force academies. International academies including the UK, Canada, and Australia have won the Sandhurst Military Skills Competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/220062/things_you_need_to_know_before_sandhurst_2019|title=Things you need to know before Sandhurst 2019|website=army.mil}}</ref>
