'''Education in Sweden''' is mandatory for children between ages 6 and 15. The [[school year]] in Sweden runs from mid/late August to early/mid June. The Christmas holiday from mid December to early January divides the Swedish school year into two [[academic term|terms]].

Preschool is free for low-income families and subsidized with a price ceiling for all families. The year children turn six they start the compulsory preschool class (''förskoleklass''), which act as a transition phase between preschool and comprehensive schools. Children between ages 7 and 15 attend comprehensive school where a wide range of subjects are studied. All students study the same subjects, with exception for different language choices. The majority of schools are run municipally, but there are also privately owned schools, known as independent schools.

Almost all students continue studying in 3 year long upper secondary schools where most students choose one out of 18 national programmes some of which are vocational and some preparatory. For students not fulfilling the requirements for the national programmes, introductory programmes are available where students work to satisfy the requirements for the national programmes. In 2018, 16% of students finishing year 9 of comprehensive school were not eligible for national programmes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://siris.skolverket.se/siris/sitevision_doc.getFile?p_id=548420|title=Grundskolan – Betyg och Prov – Riksnivå|website=Skolverket|language=sv|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>

The higher education system is compatible with the rest of Europe through the [[Bologna Process]] where degrees are divided into 3 cycles, basic level, advanced level and doctoral level. There are two degrees available in each cycle of different lengths. Universities have no tuition fees for Swedish citizens (as well for citizens of [[European Economic Area]] сountries), and student aid is available from the government.

==History==

===Comprehensive school===
[[File:Graduation class Realexamen 1965 Danderyd.jpg|thumb|Class of 15- and 16-year-olds celebrates a successfully completed ''Realexamen'' (graduation from ''realskolan'') in a [[Stockholm]] suburb in 1965.]]
In 1842, the Swedish parliament introduced a four-year primary school for children in Sweden, "''folkskola''". In 1882 two grades were added to "''folkskola''", grade 5 and 6. Some "''folkskola''" also had grade 7 and 8, called "''fortsättningsskola''". Schooling in Sweden became mandatory for 7 years in the 1930s and for 8 years in the 1950s. In 1962 the first version of the current compulsory school was introduced with Swedish children having 9 mandatory years in school – from August the year the child turns 7 to June the year the child turns 16.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lararnashistoria.se/sites/www.lararnashistoria.se/files/artiklar/Folkskolan%20och%20grundskolan.pdf|title=Folkskolan och grundskola|website=www.lararnashistoria.se|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>

The 1962 curriculum included two different study paths vocational and preparatory, this was however abolished in the 1969 revision. In 1980 came another major revision increasing the emphasize on the theoretical subjects. In 1994 the grading system was changed and in the latest revision from 2011 the grading system was changed yet again this time also introducing grades from year 6.<ref name=":0" />

===Secondary school===
In 1905 ''realskolan'' was introduced for students wanting to continue studying after ''folkskolan'' it had varying length between 3 and 6 years.

In 1968 ''gymnasieskolan'' was introduced with a similar structure to the current version. 22 different programmes some of which were vocational and some preparatory. These programmes lasted from between 2 and 4 years something that was changed in 1991 making all programmes 3 years long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lararnashistoria.se/sites/www.lararnashistoria.se/files/artiklar/L%C3%A4roverken%20och%20gymnasieskolan.pdf|title=Läroverken och gymnasieskolan|website=www.lararnashistoria.se|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>

== Preschool ==
[[Preschool]] is offered to all children whose parents are working, studying, unemployed or on parental leave from the age of one. From the age of 3, all children are eligible for at least 3 hours of preschool education every day for free. Fees for children being at preschool for more than 3 hours a day or under 3 years of age are based on family income and number of children. Prices range from free to a maximum of 1 425 SEK (€135 or US$150) per month {{as of|July 2019}} with exact rates set by the municipality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Swedish preschool |url=https://sweden.se/society/play-is-key-in-preschool/ |website=sweden.se |publisher=[[Swedish Institute]] |accessdate=8 October 2019 |date=13 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sweden.se/society/play-is-key-in-preschool/|title=Swedish preschool|date=13 June 2013|website=sweden.se|language=en-GB|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.omsvenskaskolan.se/engelska/foerskolan-och-foerskoleklass/|title=Preschool and preschool class {{!}} Skolverket nyanlända|website=www.omsvenskaskolan.se|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>

It is intended to free up parents to work, establishing a foundation for children going into the comprehensive school and promote fundamental values such as the equal value of all people.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://www.skolverket.se/sitevision/proxy/publikationer/svid12_5dfee44715d35a5cdfa2899/55935574/wtpub/ws/skolbok/wpubext/trycksak/Blob/pdf4049.pdf?k=4049|title=Curriculum for the Preschool|publisher=Skolverket|year=2019|isbn=978-913832747-0|language=sv|access-date=18 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411212152/https://www.skolverket.se/sitevision/proxy/publikationer/svid12_5dfee44715d35a5cdfa2899/55935574/wtpub/ws/skolbok/wpubext/trycksak/Blob/pdf4049.pdf?k=4049|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> This is achieved through pedagogical activities prepared by preschool teachers often involving things such as play, singing and drawing. The preschool teachers should incorporate multiple educational moments each day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/forskolan/laroplan-for-forskolan/reviderad-laroplan-for-forskolan/undervisning-i-forskolan|title=Undervisning i förskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>

== Comprehensive school ==
The educational system in Sweden is based on a nine-year long comprehensive school (''Grundskola''), with mandatory attendance between 6/7 and 15/16 years of age.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=http://www.omsvenskaskolan.se/engelska/grundskolan-och-fritidshem/|title=Comprehensive school and recreation centres {{!}} Skolverket nyanlända|website=www.omsvenskaskolan.se|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Subjects ===
In the Swedish compulsory school each student take 16 compulsory subjects which are, sorted by time allocated: Swedish, Mathematics, Physical Education, English, Handicrafts, Music, Visual arts, Technology, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Social Studies, Religion, Geography and Home Economics. All of these subjects are taken in all three school stages, lower stage (grades 1–3), middle stage (grade 4–6), and upper stage (grades 7–9).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/grundskolan/laroplan-och-kursplaner-for-grundskolan/timplan-for-grundskolan|title=Timplan för grundskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.skolverket.se/sitevision/proxy/publikationer/svid12_5dfee44715d35a5cdfa2899/55935574/wtpub/ws/skolbok/wpubext/trycksak/Blob/pdf3984.pdf?k=3984|title=Curriculum for the compulsory school, preschool class and school-age educare 2011, revised 2018.|year=2018|isbn=9789138327340|oclc=1066022776|access-date=19 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411212237/https://www.skolverket.se/sitevision/proxy/publikationer/svid12_5dfee44715d35a5cdfa2899/55935574/wtpub/ws/skolbok/wpubext/trycksak/Blob/pdf3984.pdf?k=3984|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In sixth grade students can also choose a non-compulsory foreign language course. Over 85% of grade 9 students studied a third language in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jmftal.artisan.se/databas.aspx?sf=gr&hg=L0&vg=Skolor+och+elever&sy=0&varid=19&varid=8&varid=9&varid=103&year=2017&area=&area=-99&render=true&mode=1#tab-1|title=Skolverket - Jämförelsetal - Databasen|website=www.jmftal.artisan.se|language=sv|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref> All schools have to offer 2 of the languages Spanish, French, and German.

There is also a compulsory, non-graded Student's Choice subject (''Elevens Val'') where the student can choose from various activities facilitated by the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/skolutveckling/anordna-och-administrera-utbildning/anordna-utbildning-pa-grundskoleniva/anordna-elevens-val|title=Anordna elevens val - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> Student's Choice has been criticized for potentially being a bad use of the students and teachers time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lrbloggar.se/nicklasmork/dags-att-avskaffa-pseudoamnet-elevens-val|title=Dags att avskaffa pseudoämnet elevens val? - Nicklas Mörk|website=lrbloggar|language=sv|access-date=25 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225223735/http://lrbloggar.se/nicklasmork/dags-att-avskaffa-pseudoamnet-elevens-val/|archive-date=25 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skolvarlden.se/artiklar/mer-idrott-mindre-elevens-val|title=Mer idrott – mindre "elevens val"|website=Skolvärlden|language=sv|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

===Grading===
In Sweden students start receiving grades from year 6 with proposals of changing it to year 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2016/11/prop.-20161746/|title=En försöksverksamhet med betyg från och med årskurs 4|date=10 November 2016|website=Regeringskansliet|language=sv|access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref> Before grade 6 students receive an Individual Development Plan (''Individuell Utvecklingsplan (IUP)'') containing the teachers assessment of the students knowledge.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/grundskolan/iup-med-omdomen-i-grundskolan|title=IUP med omdömen i grundskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref> Students have regular development talks with their teachers discussing how to improve based on their IUP and grades.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":5" />

The grading system in compulsory school uses the grades A, B, C, D, and E as passing grades and F as failing.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/grundskolan/betyg-i-grundskolan/satta-betyg-i-grundskolan|title=Sätta betyg i grundskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=27 February 2019}}</ref> B and D work as filling grades, for when a student hasn't reached all objectives for C or A but has reached most of them. If the student can't be graded, e.g. extensive truancy, the student will receive a dash instead of an F. A dash is not considered a grade.<ref name=":14" /> If a student is on the verge of receiving an F in a certain subject/course, the teacher responsible for that subject will notify the student and the student's parents. If a student is given an F, they will receive a written review of how to improve themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/regler-och-ansvar/ansvar-i-skolfragor/extra-anpassningar-och-sarskilt-stod-i-skolan|title=Extra anpassningar och särskilt stöd i skolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=27 February 2019}}</ref>

The pupil's total score, which is used for application to upper secondary schools, is calculated by taking the pupil's subject grades and numerically adding them together, with the following letter to number conversion: E = 10, D = 12.5, C = 15, B = 17.5, and A = 20.<ref name=":14" /> This yields a maximum possible score of 340 for students taking 17 subjects. Pupils can have either 16 or 17 grades depending on if they take an additional language course on top of the 16 compulsory subjects. Pupils who don't study any foreign language or instead study extra Swedish or English will only have 16 grades and cannot receive a score higher than 320.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.utbildningsinfo.se/grundskola/sprakval-och-meritpoang-1.1224|title=Meritpoäng|website=Utbildningsinfo|publisher=Skolverket|language=sv|access-date=27 February 2019}}</ref>

The sixteen subjects used to calculate the total must include the three core subjects – English, Swedish, and Mathematics. If the pupil fails any of the core subjects, she or he lacks qualification to attend secondary school. However, the student can still attend the secondary school introduction program (''introduktionsprogram''), either to gain competence in the core subjects and start a secondary school programme or gain skills to enter employment.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=http://www.omsvenskaskolan.se/engelska/gymnasieskolan/introduktionsprogram-i-gymnasieskolan/|title=Introductory programmes in upper secondary school {{!}} Skolverket nyanlända|website=www.omsvenskaskolan.se|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>

=== National tests ===
In grades 3, 6 and 9 national tests are administered to all students in the Swedish grundskola. The primary aim of these tests are to ensure all students are assessed equivalently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/grundskolan/nationella-prov-i-grundskolan|title=Nationella prov i grundskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref> The test results should be given special consideration by teachers when setting the students final grade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/grundskolan/nationella-prov-i-grundskolan/genomfora-och-bedoma-prov-i-grundskolan#h-Provresultatetsbetydelseforbetyget|title=Genomföra och bedöma prov i grundskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref>

In grade 3 the tests are framed around a story involving two children encountering Math and Swedish in everyday situations to make the test situation less intimidating. Only Swedish and Math has national tests in year 3.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/grundskolan/nationella-prov-i-grundskolan/provdatum-i-grundskolan#h-Nationellaproviarskurs3|title=Provdatum i grundskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref> The results from the tests are not used for grading, as students do not receive grades before year 6.<ref name=":6" />

In grade 6 and 9 there are tests for all three core subjects Swedish, Math and English. These tests consist of both oral and written components. In grade 9 one science subject (Physics, Biology or Chemistry) and one social science subject (Civics, Religion, Geography or History) are tested as well.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/download/18.49f081e1610d887500ae7/1516722654388/information-np-ak9-engelska.pdf|title=National tests|website=Skolverket|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref>

Skolverket also provide tests similar to the national tests for the purpose of assisting teachers with assessing students. These are sometimes confused for national tests however these tests are not mandatory and available for a greater variety of year levels and subjects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/grundskolan/bedomning-i-grundskolan/bedomningsstod-i-amnen-i-grundskolan|title=Bedömningsstöd i ämnen i grundskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref>

The tests and mark schemes have several times been spread on the internet before the test date resulting in wide spread cheating. In these cases substitute tests are to be used, however these tests have been accused for not giving results consistent with the non substitute tests by the [[Swedish Teachers' Union]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lararnastidning.se/halften-av-de-nationella-proven-i-matte-ett-ersattningsprov/|title=Hälften av de nationella proven i matte ett ersättningsprov|website=lararnastidning.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> and can not be used in [[Statistics Sweden]]'s reports.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/7CA437FD-3B94-4F77-8EDD-CA524AF8D48F|title=Otillåten spridning av nationella prov – vad gör Skolverket och Skolinspektionen?|publisher=Riksrevisionen|year=2018|isbn=978-91-7086-505-3|location=Stockholm|pages=6|language=sv}}</ref> The [[Swedish National Audit Office]] published a report regarding "The unauthorised dissemination of national tests" in 2018. The audit found the  Swedish National Agency for Education's new guidelines for handling the national tests satisfactory, but implemented too late. The report recommended the Swedish School Inspectorate to monitor individual schools compliance with these new guidelines.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.riksrevisionen.se/download/18.136bf37816851814989ed208/1548416382169/Summary_RiR_2018_34.pdf|title=Otillåten spridning av nationella prov – vad gör Skolverket och Skolinspektionen?|publisher=Riksrevisionen|year=2018|isbn=978-91-7086-505-3|location=Stockholm|pages=5–7|language=sv}}</ref>

=== Violence guidelines ===
In 2014, the [[National Agency for Education (Sweden)|National Agency for Education]] published guidelines to staff on how to act during incidents of armed violence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.gotland.se/89507|title=Väpnat våld i skolan hur skolor kan agera om det händer.|date=2014|publisher=Skolverket|isbn=9789175590820|location=Stockholm|oclc=941398864}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=159&artikel=6783732|title=Lärare utbildas i att bemöta väpnat våld i skolan|date=22 September 2017|work=Sveriges radio|access-date=19 March 2019|language=sv}}</ref> In the 2012–2017 period, the number of reports of physical violence in schools increased 129% and reports of threats increased with 46% in the same period according to the [[Swedish Work Environment Authority]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/snabbkollen/anmalningar-om-vald-i-skolor-okar-kraftigt|title=Anmälningar om våld i skolor ökar kraftigt|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|date=29 September 2018|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=6 October 2018|language=sv}}</ref> The latter reports include all reported physical violence and threats, not only armed violence.

=== Other types of primary education ===
There are various types of primary education including the Sami-schools, with special accommodations for the indigenous [[Sámi people]],<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/sameskolan|title=Sameskolan - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref> special needs schools for students with intellectual disabilities,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.omsvenskaskolan.se/engelska/grundsaerskolan/|title=Special needs comprehensive school {{!}} Skolverket nyanlända|website=www.omsvenskaskolan.se|access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref> and special schools for students with other disabilities such as deafness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.omsvenskaskolan.se/svenska/grundskolan-och-fritidshem/vad-aer-specialskola/|title=Vad är specialskola? {{!}} Skolverket nyanlända|website=www.omsvenskaskolan.se|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>

There is also [[komvux]], adult education at primary or secondary level, and introductory programmes for students who failed compulsory education.<ref name=":15" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/skolutveckling/anordna-och-administrera-utbildning/administrera-utbildning/registrera-och-utforma-betyg#h-Betygsdokumentikommunalvuxenutbildningpagrundlaggandeniva|title=Registrera och utforma betyg - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref> Homeschooling is only permitted for students who for some reason, usually severe sickness, can't participate in normal classroom education.

==Upper Secondary education==
Upper Secondary school, called ''[[gymnasieskola]]'', usually lasts for three years. It's elective, but with a 99% enrollment rate (OECD 2018).<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/data/education-database/enrolment-by-age_71c07338-en|title=Enrolment by age|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|doi=10.1787/71c07338-en|access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref> It is divided into 18 different national programmes with different educational focus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/gymnasieskolan/laroplan-program-och-amnen-i-gymnasieskolan/gymnasieprogrammen|title=Gymnasieprogrammen - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=27 February 2019}}</ref> The system is course based with the same courses being used for multiple programmes. There are also introductory programmes for students who don't satisfy the requirements for the national programmes. A significant number of these students are immigrants learning Swedish.<ref name=":15" /><ref name=":8" />

=== National programmes ===
The national programmes are divided into two categories: preparatory and vocational. All national programmes give basic qualification to attend university,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antagning.se/sv/Det-har-galler-for-dig-som-gatt/Gymnasieskolan/Slutbetyg-2010-och-framat/|title=Slutbetyg 2010 och framåt - Antagning.se|website=www.antagning.se|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref> but preparatory programs typically also satisfy the additional requirements needed to study university courses in specific subject areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antagning.se/globalassets/regelverk-och-anmalningskatalog/omradesbehorigheter-for-gy11--vux12-ny4.pdf|title=Områdesbehörigheter för Gy11 och Vux12|website=www.antagning.se|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref>

In 2018 approximately one third of students studying a national programme were studying a vocational programme while two thirds were studying a preparatory programme.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://siris.skolverket.se/reports/rwservlet?cmdkey=common&geo=1&report=gy_elever&p_ar=2017&p_lankod=&p_kommunkod=&p_skolkod=&p_hmantyp=&p_hmankod=&p_flik=G&p_sub=1|title=Gymnasieskolan - Elevstatistik|website=siris.skolverket.se|access-date=7 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Courses ===
All students take at least 2500 points worth of courses. Some of these courses are universal for students in all programmes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/sitevision/proxy/undervisning/gymnasieskolan/laroplan-program-och-amnen-i-gymnasieskolan/gymnasieprogrammen/program/svid12_5dfee44715d35a5cdfa9295/1530314731/syllabuscw/jsp/program.pdf?programCode=BF001&date=20190307&version=8|title=Barn- och fritidsprogrammet programstruktur|website=www.skolverket.se}}</ref> These courses are the first course in each of the following subjects: English, Swedish, Mathematics, Religion, Civics, Natural Science and Physical Education. In preparatory programmes additional English, Swedish and Mathematics is also included as core courses.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/sitevision/proxy/undervisning/gymnasieskolan/laroplan-program-och-amnen-i-gymnasieskolan/gymnasieprogrammen/program/svid12_5dfee44715d35a5cdfa9295/1530314731/syllabuscw/jsp/program.pdf?programCode=NA001&date=20190307&version=6|title=Naturvetenskapsprogrammet programstruktur|website=www.skolverket.se|publisher=Skolverket}}</ref>

There are also programme specific and orientation specific courses. Orientation specific courses are the courses that a student elects to take by selecting an orientation inside of their programme. Finally, individually selected courses are courses that the student freely selects for herself/himself.<ref name=":9" />

=== Diploma project ===
In all programs in the upper secondary school, all students are required to do a diploma project. The diploma project is a project where the students are required to plan, execute and reflect on a bigger project related to something they have been studying. This project have two grading options, which is receiving an E (pass) or F (fail). The diploma project is not included in the students merit value that is used towards further education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/gymnasieskolan/laroplan-program-och-amnen-i-gymnasieskolan/gymnasiearbetet|title=Gymnasiearbetet - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Eligibility ===
To be eligible for upper secondary education the pupil need to pass 8 out of 16 subjects for the vocational programmes and 12 out of 16 for preparatory programmes. The pupil also need to pass the three core subjects Math, Swedish and English.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://siris.skolverket.se/reports/rwservlet?cmdkey=common&geo=1&report=gr_betyg_beh&p_sub=1&p_ar=2018&p_lankod=&p_kommunkod=&p_skolkod=&p_hmantyp=&p_hmankod=&p_flik=G&p_kon=A|title=Behörighet till gymnasieskolan|website=siris.skolverket.se|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>

In 2018, 15.6% of pupils who left compulsory education did not qualify to proceed to upper secondary education.<ref name=":11" /> This is a significant increase from 2011, the first year with the current syllabus, where 12.3% of pupils did not qualify.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://siris.skolverket.se/reports/rwservlet?cmdkey=common&geo=1&report=gr_betyg_beh&p_sub=1&p_ar=2011&p_lankod=&p_kommunkod=&p_skolkod=&p_hmantyp=&p_hmankod=&p_flik=G&p_kon=A|title=Behörighet till gymnasieskolan|website=siris.skolverket.se|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> The group not mastering compulsory education are predominantly boys and [[Immigration to Sweden|pupils with foreign origin]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fof.se/tidning/2018/2/artikel/laget-ar-javligt-allvarligt|title=Läget är jävligt allvarligt|date=8 February 2018|work=Forskning & Framsteg|access-date=23 August 2018|language=sv}}</ref>

Pupils who did not qualify for upper secondary education can still proceed to an introductory programme (''Introduktionsprogram'') which help students gain eligibility for the national programmes.<ref name=":15" />

===Admittance===
The prospective student applies to attend a certain program at a certain school, competing for entrance based upon his/her elementary school grades. In a few cases, such as the arts program (''Estetiska programmet'') at certain schools, the student applies for both the program and the orientation. Some programmes, generally the arts programmes and certain more specialized programmes/orientations, have some form of entrance exam in addition to the elementary school grades.<ref>{{cite act|type=|index=|date=22 December 2010|article=Kap 7|article-type=|legislature=|title=Gymnasieförordning (2010:2039)|trans-title=Secondary Education Act|page=|url=https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/gymnasieforordning-20102039_sfs-2010-2039|language=Swedish}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/skolutveckling/anordna-och-administrera-utbildning/anordna-utbildning-pa-gymnasieniva/forsoksverksamhet-med-spetsutbildning-i-gymnasiet|title=Försöksverksamhet med spetsutbildning i gymnasiet - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=11 March 2019}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Introductory programmes ===
For students who did not qualify for the national programmes, most often by failing Swedish, English or Math. There are different types of introductory programmes the most common of which being language introduction for immigrants learning Swedish and individual alternative, a highly individualized programme intended to help students who did not satisfy the eligibility requirements for the national programmes to gain eligibility for them.<ref name=":15" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/undervisning/gymnasieskolan/laroplan-program-och-amnen-i-gymnasieskolan/gymnasieprogrammen/introduktionsprogram|title=Introduktionsprogram - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>

==Higher education==
{{See also|List of universities in Sweden}}
After upper secondary school, students can apply to university in order to receive [[tertiary education]]. General [[academic degree]]s are offered by public [[universities]] and [[university college]]s that tend to attract students on a regional basis. Besides general academic degrees, the higher education system also provides a number of professional degrees at a bachelor's or master's level in fields such as engineering, law and medicine. Independently from the Bologna Process-compatible university system there is a system of higher vocational education where subject areas such as, Business Finance and Administration, IT, and Hospitality and Tourism are being taught.
<!--A University Diploma can be awarded after two years of study, and a [[Bachelor's degree]], after three years at a university or university college. It is possible to specialize further by obtaining a [[Master's degree]] which requires an additional year at a university, however once at least a Bachelor's degree has been obtained the student is qualified for postgraduate education.

Besides the general academic degrees described the system of higher education in Sweden also provides a number of [[professional degree|professional]] and [[vocational education|vocational]] degrees awarded by establishments on the outside of, and on occasion by separate schools within, the public university system. These degrees are in fields such as engineering, law and medicine. Even if these have a more extensive curriculum and require a longer time to complete than a Master's degree, it is generally not possible to receive any intermediate degree prior to completion. Having completed the preparatory secondary school with a specialization in natural sciences is typically a prerequisite before being able to apply to an establishment that awards one of the higher professional degrees in the natural science or technical fields.-->

=== Types of degrees ===
Swedish degrees are incorporated in the [[Bologna Process]], the European higher education framework.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/higher-education/bologna-process-and-european-higher-education-area_en|title=The Bologna Process and the European Higher Education Area|last=BONJEAN|first=Dominique|date=21 September 2018|website=Education and Training - European Commission|language=en|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref> In this system degrees are divided into three cycles, corresponding to bachelor's level, master's level and doctoral level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/Documents/QF-EHEA-May2005.pdf|title=The framework of qualifications for the European Higher Education Area|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923234414/http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/Documents/QF-EHEA-May2005.pdf|archive-date=23 September 2015|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref> In Sweden, there are two general qualifications for each cycle of different lengths and various professional degrees and various professional degrees at bachelor's or master's level.<ref name=":2" />

===Grading===
{{See also|Academic grading in Sweden|Bologna process#Sweden}}
The grading system used vary between different universities and university colleges. There are currently five different systems in use all of which are [[Criterion-referenced grading|criteria-referenced]]. The three most common systems are the seven-grade scale (A–F, Fx), the three-grade scale VG, G, U which is very similar to the pre-2011 compulsory and upper secondary grade system and the pass or fail system G/U.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.suhf.se/MediaBinaryLoader.axd?MediaArchive_FileID=10db169a-ccea-483f-a1d3-bf868cb8f1ce&FileName=Betyg+i+h%C3%B6gre+ubildning.pdf|title=Betyg i högre utbildning|date=23 February 2016|website=www.suhf.se|publisher=Sveriges universitets-och högskoleförbund|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref> The grades from all systems can be converted to the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS) for grade comparison with other universities across Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.su.se/utbildning/examen/betygssystem-betygsf%C3%B6rdelning|title=Betygssystem & betygsfördelning - Stockholms universitet|website=www.su.se|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref>

===Language requirements===
Before being accepted to a higher education programme in Sweden, all applicants must demonstrate a minimum proficiency in Swedish and English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/All-you-need-to-know1/Applying-for-studies/Entry-requirements/Bachelors-level-requirements/|title=Bachelor's level requirements - Universityadmissions.se|website=www.universityadmissions.se|publisher=[[Swedish Council for Higher Education]]|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> For international applicants, the [[Test in Swedish for University Studies]] is used to test Swedish language proficiency and [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] or the Cambridge [[First Certificate in English]] exam may be used for English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antagning.se/sv/Hur-du-anmaler-dig-och-haller-koll/magister-och-master/sprakkrav-for-utbildningar-som-ges-pa-svenska/|title=Språkkrav för utbildningar som ges på svenska - Antagning.se|website=antagning.se|publisher=[[Swedish Council for Higher Education]]|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/All-you-need-to-know1/Applying-for-studies/English-requirements/|title=English language requirements - Universityadmissions.se|website=www.universityadmissions.se|publisher=[[Swedish Council for Higher Education]]|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

=== SweSAT ===
The [[Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test]] (''Högskoleprovet'') is a [[standardised test]] used as one of the means to gain admission to higher education in Sweden. The test itself is divided into a mathematical part and a verbal part, which both contain 4 subdivisions, in total 160 multiple-choice questions. Apart from the English language reading comprehension test, all sections are taken in Swedish. To gain admittance to courses or programmes using the SweSAT students need to independently fulfill the eligibility requirements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studera.nu/startpage/road-to-studies/hogskoleprovet---swedish-scholastic-aptitude-test/what-is-the-hogskoleprovet/|title=What is the Högskoleprovet?|website=www.studera.nu|language=en|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref>

===Student aid===
Swedish students receives help from the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|National Board of Student Aid]] (CSN) while studying. CSN is a Swedish Government authority that is sending out financial aid for studies. This includes loans and grants for students that is studying in Sweden or abroad in another country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.government.se/government-policy/education-and-research/the-swedish-financial-aid-system-for-studies/|title=Financial aid for studies|date=22 April 2015|website=Regeringskansliet|language=sv-se|access-date=25 October 2018}}</ref>

As of autumn semester 2011, higher education is free of charge only for Swedish, EU/EEA, and Swiss citizens.<ref>

===Anti discrimination work===
All universities are required to have guidelines how to handle cases of discrimination. They are also required to work together with the [[Equality Ombudsman]] to ensure admission, tuition and examinations are fair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.do.se/framja-och-atgarda/hogskolans-ansvar/|title=Högskolans aktiva åtgärder - Diskrimineringsombudsmannen|website=www.do.se|language=sv|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Higher vocational education ===
Post-secondary vocational education usually consist of many 1–2 year long subject specific programmes consisting of roughly three quarters theoretical and one quarter workplace experience. Higher vocational schools cooperate with various employers to improve employment prospects of the students. The system is independent from the other types of higher education in that it is not Bologna compatible, does not award a bachelor's or master's degree (while professional degrees do) and is not thought by universities or university colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studera.nu/startpage/road-to-studies/other-ways-of-studying/higher-vocational-education/|title=Higher vocational education|website=www.studera.nu|language=en|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yrkeshogskolan.se/|title=Yrkeshögskolan - How does it work?|website=Yrkeshögskolan|language=sv|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yrkeshogskolan.se/|title=Higher Vocational Education (HVE)|website=Yrkeshögskolan|language=sv|access-date=7 April 2019}}</ref>

==Independent schools==
Prior to the 1990s, there were only a handful of [[private school]]s in Sweden, mostly tuition-funded [[boarding school]]s, whereof [[Sigtunaskolan Humanistiska Läroverket|Sigtunaskolan]] and [[Lundsbergs skola]] are the most well known. A major education reform in 1992 allowed privately run schools offering primary or secondary education to receive public funding for each student, at a level similar to what public schools receive. These are called "independent schools" (''friskolor''), and in 2008 there were around 900 of them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/politics_show/7471335.stm|title=independent schools|last=Buonadonna|first=Paola|date=26 June 2008|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]|author-link=Paola Buonadonna}}</ref>

The "independent schools", similar to [[charter school]]s in the United States or [[Academy (English school)|academies]] in the United Kingdom, are funded with public money (''skolpeng'') from the local municipality, based on the number of pupils they have enrolled, in the same way Swedish public schools are. Consequently, they are not allowed to discriminate or require admission examinations, nor are they allowed to charge the students any additional fees. They are, however, allowed to accept private donations. Regional economic differences directly affect how much money each municipality can provide per pupil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skl.se/skolakulturfritid/forskolagrundochgymnasieskola/vagledningsvarpavanligafragor/samycketkostarskolan.2785.html|title=Så mycket kostar skolan|website=skl.se|language=sv|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

Anyone can start an independent [[for-profit school]], or a chain of such schools, in Sweden. Many of them offer an alternate pedagogy (such as [[Montessori]]), or a foreign/international, religious or special needs (such as hearing-impaired) profile. There are also several secondary schools with an elite sports profile. [[Internationella Engelska Skolan]] and [[Kunskapsskolan]] are the two largest "independent school" chains. In 2008, more than 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled independent schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/publikationer?id=3356|title=Private actors in preschools and schools|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="economist" />

===Opinions===
The independent school system has divided public opinion in Sweden, especially regarding religious schools and for-profit schools. During the [[2018 Swedish general election|2018 election]] several parties, including the Moderate party<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://moderaterna.se/friskolor-vinster-och-det-fria-skolvalet|title=Friskolor, vinster och det fria skolvalet {{!}} Nya Moderaterna|website=moderaterna.se|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> and Socialdemocratic party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialdemokraterna.se/var-politik/a-till-o/friskolor/|title=Friskolor|website=Socialdemokraterna|language=sv|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> suggested some kind of limit to profits, while the [[Liberals (Sweden)|Liberals]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liberalerna.se/politik/friskolor/|title=Friskolor|website=Liberalerna|language=sv-SE|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> and [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre party]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.centerpartiet.se/lokal/blekinge/ronneby/startsida/nyheter/nyheter/2018-02-04-vinstforbud---en-kapp-i-hjulet-for-friskolor|title=Vinstförbud - en käpp i hjulet för friskolor|website=www.centerpartiet.se|language=sv|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> opposed such a limit. A ban on religious independent schools has also been suggested with support from the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left party]] and Socialdemocratic party, while the Moderates, Green party, Christiandemocrats and Centre party are satisfied with the current system banning religious elements in the classroom, but allowing it during breaks or before lessons start.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/religiosa-friskolor-blir-slagtra-i-valdebatten-1|title=Analys: Religiösa friskolor blir slagträ i valdebatten|last=Knutson|first=Mats|date=13 March 2018|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref>

The Swedish model has been put forward as a possible model for similar solutions in both the United Kingdom<ref name="economist" /><ref name="spectator.co.uk" /> and the United States, where [[Per Unckel]], County Governor of Stockholm and former Conservative Minister of Education, in 2009 summarized the advantages of the Swedish system in an opinion piece produced by the [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[think tank]] [[Pacific Research Institute]]: "Education is so important that you can’t just leave it to one producer. Because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes".<ref name="Op-Ed New York Times" />

In February 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published an article by a former political advisor to the Swedish Ministry of Education, Karin Svanborg-Sjövall, on the independent school system: "Sweden proves that private profit improves services and influences policy. Even education unions came on board when private provision was introduced into Swedish schools",<ref name="guardian.co.uk" /> citing the paper on average educational performance made by research institute under the Swedish Ministry of Employment, IFAU, which found "that an increase in the share of independent-school students improves average performance at the end of compulsory school as well as long-run educational outcomes".<ref name="ifau.se" /> However, in June 2015, another article by the education correspondent from ''The Guardian'' quoted then Education Minister, Gustav Fridolin, as saying that the system was "a political failure" and stated that standards in learning had dropped dramatically over the years and were in a state of "crisis".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/sweden-schools-crisis-political-failure-education|title='It's a political failure': how Sweden's celebrated schools system fell into crisis|last=correspondent|first=Sally Weale Education|date=10 June 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 February 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==PISA and PIRLS results==
Swedish results in the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] were in 2015 close to the [[OECD]] average. The Swedish scores were declining between 2006 and 2012, which was  heavily reported and adopted as an important talking point for many political parties, including the [[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]] and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialdemokraterna.se/aktuellt/nyhetsarkiv/pisa-2015---larare-och-elever-lyfter-svensk-skola/|title=PISA 2015 - Lärare och elever lyfter svensk skola|website=Socialdemokraterna|language=sv|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=https://moderaterna.se/alliansen-skolreformer-att-sverige-ska-vara-bland-de-tio-basta-i-kunskapsmatningen-pisa|title=Alliansen: Skolreformer för att Sverige ska vara bland de tio bästa i kunskapsmätningen Pisa. {{!}} Nya Moderaterna|website=moderaterna.se|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.svd.se/pisa-studien-sveriges-skola-samst-i-norden|title=Pisa-studien: Sveriges skola sämst i Norden|date=3 December 2013|work=Svenska Dagbladet|access-date=13 March 2019|language=sv|issn=1101-2412}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sverige-samst-i-klassen/|title=Sverige sämst i klassen|last=Carp|first=Ossi|date=3 December 2013|work=Dagens Nyheter|access-date=17 April 2019|language=sv}}</ref>

In the 2015 PISA report, the Swedish scores increased for the first time since the programme started in 2006. Both the [[Moderate Party]] and the Social Democratic Party have suggested actions to improve education and increase PISA scores in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skolverket.se/skolutveckling/forskning-och-utvarderingar/internationella-jamforande-studier-pa-utbildningsomradet/pisa-internationell-studie-om-15-aringars-kunskaper-i-matematik-naturvetenskap-och-lasforstaelse#h-SverigesnegativatrendbruteniPISA|title=PISA: internationell studie om 15-åringars kunskaper i matematik, naturvetenskap och läsförståelse - Skolverket|website=www.skolverket.se|language=sv|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=":13" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialdemokraterna.se/aktuellt/nyhetsarkiv/pisa-2015---larare-och-elever-lyfter-svensk-skola/|title=PISA 2015 - Lärare och elever lyfter svensk skola|website=Socialdemokraterna|language=sv|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>

Sweden’s performance in the international fourth-grade reading assessments ([[PIRLS]]) dropped by 19 points from 2001 (561) to 2011 (542) and recovered by 13 points in 2016 (555). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/trends-in-reading-achievement/|title=PIRLS Trends}}</ref>

The influx of immigrants to Swedish schools has been reported as a major contributor to why Sweden's score dropped more than any other European country by a National Agency of Education report.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/immigrant-children-in-sweden-blamed-for-countrys-poor-test-scores-a6934111.html|title=Immigrant children in Sweden blamed for country's poor test scores|last=Staufenberg|first=Jess|date=16 March 2016|work=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ten years after the pre-school reform : a national evaluation of the Swedish pre-school|last=Sverige.
