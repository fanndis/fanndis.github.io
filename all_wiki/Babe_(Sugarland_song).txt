"'''Babe'''" is a song recorded by American [[country music]] duo [[Sugarland]], featuring guest vocals from American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released by [[Big Machine Records]] on April 20, 2018, as the second single from Sugarland's sixth studio album, ''[[Bigger (album)|Bigger]]'' (2018). The song was originally written by Swift and [[Patrick Monahan]] of the American band [[Train (band)|Train]], for Swift's fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012); however, it did not make the final track-list. "Babe" is a [[midtempo]] [[Country music|country]] [[ballad]] and [[breakup song]]. It peaked at number 2 on the [[Digital Songs|''Billboard'' Digital Songs]] chart, number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]], and at number 72 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

==Background==
[[File:191125 Taylor Swift at the 2019 American Music Awards.png|thumb|150px|[[Taylor Swift]] co-wrote "Babe" with [[Train (band)|Train]]'s [[Patrick Monahan]], for her 2012 album [[Red (Taylor Swift album)|''Red'']]. However, it did not make the final track list.|alt=]]

[[Patrick Monahan]], the founding member of rock band [[Train (band)|Train]], first spoke about the song during a 2013 interview with [[ABC News Radio]]. He said that when he asked Swift about collaborating on a song for Train's next album, she asked him to co-write a song for her album ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012). Ultimately, the song was not included on the album, but when Swift decided to put out a deluxe version of ''Red'', Monahan thought it would finally be released.<ref>{{cite news|title=Train's Pat Monahan on Writing with Taylor Swift: "Her Perspective Is Very Fresh"|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2013/10/15/trains-pat-monahan-on-writing-with-taylor-swift-her-perspect.html|accessdate=April 24, 2018|work=ABC News Radio|date=October 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Chelsea|title=Taylor Swift Wrote and Is Featured on Sugarland's Newest Song "Babe"|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-sugarland-babe|accessdate=April 24, 2018|work=Teen Vogue|date=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chiu|first=Melody|title=Sugarland and Taylor Swift Release Breakup Song 'Babe' — Find Out the Story Behind the Track|url=http://people.com/country/sugarland-taylor-swift-babe-collaboration/|work=People|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref> The song was not previously recorded.<ref>{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Cindy|title=Taylor Swift, Sugarland team for country duet 'Babe'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/04/20/taylor-swift-sugarland-team-country-duet-babe/535334002/|accessdate=April 24, 2018|work=USA Today|date=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Cindy|title=Sugarland, Taylor Swift team for country duet 'Babe'|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/12/sugarland-taylor-swift-team-country-duet-babe/513355002/|accessdate=April 18, 2018|work=The Tennessean|date=April 12, 2018}}</ref>
