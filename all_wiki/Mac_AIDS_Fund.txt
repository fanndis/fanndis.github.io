==History==
[[File:Mac Cosmetics Creator Frank Angelo Was First Manager Of Michael Laucke.jpg|thumb|MAC Cosmetics and MAC AIDS Fund Creator Frank Angelo]]
The M∙A∙C AIDS Fund was established in Toronto in 1994 by Frank Angelo and Frank Toskan. In 1985 they had co-founded [[MAC Cosmetics]], initially a manufacturer of make-up for models and professional make-up artists. The fund's income came primarily from the sales of its VIVA Glam product line and the sales of greeting cards designed by children with AIDS.

Among the other organizations with whom the fund partners is the [[United Nations Foundation]].<ref>[[United Nations Foundation]]. [http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/partners/organizations/mac-aids-fund.html Partner organizations: MAC AIDS Fund]. Retrieved 7 November 2015.</ref>

In 1994, Angelo and Toskan sold 51 percent of their business to [[Estée Lauder Companies]] who then completed their acquisition of the company in 1998. In its board meeting of April 2004, the Mac AIDS Fund directors comprised Ian Ness, Charles Richards, Frank Doyle, [[Michael Laucke]], Bruce Hunter and John Demsey served as Chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/MAC_Board_Minutes.jpg|title=Members of The Mac AIDS Fund board meeting of April 2004|publisher=}}</ref> As of 2015, John Demsey, the Group President of Estee Lauder Companies, serves as Chairman of the Mac AIDS Fund's Board of Directors.<ref name = "Shea">Shea, Courtney (2 November 2014).

==VIVA Glam==
The M∙A∙C AIDS Fund is supported exclusively by the sales of the MAC Cosmetics VIVA Glam line which features lipsticks and lip glosses.

===Media campaigns===

On World AIDS Day in November 2002, a showing of the film ''Pandemic: Facing AIDS'' by [[Rory Kennedy]] (sponsored in part by MAC cosmetics) took place at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Moxie Firecracker Films|url = http://www.moxiefirecracker.com/film-detail.php?id=85|website = www.moxiefirecracker.com|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Michael Laucke in Interview (GuitarFest in St Trinity Church)|last = Farley|first = Alan|date = 21 October 2004|work = [[KALW]] Radio (Berkeley, California) |via = |quote = So, for this film with Rory Kennedy (Pandemic:FACING aids), since we (MAF) give away 3 to 4 million a year, we couldn't afford to finance the whole film. So we contacted the Gates foundation and the financing came through, based on Rory's credibility.  ...we lost title sponsorship. It (a showing) took place at the United Nations in that room with the name tags of each country on the seats. ...and later that month all of us (all the directors) were convened at the United Nations again to receive an award from Kofi Anan. ...Danny Glover was there, Elton (John) wasn't... It was amazingly successful, but of course so sad. Of the 5 countries portrayed in the film, only the wealthier countries did ok, and people survived.}}</ref>
