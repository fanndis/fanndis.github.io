A '''concept album''' is an [[album]] whose [[music track|track]]s hold a larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually.{{sfn|Cullen|2001|p=98}}{{sfn|Elicker|2001|pp=227–229}} This is typically achieved through a single central [[narrative]] or theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, or lyrical.{{sfn|Shuker|2012|p=5}} Sometimes the term is applied to albums considered to be of "uniform excellence" rather than an LP with an explicit musical or lyrical motif.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=49}} There is no consensus among [[music criticism|music critics]] as to the specific criteria for what a "concept album" is.{{sfn|Elicker|2001|pp=227–229}}<ref name="independent"/>

The format originates with [[folk music|folk]] singer [[Woody Guthrie]]'s ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'' (1940) and was subsequently popularized by [[traditional pop]] singer [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1940s–50s string of albums, although the term is more often associated with [[rock music]]. In the 1960s several well-regarded concept albums were released by various rock bands, which eventually led to the invention of [[progressive rock]] and [[rock opera]]. Since then, [[list of concept albums|many concept albums have been released across numerous musical genres]].

==Definitions==
There is no clear definition of what constitutes a "concept album".<ref name="independent"/>{{sfn|Elicker|2001|p=227}} Fiona Sturges of ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that the concept album "was originally defined as a long-player where the songs were based on one dramatic idea – but the term is subjective."<ref name="independent">{{ cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-return-of-concept-album-1796064.html | title=The return of concept album | first=Fiona | last=Sturges | work=[[The Independent]] | date=1 October 2009 | accessdate=25 April 2016 }}</ref> A precursor to this type of album can be found in the 19th century [[song cycle]]<ref name="PMperf">{{cite web|last1=Cucchiara|first1=Romina|title=The Concept Album As a Performative Genre|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/186925-the-concept-album-as-a-performative-genre/|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=10 November 2014}}</ref> which ran into similar difficulties in classification.{{sfn|Elicker|2001|p=228}} The extremely broad definitions of a "concept album" could potentially encompass all [[soundtrack albums|soundtracks]], [[compilation albums|compilations]], [[cast recording]]s, [[greatest hits album]]s, [[tribute album]]s, [[Christmas album]]s, and [[live album]]s.{{sfn|Elicker|2001|p=228}}

The most common definitions refer to an expanded approach to a rock album (as a story, play, or opus), or a project that either revolves around a specific theme or a collection of related materials.{{sfn|Elicker|2001|p=228}} [[AllMusic]] writes, "A concept album could be a collection of songs by an individual songwriter or a particular theme – these are the concept LPs that reigned in the '50s ... the phrase 'concept album' is inextricably tied to the late 1960s, when [[rock and roll|rock & rollers]] began stretching the limits of their art form."<ref name="AllMusic/Concept albums">{{cite web |author=AllMusic staff| url=https://www.allmusic.com/blog/post/allmusic-loves-concept-albums | title= AllMusic Loves Concept Albums | website=[[AllMusic]] | date=10 February 2014 | accessdate=25 April 2016 }}</ref> Author Jim Cullen describes it as "a collection of discrete but thematically unified songs whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts ... sometimes [erroneously] assumed to be a product of the rock era."{{sfn|Cullen|2001|p=98}} Author Roy Shuker defines concept albums and [[rock operas]] as albums that are "unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical. ...  In this form, the album changed from a collection of heterogeneous songs into a narrative work with a single theme, in which individual songs segue into one another."{{sfn|Shuker|2012|p=5}}

Speaking of concepts in albums during the 1970s, [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), because "overall impression" of an album matters, "concept intensifies the impact" of certain albums "in more or less the way ''[[Sgt. Pepper]]'' intended", as well as "a species of concept that pushes a rhythmically unrelenting album like ''[[The Wild Magnolias]]'' or a vocally irresistible one like [[Shirley Brown]]'s ''Woman to Woman'', to a deeper level of significance."<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0899190251|chapter=The Criteria|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/criteria.php|via=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>

Themes included exploring wild life and dealing with emotions, with some albums meant to be played while dining or relaxing. This was accompanied in the mid 1950s with the invention of the [[gatefold]], which allowed room for [[liner notes]] to explain the concept.{{sfn|McKnight-Trontz|1999|p=10}}

[[File:Frank Sinatra Metronome magazine November 1950.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Frank Sinatra]], 1950]]

Singer [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded several concept albums prior to the 1960s rock era, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955) and ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Cullen|2001|p=98}} Sinatra is occasionally credited as the inventor of the concept album,{{sfn|Rojek|2004}} beginning with ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'' (1946), which led to similar work by [[Bing Crosby]]. According to biographer Will Friedwald, Sinatra "sequenced the songs so that the lyrics created a flow from track to track, affording an impression of a narrative, as in [[musical comedy]] or [[opera]]. ... [He was the] first pop singer to bring a consciously artistic attitude to recording."{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|}}{{refn|group=nb|In the late 1940s, [[Boogie-Woogie]] and [[Stride (music)|Stride]] pianist [[Pete Johnson]] recorded an early concept album, ''House Rent Party'' (1946), in which he starts out playing alone, supposedly in a new empty house, and is joined there by other players. Each has a solo single backed by Johnson, and then the whole group plays a jam session together.<ref>Silvester, Peter, A Left Hand Like God, A Study of Boogie-Woogie, pp. 98-99</ref>}}

Singer/pianist [[Nat "King" Cole]] (who, along with Sinatra, often collaborated with arranger [[Nelson Riddle]] during this era) was also an early pioneer of concept albums,<ref>"Cole developed the art of the concept album, a song collection consciously built on a single theme..."

===1960s: Rock and country music===
[[File:The Beatles magical mystery tour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Beatles]], 1967]]

In the early 1960s, concept albums began featuring highly in American [[country music]], however the fact went largely unacknowledged by rock/pop fans and critics who would only begin noting "concept albums" as a phenomenon later in the decade,{{sfn|Elicker|2001|p=234}} when albums became closely aligned with countercultural ideology, resulting in a recognised "[[album era]]" and the introduction of the rock concept album.{{sfn|Danesi|2017|p=15}} The author Carys Wyn Jones writes that [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967), and [[the Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' (1969) are variously cited as "the first concept album", usually for their "uniform excellence rather than some lyrical theme or underlying musical motif".{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=44}}

Other records have been claimed as "early" or "first" concept albums. ''The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time'' (2015) states that [[the Ventures]] "pioneered the idea of the rock concept album years before the genre is generally acknowledged to have been born"{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=689}} with their 1964 album ''[[The Ventures in Space]]''. Another is the Beach Boys' ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=xix}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Springer|first1=Matt|title=52 Years Ago: The Beach Boys Release a Concept Album About Cars, 'Little Deuce Coupe'|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/beach-boys-little-deuce-coupe/|website=[[Ultimate Guitar]]|date=7 October 2015}}</ref> Writing in ''[[101 Albums That Changed Popular Music]]'', Chris Smith commented: "Though albums such as Frank Sinatra's 1955 ''In the Wee Small Hours'' and [[Marty Robbins]]' 1959 ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'' had already introduced concept albums, ''Little Deuce Coupe'' was the first to comprise almost all original material rather than standard covers."{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=xix}} Writing in his ''Concise Dictionary of Popular Culture'', [[Marcel Danesi]] identifies the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965) and the Who's ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' (1967) as other examples of early concept albums.{{sfn|Danesi|2017|p=72}} [[Brian Boyd]] of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' names [[the Kinks]]' ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' (1966) as the first concept album: "Written entirely by [[Ray Davies]], the songs were supposed to be linked by pieces of music, so that the album would play without gaps, but the record company baulked at such radicalism. It’s not one of the band’s finest works, but it did have an impact."<ref name="Boyd2016">{{cite news|last1=Boyd|first1=Brian|title=The Beatles, Bob Dylan and The Beach Boys: 12 months that changed music|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/the-beatles-bob-dylan-and-the-beach-boys-12-months-that-changed-music-1.2671482|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=4 June 2016}}</ref>

"Popular consensus" for the first rock concept album, according to AllMusic, favours ''Sgt. Pepper''.<ref name="AllMusic/Concept albums" /> According to [[music criticism|music critic]] [[Tim Riley (music critic)|Tim Riley]], "Strictly speaking, [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'' [1966] has claims as the first 'concept album', but ''Sgt. Pepper'' was the record that made that idea convincing to most ears."{{sfn|Riley|1988|p=11}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Frank Zappa]] said that within ''Freak Out!'', "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function."{{sfn|Zappa|Occhiogrosso,|1989|pp=65–80}} The Beatles' [[John Lennon]] commented: "''Sgt. Pepper'' is called the first concept album, but it doesn't go anywhere&nbsp;... it works because we ''said'' it worked."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|p=197}} }} Musicologist Allan Moore says that "Even though previous albums had set a unified mood (notably Sinatra's ''[[Songs for Swinging Lovers]]''), it was on the basis of the influence of ''Sgt. Pepper'' that the penchant for the concept album was born."{{sfn|Moore|2016}}{{refn|group=nb|He continues that: "Things might have looked different had Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys managed to complete the album ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' at the time. ... it would have suggested an entirely different possible line of development for the concept album, wherein parts of tracks reappeared in others producing a form frankly far more sophisticated than any of its contemporaries."{{sfn|Moore|2016}}}} Adding to ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s claim, the artwork reinforced its central theme by depicting the four Beatles in uniform as members of the Sgt. Pepper band, while the record omitted the gaps that usually separated album tracks.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Johnny|last=Black|title=Concept Albums: A-may-zing!|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=April 1991}} Available at [https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/concept-albums-a-may-zing Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).</ref>

Author Bill Martin relates the assumed concept albums of the 1960s to [[progressive rock]]:

{{quote|In discussions of progressive rock, the idea of the "concept album" is mentioned frequently. If this term refers to albums that have thematic unity and development throughout, then in reality there are probably fewer concept albums than one might first think. ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Sergeant Pepper's'' do not qualify according to this criterion ... However, if we instead stretch the definition a bit, to where the album ''is'' the concept, then it is clear that progressive rock is entirely a music of concept albums—and this flows rather directly of ''Rubber Soul'' (December 1965) and then ''Revolver'' (1966), ''Pet Sounds'', and ''Sergeant Pepper's''. ... in the wake of these albums, many rock musicians took up "the complete album approach."{{sfn|Martin|2015|p=41}} }}

''[[Popmatters]]''{{'}} Sarah Zupko notes that while the Who's ''Tommy'' is "popularly thought of as the first rock opera, an extra-long concept album with characters, a consistent storyline, and a slight bit of pomposity", it is preceded by the shorter concept albums ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'' ([[Small Faces]], 1968) and ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' ([[The Pretty Things]], 1968).<ref>{{cite magazine|first = Sarah|last = Zupko|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/reviews/article/24787/prettythings-sf |title=The Pretty Things: S.F.

According to author Edward Macan, concept albums as a recurrent theme in progressive rock was directly inspired by the counterculture associated with "the [[proto-progressive]] bands of the 1960s", observing: "the consistent use of lengthy forms such as the programmatic [[song cycle]] of the concept album and the multimovement suite underscores the hippies' new, drug-induced conception of time."{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=13}}

In the 21st century, the field of classical music has adopted the idea of the "concept album", citing such historical examples as [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] ''[[Die Winterreise]]'' and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann's]] ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39 (Schumann)|Liederkreis]]'' as prototypes for contemporary composers and musicians.{{sfn|Shuker|2017|p=10}} Classical composers and performers increasingly adopt production and marketing strategies that unify otherwise disparate works into concept albums or concerts.<ref name="bennett">{{cite web |last1=Bennett |first1=Dawn and Diana Blom |title=Pinching (or taking back) ideas from popular music: Placing the concept album in contemporary classical music |url=https://www.academia.edu/19068346 |website=academia.edu/ |accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref> The classical music magazine [[Gramophone (magazine)|''Gramophone'']] includes a special category for "concept album" in its annual [[Gramophone Classical Music Awards|"Recordings of the Year Awards"]], to celebrate "albums where a creative mind has curated something visionary, a programme whose whole speaks more powerfully than its parts.
