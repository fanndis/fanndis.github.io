{{Main|History of Oregon State University}}

===Early years===
[[File:Style show at Multnomah Hotel in Portland Oregon 1920.jpg|thumb|left|OAC Home Economics Department at [[Multnomah Hotel]] in Portland, 1920]]
The university's roots date back to 1856, when it was originally founded as a primary and preparatory community school - known as Corvallis Academy. Within a decade, college coursework was added to the curriculum, making it the first school of its type in the region and a magnet for Oregon's young adults seeking a profession.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Landis |first1=Larry |title=Oregon State University |url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/oregon_state_university/#.X10VUGhKipg |website=oregonencyclopedia.org |publisher=The Oregon Encyclopedia |access-date=12 September 2020}}</ref> The university's name changed a total of eleven times, mostly up until the 1920s. Like many of today's land-grant colleges and universities, [[List of university and college name changes in the United States | name changes were common]] during this period and helped schools better align themselves with some of the largest available grants in agricultural research.<ref name="Land Grant College History and College Names">{{cite web |last1=Walton |first1=John C. |title=Land Grant College Education 1910-1920 Part 1 |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED540752.pdf |website=eric.ed.gov |publisher=Dept. of Interior |access-date=11 September 2020}}</ref>

Corvallis area [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] played a leading role in developing the early school. Several of the university's largest buildings are named after these early founders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2007/05/26/news/community/2loc10_munford.txt|title=Fraternal orders shaped Corvallis; Gazette Times; By Ken Munford; May 25, 2007, 2007 |access-date=2006-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2007/08/11/news/community/2loc06_munford.txt|title=Town, university have symbiotic relationship; Gazette Times; By Ken Munford; August 10, 2007|access-date=2006-11-08}}</ref> The school offered its first college-level curriculum in 1865, under the administration of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

On August 22, 1868, official articles of incorporation were filed for Corvallis College. October 27, 1868, is known as OSU Charter Day. The [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] designated Corvallis College as the "agricultural college of the state of Oregon" and the recipient of the [[Land-grant university|Land Grant]]. Acceptance of this grant required the college to comply with the requirements set forth in the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]] and the name of the school was changed to '''Corvallis State Agricultural College'''. The school was then authorized to grant the [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Master of Arts]] degrees. The first graduating class was in 1870, granting [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees. The school's name changed several times in the early years as its mission quickly broadened.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===Oregon State===
The Oregon Unification Bill was passed in 1929 by the Legislative Assembly, which placed the school under the oversight of the newly formed [[Oregon State Board of Higher Education]]. A doctoral in education was first offered in the early 1930s, with the conferral of four [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees in 1935. This year also saw the creation of the first summer session. The growing diversity in degree programs led to another name change in 1937, when the college became '''Oregon State College'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/chronology/chron_1920.html|title=Chronological History of Oregon State University - 1920-1929|website=Oregon State University Library Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923101544/http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/chronology/chron_1920.html|archive-date=September 23, 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>

The university's current title, '''Oregon State University,''' was adopted on March 6, 1961, by a legislative act signed into law by Governor [[Mark Hatfield]].<ref name=omsbgh>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XP9VAAAAIBAJ&pg=2154%2C807741 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Oregon |agency=Associated Press |title=OSU measure signed by Gov. Hatfield |date=March 6, 1961 |page=1}}</ref> Not unlike most American universities and colleges, OSU actively works to diversify its faculty and staff. In 1993, OSU reported it was having difficulties with the retention and hiring of minority faculty members. Only 150 out of 2,284 faculty members were black, Native American, Asian, or Hispanic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/34689617/corvallis_gazettetimes/|title=Minority Flight: OSU has trouble keeping 'faculty of color'|last=Allen|first=Chester|date=1993-08-29|website=Corvallis Gazette-Times|language=en|via=Newspapers.com|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> In response, the school president and vice president introduced a hiring initiative to promote and enhance diversity. The initiative recognizes the compelling need to build a welcoming and inclusive university community and the direct relationship between excellence and diversity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diversity Hiring Initiative |url=https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/president/reports-and-initiatives/diversity-hiring-initiative |website=oregonstate.edu |publisher=Oregon State University |access-date=13 September 2020}}</ref>
In 2007, Scott Reed was named the Vice Provost for Outreach and Engagement as OSU Extension Service and [[Oregon State University Ecampus|OSU Ecampus]] were aligned under this new division. Ecampus delivers OSU degree programs and courses online and at a distance to students worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

==Student life==
[[File:OSU Dixon Rec Center.JPG|thumb|[[Dixon Recreation Center]]]]
[[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]] is the tenth largest city in the state. It is a relatively small community and many of the local events have a strong connection to the university. Oregon State has over 400 active student organizations and groups. The campus is only a few hours driving distance from any number of outdoor recreation opportunities. Several federal and state natural forests and parks are popular student destinations. These include the [[Cascade Range]], a rugged coastline, several large forests, the high desert and numerous rivers and lakes. [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon's largest city, is {{convert|85|mi|km|0}} north of the campus.

From 1930<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer_full.php?CISOROOT=/EAD&CISOPTR=460&REC=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504114001/http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer_full.php?CISOROOT=/EAD&CISOPTR=460&REC=8|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 4, 2009|title=Digital Collections : L_TITLE_ITEM_VIEWER|date=May 4, 2009}}</ref> until 1968, Oregon State University was home to the Gamma chapter of [[Phrateres]], a philanthropic-social organization for female college students. Gamma was the third chapter of the organization, which eventually had over 20 chapters in [[Canada]] and the United States.

The majority of older students at Oregon State University live off-campus, but on-campus housing is available and required for most incoming freshmen. There are 16 residence halls on campus,<ref>{{cite web|title = Oregon State to name new residence hall after pioneering student|url = http://kval.com/news/local/oregon-state-to-name-new-residence-hall-after-pioneering-student|website = KVAL|access-date = January 30, 2016|language = en-US|first = Sinclair Broadcast|last = Group|date = May 28, 2016}}</ref> which are organized into individual Hall Councils. The residence halls include Bloss Hall, Buxton Hall, Callahan Hall, Cauthorn Hall, Dixon Lodge, Finley Hall, Halsell Hall, Hawley Hall, International Living-Learning Center, McNary Hall, Poling Hall, Sackett Hall, Tebeau Hall, Weatherford Hall, West Hall, and Wilson Hall. Residents make up the membership and each council holds their own elections to select management over the hall government. All of the councils are managed by the Residence Hall Association (RHA).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021124213001/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/rha/ Residence Hall Association], oregonstate.edu</ref>

[[The LaSells Stewart Center]] is the conference and performing arts center for the campus. Many famous speakers have graced the stage of the campus' main auditorium, [[Austin Auditorium]], while the [[Corvallis-OSU Symphony]] plays there frequently. The OSU Office of Conferences and Special Events is in the auditorium.

The university is home to Orange Media Network, the university's student media department. Orange Media Network encompasses the award-winning ''[[The Daily Barometer]]'' student newspaper, [[KBVR|KBVR 88.7 FM]], KBVR-TV, Prism Art and Literary Journal, lifestyle magazine Beaver's Digest, and fashion magazine DAMchic.

Two Oregon State students are members of the [[Oregon Student Association]] Board of Directors.

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]] and athletic games are: ''[[Hail to Old OSU]]'' and the Alma Mater.

===Student government===
The Associated Students of Oregon State University (ASOSU) is the officially recognized student government at Oregon State University and represents all students in campus affairs and at community, state and federal levels regarding issues that directly influence the quality of and access to, post-secondary education.

===Diversity===

In a 2008 national ranking based on academics, athletic opportunity and overall performance, Oregon State was chosen as one of the "premier" universities in America. This ranking, performed by [[Stack magazine|''STACK'' magazine]], places Oregon State 29th in the nation's "Elite 50" universities and uncontested within the state that year.<ref name=Elite50>{{cite web|url=http://www.primenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=132308|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908012456/http://www.primenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=132308|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-08|work=Stack|title=Elite 50|access-date=2008-02-03}}</ref> Since then, the University of Oregon has joined Oregon State in the STACK rankings.

The history of Oregon State athletics dates back to 1893, when "Jimmie the [[Coyote]]" was chosen as the college's mascot.<ref name="alumni-mascothistory">[http://alumni.oregonstate.edu/eclips/history/sportshistory05.html Part 5 of 20: A History of Athletic Mascots at Oregon State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608061738/http://alumni.oregonstate.edu/eclips/history/sportshistory05.html |date=June 8, 2007 }}, oregonstate.edu</ref> This was replaced by the [[American Beaver|beaver]] in 1910; it has remained the school's mascot. In 1915, the college became one of the four charter members of the [[Pacific Coast Conference|Pacific Coast (Athletic) Conference]].
