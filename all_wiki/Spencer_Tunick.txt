'''Spencer Tunick''' (born January 1, 1967) is an American photographer best known for organizing large-scale nude shoots. Since 1994, he has photographed over 75 human installations around the world.<ref name="inde_Spen"/>

==Life and career==
Spencer Tunick was born in  [[Middletown, Orange County, New York]] into a Jewish family. His father Earl owned a keychain photo-viewer franchise in the [[Catskills]].<ref name="gunkguide1"/>  In 1986, he visited London, where he took photographs of a nude at a bus stop and of scores of nudes in [[Alleyn's School]]'s Lower School Hall in [[Dulwich]], [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]]. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from [[Emerson College]] in 1988.

==Photography==
In 1992, Tunick began documenting live nudes in public locations in New York through video and photographs. His early works from this period focus more on a single nude individual or small groups of nudes. Tunick cites 1994, when he posed and photographed 28 nude people in front of the [[headquarters of the United Nations]] in midtown Manhattan, as a turning point in his career; "It all started there, moving my work from just photography into installation and performance photography," he says.<ref name="gunkguide1"/> Since then, he has organized and photographed over 65 temporary site-related installations in the United States and abroad.

Tunick's philosophy is that "individuals en masse, without their clothing, grouped together, metamorphose into a new shape. The bodies extend into and upon the landscape like a substance. These grouped masses which do not underscore sexuality become abstractions that challenge or reconfigure one's views of nudity and privacy."<ref name="artn_Spen"/>

Sometimes, after gathering his subjects together, Tunick grades them by gender, long hair, age or other characteristics. Registration for modeling on his website includes questions about skin tone. A color chart shows seven boxes ranging from stark white to baby-powder pink and dark chocolate. In his work, he plays off different flesh tones or groups people of the same color.<ref name="TheTelegraph2016"/> Tunick is also interested in the juxtaposition between the organic and the mechanical, and often chooses famous buildings or unusual structures as his backdrop.<ref name="gunkguide1"/>

==Major installations==
; 2001
In May 2001, between 2,500 and 3,000 volunteers gathered at the [[Place des Arts]] in [[Montreal]], in collaboration with the [[Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal]].<ref name="Montreal2001"/> Later, in September 2001, Tunick photographed 400 nude volunteers in [[Greenwich]], London, each side of ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', and then in a nearby street.
; 2003
In April 2003, Tunick was again in London to photograph 160 nude volunteers in front of the [[Saatchi Gallery]] at its opening on the South Bank,<ref name="theGuardian2003"/> and later 500 volunteers in a nude photo shoot in [[Selfridges]] department store.<ref name="BBCNews2003a"/>
In June, he photographed 7,000 naked people in [[Barcelona]], and hundreds of women in New York's [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central train station]] in October.<ref name="BBCNews2003b"/>

; 2004
On June 26, 2004 in [[Cleveland]], he completed his largest installation in the United States, with 2,754 people posing. In August 2004, a photo shoot was completed in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] of about 1,800 nudes in Buffalo's old [[Buffalo Central Terminal|central train station]].
; 2005
On July 17, 2005 he photographed almost 1,700 nudes on the [[quayside]]s at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Gateshead]], including the [[Gateshead Millennium Bridge]].<ref name="BBCNews2005"/>

On September 11, 2005, he photographed 1,493 nudes in [[Lyon]] on the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] quaysides and footbridge resp. between containers.<ref name="AutoN0-1"/> On March 19, 2006, Tunick photographed 1,500 nudes in [[Caracas]], having people standing up, lying down, and on their knees beside the main [[Simón Bolívar]] statue.<ref name="edan_Vene"/>

; 2006
On August 6, 2006 he photographed about 500 nudes in the courtyard of the [[Museum Kunstpalast]] in Düsseldorf.<ref name="Vimeo2006"/>
; 2007
In 2007 Spencer Tunick was commissioned by the Dream Amsterdam Foundation to realize art projects for the artistic event ''Dream Amsterdam''.<ref name="vimeo2007"/>  On April 15, 2007, Tunick organized an installation in a tulip field in [[Schermerhorn]]. On June 3, 2007, he photographed installations with 2000 participants in [[Amsterdam]]: 2000 people in a car park; 250 men at a nearby gas station; and 250 women on bicycles on the [[Lijnbaansgracht]]&nbsp;— [[Lauriergracht]]. A small group of participants was photographed on a canal, [[Leliegracht]], requiring a special bridge construction to create the illusion that the people were floating over the water.

On May 6, 2007, approximately 18,000 people posed for Tunick in [[Mexico City]]'s principal square, the [[Zócalo]], setting a new record,<ref name="AutoN0-2"/> and more than doubling the previous highest number of 7,000 people who had turned out in Barcelona in 2003. Male and female volunteers of different ages stood and saluted, lay down on the ground, crouched in the [[fetal position]], and otherwise posed for Tunick's lens in the city's massive central plaza, the [[Plaza de la Constitución]]. Here, the specific problems of photographing great numbers of people outside became clear: as Tunick could only shoot from buildings located west of the square (the three other sides of the square are government buildings and the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|cathedral]]), there was a rush to take the pictures before dawn to avoid getting [[sunflare]] in the lens.  An accompanying documentary ''Naked in Mexico: Spencer Tunick'' was also filmed on, and around, the date of the photo shoot.

On August 18, 2007, Tunick used 600 nude people in a "living sculpture" on the [[Aletsch Glacier]] in an installation intended to draw attention to [[global warming]] and the shrinking of the world's glaciers in a collaboration with [[Greenpeace]]. The temperature was about {{convert|10|°C}}.<ref name="AutoN0-3"/> The Aletsch glacier retreated by {{convert|100|m}} between 2005 and 2006.<ref name="AutoN0-4"/> The environment-oriented installation was reported in several languages and media outlets around the world, Swiss politicians were playfully encouraged to demonstrate their green credentials by participating in Tunick's installation, and Euro RSCG Zurich, Switzerland received the AME Grand Trophy for Public Service and Not-For-Profit, for their campaign for Tunick and Greenpeace Switzerland, "Naked Testimony to Global Warming".<ref name="artdesigncafe2010"/>

Tunick followed this installation with one at the Sagamore Hotel in [[Miami Beach]].<ref name="phil"/>
; 2008
Tunick announced plans to take photographs in [[Ernst Happel Stadium]] in Vienna with 2,008 naked football fans in the run-up to the [[Euro 2008]] tournament.<ref name="AutoN0-5"/>

On June 17, 2008 Tunick carried out an installation in the grounds of [[Blarney Castle]] in [[County Cork]] with about 1200 people. Another photoshoot was organised for four days later (Saturday June 21) in Dublin, on the [[Great South Wall|South Wall]] near the [[Poolbeg Lighthouse]], with over 2500 nude people taking part. The South Wall event was somewhat washed out, with one of the proposed set-ups having to be cancelled. However, people praised the organisers for an event well run.
; 2009
On October 3, 2009 Tunick performed another installation in collaboration with Greenpeace, this time to draw attention to the effect climate change is having on French wine production. Over 700 volunteers turned up at a vineyard near [[Fuisse|Macon]], France for a number of poses among the vines.<ref name="AutoN0-6"/>
; 2010
[[File:Sydney Opera House, nudism.jpg|thumb|left|Participants preparing for photo at Sydney Opera House]]
On March 1, 2010 Tunick carried out a series of installations titled "The Base" on the [[Sydney Opera House]] Forecourt and inside the Opera House. The installations were carried out as part of the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] and were Tunick's first large-scale installation in Sydney, with over 5,200 participants.<ref name="AutoN0-7"/> For the event, the CBC reported that Tunick had invited Lady Gaga to the photo shoot.<ref name="AutoN0-8"/>

In May 2010, Tunick  was commissioned by [[The Lowry]] to work with 1000 people in five secret locations.<ref name="AutoN0-9"/> The resulting exhibition was called Everyday People,<ref name="AutoN0-10"/> tying into a phrase used by [[L. S. Lowry]] in describing his art. The press were allowed a photoshoot at Peel Park, Salford on May 1, but the other locations such as [[Castlefield]]s, Dantzic Street and [[Manchester Airport|Ringway]] remained unreported.<ref name="AutoN0-11"/>

On August 8, 2010, around 700 revellers at the [[Big Chill Festival]], at [[Eastnor Castle]] Deer Park in Herefordshire UK, shed their clothes and covered themselves in five shades of body paint for an installation that paid homage to the art of [[Yves Klein]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]], and made reference to the BP oil spillage in the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="The Spencer Tunick Experience"/>
[[File:Spencer Tunick Nude Installation.jpg|thumb|275px|Spencer Tunick nude installation at [[Eastnor Castle]]]]
Tunick continued to the International Street Theatre Festival in [[Aurillac]],<ref name="aurillac" /> France, where he had been invited to hold an installation for its 25th anniversary. The installation took place over two days, August 20 and 21, 2010. On the first morning, Tunick assembled participants with black umbrellas on a hillside above the town centre, and later with clear umbrellas in the narrow streets of the historic quarter of Aurillac. On the following morning Tunick set out to re-enact [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s "[[Liberty Leading the People]]", with the help of 250 women wielding French flags, 4 men and a smoke machine.<ref name="The Spencer Tunick Experience"/>
; 2011
On September 17, 2011, Tunick photographed a large group of naked volunteers at the [[Dead Sea]].  1,200 volunteers ranging in age from 20 to somewhere in their sixties set out for the Dead Sea before dawn and modeled in three different arrangements: in the sea, on land and covered in [[Mud bath|Dead Sea mud]].<ref name="AutoN0-12"/><ref name="smh._Dead"/>

; 2012
On June 23, 2012, Tunick photographed a group of naked volunteers in Munich, Germany.  Tunick was interpreting scenes from the [[Richard Wagner]] opera "[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]".  The volunteers were painted in gold or red posing outside the [[National Theatre Munich|Bavarian State Opera House]].<ref name="AutoN0-13"/><ref name="AutoN0-14"/>
; 2016
On June 4, 2016, Tunick photographed a group of naked volunteers in [[Bogotá]], Colombia. 6,000 volunteers ranging in age from 20 to somewhere in their sixties set out for Bogotá before dawn.<ref name="AutoN0-15"/><ref name="cult_Bogo"/>

On July 9, 2016, Tunick photographed 3,200 people wearing only blue paint, in [[Kingston upon Hull]], UK. The project was named ''Sea of Hull'', and was commissioned by [[Ferens Art Gallery]] in recognition of the following year's [[UK City of Culture|City of Culture]] events. The gathering was the largest of any of Tunick's UK-based projects to date.<ref name="AutoN0-16"/>

On July 18, 2016, Tunick photographed 100 nude women, in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where the [[Republican National Convention]] was being hosted. They held circular [[Mylar]] mirrors over their heads and reflected light at the city to expose what they view as the naked truth about Republicans.<ref name="AutoN0-17"/> According to Tunick, the point of the exercise was to "shine the wisdom of women to change the world."

;2018
In July 2018, Tunick photographed almost 500 men and women draped in sheer red cloths on top of a [[Woolworths Group (Australia)|Woolworths]] supermarket building in [[Melbourne]], Australia.<ref name="Guardian20180709" />

In September 2018, Tunick visited Bodø, Norway to create the artwork BODØ BODYSCAPE as part of Bodø Biennale. It was his first project in Norway, and first ever project north of the Arctic Circle. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bodobiennale.no/en/bodoe-biennale-2018/program/spencer-tunick-bodoe-bodyscape|title=Spencer Tunick: Bodø Bodyscape|website=Bodø Biennale}}</ref>

==Media reception==
Tunick is the subject of three [[HBO]] documentaries, ''Naked States'', ''Naked World'', and ''Positively Naked''.

It has been observed that there may be an ambiguity in Tunick's work between "transgression" and "obedience". A "regimented" quality has been observed in the arrangement of figures in some of Tunick's work, but this, it has been observed, may be offset by the social transgression that accrues to public nakedness.<ref name="Fineman"/>
