'''[[African Americans]]''' (also known as '''Black Americans''' and '''Afro-Americans''') are an [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|ethnic group]] in the [[United States]]. The first achievements by African Americans in various fields have historically marked footholds, often leading to more widespread cultural change. The shorthand phrase for this is "breaking the color barrier".<ref>Juguo, Zhang (2001). ''W. E. B. Du Bois: The Quest for the Abolition of the Color Line''. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-93087-1}}</ref><ref>Herbst, Philip H (1997). ''The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States''.

One commonly cited example is that of [[Jackie Robinson]], who became the [[Baseball color line|first African American]] of the modern era to become a [[Major League Baseball]] player in 1947, ending 60 years of segregated [[Negro Leagues]].<ref>Sailes, Gary Alan (1998).
