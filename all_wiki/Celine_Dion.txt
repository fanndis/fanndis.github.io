She first gained international recognition by winning both the 1982 [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Eurovision Song Contest]], where she [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988|represented Switzerland]]. After learning to speak English, she signed on to [[Epic Records]] in the United States. In 1990, Dion released her debut English-language album, ''[[Unison (Celine Dion album)|Unison]]'', establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.

During the 1990s, she achieved worldwide fame after releasing several best-selling English-language albums, such as ''[[Falling into You]]'' (1996) and ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' (1997), which were both certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|diamond]] in the US. She also scored a series of international number-one hits, including "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Celine Dion version|The Power of Love]]", "[[Think Twice (Celine Dion song)|Think Twice]]", "[[Because You Loved Me]]", "[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now#Celine Dion|It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]", "[[My Heart Will Go On]]", and "[[I'm Your Angel]]". Dion continued releasing French albums between each English record; ''[[D'eux]]'' (1995) became the best-selling French-language album of all time, while ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' (1998), ''[[Sans attendre]]'' (2012), and ''[[Encore un soir]]'' (2016), were all certified [[Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique|diamond]] in France. During the 2000s, she built her reputation as a highly successful live performer with [[A New Day...]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] (2003–07), which remains the highest-grossing [[concert residency]] of all time, as well as the [[Taking Chances World Tour]] (2008–09), one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours of all time]].

Dion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] to [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[European classical music|classical]]. Her recordings are mainly in French and English, although she also sings in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is regarded as one of pop music's most influential vocalists. She has won five [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. ''Billboard'' named her the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Adult Contemporary]]" for having the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)#Most number-one songs|most number-one songs]] on the radio format for a female artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7776996/the-illustrious-career-of-celine-dion|title=Being Celine: A Look Back at the Illustrious Career of Celine Dion |work=Billboard|author=Billboard Staff|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> She is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] era.

As a child in Quebec, Dion participated in Girl Guide programs as a member of [[Girl Guides of Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridgetimes.ca/opinion-story/6155448-celine-dion-margaret-atwood-among-long-list-of-girl-guides/|title=Opinion {{!}} Celine Dion, Margaret Atwood among long list of Girl Guides|date=2 December 2015|website=CambridgeTimes.ca|language=en-CA|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref>

At age 12, she collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, "[[Ce n'était qu'un rêve]]", whose title translates as "It Was Only a Dream" or "Nothing But A Dream".<ref name="autogenerated12" /> Her brother Michel sent the recording to music manager [[René Angélil]], whose name he discovered on the back of a [[Ginette Reno]] album.<ref name="Jam">{{cite web|title=Dion, Celine|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/D/Dion_Celine.html|work=[[Jam!]]|publisher=Canoe.ca|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref> Angélil was moved to tears by Dion's voice and decided to make her a star.<ref name="autogenerated12" /> In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, ''[[La voix du bon Dieu]]'', which later became a local No. 1 hit and made her an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in [[Tokyo, Japan]], and won the musician's award for "Top Performer" as well as the gold medal for "Best Song" with "[[Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi]]".<ref name="Jam" />

By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single "[[D'amour ou d'amitié]]" ("Of Love or of Friendship"), Dion had also won several [[Félix Award]]s, including "Best Female performer" and "Discovery of the Year".<ref name="Jam"/><ref name="autogenerated20">[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/celine-dion.html Celine Dion Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927104806/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/celine-dion.html |date=27 September 2013 }}, [[The Biography Channel]]. 13 September 2007.</ref> Further success came when she represented [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Switzerland]] in the [[1988 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Ne partez pas sans moi]]" and won the contest by a close margin in [[Dublin]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=John Kennedy|title=The Eurovision Song Contest&nbsp;— The Official History|author-link=John Kennedy O'Connor|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|location=UK|date=2 April 2007|isbn=978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref>

At age eighteen, after seeing a [[Michael Jackson]] performance, Dion told Angélil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/dion_celine/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd|title=''Céline Dion''|work=MTV Artists|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> Though confident in her talent, Angélil realized that her image needed to be changed for her to be marketed worldwide.<ref name="autogenerated12"/> She receded from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the [[Berlitz Corporation|École Berlitz]] in 1989 to polish her English.<ref name=Enc>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Celine Dion|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/celine-dion|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Historica-Dominion]]|accessdate=25 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927173706/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/celine-dion|archivedate=27 September 2013}}</ref>

In 1989, during a concert on the [[Incognito tournée]], she injured her voice.

===1990–1992: ''Unison'', ''Dion chante Plamondon'' and ''Celine Dion''===
Two years after she learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with ''[[Unison (Celine Dion album)|Unison]]'' (1990), the lead single having originally been recorded by [[Laura Branigan]].<ref name="Jam"/> She incorporated the help of many established musicians, including Vito Luprano and Canadian producer [[David Foster]].<ref name="Time1"/> The album was largely influenced by 1980s [[soft rock]] music that quickly found a niche within the [[adult contemporary]] radio format. ''Unison'' also hit the right notes with critics: Jim Faber of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that her vocals were "tastefully unadorned", and that she never attempted to "bring off styles that are beyond her".<ref>{{cite news|title=Review—Céline Dion Unison|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,313100_4_0_,00.html|accessdate=10 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625165657/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C313100%2C00.html|archivedate=25 June 2009|date=25 January 1991|last=Farber|first=Jim|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] declared it "a fine, sophisticated American debut".<ref>{{cite web|title=Allmusic|work=Review—Céline Dion Unison|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r5855|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=18 November 2005}}</ref> Singles from the album included "[[(If There Was) Any Other Way]]", "[[The Last to Know]]", "[[Unison (song)#Céline Dion version|Unison]]", and "[[Where Does My Heart Beat Now]]", a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad that made prominent use of the electric guitar. The latter became her first top-ten hit on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number four. In 1991, Dion was a featured soloist on "[[Voices That Care]]", a tribute to American troops fighting in [[Operation Desert Storm]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Her real international breakthrough came when she duetted with [[Peabo Bryson]] on the [[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|title track]] to [[Disney]]'s animated film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).<ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite news|last=Bliss|first=Karen|title=25 Years of Canadian Artists |work=Canadian Musician |date=1 March 2004 |page=34 |issn=0708-9635}}</ref> It became her first top-ten hit in the UK and her second top-ten hit in the US. The song earned its songwriters an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]] and gave Dion her first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].<ref name="Time1"/> "Beauty and the Beast" served as the [[lead single]] from her 1992 [[Celine Dion (album)|self-titled album]], which, like her debut, had a strong pop rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaborations with David Foster and [[Diane Warren]], the album was even more well-received commercially than ''Unison''; it was certified diamond in Canada and double platinum in the US. The album's second single "[[If You Asked Me To#Celine Dion version|If You Asked Me To]]" (a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Patti LaBelle]]'s song from the 1989 movie ''[[Licence to Kill]]'') became her first [[List of number-one singles of 1992 (Canada)|number-one single]] in Canada and peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Also during this time, Dion released the Francophone album ''[[Dion chante Plamondon]]''. The album consisted mostly of covers, but featured four new songs: "[[Des mots qui sonnent (song)|Des mots qui sonnent]]", "[[Je danse dans ma tête]]", "[[Quelqu'un que j'aime, quelqu'un qui m'aime]]" and "[[L'amour existe encore]]". It was originally released in Canada and France during the 1991–1992 period, then later received an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. "[[Un garçon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)]]" became a smash hit in France, reaching No. 2 and being certified gold. In Quebec, the album was certified Gold the day it was released.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

By 1992, ''Unison'', ''Céline Dion'', and numerous high-profile media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame.<ref name="autogenerated18">Alexander, Charles P.

===1993–1995: ''The Colour of My Love'' and ''D'eux''===
[[File:Dion C ter.jpg|thumb|upright|Celine Dion reading a magazine in 1994.]]
In 1993, Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him "the colour of [her] love" in the dedication section of her third English-language album ''[[The Colour of My Love]]''. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as she had feared, fans embraced the couple.<ref name="Time1"/> Eventually, Angélil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony in December 1994, which was broadcast live on Canadian television.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

As with most of her catalogue, ''The Colour of My Love'' had over-riding themes of love and romance.<ref name="autogenerated23">{{cite web|title=Celine Dion The Colour of My Love|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2002/celinedion-thecolourofmylove.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402231118/http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2002/celinedion-thecolourofmylove.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 April 2012|work=Plugged In|accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref> It became her most successful record up to that point, selling more than six million copies in the US, two million in Canada, and peaking at No. 1 in many countries. The album also spawned Dion's first US, Canadian, and Australian No. 1 single "[[The Power of Love (Celine Dion)|The Power of Love]]" (a remake of [[Jennifer Rush]]'s 1985 hit), which would become her [[signature song|signature hit]] until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s.<ref name="autogenerated18"/>

The single "[[When I Fall in Love#Céline Dion and Clive Griffin version|When I Fall in Love]]", a [[duet]] with [[Clive Griffin]], achieved moderate success on the US and Canadian charts and was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning one. ''The Colour of My Love'' also became Dion's first major hit in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. Both the album and the single "[[Think Twice (Celine Dion song)|Think Twice]]" simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. "Think Twice", which remained at No. 1 for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the UK<ref>{{cite web|work=Celinedion.com|title=The Journey so Far|url=http://www.celinedion.com/biography?page=0,2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709112546/http://www.celinedion.com/biography?page=0%2C2|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 July 2012|accessdate=16 August 2005}}</ref> while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two million copies sold.<ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115055129/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx|date=15 January 2013|title=Certified Awards Search}}</ref>

Dion kept to her French roots and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record.<ref name="autogenerated15">"Celine Dion". Compton's by Britannica. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2005.</ref> Generally, they achieved more credibility than her English-language works.<ref name="autogenerated21"/> She released ''[[À l'Olympia (Céline Dion album)|À l'Olympia]]'', a live album that was recorded during one of her concerts at the [[Paris Olympia]] in 1994. It had one promotional single, a live version of "[[Calling You#Céline Dion version|Calling You]]", which peaked at seventy-five on the French Singles Chart. She also recorded a bilingual version of "[[Petit Papa Noël]]" with [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] for the 1994 holiday album ''[[A Very Merry Chipmunk]]''. ''[[D'eux]]'' (also known as ''The French Album'' in the United States), was released in 1995, and it would go on to become the best-selling French-language album of all time.<ref name="autogenerated15"/> The album was mostly written and produced by [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], and amassed huge success with the singles "[[Pour que tu m'aimes encore]]" and "[[Je sais pas]]".

''[[Falling into You]]'' (1996), Dion's fourth English-language album, presented the singer at the height of her popularity and showed a further progression of her music.<ref name="autogenerated22"/> In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements, such as complex orchestral sounds, African [[chanting]], and elaborate musical effects.

The title track "[[Falling into You (song)|Falling into You]]" and "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" (a [[Tina Turner]] cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; "[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now#Céline Dion|It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]" (produced by its writer [[Jim Steinman]]) and a remake of [[Eric Carmen]]'s "[[All by Myself#Céline Dion version|All by Myself]]" maintained a soft-rock atmosphere, combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the No. 1 single "[[Because You Loved Me]]", which was written by Diane Warren, was a pop ballad that served as the theme to the 1996 film ''[[Up Close and Personal (film)|Up Close and Personal]]''.<ref name="Inter"/>

Chuck Taylor of ''Billboard'' wrote, "the performance&nbsp;... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul.

Dion ended her three-year sabbatical from the music industry with the aptly titled album ''[[A New Day Has Come]]'', released in March 2002. The album was her most personal yet, with songs focusing on her motherhood and maturation as a woman such as "[[A New Day Has Come (song)|A New Day Has Come]]", and "[[Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)]]".

After ''One Heart'', she released her next English-language studio album, ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]'' (2004). ''Miracle'' was a multimedia project conceived by Dion and Australian photographer [[Anne Geddes]] and had a theme centring on babies and motherhood. The album was filled with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, including covers of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[What a Wonderful World]]" and [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)#Céline Dion version|Beautiful Boy]]".

The francophone album ''[[1 fille & 4 types]]'' (''1 Girl & 4 Guys''), released in October 2003, fared better than her previous two releases and showed her trying to distance herself from the "diva" image. She recruited [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], [[Gildas Arzel]], Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best-selling French albums ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' and ''[[D'eux]]''. Labeled "the album of pleasure" by Dion herself, the album cover showed her in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved widespread commercial success in France, Canada, and Belgium where it reached No.&nbsp;1. In France, the album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 and was later certified 2× platinum after selling over 700,000 copies. Critic Stephen Erlewine of ''[[AllMusic]]'' wrote that Dion's vocals were "back at top of their game" and that she was "getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while".<ref>{{cite web|title=Allmusic|work=Review—1 Fille & 4 Types|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r666176|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=20 November 2005}}</ref>

Though her albums were commercially successful, they did not achieve the sales or the reception of her previous works. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey, and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, [[Urban contemporary|Urban]]/[[Hip hop music|Hip-hop]] songs.<ref>Gardner, Elysa.

===Influences===
Dion cites idols as varied as [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Carole King]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Barbra Streisand]], and the [[Bee Gees]], all of whom she would eventually collaborate with.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4099|pure_url=yes}}|title=Celine Dion Bio |publisher=All Music Guide|year=2009|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/06/30/celine-dion-remembers-her-idol-michael-jackson|title=Celine Dion Remembers Her Idol, Michael Jackson|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=7 January 2010|date=30 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/singers-influenced-whitney-houston/story?id=15632234#6|title=From Beyonce to Gaga: 8 Singers Influenced by Whitney Houston|work=[[ABC News]]|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref> Her music has been influenced by numerous genres, including pop, rock, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[R&B]], and [[soul music|soul]], and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an emphasis on love and romance.<ref name="autogenerated23"/><ref>[http://www.pluggedinonline.com/music/music/a0001107.cfm Celine Dion, ''Let's Talk About Love''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829161008/http://www.pluggedinonline.com/music/music/a0001107.cfm |date=29 August 2008 }}, pluggedinonline.com; retrieved 13 September 2007.</ref> After the birth of her first child, her work increasingly focused on maternal love.<ref name="celebr"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2002/CelineDion-LetsTalkAboutLove.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715094203/http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2002/CelineDion-LetsTalkAboutLove.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 July 2011 |title=Celine Dion |work=plugged in.com|publisher=Focus on the Family|year=2009|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2003/CelineDion-OneHeart.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715094213/http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2003/CelineDion-OneHeart.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 July 2011 |title=Celine Dion-- One Heart |work=plugged in.com|publisher=Focus on the Family|year=2009|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2002/CelineDion-ANewDayHasCome.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715094219/http://www.pluggedin.com/music/albums/2002/CelineDion-ANewDayHasCome.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 July 2011 |title=A new Day Has Come|work=plugged in.com|publisher=Focus on the Family|year=2009|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref>

===Musical style===
Dion has faced considerable criticism from critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and is marked by excessive sentimentality.<ref name= Enc/><ref name="autogenerated24"/> According to Keith Harris of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, "[Dion's] sentimentality is bombastic and defiant rather than demure and retiring&nbsp;... [she] stands at the end of the chain of drastic devolution that goes Aretha–Whitney–Mariah. Far from being an aberration, Dion actually stands as a symbol of a certain kind of pop sensibility—bigger is better, too much is never enough, and the riper the emotion the more true."<ref>''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'' 2004.</ref> Her francophone releases, by contrast, tend to be deeper and more varied than her English releases, and consequently have achieved more credibility.<ref name="autogenerated21"/><ref name=cbcc>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/celinedion.html|title=The real Céline: Céline Dion's new French album shows her personal side|publisher=CBC|year=2007|accessdate=7 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531083109/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/celinedion.html|archivedate=31 May 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Critics have stated that Dion's involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced<ref name="cbcc"/> and impersonal.<ref name="autogenerated21"/> However, coming from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she dabbled in learning how to play instruments like piano and guitar, and practised with a [[Fender Stratocaster]] during the recording sessions for her album ''Falling into You''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/arts/quebec-s-little-girl-conquering-the-globe.html|title=Quebec's Little Girl, Conquering the Globe|work=The New York Times|accessdate=7 January 2010|first=Anthony|last=Depalma|date=23 February 1997}}</ref>

Occasionally, Dion has contributed to the writing of a handful of her English and French songs, as well as writing a few songs for other artists such as [[Marc Dupre]]. Additionally, as her career progressed, she found herself taking charge in the production of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval, which could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input.<ref name="autogenerated21"/> By the time she released her second English album ''[[Celine Dion (album)|Celine Dion]]'', she had assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, "On the second album I said, 'Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100% happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album.' This is my album."<ref name="autogenerated21" /> Besides her contributions to some of her early French albums, Dion wrote a few of the songs on ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' (1997) and ''[[These Are Special Times]]'' (1998).<ref name="evous.fr">{{cite web|url = http://www.evous.fr/musique/Marc-Dupre-Entre-deux-mondes,11068.html|title = Céline Dion signe le single de Marc Dupré : Ecoutez 'Entre deux mondes'|publisher = Evous.fr|accessdate = 27 September 2014|date = 8 September 2011|language = French}}</ref>

She is often the subject of media ridicule<ref>See, e.g., [[Joel Selvin]], [http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Celine-Dion-in-full-force-at-HP-Pavilion-3170389.php "Celine Dion in full force at HP Pavilion"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 23 February 2009, E2. In this rather hostile review, Selvin wrote: "You want cheese? She is a [[Velveeta]] volcano."</ref> and parody and is frequently impersonated on shows such as ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' for her strong accent and onstage gesticulations. However, she has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her.<ref name="vh1" /> She even invited [[Ana Gasteyer]], who parodied her on ''SNL'', to appear onstage during one of her performances in New York City. While she is rarely politically outspoken, in 2005 following the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster, Dion appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and tearfully criticized the [[George W. Bush|US government]]'s slow response in aiding the victims of the hurricane: "There's people still there waiting to be rescued. To me that is not acceptable&nbsp;... How can it be so easy to send planes in another country to kill everybody in a second and destroy lives.

Dion is regarded as one of pop music's most influential vocalists. [[Linda Lister]] describes her as a reigning ''Queen of Pop'' for her influence over the recording industry during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lister|first=Linda|title=Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars|url=http://lindalister.com/Divafication.pdf|work=[[Linda Lister]]|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref> Her music and vocal styling, alongside that of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, have been said to shape how the bulk of modern female pop vocalists sing. These three artists have been widely credited with reviving the [[power ballad]], and in doing so reshaping the adult contemporary radio format, making it one of the most popular formats of the 1990s and early 2000s. According to producer, musician, and former ''[[American Idol]]'' judge [[Randy Jackson]], Dion, Houston, and Carey are the voices of the modern era.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harp|first=Justin|title=''American Idol'' Randy Jackson: "Whitney Houston was voice of generation"|url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/music/news/a367273/american-idol-randy-jackson-whitney-houston-was-voice-of-generation.html|accessdate=25 September 2013|newspaper=[[Digital Spy]]|date=23 February 2012}}</ref> Music critic and Dion biographer Carl Wilson notes that her "fame and influence is also renewed and expressed regularly these days by ''American Idol'', the largest mass musical phenomenon of the past decade, where Celine's stood solidly in its pantheon of singers for young people to emulate".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hiebert|first=Paul|title=Why Celine Dion Will Always Be Popular – At Least While You're Alive|url=http://flavorwire.com/90128/why-celine-dion-will-always-be-popular-at-least-while-youre-alive|work=Flavorwire|accessdate=25 September 2013|date=12 May 2010}}</ref> Many contestants on the countless televised talent competitions that have risen at the turn of the millennium often emulate Dion, Houston and Carey and cite them as idols.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celine Still A Favourite Among American Idol Contestants|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-still-favourite-among-american-idol-contestants|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615080941/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-still-favourite-among-american-idol-contestants|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 June 2013|accessdate=25 September 2013|newspaper=The Official Celine Dion Site|date=20 May 2013}}</ref>

==Cultural impact==
On a cultural level, Dion is credited for introducing francophone music to many non-francophone countries around the globe. Her albums ''[[D'eux]]'' and ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' remain the best selling francophone albums in history, gaining unprecedented success in non-Francophone markets such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece, Austria, Japan, and New Zealand.

==Personal life==
[[File:Céline Dion René Angelil 2012.jpg|thumb|Dion and husband [[René Angélil]] in 2012]]
As the youngest of 14 children, Dion grew up wearing hand-me-downs and sharing a bed with several sisters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/09/best-dressed-list-2019|title=Vanity Fair 2019 Best Dressed List|last=Bullock|first=Maggie|date=5 September 2019|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> As a baby, she slept in a drawer to save on a crib.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/01/celine-dion-201201|title=Caesars Princess|last=Heilpern|first=John|date=14 December 2011|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref> She was bullied at school and called "Vampire", owing to her teeth and skinny frame.<ref name=":4" /> Local tabloids even dubbed her "Canine Dion" in the teenage years of her career.<ref name=":3" /> She often spoke of running home from school to play music in the basement with her brothers and sisters. "I detested school", she would later write in her autobiography. "I had always lived surrounded by adults and children a lot older than me. I learned everything I needed to know from them. As far as I was concerned, real life existed around them."<ref name=":2" /> Dion's eldest sister was already in her 20s, married, and pregnant with her first child at the time Dion's mother, [[Thérèse Dion|Thérèse]], was pregnant with Celine.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thérèse Dion : La Vie Est un Beau Voyage|last=Germain|first=Georges-Hébert|publisher=Libre Expression|year=2006|isbn=2764802978|location=Montreal|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/theresedionlavie0000germ}}</ref>

Dion first met [[René Angélil]], her future husband and manager, in 1980, when she was 12 and he was 38, after her brother, Michel Dondalinger Dion, had sent him a demonstration recording of "[[Ce n'était qu'un rêve]]" ("It Was Only a Dream/Nothing But A Dream"), a song she, her mother Thérèse, and her brother Jacques Dion had jointly written. Over subsequent years, Angélil guided her to stardom in francophone territories.

After the dissolution of Angélil's second marriage, he and Dion took a professional break and he spent the major part of the year in Las Vegas, while Dion was learning English and taking dance and singing lessons in Montreal. Upon his return, "he avoided being alone with me for too long a time",<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Story, My Dream|last=Dion|first=Celine|publisher=HarperCollins / Avon|year=2000|isbn=0380819058|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/celinedionmystor00dion/page/196 196]|url=https://archive.org/details/celinedionmystor00dion/page/196}}</ref> she said in her 2000 autobiography ''My Story, My Dream''.
