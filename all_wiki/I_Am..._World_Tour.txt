'''I Am... World Tour''' (sometimes referred to as the '''I Am... Tour''') was the fourth [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Beyoncé Knowles]] launched in support of her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The tour was announced in October 2008 embarked in March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. The tour consisted of 108 shows in total, visiting the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Preparations for the shows began eight months prior to the beginning of the tour with twelve-hour rehearsals for two months. Knowles described the shows as her best and most theatrical from all of her tours.

The [[set list]] for the concerts included songs from Knowles' three studio albums as well as several covers of other artists and a [[Destiny's Child]] medley. The central theme of the tour was to showcase the difference between Knowles' dual personality; her emotional side and her onstage persona, Sasha Fierce which was also demonstrated in the dual album ''I Am... Sasha Fierce''. The show featured two stages – the main one and a smaller [[B-stage]] where Knowles was transferred during the middle of the show. She was backed by an all-female band, female background dancers and a big [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] screen. [[Thierry Mugler]] collaborated with Knowles on the costumes and had a creative advisor role further working on the [[choreography]], [[lighting]] and production. [[Chris March]] made the costumes usable for stage and helped in their making. For the ballads, Knowles wore longer dresses while for the performances of the up-tempo songs, more make-up and more revealing outfits were worn. The fashion and Knowles' look and figure received praise from critics.

I Am... received acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]] who praised Knowles' performance abilities calling her the best female performer. A concert in Malaysia was cancelled by Knowles after several Muslim groups tried to ban it although she agreed to tone down her look according to the country's standards. The tour was commercially successful grossing $86.0 million from 93 shows in total. Separate performances of several songs were broadcast on different channels and two concerts were released as [[live album]]s; the live performance at the [[I Am... Yours]] revue was [[I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas|released]] in a [[CD]]/[[DVD]] format in 2009 and footage of the tour was released on the [[I Am... World Tour (album)|similarly titled live album]] in 2010.

In 2006, during an interview with [[MTV News]], Beyoncé introduced an aggressive alter ego, Sasha Fierce, which also served as her stage persona. She added that the persona is a complete opposite of her when not performing by characterizing her as "aggressive... strong... fearless."<ref name="fierceego">{{cite news |title=Beyonce Explains 'Fearless' Stage Persona In 2006 Interview |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1627106/beyonce-explains-fearless-stage-persona-2006-interview.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]].

Beyoncé revealed that the hardest aspect of coming up with the tour's set list was managing to fit her decade-long song catalogue in a two-hour show.<ref name="mama"/> According to her, the tour was supposed to be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience in order to reflect the "real[,] raw and more sensitive" nature of the ''I Am...'' portion of the double album.<ref name="mama"/> Beyoncé expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, thus "ruining" the surprise factor of the concert experience; however she also appreciated the fact that it can act as a "little sneak peek" for fans to decide if they indeed want to attend.<ref name="mama"/> French designer [[Thierry Mugler]] served as the creative advisor while also being responsible for Beyoncé's wardrobe. He contributed in the design of lighting, [[choreography]], production and directed three sequences for the concert.<ref name="claire">{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/289751/thierry-mugler-to-design-beyonce-tour.html|title=Thierry Mugler to design Beyoncé tour|date=December 4, 2008|access-date=December 28, 2009|work=[[Marie Claire]]|first=Lucy|last=Hutchings|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212082019/http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/289751/thierry-mugler-to-design-beyonce-tour.html|archive-date=December 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to his creative vision, the shows were intended to represent ''[[mise en scène|mise-en-scène]]'' by incorporating technical aspects with fashion in order to capture the emotions behind the songs. He added, "There will be a lot of dramatization and metamorphosis on stage. Some very strong effects have been inspired directly by Beyoncé, and only she could make [them] happen on stage."<ref name="chron" /><ref name="wwd.com" />

Onstage, Beyoncé was backed by her ten-piece all-female band, Suga Mama, which included two [[drummer]]s, two [[keyboardist]]s, a percussionist, a [[horn section]], three backup vocalists called the Mamas, and a lead [[guitarist]].<ref name="press" /><ref name="nytimes" /> The show featured two stages, namely a simple main stage with a pop0up set of stairs, an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] background screen, and glass risers for Suga Mama and The Mamas as well as a smaller [[B-stage]] in the midst of the audience for the later portions of the show. During the concerts, Beyoncé went through six costume changes; during the breaks, The Mamas harmonized.<ref name="sftimes" /><ref name="thrill" /> The [[set list]] included songs from all of Beyoncé's three studio albums that had been published, a [[Destiny's Child]] medley and several covers of other artists.<ref name="seattle" /> Several critics noted that the songs on the set list were divided into ballads and more up-tempo songs to coincide with the central theme of ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' – the dual personality of Beyoncé. Beyoncé's costumes were changed in order to coincide with the songs' nature; during performances of ballads, she wore longer white dresses while for the uptempo songs, she had more revealing outfits and make-up.<ref name="omh" />

Thierry Mugler served as the main [[costume designer]] for the tour. Beyoncé was acquainted to and enraptured by his work at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute]] Gala, titled "Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy" (2008) where she saw several of his [[haute couture]] pieces that were on display.<ref name="claire" /> Beyoncé discussed the possibility of using the costumes with [[Tina Knowles]].<ref name="chron">{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Thierry-Mugler-re-creates-Beyonce-as-a-fierce-diva-1741497.php|title=Thierry Mugler re-creates Beyonce as a fierce diva|work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] via [[Houston Chronicle]]|first=Michael|last=Quintanilla|date=April 29, 2009|access-date=June 10, 2013}}</ref> She met with Mugler in Paris in September of the same year and started exchanging ideas for costume designs and the following month he was contracted as the designer for the tour.<ref name="chron" /><ref name="march" /> While designing, the main concept Mugler wanted to illustrate was the duality between "being a woman and a warrior" through his own creative perception; the words "Feminine.

Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive.

A seventy one piece wardrobe was designed for Beyoncé and her dancers and band. For the shows, Beyoncé adopted ten different looks. American fashion designer [[Chris March]] also worked with Mugler ensuring the costumes were suitable for stage purposes.

{{quote box|width=23em|align=right|quote=Beyonce's entrance at the O2 makes the finale of '[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]' seem like an exercise in tasteful understatement. As dry ice gusts wildly about the stage and [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] horns blare, a statuesque silhouette appears, hand on hips, head tilted imperiously. Then the swelling intro to 'Crazy In Love' kicks in, the smoke clears, and there stands Beyonce, superhumanly buff and glamorous. You are left in no doubt that tonight you are in the presence of pop royalty ... There's so much glittering spectacle that you could be at a lavish [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] or a presidential inauguration ... Pop music doesn't get any smarter, sassier or more spectacular.

The tour received rave reviews from critics.

Ben Ratliff of ''The New York Times'' observed that the show would make spectators question themselves how the singer managed to put on a "dazzling show" both physically and organizationally; he further praised the singer's "hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference".<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben |title=Flash, Concepts and, Yes, Songs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/arts/music/23beyonce.html |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 22, 2009|access-date=May 23, 2009}}</ref> Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of ''[[The Belfast Telegraph]]'' described the show as "incredible... mind blowing...

She also praised the singer's "enviable" dancing skills, "spectacular production and audio visuals" but noted that some songs "let down" the performance by being less melodic.<ref name="perth" /> Jay Lustig of ''The Star-Ledger'' described the show as a "bona fide pop spectacle" with futuristic themes throughout.<ref name="nj.com" /> Jim Farber from the ''Daily News'' viewed the tour as "a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops" as compared to [[The Beyoncé Experience]] and added that "Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point".

Describing the show as simultaneously "spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick", Michael Cragg of [[musicOMH]] noted that the highlights included songs from the ''Sasha Fierce'' half of the album.<ref name="omh" /> Caryn Ganz of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine praised the show, lauding the singer for her work ethic and the ability to execute singing, dancing and posing at the same time.<ref name="rolltour" /> Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage to the center of the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again."<ref name="thrill" /> A writer of ''Billboard'' magazine noted that Knowles "brought all the fierceness" on stage for the tour.<ref name="billrev" /> ''[[The Australian]]''{{'}}s Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in "full view".<ref name="australian">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/arts-arc/choreographed-self-belief/story-e6frg8po-1225775188653|title=Choreographed self-belief|work=[[The Australian]]|first=Patrick|last=Emery|date=September 17, 2009|access-date=June 15, 2013}}</ref> Comparing her performance with [[Michael Jackson]]'s live shows, Renee Michelle Harris of the ''South Florida Times'' writes, "[Knowles] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves".<ref name="sftimes">{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Renee Michelle|title=Beyoncé Wows Crowd at BankAtlantic Center|url=http://www.sfltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2977&Itemid=1 |work=South Florida Times|date=July 3, 2009|access-date=July 3, 2009}}</ref> Holly Burnes of ''The Daily Telegraph'' noted that the performance was almost inimitable and added "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever".<ref name="telegraphau">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/beyonce-knowles-and-sasha-fierce-unite-sydney-ladies-fans-at-concert/story-e6frexar-1225776869209|title=Beyonce Knowles and Sasha Fierce unite Sydney ladies, fans at concert|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Holly|last=Burnes|date=September 19, 2009|access-date=June 15, 2013}}</ref>

Simon Colling from ''The West Australian'' described the performance as "powerhouse" and added, "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R&B) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, [[Aretha Franklin]] and rapper [[Missy Elliott]]... [and] [[Mariah Carey]]". Joanna Horowitz of ''The Seattle Times'' noted that despite the inclusion of almost 10 different musical styles in the show's set list, the singer's "own [musical] signature" and focus were lacking. Nevertheless, Horowitz praised the singer's performing skills and summarized the concert as "a hip-hop [[Cirque du Soleil]] — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring".<ref name="seattle" /> ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s Barbara Ellen wrote, "she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years".<ref name="observer">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/24/beyonce|title=She's a woman of two halves|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Barbara|last=Ellen|date=May 24, 2009|access-date=June 15, 2013}}</ref> However, she noted that Knowles is "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical."<ref name="observer" /> Noting influences by [[Tina Turner]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] during the tour, Ann Powers of ''Los Angeles Times'' writes: "And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, with a combination of power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations ... Indeed, her production can be seen as a retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream."<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/13/entertainment/et-beyonce13|title=Pop Music Review – Live: Beyoncé at Honda Center|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Ann|last=Powers|author-link=Ann Powers|date=July 13, 2009|access-date=June 15, 2013}}</ref>

Ben Ratliff of ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized the tour's concept as "the duality of well-meaning good girl and rapacious animal-robot-dance-titan."<ref name="nytimes" /> Jay Lustig of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' concluded that the album's split personality was reflected in the show naturally enough.<ref name="nj.com" /> However, Barbara Ellen of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote, "Another irritant is the much-trumpeted 'duality' nonsense with Sasha Fierce, Beyoncé's alter-ego for her latest album. All 'Sasha' does here is flail about in a video, no different from regular Beyoncé, except for a gold dress and a hairdo that veers dangerously towards Liberace."<ref name="observer" /> Similarly, [[Ann Powers]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the only thing which was not fully realized was the show's "overarching" theme, "Beyonce meant to represent herself as a split personality, tender and open on the one hand, indomitable and rather scary on the other. But Beyonce has chosen the wrong dichotomy to represent herself."<ref name="latimes" />

In September 2009, it was announced by the Associated Press that Knowles would be bringing her show to [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia on October 25, 2009, but it would be without some of her usual tricks. After encountering what became familiar opposition from religious groups in a predominantly Muslim country, Knowles agreed to tone down some parts of her act. A spokesperson for the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] stated: "We are against Western sexy performances; we don't think our people need that."<ref name="Malaysia" /> However, a rep soon came from the concert's Malaysian organizer, stating that "all parties have reached an amicable understanding" about the performance.<ref name="Malaysia" /> He went on saying that Knowles should be regarded as a "role model" and an "embodiment of success" because of her philanthropic work, including campaigns against poverty and domestic violence.<ref name="Malaysia" /> The Marctensia promoter further told the Associated Press: "We are confident that Beyoncé's concert will once and for all silence international critics and put Malaysia back on track and move up the ranks in presenting A-list international pop concerts in this region and further boost tourism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622241/beyonce-agrees-tone-down-concert-malaysian-date.jhtml|title=Beyonce Agrees To Tone Down Concert For Malaysian Date|publisher=MTV News.

However, it was ultimately announced in October 2009 that the concert has been postponed in the wake of accusations by Islamic conservatives that the show would be "immoral and unclean".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/398075/beyonc-branded-immoral-by-malay-muslims.html|title=Beyoncé Branded 'Immoral' by Malay Muslims|work=[[Marie Claire]]|access-date=June 15, 2013}}</ref> Malaysian promoter Marctensia said in a statement that the show has been postponed to a future date to be announced shortly, and added "The postponement is solely [the] decision of the artist and has nothing to with other external reasons."<ref name="cancellation" /> Another representative declined to comment on whether the show was postponed due to the heavy criticism it was receiving from religious leaders in the country.<ref name="Malaysia">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1624205/beyonces-malaysian-concert-postponed-again.jhtml|title=Beyonce's Malaysian Concert Postponed Again|publisher=MTV News.
