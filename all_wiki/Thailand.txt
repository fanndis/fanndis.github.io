Located at the centre of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochinese Peninsula]], it is composed of [[Provinces of Thailand|76 provinces]], and covers an area of 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), and a population of over 66 million people.<ref name="2019PopEst" /> Thailand is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|50th-largest country]] by land area, and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|22nd-most-populous country]] in the world. The capital and largest city is [[Bangkok]], a special administrative area. Thailand is [[Template:Borders of Thailand|bordered]] to the north by [[Myanmar]] and [[Laos]], to the east by [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], to the south by the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]], and to the west by the [[Andaman Sea]] and the southern extremity of Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include [[Vietnam]] in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and [[Indonesia]] and [[India]] on the Andaman Sea to the southwest. Nominally, Thailand is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]; however, in recent history, its government has experienced multiple [[Coup d'état|coups]] and periods of [[military dictatorship]]s.

[[Tai peoples]] migrated from southwestern China to mainland [[Southeast Asia]] from the 11th century; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Siamese'' dates to the 12th century. Various [[Indianised kingdoms]] such as the [[Mon kingdoms]], [[Khmer Empire]] and [[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay states]] ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of [[Ngoenyang]], [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]], [[Lan Na]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], which rivalled each other. Documented European contact began in 1511 with a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656–1688), gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–67)|1767 Burmese–Siamese War]]. [[Taksin]] (r. 1767–1782) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. He was succeeded in 1782 by [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke]] (r. 1782–1809), the first monarch of the current [[Chakri dynasty]].

Throughout the era of [[Western imperialism in Asia]], Siam remained the only nation in the region to avoid being [[Colonization|colonized]] by foreign powers, although the Siamese government was often forced to cede both territory and trade concessions in [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]. The Siamese system of government was centralized and transformed into modern unitary [[absolute monarchy]] in the reign of [[Chulalongkorn]] (r. 1868–1910). Siam joined [[World War I]] siding with the allies, a political decision to amend the unequal treaties. Following a bloodless [[Siamese revolution of 1932|revolution in 1932]], Siam became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to "Thailand". Thailand was a [[Thailand in World War II|satellite of Japan]] in [[World War II]]. In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. Thailand became a [[Major non-NATO ally|major ally]] of the [[United States]], and played a key [[Cold War|anti-communist role]] in the region as a member of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO). Apart from a [[1973 Thai popular uprising|brief period of parliamentary democracy]] in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. Since the 2000s, Thailand has been caught in a bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], which culminated in two coups, most recently [[2014 Thai coup d'état|in 2014]] and the establishment of its [[Constitution of Thailand#2017 Constitution|current and 20th constitution]] and faces the ongoing [[2020 Thai protests]].

Thailand is a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/usmu003.asp |title=American foreign policy. 1950–1955; basic documents |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2321k |title=22 U.S. Code §&nbsp;2321k – Designation of major non-NATO allies |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> Despite comparatively sporadic changes in leadership, it is considered a [[middle power]] in global affairs.<ref>Jonathan H.

=== Etymology of ''Siam'' ===
The country has always been called ''[[Mueang#Thailand|Mueang Thai]]'' by its citizens. By outsiders, prior to 1949, it was usually known by the [[exonym]] ''Siam'' ({{lang-th|{{linktext|สยาม}}}} {{RTGS|''sayam''}}, {{IPA-th|sajǎːm|pron}}, also spelled ''Siem'', ''Syâm'', or ''Syâma''). The word ''Siam'' may have originated from [[Pali]] (''suvaṇṇabhūmi'', 'land of gold') or [[Sanskrit]] श्याम (''śyāma'', 'dark') or [[Mon language|Mon]] ရာမည(''rhmañña'', 'stranger'). The names ''[[Shan people|Shan]]'' and ''[[Ahom people|A-hom]]'' seem to be variants of the same word. The word ''Śyâma'' is possibly not its origin, but a learned and artificial distortion.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Charles |title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (of 3) [EBook #16847] |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. |year=1921 |location=London |pages=Ch. xxxvii 1; citing in turn Footnote 189: The name is found on [[Champa]]n inscriptions of 1050 CE and according to Gerini appears in [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia|Samarade]] = Sâmaraṭṭha. See Gerini, Ptolemy, p. 170. But Samarade is near Bangkok and there can hardly have been Thais there in Ptolemy's time; and Footnote 190: So too in Central Asia Kustana appears to be a learned distortion of the name [[Khotan]], made to give it a meaning in Sanskrit}}</ref> Another theory is the name derives from Chinese: "Ayutthaya emerged as a dominant centre in the late 14th century. The Chinese called this region Xian, which the Portuguese converted into Siam."<ref name="chris05" />{{RP|8}} A further possibility is that [[Mon language|Mon]]-speaking peoples migrating south called themselves ''syem'' as do the autochthonous [[Mon-Khmer]]-speaking inhabitants of the [[Malay Peninsula]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

[[File:King Mongkut (Rama IV) of Siam Signature (English).svg|thumb|''SPPM Mongkut Rex Siamensium'', [[King Mongkut]]'s signature]]
The signature of King [[Mongkut]] (r. 1851–1868) reads ''SPPM'' (Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha) ''Mongkut Rex Siamensium'' (Mongkut King of the Siamese), giving the name ''Siam'' official status until 24 June 1939 when it was changed to "Thailand".<ref name="ThaiCSM">[http://www.csmngt.com/thailand_history.htm Thailand (Siam) History], CSMngt-Thai. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424080811/http://www.csmngt.com/thailand_history.htm |date=24 April 2015}}</ref> Thailand was renamed ''Siam'' from 1946 to 1948, after which it again reverted to "Thailand".

=== Etymology of "Thailand" ===
According to [[George Cœdès]], the word ''Thai'' ({{linktext|ไทย}}) means 'free man' in the Thai language, "differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs".<ref name=Coedes-1968>{{cite book|last=Cœdès|first= George|author-link= George Cœdès|editor= Walter F.

While Thai people will often refer to their country using the polite form ''prathet Thai'' ({{lang-th|ประเทศไทย}}), they most commonly use the more colloquial term ''mueang Thai'' ({{lang-th|เมืองไทย}}) or simply ''Thai;'' the word ''[[mueang]]'', archaically referring to a city-state, is commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of a region. ''Ratcha Anachak Thai'' ({{lang-th|ราชอาณาจักรไทย}}) means 'kingdom of Thailand' or 'kingdom of Thai'. Etymologically, its components are: ''ratcha'' ({{lang-sa|राजन्}}, ''[[rājan]]'', 'king, royal, realm'); ''-ana-'' ([[Pali]] ''āṇā'' 'authority, command, power', itself from the Sanskrit {{lang|sa|आज्ञा}}, ''ājñā'', of the same meaning) ''-chak'' (from Sanskrit {{lang|sa|{{linktext|चक्र}}}} ''cakra-'' 'wheel', a symbol of power and rule). The [[Thai National Anthem]] ({{lang-th|เพลงชาติ}}), written by [[Luang Saranupraphan]] during the patriotic 1930s, refers to the Thai nation as ''prathet Thai'' ({{lang-th|ประเทศไทย}}). The first line of the national anthem is: ''prathet thai ruam lueat nuea chat chuea thai'' ({{lang-th|ประเทศไทยรวมเลือดเนื้อชาติเชื้อไทย}}), 'Thailand is the unity of Thai flesh and blood'.

After the decline of the Khmer Empire and [[Pagan Kingdom|Kingdom of Pagan]] in the early-13th century, various states thrived in their place. The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the [[Malay peninsula]].<ref name="wyatt" />{{rp|38–9}} During the 13th century, Tai people had already settled in the core land of [[Dvaravati]] and [[Lavo Kingdom]] to [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]] in the south. There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais.<ref name="wyatt" />{{rp|50–1}}

Around 1240, [[Si Inthrathit|Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao]], a local Tai ruler, rallied the people to rebel against the Khmer. He later crowned himself the first king of [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in 1238.<ref name="wyatt" />{{rp|52–3}} Mainstream Thai historians count Sukhothai as the first kingdom of Thai people. Sukhothai expanded furthest during the reign of [[Ram Khamhaeng]] (r. 1279–1298). However, it was mostly a network of local lords who swore fealty to Sukhothai, not directly controlled by it.<ref name="wyatt" />{{rp|55–6}} He is believed have invented [[Thai script]] and Thai ceramics were an important export in his era. Sukhothai embraced [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] in the reign of [[Maha Thammaracha I]] (1347–1368).

To the north, [[Mangrai]], who descended from a local ruler lineage of [[Ngoenyang]], founded the kingdom of [[Lan Na]] in 1292, centered in [[Chiang Mai]]. He unified the surrounding area and his dynasty would rule the kingdom continuously for the next two centuries. He also created a network of states through political alliances to the east and north of the [[Mekong]].<ref name="chris05" />{{rp|8}} While in the port in Lower Chao Phraya Basin, a federation around [[Phetchaburi]], [[Suphan Buri]], [[Lopburi]], and the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] area was created in the 11th century.<ref name="chris05" />{{rp|8}}

According to the most widely accepted version of its origin, the Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby [[Lavo Kingdom]] and Suvarnabhumi with [[Uthong]] as its first king. Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the [[Mandala (political model)|mandala system]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Higham |first=Charles |title=The Archaeology of Mainland Southeast Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ifNH4uK0LAC&pg=PA355 |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-27525-3 |accessdate=6 September 2009 }}</ref>{{rp|355}} Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage. Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital [[Angkor]].<ref name="ชาญวิทย์">{{cite book |last=เกษตรศิริ |first=ชาญวิทย์ |date=2005 |title=อยุธยา: ประวัติศาสตร์และการเมือง |publisher=โรงพิมพ์มหาวิทยาลัยธรรมศาสตร์ |isbn=978-974-91572-7-5 }}</ref>{{rp|26}} Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom. [[Borommatrailokkanat]] brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called ''[[sakdina]]'', where male commoners were conscripted as [[corvée]] labourers for six months a year.<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|107}} Ayutthaya was interested in the [[Malay peninsula]], but failed to conquer the [[Malacca Sultanate]] which was supported by the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name="loc" />{{rp|11, 13}}

European contact and trade started in the early-16th century, with the [[Duarte Fernandes|envoy]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] duke [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1511,  Portugal became an allied and ceded some soldiers to King Rama Thibodi II.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ayutthaya history Foreign Settlements|url=https://www.ayutthaya-history.com/Settlements_Portuguese.html}}</ref> The Portuguese were followed in the 17th century by the French, Dutch, and English. Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and the Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against the Burmese Kingdom. Several wars with its ruling dynasty [[Taungoo Dynasty]] starting in the 1540s in the reign of [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] were ultimately ended with the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1568–70)|capture of the capital in 1570]].<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|146–7}} Then was a brief period of vassalage to Burma until [[Naresuan]] proclaimed independence in 1584.<ref name="chris05">{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Christopher |first2=Pasuk|last2=Phongpaichit|date=2014|title=A History of Thailand|location=Singapore|publisher=C.O.S Printers Pte Ltd|isbn=978-1-107-42021-2}}</ref>{{rp|11}}

Ayutthaya then sought to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656–1688) when some European travelers regarded Ayutthaya as an Asian great power, alongside China and India.<ref name="chris" />{{rp|ix}} However, growing French influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and led eventually to the [[Siamese revolution of 1688]].<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|185–6}} However, overall relations remained stable, with French missionaries still active in preaching Christianity.<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|186}}

After a bloody period of dynastic struggle, Ayutthaya entered into what has been called the Siamese "[[golden age]]", a relatively peaceful episode in the second quarter of the 18th century when [[Thai art|art]], [[Thai literature|literature]], and learning flourished. There were seldom foreign wars, apart from conflict with the [[Nguyễn Lords]] for control of [[Cambodia]] starting around 1715. The last fifty years of the kingdom witnessed bloody succession crises, where there were purges of court officials and able generals for many consecutive reigns. In 1765, a combined 40,000-strong force of Burmese armies [[Burmese–Siamese War (1759–60)|invaded it]] from the north and west.<ref name="Harvey-1925">{{cite book | last=Harvey|first=G E |title=History of Burma|publisher=Frank Cass & Co.

=== Thonburi Kingdom ===
{{Main|Thonburi Kingdom}}
[[File:KingTaksin's coronation.jpg|thumb|right|[[Taksin the Great]] enthroned himself as a Thai king, 1767-12-28.]]
The capital and much territories lied in chaos after the war. The former capital was occupied by the [[Burma|Burmese]] garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, [[Pimai]], [[Chanthaburi]], and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. [[Taksin|Chao Tak]], a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by [[right of conquest]],  beginning with the legendary sack of [[Chanthaburi]]. Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the [[Chao Phraya]] to take the fort of [[Thonburi]]. In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city.<ref>จรรยา ประชิตโรมรัน. (2548). สมเด็จพระเจ้าตากสินมหาราช. สำนักพิมพ์แห่งจุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย. หน้า 55</ref>

Chao Tak then crowned himself as [[Taksin]] and proclaimed [[Thonburi]] as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with Burma, Laos, and Cambodia, which successfully drove the Burmese out of Lan Na in 1775,<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|225}} captured [[Vientiane]] in 1778<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|227–8}} and tried to install a pro-Thai king in Cambodia in the 1770s. In his final years there was a coup, caused supposedly by his "insanity", and eventually Taksin and his sons were executed by his longtime companion General [[Rama I|Chao Phraya Chakri]] (the future Rama I). He was the first king of the ruling [[Chakri Dynasty]] and founder of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] on 6 April 1782.

A [[Siamese revolution of 1932|bloodless revolution]] took place in 1932, carried out by a group of military and civilian officials [[Khana Ratsadon]]. [[Prajadhipok]] was forced to grant the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of [[absolute monarchy]].

Constant unrest and instability, as well as fear of a communist takeover after the [[fall of Saigon]], made some ultra-right groups brand leftist students as communists.<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|548}} This culminated in the [[Thammasat University massacre]] in October 1976.<ref name="Wyatttrans" />{{rp|548–9}} A coup d'état on that day brought Thailand a new ultra-right government, which cracked down on media outlets, officials, and intellectuals, and fuelled the [[Communist insurgency in Thailand|communist insurgency]]. Another coup the following year installed a more moderate government, which offered amnesty to communist fighters in 1978.

Fueled by [[Indochina refugee crisis]], [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|Vietnamese border raids]] and economic hardships, [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] launched a successful coup and became the Prime Minister from 1980 to 1988. The communists abandoned the insurgency by 1983. Prem's premiership was dubbed "semi-democracy" because the Parliament was composed of all elected House and all appointed Senate. The 1980s also saw increasing intervention in politics by the monarch, who rendered two coup attempts against Prem failed. Thailand had its first elected prime minister in 1988.<ref name="bri31">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/The-postwar-crisis-and-the-return-of-Phibunsongkhram#ref52686 |title=Partial democracy and the search for a new political order|website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=11 March 2018 }}</ref>

[[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], who was [[National Peace Keeping Council|the coup leader in 1991]] and said he would not seek to become prime minister, was nominated as one by the majority coalition government after the [[March 1992 Thai general election|1992 general election]]. This caused a popular demonstration in Bangkok, which ended with [[Black May (1992)|a military crackdown]]. Bhumibol intervened in the event and Suchinda then resigned.

Prior to 1932, Thai kings were [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchs]]. During [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the king was seen as a ''Dharmaraja'' or 'king who rules in accordance with [[Dharma]]'. The system of government was a network of tributaries ruled by local lords. Modern absolute monarchy and statehood was established by Chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralized protectorate system into a unitary state. On 24 June 1932, [[Khana Ratsadon]] (People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution which marked the beginning of [[constitutional monarchy]].

Thailand has had 20 constitutions and charters since 1932, including the latest and current 2017 Constitution. Throughout this time, the form of government has ranged from military dictatorship to electoral democracy.<ref name="multiple">{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060919/thailand_coups_060919/20060919/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016060633/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060919/thailand_coups_060919/20060919/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 October 2007 |title=A list of previous coups in Thailand |agency=Associated Press |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,214562,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706035133/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C214562%2C00.html |archive-date=6 July 2008 |title=Raw Data: List of Recent Coups in Thailand's History |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Thailand has had the fourth-most [[Coup d'état|coups]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siamintelligence.com/thai-forth-coup-0f-the-world/ |script-title=th:สถิติที่ไม่น่าภูมิใจเมื่อไทยติดอันดับที่ 4 ประเทศที่มีการรัฐประหารบ่อยที่สุดในโลก |website=Siam Intelligence |language=th}}</ref> "Uniformed or ex-military men have led Thailand for 55 of the 83 years" between 1932 and 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Denis D.|title=Deadly bombing in military-ruled Thailand adds to mounting woes in one-time 'Land of Smiles'|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/08/22/bombing-the-latest-of-many-challenges-for-thailands-junta|accessdate=23 August 2015|work=U.S. News & World Report|agency=Associated Press|date=22 August 2015}}</ref> Most recently, the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] ruled the country between 2014 and 2019.

The politics of Thailand is conducted within the framework of a [[constitutional monarchy]], whereby a [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarch]] serves as [[head of state]]. The current King of Thailand is [[Vajiralongkorn]] (or Rama X), who has reigned since October 2016. The powers of the king are limited by the constitution and he is primarily a symbolic figurehead. The monarch is head of the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|armed forces]] and is required to be Buddhist as well as the [[Defender of the Faith]]. He has the power to appoint his heirs, the power to grant pardons, and the [[Royal Assent|royal assent]]. The king is aided in his duties by the [[Privy Council of Thailand]]. However, the monarch still occasionally intervenes in Thai politics, as all constitutions pave the way for customary royal rulings. The monarchy is widely revered and [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]] is a severe crime in Thailand.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Thailand}}
[[File:Thailand BMNG.png|thumb|left|A satellite image of Thailand.]]

Totalling {{convert|513120|km2}}, Thailand is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|50th-largest country]] by total area. It is slightly smaller than [[Yemen]] and slightly larger than [[Spain]].<ref name=CIA />

Thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups. The north of the country is the mountainous area of the [[Thai highlands]], with the highest point being [[Doi Inthanon]] in the [[Thanon Thong Chai Range]] at {{Convert|2565|m|0}} above sea level. The northeast, [[Isan]], consists of the [[Khorat Plateau]], bordered to the east by the [[Mekong River]]. The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat [[Chao Phraya]] river valley, which runs into the [[Gulf of Thailand]].

Southern Thailand consists of the narrow [[Kra Isthmus]] that widens into the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Politically, there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population, basic resources, natural features, and level of social and economic development. The diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of Thailand's physical setting.

The Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the indispensable water courses of rural Thailand. Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries. The Gulf of Thailand covers {{convert|320000|km2|-3}} and is fed by the Chao Phraya, [[Mae Klong River|Mae Klong]], [[Bang Pakong River|Bang Pakong]], and [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi]] Rivers. It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the Kra Isthmus. The eastern shore of the Gulf of Thailand is an industrial centre of Thailand with the kingdom's premier deepwater port in [[Sattahip District|Sattahip]] and its busiest commercial port, [[Laem Chabang]].

The [[Andaman Sea]] is a precious natural resource as it hosts popular and luxurious resorts. [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], [[Krabi]], [[Ranong]], [[Phang Nga]] and [[Trang Province|Trang]], and their islands, all lay along the coasts of the Andaman Sea and, despite the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]], they remain a tourist magnet.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main|Organization of the government of Thailand|Provinces of Thailand}}
{{See also|Regions of Thailand}}
Thailand is a [[unitary state]]; the administrative services of the executive branch are divided into three levels by ''National Government Organisation Act, BE 2534'' (1991): central, provincial and local. Thailand is composed of 76<!--not 77, Bangkok is not a province, see next sentence!--> [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]] ({{lang|th|จังหวัด}}, changwat), which are first-level [[administrative division]]s.{{cn|date=October 2020}} There are also two specially governed districts: the capital [[Bangkok]] and [[Pattaya]]. Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province. Each province is divided into [[amphoe|districts]] ({{lang|th|อำเภอ}}, amphoe) and the districts are further divided into sub-districts ({{lang|th|ตำบล}}, tambons). The name of each province's capital city ({{lang|th|เมือง}}, mueang) is the same as that of the province. For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (''Changwat Chiang Mai'') is ''Mueang Chiang Mai'' or ''Chiang Mai''. All provincial governors and district chiefs, which are administrators of provinces and districts respectively, are appointed by the central government.<ref>{{cite web|title=LOCAL PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION B.E. 2542 (1999)|url=http://www.dla.go.th/upload/enDocument/2012/6/1_1.pdf|website=Department of Local Administration (DLA)|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> Thailand's provinces are sometimes grouped into four to six regions, depending on the source.

The foreign relations of Thailand are handled by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Thailand participates fully in international and regional organisations. It is a [[major non-NATO ally]] and Priority Watch List [[Special 301 Report]] of the United States. The country remains an active member of ASEAN [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. Thailand has developed increasingly close ties with other ASEAN members: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, whose foreign and economic ministers hold annual meetings. Regional co-operation is progressing in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters. In 2003, Thailand served as [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) host. Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, currently serves as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In 2005 Thailand attended the inaugural East Asia Summit.

In recent years, Thailand has taken an increasingly active role on the international stage. When [[East Timor]] gained independence from Indonesia, Thailand, for the first time in its history, contributed troops to the international peacekeeping effort. Its troops remain there today as part of a UN peacekeeping force. As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand has reached out to such regional organisations as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thailand has contributed troops to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Thaksin initiated negotiations for several [[free trade agreement]]s with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. The latter especially was criticised, with claims that uncompetitive Thai industries could be wiped out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ftawatch.org/ |title=FTA Watch Group website |publisher=Ftawatch.org |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822090332/http://www.ftawatch.org/ |archive-date=22 August 2009  }}</ref>

Thaksin also announced that Thailand would forsake foreign aid, and work with donor countries to assist in the development of neighbours in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/thaksins-chance-leading-role-region |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |title=Thaksin's Chance for Leading Role in the Region |date=10 March 2004 |author=John D.

Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack.

Abhisit appointed Peoples Alliance for Democracy leader Kasit Piromya as foreign minister. In April 2009, fighting broke out between Thai and Cambodian troops on territory immediately adjacent to the 900-year-old ruins of Cambodia's [[Preah Vihear Temple|Preah Vihear]] Hindu temple near the border. The Cambodian government claimed its army had killed at least four Thais and captured 10 more, although the Thai government denied that any Thai soldiers were killed or injured. Two Cambodian and three Thai soldiers were killed. Both armies blamed the other for firing first and denied entering the other's territory.<ref>The Telegraph, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/5101029/Troops-from-Thailand-and-Cambodia-fight-on-border.html Troops from Thailand and Cambodia fight on border] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523080330/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/5101029/Troops-from-Thailand-and-Cambodia-fight-on-border.html |date=23 May 2010 }}, 3 April 2009</ref><ref>Bloomberg, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=a2G.h3Ms.a3s&refer=asia Thai, Cambodian Border Fighting Stops, Thailand Says] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014072312/http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080 |date=14 October 2007 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>

The private sector of education is well developed and significantly contributes to the overall provision of education which the government would not be able to meet with public establishments. Education is compulsory up to and including age 14, with the government providing free education through to age 17. Thailand is the 3rd most popular study destination in [[Asean]]. The number of international degree students in Thailand increased by fully 979% between 1999 and 2012, from 1,882 to 20,309 students.

Teaching relies heavily on [[rote learning]] rather than on student-centred methodology. The establishment of reliable and coherent curricula for its primary and secondary schools is subject to such rapid changes that schools and their teachers are not always sure what they are supposed to be teaching, and authors and publishers of textbooks are unable to write and print new editions quickly enough to keep up with the volatility. Issues concerning university entrance has been in constant upheaval for a number of years. Nevertheless, Thai education has seen its greatest progress in the years since 2001.

=== Recent economic history ===
[[File:Bangkok (251385359).jpeg|thumb|[[Sathorn]] in Bangkok is a skyscraper-studded business district that is home to major hotels and embassies.]]

Thailand experienced the world's highest economic growth rate from 1985 to 1996 – averaging 12.4% annually. In 1997 increased pressure on the [[Thai baht|baht]], a year in which the economy contracted by 1.9%, led to a crisis that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] administration to [[Floating exchange rate|float the currency]]. Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was forced to resign after his cabinet came under fire for its slow response to the economic crisis. The baht was pegged at 25 to the US dollar from 1978 to 1997. The baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the US dollar in January 1998 and the economy contracted by 10.8% that year, triggering the [[Asian financial crisis]].

Thailand's economy started to recover in 1999, expanding 4.2–4.4% in 2000, thanks largely to strong exports. Growth (2.2%) was dampened by the softening of the global economy in 2001, but picked up in the subsequent years owing to strong growth in Asia, a relatively weak baht encouraging exports, and increased domestic spending as a result of several mega projects and incentives of Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], known as [[Thaksinomics]]. Growth in 2002, 2003, and 2004 was 5–7% annually.

Growth in 2005, 2006, and 2007 hovered around 4–5%. Due both to the weakening of the US dollar and an increasingly strong Thai currency, by March 2008 the dollar was hovering around the 33 baht mark. While Thaksinomics has received criticism, official economic data reveals that between 2001 and 2011, Isan's GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area increased from US$7,900 to nearly US$13,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thai northeast vows poll payback to Shinawatra clan|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iMeE4IHFr1q7Rr-eX5J1UmL3gcZQ?docId=b69c47e3-e4f5-4c32-8679-3d7ce5f040a3|accessdate=8 February 2014|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=31 January 2014|last=Jones|first=Aidan}}</ref>

With the instability surrounding major 2010 protests, the GDP growth of Thailand settled at around 4–5%, from highs of 5–7% under the previous civilian administration. Political uncertainty was identified as the primary cause of a decline in investor and consumer confidence. The IMF predicted that the Thai economy would rebound strongly from the low 0.1% GDP growth in 2011, to 5.5% in 2012 and then 7.5% in 2013, due to the monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand, as well as a package of fiscal stimulus measures introduced by the former [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |title=Thailand Economy To Rebound Strongly In 2012 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |last=Phromchanya |first=Phisanu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015133916/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |archive-date=15 October 2015  }}</ref>

[[File:Thailand Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.15|A proportional representation of Thailand's exports]]
The economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP). Thailand exports over US$105 billion worth of goods and services annually.<ref name=CIA /> Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, [[Rice production in Thailand|rice]], textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery.<ref name=CIA />

Substantial industries include electric appliances, components, computer components, and vehicles. Thailand's recovery from the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis depended mainly on exports, among various other factors. {{as of|2012}}, the [[Automotive industry in Thailand|Thai automotive industry]] was the largest in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|9th largest in the world]].<ref name=BkP>{{cite journal | journal = Bangkok Post | title = 2-million milestone edges nearer | url =http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/economics/308171/2-million-milestone-edges-nearer | first = Santan | last = Santivimolnat | date = 18 August 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://thailand-business-news.com/business/43750-thailand-poised-to-surpass-car-production-target|title=Thailand poised to Surpass Car Production target|last=Languepin|first=Olivier|date=3 January 2013|work=Thailand Business News|accessdate=20 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115152809/http://thailand-business-news.com/business/43750-thailand-poised-to-surpass-car-production-target|archive-date=15 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=OICA>{{cite web | title = Production Statistics | publisher = OICA (International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers) | url = http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ | accessdate = 26 November 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131106174001/http://www.oica.net/category/production-statistics/ | archive-date = 6 November 2013 }}</ref> The Thailand industry has an annual output of near 1.5 million vehicles, mostly commercial vehicles.<ref name=OICA />

Asian tourists primarily visit Thailand for Bangkok and the historical, natural, and cultural sights in its vicinity. Western tourists not only visit Bangkok and surroundings, but in addition many travel to the southern beaches and islands. The north is the chief destination for trekking and [[adventure travel]] with its diverse ethnic minority groups and forested mountains. The region hosting the fewest tourists is [[Isan]].

Thailand is a large producer of natural gas, with reserves of at least 10 trillion cubic feet. After Indonesia, it is the largest coal producer in SE Asia, but must import additional coal to meet domestic demand.

=== Informal economy ===
Thailand has a diverse and robust informal labour sector—in 2012, it was estimated that informal workers comprised 62.6% of the Thai workforce. The [[Ministry of Labour (Thailand)|Ministry of Labour]] defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labour Protection Act (LPA). The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialised and service-oriented.<ref name=":2">Kongtip, Pornpimol et al. "Informal Workers in Thailand: Occupational Health and Social Security Disparities". ''New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS'' 25.2 (2015): 189–211. ''PMC''. Web. 12 March 2018.</ref> Between 1993 and 1995, ten percent of the Thai labour force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector. It is estimated that between 1988 and 1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled.<ref name=":6">{{cite book|title=Disposable People : New Slavery in the Global Economy|url=https://archive.org/details/disposablepeople00bale_0|url-access=registration|last1=Bales|first1=Kevin|website=ProQuest Ebook Central|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> While the Asian Financial Crisis that followed in 1997 hit the Thai economy hard, the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation, as Thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the IMF and World Bank. These reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatisation and trade liberalisation in the country, and decreased federal subsidisation of public goods and utilities, agricultural price supports, and regulations on fair wages and labour conditions.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Guille|first=Howard|date=2014|title=Reforming Asian Labor Systems: Economic Tensions and Worker Dissent|journal=Asian Studies Review|volume=39}}</ref> These changes put further pressure on the agricultural sector, and prompted continued migration from the rural countryside to the growing cities. Many migrant farmers found work in Thailand's growing manufacturing industry, and took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labour regulations and often exploitative conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol4/89-F10110.pdf|title=The Role of Informal Sector in Thailand|last=Warunsiri|first=Sasiwimon|date=2011|website=Research Institute for Policy Evaluation and Design}}</ref>

Those that could not find formal factory work, including illegal migrants and the families of rural Thai migrants that followed their relatives to the urban centres, turned to the informal sector to provide the extra support needed for survival—under the widespread regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programs, one family member working in a factory or sweatshop made very little. Scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of Thailand's labour reforms in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state. This can be described as the "externalisation of market risk", meaning that as the country's labour market became increasingly deregulated, the burden and responsibility of providing an adequate livelihood shifted from employers and the state to the workers themselves, whose families had to find jobs in the informal sector to make up for the losses and subsidise the wages being made by their relatives in the formal sector. The weight of these economic changes hit migrants and the urban poor especially hard, and the informal sector expanded rapidly as a result.<ref name=":3" />

Today, informal labour in Thailand is typically broken down into three main groups: subcontracted/self employed/home-based workers, service workers (including those that are employed in restaurants, as street vendors, masseuses, taxi drivers, and as domestic workers), and agricultural workers. Not included in these categories are those that work in entertainment, nightlife, and the sex industry. Individuals employed in these facets of the informal labour sector face additional vulnerabilities, including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking.<ref name=":2" />

In general, education levels are low in the informal sector. A 2012 study found that 64% of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school. Many informal workers are also migrants, only some of which have legal status in the country. Education and citizenship are two main barriers to entry for those looking to work in formal industries, and enjoy the labour protections and social security benefits that come along with formal employment. Because the informal labour sector is not recognised under the Labour Protection Act (LPA), informal workers are much more vulnerable labour to exploitation and unsafe working conditions than those employed in more formal and federally recognised industries. While some Thai labour laws provide minimal protections to domestic and agricultural workers, they are often weak and difficult to enforce. Furthermore, Thai social security policies fail to protect against the risks many informal workers face, including workplace accidents and compensation as well as unemployment and retirement insurance. Many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment, and many do not make a living wage.<ref name=":2" /> As a result, labour trafficking is common in the region, affecting children and adults, men and women, and migrants and Thai citizens alike.

Thailand had a population of 66,558,935 as of 2019.<ref name="2019PopEst" /> Thailand's population is largely rural, concentrated in the rice-growing areas of the central, northeastern and northern regions. About 45.7% of Thailand's population lived in urban areas {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, concentrated mostly in and around the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Area]].

Thailand's government-sponsored family planning program resulted in a dramatic decline in population growth from 3.1% in 1960 to around 0.4% today. In 1970, an average of 5.7 people lived in a Thai household. At the time of the 2010 census, the average Thai household size was 3.2 people.

The official language of Thailand is [[Thai language|Thai]], a [[Kra–Dai language]] closely related to [[Lao language|Lao]], [[Shan language|Shan]] in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from [[Hainan]] and [[Yunnan]] south to the Chinese border. It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the [[Thai alphabet]], an [[abugida]] script that evolved from the [[Khmer alphabet]].

Sixty-two languages were recognised by the Royal Thai Government in the 2011 Country Report to the UN Committee responsible for the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|''International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination'']], which employed an ethnolinguistic approach and is available from the Department of Rights and Liberties Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Justice.{{RP|3}} [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] is spoken in the southern provinces, and [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] is spoken in the provinces that were formerly part of the independent kingdom of [[Lan Na]]. For the purposes of the national census, which does not recognise all 62 languages recognised by the Royal Thai Government in the 2011 Country Report, four dialects of Thai exist; these partly coincide with regional designations.

The largest of Thailand's minority languages is the [[Lao language|Lao]] dialect of [[Isan language|Isan]] spoken in the northeastern provinces. Although sometimes considered a Thai dialect, it is a Lao dialect, and the region where it is traditionally spoken was historically part of the Lao kingdom of [[Lan Xang]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the far south, [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay]] is the primary language of Malay Muslims. Varieties of Chinese are also spoken by the large [[Thai Chinese]] population, with the [[Teochew dialect]] best-represented.

Numerous tribal languages are also spoken, including many [[Austroasiatic languages]] such as [[Mon language|Mon]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Vietnamese language|Viet]], [[Mlabri language|Mlabri]] and [[Aslian languages|Orang Asli]]; [[Austronesian languages]] such as [[Cham language|Cham]] and [[Moken language|Moken]]; [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] like [[Lawa language|Lawa]], [[Akha language|Akha]], and [[Karen languages|Karen]]; and other [[Tai languages]] such as [[Tai Yo language|Tai Yo]], [[Phu Thai language|Phu Thai]], and [[Saek language|Saek]]. [[Hmong language|Hmong]] is a member of the [[Hmong–Mien languages]], which is now regarded as a language family of its own.

English is a mandatory school subject, but the number of fluent speakers remains low, especially outside cities.

Thailand's most prevalent religion is [[Theravada Buddhism]], which is an integral part of Thai identity and culture. Active participation in Buddhism is among the highest in the world. Thailand has the second-largest number of [[Buddhist]]s in the world after China.<ref name="PewDec2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|title=The Global Religious Landscape|date=December 2012|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=5 November 2018}}</ref> According to the 2000 census, 94.6% and 93.58% in 2010 of the country's population self-identified as Buddhists of the Theravada tradition.

[[File:Phutthamonthon Buddha.JPG|thumb|''[[Samanera]]'' of [[Theravada Buddhism]], the most practised religion in Thailand.]]

Islam is concentrated mostly in the country's southernmost provinces: [[Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Satun Province|Satun]], [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]], and part of [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]] [[Chumphon Province|Chumphon]], which are predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], most of whom are [[Sunni Muslim]]s. Christians represented 1.17% (2015) of the population in 2015, with the remaining population consisting of [[Hinduism in Thailand#Thailand|Hindus]] and [[Sikhism in Thailand|Sikhs]], who live mostly in the country's cities. There is also a small but historically significant [[Jews and Judaism in Thailand|Jewish community in Thailand]] dating back to the 17th century.

The constitution does not name official state religion, and provides for freedom of religion. Even the authority formally does not register new religious groups that have not been accepted and limit the number of missionaries, unregistered religious organisations as well as missionaries who are allowed to operate freely. There have been no widespread reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.<ref>United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

Health and medical care is overseen by the [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] (MOPH), along with several other non-ministerial government agencies, with total national expenditures on health amounting to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2009. [[Non-communicable disease]]s form the major burden of morbidity and mortality, while infectious diseases including malaria and tuberculosis, as well as traffic accidents, are also important public health issues. The current Minister for Public Health is [[Anutin Charnvirakul]].

In December 2018 the interim parliament voted to legalise the use of [[cannabis]] for medical reasons. Recreational use remained unlawful. The National Legislative Assembly had 166 votes in favour of the amendment to the Narcotics Bill, while there were no nay votes and 13 abstentions.

Thai culture and traditions incorporate a great deal of influence from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia. Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity. [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from [[Hinduism]], [[animism]], as well as ancestor worship. The [[Thai solar calendar|official calendar]] in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]] (BE). Thai identity today is a [[Thaification|social construct]] of [[Phibun]] regime in 1940s.

Several ethnic groups mediated change between their traditional local culture, national Thai, and global cultural influences. [[Overseas Chinese]] also form a significant part of Thai society, particularly in and around Bangkok. Their successful integration into Thai society has allowed them to hold positions of economic and political power. Thai Chinese businesses prosper as part of the larger [[bamboo network]].<ref name="Weidenbaum">{{cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/bamboonetworkhow00weid|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bamboonetworkhow00weid/page/4 4]–8}}</ref>

''[[Thai greeting|Wai]]'' is traditional Thai greeting, and is generally offered first by person who is younger or lower in social status and position. Respects for elderly (by age, position, monks, or certain professions) is Thai [[mores]]. As with other Asian cultures, respect towards ancestors is an essential part of Thai spiritual practice. Thais have strong sense of social hierarchy, reflecting in many classes of [[Thai honorifics|honorifics]]. Seniority is paramount in Thai culture. Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies. Older siblings have duties to younger ones.

Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity.

Taboos in Thailand include touching someone's head or pointing with the feet, as the head is considered the most sacred and the foot the lowest part of the body.

=== Art ===
{{Main|Thai art}}
[[File:WatPhraKeaw Ramayana Chariot.JPG|thumb|Scene from the [[Ramakien]] depicted on a mural at [[Wat Phra Kaew]].]]

The origins of Thai art were very much influenced by [[Buddhist art]] and by scenes from the Indian epics. Traditional Thai [[sculpture]] almost exclusively depicts [[Buddha image|images of the Buddha]], being very similar with the other styles from [[Southeast Asia]]. Traditional Thai [[painting]]s usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as [[palace]]s and [[temple]]s. Thai art was influenced by indigenous civilisations of the [[Dvaravati|Mon]] and other civilisations. By the Sukothai and Ayutthaya period, thai had developed into its own unique style and was later further influenced by the other Asian styles, mostly by [[Indian art|Sri Lankan]] and [[Chinese art|Chinese]]. Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/budartthai2.pdf|title=Buddhist Arts of Thailand}}</ref>

Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of [[Western world|Western]] influence in the mid-19th century. Monk artist [[Khrua In Khong]] is well known as the first artist to introduce [[linear perspective]] to Thai traditional art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/sightseeing/26933/wat-borommaniwat|title=Wat Borommaniwat|first=Post Publishing|last=PCL|website=www.bangkokpost.com}}</ref>

The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, themes derived from the Thai versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, not to mention scenes of daily life. Some of the scenes are influenced by [[Thai folklore]] instead of following strict Buddhist [[iconography]].<ref name="auto1" />

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Architecture of Thailand}}
[[File:The sculptures of two mythical giant demons, Thotsakan and Sahatsadecha, guarding the eastern gate of the main chapel of Wat Arun, Bangkok.jpg|thumb|Two sculptures guarding the eastern gate to the main chapel of [[Wat Arun]].]]

Architecture is the preeminent medium of the country's cultural legacy and reflects both the challenges of living in Thailand's sometimes extreme climate as well as, historically, the importance of architecture to the Thai people's sense of community and religious beliefs. Influenced by the architectural traditions of many of Thailand's neighbours, it has also developed significant regional variation within its vernacular and religious buildings.

The [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] movement, which went from approximately 1350 to 1767, was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Thai architecture The identity of architecture in Ayutthaya period is designed to display might and riches so it has great size and appearance. The temples in Ayutthaya seldom built eaves stretching from the masterhead. The dominant feature of this style is sunlight shining into buildings. During the latter part of the Ayutthaya period, architecture was regarded as a peak achievement that responded to the requirements of people and expressed the gracefulness of Thainess.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finearts.go.th/olddata/files/01_Knowledge_1-3.pdf|title=โครงการจักทำองค์ความรู้ด้านการสำรวจสถาปัตยกรรมเพื่อการอนุรักษ์โบราณสถาน|publisher=[[Fine Arts Department]], Ministry of Culture(Thailand)|access-date=13 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213140750/http://www.finearts.go.th/olddata/files/01_Knowledge_1-3.pdf|archive-date=13 December 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Buddhist temples in Thailand]] are known as "[[wat]]s", from the [[Pali|Pāḷi]] ''vāṭa'', meaning an enclosure. A temple has an enclosing wall that divides it from the secular world. Wat [[architecture]] has seen many changes in Thailand in the course of history. Although there are many differences in layout and style, they all adhere to the same principles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elca.ssru.ac.th/suriyun_ch/pluginfile.php/132/block_html/content/009%20%20%20%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A.pdf|title=วัด}}</ref>

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Thai literature}}
Thai literature has had a long history. Even before the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom there existed oral and written works.

During the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]], Most literary works were written in simple prose with certain alliteration schemes. Major works include King [[Ram Khamhaeng Inscription]]. King [[Ram Khamhaeng]]'s Stone Inscription is considered the first Thai literary work in Thai script. It gives an account of the life of King Ramkhamhaeng the Great, the way of life of Thai people in general, laws, religion, economic and political stability. ''Trai Phum [[Phra Ruang]]'', was written in 1345 by King [[Maha Thammaracha I]], the fifth king of Sukhothai. It expounds Buddhist philosophy based on a profound and extensive study with reference to over 30 sacred texts. The work could be considered the nation's first piece of research dissertation. It was written in beautiful prose rich in allusions and imagery. It is a treatise on Buddhist cosmology, ethics, biology and belief system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Thai-literature|title=Thai literature|publisher=ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA}}</ref>

[[File:Sunrise on Hat Saikaew, Koh Samet.jpg|thumb|Sculptures of [[Phra Aphai Mani]] and the Mermaid from the [[epic poem]] ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]'', a work of [[Sunthorn Phu]].]]

During the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], The period produced a variety of forms on diverse subjects. New [[Thai poetry|poetic]] forms were created, with different rhyme schemes and metres. It is common to find a combination of different poetic forms in one poetic work. ''Lilit [[Yuan Phai]]'' is a narrative poem describing the war between King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] of Ayutthaya and Prince [[Tilokkarat]] of [[Lan Na]]. One of the most beautiful literary works is ''Kap He Ruea'' composed by Prince [[Thammathibet]] comparing the scenic beauty to that of his beloved lady on a boat journey in the nirat tradition. Traditionally, the verse is sung during the colourful royal barge procession. It has been the model for subsequent poets to emulate. The same prince also composed the greatly admired ''Kap Ho Khlong'' on the Visit to Than Thongdaeng and ''Kap Ho Khlong Nirat Phrabat''.<ref name="thaiembassy">{{cite web|url=http://www.thaiembassy.org/lima/en/thai-people/7305/79482-Literature-and-Performances.html|title=Culture Overview : Literature and Performances|publisher=thaiembassy}}</ref>

Despite its short period of 15 years, [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thon Buri]] Period produced ''[[Ramakian]]'', a verse drama to which King [[Taksin]] the Great contributed his poetic talent. The revival of literature at this time is remarkable since the country had not quite recovered from the aftermath of war. Some poets who later became a major force in the early Rattanakosin Period had already begun writing at this time.

During the 18th century [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] Period. After sporadic fighting at the beginning of the period, the country gradually returned to normal. It is only natural that many of the early Rattanakosin works should deal with war and military strategy. Some examples are ''Nirat Rop Phama Thi Tha Din Daeng'', ''Phleng Yao Rop Phama Thi Nakhon Si Thammarat''.In the performing arts, perhaps the most important dramatic achievement is the complete work of ''Ramakian'' by King [[Rama I]].  In addition, There were also verse recitals with musical accompaniment, such as [[Mahori]] telling the story of ''[[Kaki Klon Suphap|Kaki]]'', [[Sepha]] relating the story of ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]''. Other recitals include [[Sri Thanonchai]]. The most important Thai poet in this period was [[Sunthorn Phu]] (สุนทรภู่) (1786–1855), widely known as "the bard of Rattanakosin" ({{lang-th|กวีเอกแห่งกรุงรัตนโกสินทร์}}). Sunthorn Phu is best known for his epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]'' ({{lang-th|พระอภัยมณี}}), which he started in 1822 (while in jail) and finished in 1844. ''Phra Aphai Mani'' is a versified fantasy-adventure novel, a genre of Siamese literature known as ''nithan kham klon'' ({{lang-th|นิทานคำกลอน}}).<ref name="thaiembassy" />

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of Thailand|Dance in Thailand}}

[[File:Dance of the Ramayana.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Khon]] show is the most stylised form of Thai performance.]]
Aside from folk and regional dances (southern Thailand's [[Menora (dance)]] and [[Ramwong]], for example), the two major forms of Thai classical dance drama are [[Khon]] and [[Lakhon nai]]. In the beginning, both were exclusively court entertainments and it was not until much later that a popular style of dance theatre, [[likay]], evolved as a diversion for common folk who had no access to royal performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thai2siam.com/thai-traditional-dances|title=Thai Traditional Dances – Dance costume Thailand|publisher=Thai to Siam|access-date=12 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203174740/https://www.thai2siam.com/thai-traditional-dances|archive-date=3 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Folk dance forms include dance theater forms like [[likay]], numerous regional dances (''ram''), the ritual dance [[ram muay]], and homage to the teacher, [[Wai khru ram muay|wai khru]]. Both ram muay and wai khru take place before all traditional [[muay Thai]] matches. The wai is also an annual ceremony performed by Thai classical dance groups to honor their artistic ancestors.

Thai classical music is synonymous with those stylized court ensembles and repertoires that emerged in their present form within the royal centers of Central Thailand some 800 years ago. These ensembles, while being influenced by older practices are today uniquely Thai expressions. While the three primary classical ensembles, the [[Piphat]], [[Khrueang sai]] and [[Mahori]] differ in significant ways, they all share a basic instrumentation and theoretical approach. Each employs small ching hand cymbals and [[krap]] wooden sticks to mark the primary beat reference. Thai classical music has had a wide influence on the musical traditions of neighboring countries. The traditional [[music of Myanmar]] was strongly influenced by the Thai music repertoire, called Yodaya (ယိုးဒယား), which was brought over from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]. As Siam expanded its political and cultural influence to Laos and Cambodia during the early Rattanakosin period, its music was quickly absorbed by the Cambodia and Lao courts.

The staple food in Thailand is rice, particularly [[jasmine rice]] (also known as ''hom Mali'') which forms part of almost every meal. Thailand is a leading exporter of rice, and Thais consume over 100&nbsp;kg of milled rice per person per year.<ref name=IRRI-WRS>{{cite web|title=World Rice Statistics Online Query Facility|url=http://ricestat.irri.org:8080/wrsv3/entrypoint.htm|website=International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)|publisher=FAO|accessdate=30 January 2016|date=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426121256/http://ricestat.irri.org:8080/wrsv3/entrypoint.htm|archive-date=26 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Units of measurement ===
{{Further|Thai units of measurement}}
Thailand generally uses the [[metric system]], but [[Thai units of measurement|traditional units of measurement]] for land area are used, and [[imperial units]] of measurement are occasionally used for building materials, such as wood and plumbing fixtures. Years are numbered as B.E. ([[Thai solar calendar|Buddhist Era]]) in educational settings, civil service, government, contracts, and newspaper datelines. However, in banking, and increasingly in industry and commerce, standard Western year (Christian or Common Era) counting is the standard practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockatoo.com/english/thailand/thailand-weights-measures.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010141820/http://asiatour.com/thailand-regions-2009/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 October 2017 |title=Weights and measures in Thailand |publisher=Cockatoo.com |date=17 December 1923 |accessdate=25 April 2010 }}</ref>

[[File:Muay Thai Fight Us Vs Burma (80668065).jpeg|left|200px|thumb|[[Muay Thai]], Thailand's signature sport]]
[[Muay Thai]] ({{lang-th|มวยไทย}}, RTGS: Muai Thai, {{IPA-th|muaj tʰaj|}},<!--mid tones not transcribed--> lit. "Thai boxing") is a [[combat sport]] of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various [[clinch fighting|clinching]] techniques. Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late-20th to 21st century, when [[Westernized]] practitioners from Thailand began competing in [[kickboxing]] and mixed rules matches as well as matches under muay Thai rules around the world, Famous practitioners such as [[Buakaw Banchamek]], [[Samart Payakaroon]], [[Dieselnoi Chor Thanasukarn]] and [[Apidej Sit-Hirun]]. [[Buakaw Banchamek]] has probably brought more international interest in Muay Thai than any other Muay Thai fighters ever had.<ref name="muaythaicitizen">{{cite web|url=http://www.muaythaicitizen.com/top-10-muay-thai-fighters/|title=Top 10 Muay Thai Fighters You Should Know|publisher=muaythaicitizen}}</ref>

[[Association football]] has overtaken muay Thai as the most widely followed sport in contemporary Thai society. [[Thailand national football team]] has played the [[AFC Asian Cup]] six times and reached the semifinals in [[1972 AFC Asian Cup|1972]]. The country has hosted the Asian Cup twice, in 1972 and in [[2007 AFC Asian Cup|2007]]. The 2007 edition was co-hosted together with [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]]. It is not uncommon to see Thais cheering their favourite English Premier League teams on television and walking around in replica kit. Another widely enjoyed pastime, and once a competitive sport, is [[kite flying]].

[[Volleyball]] is rapidly growing as one of the most popular sports. The [[Thailand women's national volleyball team|women's team]] has often participated in the [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|World Championship]], [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|World Cup]], and [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|World Grand Prix]] [[Asian Championship]]. They have won the [[Asian Women's Volleyball Championship|Asian Championship]] twice and [[AVC Cup for Women|Asian Cup]] once. By the success of the women's team, the [[Thailand men's national volleyball team|men team]] has been growing as well.

[[Takraw]] (Thai: ตะกร้อ) is a sport native to Thailand, in which the players hit a rattan ball and are only allowed to use their feet, knees, chest, and head to touch the ball. [[Sepak takraw]] is a form of this sport which is similar to volleyball. The players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the ground on the opponent's side. It is also a popular sport in other countries in Southeast Asia. A rather similar game but played only with the feet is [[buka ball]].

[[Snooker]] has enjoyed increasing popularity in Thailand in recent years, with interest in the game being stimulated by the success of Thai snooker player [[James Wattana]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hodgson |first=Guy |date=18 April 1993 |title=Snooker: A storm coming in from the East: Thailand doesn't boast many world-beating sportsmen.

Other sports in Thailand are slowly growing as the country develops its sporting infrastructure. The success in sports like [[powerlifting|weightlifting]] and [[taekwondo]] at the last two summer Olympic Games has demonstrated that boxing is no longer the only medal option for Thailand.

=== Sporting venues ===
[[File:Bangkok Lumpinee Boxing Stadium 1.jpg|thumb|[[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]]]]
The well-known [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]] originally sited at Rama IV Road near Lumphini Park hosted its final Muay Thai boxing matches on 8 February 2014 after the venue first opened in December 1956. Managed by the Royal Thai Army, the stadium was officially selected for the purpose of muay Thai bouts following a competition that was staged on 15 March 1956. From 11 February 2014, the stadium will relocate to Ram Intra Road, due to the new venue's capacity to accommodate audiences of up to 3,500. Foreigners typically pay between 1,000 and 2,000 baht to view a match, with prices depending on the location of the seating.<ref>{{cite news|title=End of an era for Muay Thai at Lumpini|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/393517/end-of-an-era-as-lumpini-boxing-stadium-closes-its-doors-on-friday|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=6 February 2014}}{{dead link|date=July 2020}}</ref>
