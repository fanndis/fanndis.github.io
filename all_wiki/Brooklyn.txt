Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city (and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the [[New York State Constitution]]) until January 1, 1898, when, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, according to the new Municipal Charter of "Greater New York", [[consolidation of New York City|Brooklyn was consolidated]] with other cities, towns, and counties, to form the modern ''City of New York'', surrounding the [[New York Bay|Upper New York Bay]] with five constituent boroughs. The borough continues, however, to maintain a [[Culture of Brooklyn|distinct culture]]. Many [[List of Brooklyn neighborhoods|Brooklyn neighborhoods]] are [[ethnic enclave]]s. Brooklyn's official motto, displayed on the Borough [[Seal (device)|seal]] and [[Flags of New York City's boroughs#Brooklyn|flag]], is {{lang|nl|Eendraght Maeckt Maght}}, which translates from early modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as "[[Unity makes strength]]".

The history of [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement]] in Brooklyn spans more than 350 years. The settlement began in the 17th century as the small [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch-founded]] town of "Breuckelen" on the [[East River]] shore of [[Long Island]], grew to be a sizeable city in the 19th century, and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then confined to [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]]), the remaining rural areas of Kings County, and the largely rural areas of [[Queens]] and [[Staten Island]], to form the modern City of New York.

===Colonial era===

====Six Dutch towns====
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the [[Lenape]], an Algonquian-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribe often referred to in colonial documents by a variation of the place name "[[Canarsie]]". Bands were associated with place names, but the colonists thought their names represented different tribes. The ''Breuckelen'' settlement was named after [[Breukelen]] in the [[Netherlands]]; it was part of [[New Netherland]]. The [[Dutch West India Company]] lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names):<ref>[http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Town/Bushwick/index.html ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle''], "Map of six townships"</ref>
* [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]]: in 1645, settled under Dutch patent by English followers of [[Anabaptist]] [[Deborah Moody]], named for [['s-Gravenzande]], Netherlands, or [[Gravesend]], England
* [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]]: as ''Breuckelen'' in 1646, after the town now spelled [[Breukelen]], [[Netherlands]]. Breuckelen was along Fulton Street (now Fulton Mall) between Hoyt Street and Smith Street (according to H. Stiles and P. Ross). Brooklyn Heights, or Clover Hill, is where the village of Brooklyn was founded in 1816.
* [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]]: as ''Nieuw [[Amersfoort]]'' in 1647
* [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]]: as ''[[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwout]]'' in 1652
* [[New Utrecht, Brooklyn|''Nieuw Utrecht'']]: in 1657, after the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands
* [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]]: as ''Boswijck'' in 1661

The colony's capital of [[New Amsterdam]], across the East River, obtained its charter in 1653. The neighborhood of [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] was home to North America's first [[tide mill]]. It was built by the Dutch, and the foundation can be seen today. But the area was not formally settled as a town. Many incidents and documents relating to this period are in [[Gabriel Furman]]'s 1824 compilation.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/30/ ''Notes Geographical and Historical, relating to the Town of Brooklyn, in Kings County on Long-Island''].</ref>

====Six townships in an English province====
[[File:BrooklynMap1766.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Village of Brooklyn and environs, 1766]]
What is now Brooklyn today left Dutch hands after the final [[Kingdom of England|English]] conquest of [[New Netherland]] in 1664, a prelude to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the conquerors renamed their prize for the overall English naval commander, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], brother of the then monarch [[Charles II of England|King Charles II of England]] and future king himself as [[James II of England|King James II of England and James VII of Scotland]]; Brooklyn became a part of the new English and later British colony, the [[Province of New York]].

The English reorganized the six old Dutch towns on southwestern Long Island as ''Kings County'' on November 1, 1683,<ref>N.Y. Col. Laws, ch4/1:122</ref> one of the [[Province of New York#Counties|"original twelve counties"]] then established in New York Province. This tract of land was recognized as a political entity for the first time, and the municipal groundwork was laid for a later expansive idea of Brooklyn identity.

Lacking the [[patroon]] and tenant farmer system established along the [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River Valley]], this [[agricultural]] county unusually came to have one of the highest percentages of [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] among the population in the [[Thirteen Colonies|"Original Thirteen Colonies"]] along the [[Atlantic Ocean]] eastern coast of [[North America]].<ref>{{cite news | date=December 29, 1891 | title=Slavery Here. Right in Brooklyn and Out on Long Island | work=[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | page=2 | url=https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/50384000 | access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>

====Revolutionary War====
{{Further|Battle of Long Island|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
[[File:Battle-of-Long-Island-Map-sml.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of Long Island]] was fought across Kings County.]]

On August 27, 1776, was fought the [[Battle of Long Island]] (also known as the 'Battle of Brooklyn'), the first major engagement fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]] after independence was declared, and the largest of the entire conflict. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops forced [[Continental Army]] troops under [[George Washington]] off the heights near the modern sites of [[Green-Wood Cemetery]], [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], and [[Grand Army Plaza]].<ref name="McCullough, David 2005">[[David McCullough|McCullough, David]]. ''[[1776 (book)|1776]]''. Simon & Schuster.  2005. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-2671-4}}</ref>

Washington, viewing [[Old Stone House (Brooklyn)|particularly fierce fighting]] at the [[Gowanus Canal|Gowanus Creek]] from atop a hill near the west end of present-day [[Atlantic Avenue (Brooklyn)|Atlantic Avenue]], was famously reported to have emotionally exclaimed: "What brave men I must this day lose!".<ref name="McCullough, David 2005"/>

The [[fortification|fortified]] American positions at [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] consequently became untenable and were evacuated a few days later, leaving the British in control of [[New York Harbor]]. While Washington's defeat on the battlefield cast early doubts on his ability as the commander, the [[tactical withdrawal]] of all his troops and supplies across the [[East River]] in a single night is now seen by historians as one of his most brilliant triumphs.<ref name="McCullough, David 2005"/>

The British controlled the surrounding region for the duration of the war, as New York City was soon occupied and became their military and political base of operations in [[British America|North America]] for the remainder of the conflict. The British generally enjoyed a dominant [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] sentiment from the residents in Kings County who did not evacuate, though the region was also the center of the fledgling—and largely successful—[[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|American intelligence network]], headed by Washington himself.

The British set up a system of notorious [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|prison ships]] off the coast of Brooklyn in [[Wallabout Bay]], where more American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] died of intentional neglect than died in combat on all the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War, combined. One result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 was the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation of the British from New York City]], celebrated by residents into the 20th century.

===Post-colonial era===

====Urbanization====
[[File:Francis Guy - Winter Scene in Brooklyn - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|A preindustrial ''Winter Scene in Brooklyn'', {{circa|1819–20}}, by [[Francis Guy]] ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]
The first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The [[New York Naval Shipyard|New York Navy Yard]] operated in [[Wallabout Bay]] (border between Brooklyn and Williamsburgh) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.

The first center of [[urbanization]] sprang up in the Town of Brooklyn, directly across from [[Lower Manhattan]], which saw the incorporation of the Village of Brooklyn in 1817. Reliable steam [[List of ferries across the East River|ferry service]] across the East River to [[Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn|Fulton Landing]] converted [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] into a [[commuter town]] for [[Wall Street]]. Ferry Road to Jamaica Pass became [[Fulton Street (Brooklyn)|Fulton Street]] to [[East New York]]. Town and Village were combined to form the first, kernel incarnation of the City of Brooklyn in 1834.

In a parallel development, the Town of Bushwick, farther up the river, saw the incorporation of the Village of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburgh]] in 1827, which separated as the Town of Williamsburgh in 1840 and formed the short-lived City of Williamsburgh in 1851. [[Industrial deconcentration]] in the mid-century was bringing shipbuilding and other manufacturing to the northern part of the county. Each of the two cities and six towns in Kings County remained independent municipalities and purposely created non-aligning street grids with different naming systems.

However, the East River shore was growing too fast for the three-year-old infant City of Williamsburgh; it, along with its Town of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] hinterland, was subsumed within a greater City of Brooklyn in 1854.

By 1841, with the appearance of ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|The Brooklyn Eagle, and Kings County Democrat]]'' published by Alfred G.

The borough's soon-to-be-famous [[National League]] baseball team, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], also assisted with this. Both major institutions were lost in the 1950s: the paper closed in 1955 after unsuccessful attempts at a sale following a reporters' strike, and the baseball team decamped for Los Angeles in a realignment of [[major league baseball]] in 1957.

Agitation against Southern slavery was stronger in Brooklyn than in New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pursuitoffreedom.org/abolitionist-brooklyn/|title=Abolitionist Brooklyn (1828–1849) {{!}} In Pursuit of Freedom|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> and under Republican leadership, the city was fervent in the Union cause in the [[US Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war the [[Henry Ward Beecher Monument]] was built downtown to honor a famous local [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. A great victory arch was built at what was then the south end of town to celebrate the armed forces; this place is now called [[Grand Army Plaza]].

The number of people living in Brooklyn grew rapidly early in the 19th century. There were 4,402 by 1810, 7,175 in 1830 and 15,396 by 1830.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol. III'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p. 852</ref> The city's population was 25,000 in 1834, but the police department comprised only 12 men on the day shift and another 12 on the night shift. Every time a rash of burglaries broke out, officials blamed burglars from New York City. Finally, in 1855, a modern police force was created, employing 150 men. Voters complained of inadequate protection and excessive costs. In 1857, the state legislature merged the Brooklyn force with that of New York City.<ref>Jacob Judd, "Policing the City of Brooklyn in the {{text|1840s}} and {{text|1850s}}", ''Journal of Long Island History'' (1966) (6)2 pp.&nbsp;13–22.</ref>

====Civil War====
[[File: Brooklyn Museum - "Any Thing for Me, If You Please?"--Post Office of the Brooklyn Fair in Aid of the Sanitary Commission - Winslow Homer - overall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|"Any Thing for Me, if You Please?" Post Office, 1864]]
Fervent in the Union cause, the city of Brooklyn played a major role in supplying troops and [[materiel]] for the [[American Civil War]]. The most well-known regiment to be sent off to war from the city was the [[14th Brooklyn]] ''"Red Legged Devils"''. They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and were the only regiment named after a city. President Lincoln called them into service, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted soldiers in April 1861. Unlike other regiments during the American Civil War, the 14th wore a uniform inspired by the French [[Chasseur]]s, a light infantry used for quick assaults.

As a seaport and a manufacturing center, Brooklyn was well prepared to contribute to the Union's strengths in shipping and manufacturing. The two combined in shipbuilding; the ironclad ''[[USS Monitor|Monitor]]'' was built in Brooklyn.

====Twin city====
Brooklyn is referred to as the twin city of New York in the 1883 poem, "[[The New Colossus]]" by [[Emma Lazarus]], which appears on a plaque inside the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The poem calls New York Harbor "the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame". As a twin city to New York, it played a role in national affairs that was later overshadowed by its century-old submergence into its old partner and rival.

Economic growth continued, propelled by [[immigration]] and [[industrialization]], and Brooklyn established itself as the third-most populous American city for much of the 19th century. The waterfront from [[Gowanus Bay]] to [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] was developed with piers and factories. Industrial access to the waterfront was improved by the [[Gowanus Canal]] and the canalized [[Newtown Creek]]. {{USS|Monitor}} was the most famous product of the large and growing [[shipbuilding industry]] of Williamsburg. After the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], trolley lines and other transport brought [[urban sprawl]] beyond [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] and into the center of the county.

[[File:Currier and Ives Brooklyn Bridge2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Brooklyn Bridge]] in 1883, by [[Currier and Ives]]]]

The rapidly growing population needed more water, so the City built centralized waterworks including the [[Ridgewood Reservoir]]. The municipal Police Department, however, was abolished in 1854 in favor of a Metropolitan force covering also New York and Westchester Counties. In 1865 the [[Brooklyn Fire Department]] (BFD) also gave way to the new Metropolitan Fire District.

Throughout this period the peripheral towns of Kings County, far from Manhattan and even from urban Brooklyn, maintained their rustic independence. The only municipal change seen was the secession of the eastern section of the Town of Flatbush as the Town of New Lots in 1852. The building of [[History of the New York City Subway|rail links]] such as the [[BMT Brighton Line|Brighton Beach Line]] in 1878 heralded the end of this isolation.

[[File:The World almanac and encyclopedia (1900) (14597683228).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Borough of Brooklyn wards, 1900]]
[[Sports in Brooklyn|Sports]] became big business, and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms played professional baseball at Washington Park in the convenient suburb of [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] and elsewhere. Early in the next century, under their new name of Brooklyn Dodgers, they brought baseball to [[Ebbets Field]], beyond Prospect Park. Racetracks, [[amusement park]]s, and [[beach resort]]s opened in [[Brighton Beach]], [[Coney Island]], and elsewhere in the southern part of the county.

[[File:Currier & Ives Brooklyn2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Currier and Ives]] print of Brooklyn, 1886.]]
Toward the end of the 19th century, the City of Brooklyn experienced its final, explosive growth spurt. Railroads and industrialization spread to [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]. Within a decade, the city had annexed the Town of [[New Lots, Brooklyn|New Lots]] in 1886, the Town of [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], the Town of [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]], the Town of [[New Utrecht]] in 1894, and the Town of [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]] in 1896. Brooklyn had reached its natural municipal boundaries at the ends of Kings County.

=====Mayors of the City of Brooklyn=====
{{See also|List of mayors of New York City|Borough President#Brooklyn Borough Presidents|l2=Brooklyn borough presidents}}

Brooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until consolidation in 1898 into the [[City of Greater New York]], whose own second mayor (1902–1903), [[Seth Low]], had been Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885. Since 1898, Brooklyn has, in place of a separate mayor, elected a [[Borough President]].

[[File:1897 Brooklyn map.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Brooklyn in 1897]]
In 1883, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] was completed, transportation to Manhattan was no longer by water only, and the City of Brooklyn's ties to the City of New York were strengthened.

The question became whether Brooklyn was prepared to engage in the still-grander process of consolidation then developing throughout the region, whether to join with the county of [[Manhattan|New York]], the county of [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond]] and the western portion of [[Queens|Queens County]] to form the five boroughs of a united City of New York. [[Andrew Haskell Green]] and other progressives said yes, and eventually, they prevailed against the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|Daily Eagle]]'' and other conservative forces. In 1894, residents of Brooklyn and the other counties voted by a slight majority to merge, effective in 1898.<ref>

Kings County retained its status as one of New York State's counties, but the loss of Brooklyn's separate identity as a city was met with consternation by some residents at the time. Many newspapers of the day called the merger the "Great Mistake of 1898", and the phrase still denotes Brooklyn pride among old-time Brooklynites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brooklyn – and how it got that way|last=McCullough|first=David W|last2=Kalett|first2=Jim|date=1983|publisher=Dial Press|isbn=0385274270|location=New York|page=58|language=English|oclc = 8667213}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:New York City location Brooklyn.svg|thumb|right|Location of Brooklyn (red) within New York City (remainder white)]]
Brooklyn is {{convert|97|sqmi|km2}} in area, of which {{convert|71|mi2|km2}} is land (73%), and {{convert|26|mi2|km2}} is water (27%); the borough is the second-largest by land area among the New York City's boroughs. However, Kings County, coterminous with Brooklyn, is New York State's fourth-smallest [[county (New York)|county]] by land area and third-smallest by total area.<ref name="GR1"/> Brooklyn lies at the southwestern end of Long Island, and the borough's western border constitutes the island's western tip.

Brooklyn's water borders are extensive and varied, including [[Jamaica Bay]]; the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[The Narrows]], separating Brooklyn from the borough of [[Staten Island]] in New York City and crossed by the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]]; [[Upper New York Bay]], separating Brooklyn from [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]; and the [[East River]], separating Brooklyn from the borough of Manhattan in New York City and traversed by the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], the [[Manhattan Bridge]], the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], and numerous routes of the [[New York City Subway]]. To the east of Brooklyn lies the borough of Queens, which contains [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in that borough's [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] neighborhood, approximately two miles from the border of Brooklyn's [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]] neighborhood.

Brooklyn's neighborhoods are dynamic in ethnic composition. For example, during the early to mid-20th century, [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] had a majority of [[Jews in New York City|Jewish]] residents; since the 1970s it has been majority African American. [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] during the early 20th century was filled with ethnic [[Irish American|Irish]], then filled with Jewish residents for nearly 50 years, and is slowly becoming a [[Pakistani American|Pakistani]] enclave. Brooklyn's most populous racial group, white, declined from 97.2% in 1930 to 46.9% by 1990.<ref name="Gibson2005">Gibson, Campbell; and Jung, Kay.

Given New York City's role as a crossroads for immigration from around the world, Brooklyn has evolved a globally [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] ambiance of its own, demonstrating a robust and growing demographic and cultural diversity with respect to metrics including nationality, religion, race, and [[domestic partnership|domiciliary partnership]].

Among the most prominent are listed below:

====Jewish American====
{{main|Jews in New York City}}
Over 600,000 [[Jews]], particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]], have become concentrated in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]], where there are many [[yeshiva]]s, [[synagogue]]s, and [[kosher]] restaurants, as well as many other Jewish businesses. Other notable religious Jewish neighborhoods are [[Kensington, Brooklyn|Kensington]], [[Canarsie, Brooklyn|Canarsie]], [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn|Sea Gate]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] (home to the [[Chabad]] world headquarters). Many hospitals in Brooklyn were started by Jewish charities, including [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in Borough Park and Brookdale Hospital in Brownsville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maimonidesmed.org/Main/Public/WeSpeakYourLanguage.aspx |title=We Speak Your Language |work=maimonidesmed.org |access-date=May 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094656/http://www.maimonidesmed.org/Main/Public/WeSpeakYourLanguage.aspx |archivedate=May 18, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/nyregion/thecity/11hosp.html|title='Scrubs' Near the D Train|date=May 11, 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Many non-Orthodox Jews (ranging from observant members of various denominations to [[Atheism|atheists]] of Jewish cultural heritage) are concentrated in [[Ditmas Park, Brooklyn|Ditmas Park]] and [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], with smaller observant and culturally Jewish populations in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Brighton Beach, and Coney Island.

====Chinese American====
{{main|Chinatowns in Brooklyn|Chinese Americans in New York City}}
Over 200,000 [[Chinese Americans in New York City|Chinese Americans]] live throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn, primarily concentrated in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]] and [[Homecrest, Brooklyn|Homecrest]]. The largest concentration is in Sunset Park along 8th Avenue, which has become known for its [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] since the opening of the now-defunct Winley Supermarket in 1986 spurred initial settlement in the area. It is called [[Chinatown, Brooklyn|"Brooklyn's Chinatown"]] and its [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] population is composed in majority by [[Fuzhounese Americans]], rendering this Chinatown with the nicknames "[[Chinatowns in Brooklyn#Fuzhou Town, Brooklyn|Fuzhou Town]] ({{lang|zh|福州埠}}), Brooklyn" or the "[[Little Fuzhou]] ({{lang|zh|小福州}})" of Brooklyn. Many [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurants]] can be found throughout Sunset Park, and the area hosts a popular [[Chinese New Year]] celebration.

====Caribbean and African American====
{{main|Caribbeans in New York City}}
Brooklyn's [[African American]] and [[Caribbean]] communities are spread throughout much of Brooklyn. Brooklyn's [[West Indian]] community is concentrated in the Crown Heights, Flatbush, [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]], Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. Brooklyn is home to the largest community of West Indians outside of the Caribbean. Although the largest West Indian groups in Brooklyn are [[Jamaican American|Jamaicans]], [[Guyanese American|Guyanese]], and [[Haitian Americans|Haitians]], there are [[West Indian American|West Indian immigrants]] from nearly every part of the Caribbean. Crown Heights and Flatbush are home to many of Brooklyn's West Indian restaurants and bakeries. Brooklyn has an annual, celebrated Carnival in the tradition of pre-Lenten celebrations in the islands.<ref>Holger Henke, "The West Indian Americans," Greenwood Press: Westport (CT) 2001</ref> Started by natives of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Labor Day Carnival|West Indian Labor Day Parade]] takes place every Labor Day on [[Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)|Eastern Parkway]]. The [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] also holds the [[DanceAfrica]] festival in late May, featuring street vendors and dance performances showcasing food and culture from all parts of Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://donyc.com/events/2019/5/25/danceafrica-2019-bazaar|website=donyc.com|title=DanceAfrica 2019 Bazaar in New York at Brooklyn Academy of Music|access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/arts/dance/danceafrica-bam.html|date=May 23, 2019|first=Gia|last=Kourlas|title=DanceAfrica Celebrates Rwanda and a ‘Living Sense of Grace’|access-date=May 26, 2020|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] is home to one of the most famous African American communities in the city, along with [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]], and [[Coney Island, Brooklyn|Coney Island]].

====Latino American====
{{further|Puerto Rican migration to New York City|Nuyorican}}
[[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] is the largest hub of Brooklyn's [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino American]] community. Like other Latino neighborhoods in New York City, Bushwick has an established [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] presence, along with an influx of many [[Dominican Americans (Dominican Republic)|Dominicans]], [[South American]]s, [[Central American]]s, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], as well as a more recent influx of Puerto Ricans. As nearly 80% of Bushwick's population is Latino, its residents have created many businesses to support their various national and distinct traditions in food and other items. [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]'s population is 42% Latino, made up of these various ethnic groups. Brooklyn's main Latino groups are Puerto Ricans, [[Mexican American|Mexicans]], Dominicans, and [[Panamanian American|Panamanians]]; they are spread out throughout the borough. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are predominant in Bushwick, [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]]'s South Side and East New York. Mexicans now predominate alongside Chinese immigrants in Sunset Park, although remnants of the neighborhood's once-substantial postwar Puerto Rican and Dominican communities continue to reside below 39th Street. A Panamanian enclave exists in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]].

====Russian and Ukrainian American====
{{main|Russian Americans in New York City}}
Brooklyn is also home to many [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]], who are mainly concentrated in the areas of [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn|Brighton Beach]] and [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]]. Brighton Beach features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed ''[[Russian Americans in New York City#Russiantownscape|Little Russia]]'' and ''Little [[Odessa]]'', respectively. Originally these communities were mostly Jewish; however, in more recent years, the non-Jewish Russian and Ukrainian communities of Brighton Beach have grown, and the area now reflects diverse aspects of Russian and Ukrainian culture. Smaller concentrations of Russian and Ukrainian Americans are scattered elsewhere in southern Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Coney Island and [[Mill Basin]].

====Polish American====
Brooklyn's [[Polish-Americans|Polish]] are historically concentrated in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]], home to [[Little Poland, Brooklyn|Little Poland]]. Other longstanding settlements in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] have endured, while more recent immigrants are scattered throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn alongside the Russian American community.

====Italian American====
{{main|Italians in New York City}}
Despite widespread migration to [[Staten Island]] and more suburban areas in metropolitan New York throughout the postwar era, smaller concentrations of [[Italian American]]s continue to reside in the neighborhoods of [[Bensonhurst]], [[Dyker Heights, Brooklyn|Dyker Heights]], [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], [[Bath Beach, Brooklyn|Bath Beach]] and [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]]. Less perceptible remnants of older communities have persisted in [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]] and [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]], where the homes of the remaining Italian Americans can often be contrasted with more recent [[upper middle class]] residents through the display of small [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] statues, the retention of plastic-metal stoop awnings and the use of [[Formstone]] in house cladding. All of the aforementioned neighborhoods have retained Italian restaurants, bakeries, delicatessens, pizzerias, cafes and social clubs.

====Muslim American====
Today, [[Arab American]]s and [[Pakistani American]]s along with other Muslim communities have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], where there are many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges, halal shops, Islamic shops, and mosques. Elsewhere, Coney Island Avenue is home to ''Little [[Pakistan]]'', while Church Avenue is the center of a Bangladeshi community. Pakistani Independence Day is celebrated every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue. Earlier, the area was known predominantly for its Irish, Norwegian, and Scottish populations. Beginning in the early 20th century, Syrian and Lebanese businesses, mosques, and restaurants were concentrated on [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]] west of [[Flatbush Avenue]] in [[Boerum Hill]]; more recently, this area has evolved into a Yemeni commercial district.

====Irish American====
Third-, fourth- and fifth-generation [[Irish American]]s can be found throughout Brooklyn, with moderate concentrations{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2018}} enduring in the neighborhoods of [[Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn|Windsor Terrace]], [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] and [[Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn|Gerritsen Beach]]. Historical communities also existed in [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]] and other waterfront industrial neighborhoods, such as Greenpoint and Sunset Park. Paralleling the Italian American community, many moved to Staten Island and suburban areas in the postwar era. Those that stayed engendered close-knit, stable working-to-middle class communities through employment in the civil service (especially in law enforcement, transportation, and the [[New York City Fire Department]]) and the building and construction trades, while others were subsumed by the [[professional-managerial class]] and largely shed the Irish American community's distinct cultural traditions (including continued worship in the [[Catholic Church]] and other social activities, such as [[Irish stepdance]] and frequenting Irish American bars).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Greek American====
Brooklyn's [[Greek Americans]] live throughout the borough, especially in Bay Ridge and adjacent areas where there is a noticeable cluster of Hellenic-focused schools and cultural institutions, with many businesses concentrated there and in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue. Greek-owned diners are also found throughout the borough.

====LGBTQ community====
Brooklyn is home to a large and growing number of same-sex couples. [[Same-sex marriage in New York|Same-sex marriages in New York]] were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/25/nyregion/gay-marriage-approved-by-new-york-senate.html|title=New York Allows Same-Sex Marriage, Becoming Largest State to Pass Law|author1=Nicholas Confessore  |author2=Michael Barbaro |name-list-style=amp |work=The New York Times|date=June 24, 2011|access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref> The [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] neighborhood spearheaded the popularity of Brooklyn among lesbians, and [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn|Prospect Heights]] has an LGBT residential presence.<ref name=RosenbergDunfordp379>Rosenberg, Andrew and Martin Dunford.

====Artists-in-residence====
Brooklyn became a preferred site for artists and [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] to set up live/work spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in Manhattan. Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|DUMBO]], [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]], and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for [[artists-in-residence]]. However, rents and costs of living have since increased dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to locales in New Jersey, such as [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] or [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/realestate/moving-out-of-brooklyn-because-of-high-prices.html|title=Life After Brooklyn – Moving Out of Brooklyn Because of High Prices|author=Michelle Higgins|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 22, 2014|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>

==Government and politics==

[[File:Bk Boro Hall summer dusk jeh.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Brooklyn Borough Hall]]]]

Since consolidation with New York City in 1898, Brooklyn has been governed by the [[New York City Charter]] that provides for a "strong" [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council system]]. The centralized [[government of New York City]] is responsible for [[New York City Department of Education|public education]], correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. On the other hand, the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] is an independent [[nonprofit organization]] partially funded by the government of New York City, but also by the [[government of New York State]], the [[government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and [[fundraising|private donors]].

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with the local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough; it was a violation of the high court's [[Reynolds v. Sims|1964 "one man, one vote" reading]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris]. Retrieved June 12, 2006.</ref>

Since 1990, the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Brooklyn's current Borough President is [[Eric Adams (politician)|Eric Adams]], elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in November 2013 with 90.8% of the vote. Adams replaced popular Borough President [[Marty Markowitz]], also a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], who partially used his office to promote tourism and new development for Brooklyn.

Democrats hold most public offices, and the borough is very liberal. As of November 2017, 89.1% of registered voters in Brooklyn were Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_nov17.pdf |title=Enrollment info |website=elections.ny.gov }}</ref> Party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Pockets of Republican influence exist in Gravesend, Bensonhurst, [[Bay Ridge]], [[Dyker Heights]] and [[Midwood]].

Each of the city's five counties (coterminous with each borough) has its own criminal court system and [[District Attorney]], the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. The District Attorney of Kings County is [[Eric Gonzalez (lawyer)|Eric Gonzalez]], who replaced Democrat [[Kenneth P. Thompson]] following his death in October 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/acting-da-gonzalez-finish-term-push-letitia-james-article-1.2833938|title=Cuomo to let acting Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez finish term despite push for Public Advocate Letitia James|first=Christina Carrega-Woodby, Jennifer|last=Fermino|website=nydailynews.com}}</ref> Brooklyn has 16 City Council members, the largest number of any of the five boroughs. Brooklyn has 18 of the city's 59 community districts, each served by an unpaid Community Board with advisory powers under the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. Each board has a paid district manager who acts as an interlocutor with city agencies.

Brooklyn's job market is driven by three main factors: the performance of the national and city economy, population flows and the borough's position as a convenient back office for New York's businesses.<ref name="report">{{Cite web|url=https://www.afternic.com/forsale/bedc.org?utm_source=TDFS_DASLNC&utm_medium=DASLNC&utm_campaign=TDFS_DASLNC&traffic_type=TDFS_DASLNC&traffic_id=daslnc&|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201015505/http://www.bedc.org/statistics/Dept_Labor_Brookyn_Report_april_2006.html|url-status=dead|title=Domain For Sale|archivedate=February 1, 2015|website=www.afternic.com}}</ref>

Forty-four percent of Brooklyn's employed population, or 410,000 people, work in the borough; more than half of the borough's residents work outside its boundaries. As a result, economic conditions in Manhattan are important to the borough's jobseekers. Strong international immigration to Brooklyn generates jobs in services, retailing and construction.<ref name="report"/>

Since the late 20th century, Brooklyn has benefited from a steady influx of financial [[back office]] operations from Manhattan, the rapid growth of a [[high-tech]] and entertainment economy in [[DUMBO, Brooklyn|DUMBO]], and strong growth in support services such as accounting, personal supply agencies, and computer services firms.<ref name="report"/>

Jobs in the borough have traditionally been concentrated in manufacturing, but since 1975, Brooklyn has shifted from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy. In 2004, 215,000 Brooklyn residents worked in the services sector, while 27,500 worked in manufacturing. Although manufacturing has declined, a substantial base has remained in apparel and niche manufacturing concerns such as furniture, fabricated metals, and food products.<ref>New York City Economic Development Corporation, Brooklyn Borough Update March 2004.

First established as a [[shipbuilding]] facility in 1801, the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] employed 70,000 people at its peak during World War II and was then the largest employer in the borough. The ''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|Missouri]]'', the ship on which the Japanese formally surrendered, was built there, as was the ''[[USS Maine (ACR-1)|Maine]]'', whose sinking off Havana led to the start of the Spanish–American War. The iron-sided Civil War vessel the ''[[USS Monitor|Monitor]]'' was built in Greenpoint. From 1968 to 1979 [[Seatrain Lines|Seatrain Shipbuilding]] was the major employer.<ref>[http://www.BrooklynSteelBloodTenacityAppendix.com/ A Case Study of Seatrain Shipbuilding & the Brooklyn Navy Yard].</ref> Later tenants include industrial design firms, food processing businesses, artisans, and the film and television production industry.

It has in its permanent collection more than 1.5&nbsp; a million objects, from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art. The [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]], the world's first museum dedicated to children, opened in December 1899. The only such New York State institution accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]], it is one of the few globally to have a permanent collection{{spnd}}over 30,000 cultural objects and natural history specimens.

Brooklyn's major professional sports team is the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The Nets moved into the borough in 2012, and play their home games at [[Barclays Center]] in Prospect Heights. Previously, the Nets had played in [[Uniondale, New York]] and in [[New Jersey]]. In April 2020, the [[New York Liberty]] of the [[WNBA]] were sold to the Nets' owners and moved their home venue from [[Madison Square Garden]] to the Barclays Center.

Barclays Center was also the home arena for the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[New York Islanders]] full-time from 2015 to 2018, then part-time from 2018 to 2020 (alternating with [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Nassau Coliseum]] in Uniondale). The Islanders had originally played at Nassau Coliseum full-time since their inception until 2015, when their lease at the venue expired and the team moved to Barclays Center. In 2020, the team will return to Nassau Coliseum full-time for one season before moving to [[Belmont Park Arena|their new permanent home]] at Belmont Park in 2021.

Brooklyn also has a storied sports history. It has been home to many famous sports figures such as [[Joe Paterno]], [[Vince Lombardi]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Joe Torre]], [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Billy Cunningham]] and [[Vitas Gerulaitis]]. Basketball legend [[Michael Jordan]] was born in Brooklyn though he grew up in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].

In the earliest days of organized baseball, Brooklyn teams dominated the new game. The second recorded game of baseball was played near what is today [[Fort Greene Park]] on October 24, 1845. Brooklyn's [[Excelsior of Brooklyn|Excelsiors]], [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantics]] and [[Eckford of Brooklyn|Eckfords]] were the leading teams from the mid-1850s through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and there were dozens of local teams with neighborhood league play, such as at [[Mapleton Park, Brooklyn, NY|Mapleton Oval]].<ref name="BrooklynBallParks.com"/> During this "Brooklyn era", baseball evolved into the modern game: the first [[fastball]], first [[changeup]], first [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], first [[triple play]], [[Jim Creighton|first pro baseball player]], first [[Union Grounds|enclosed ballpark]], first [[Baseball scorekeeping|scorecard]], first known African-American team, first black championship game, first road trip, first gambling scandal, and first eight pennant winners were all in or from Brooklyn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldbrooklynbaseball.com |title=Rare Sport for Connoisseurs: How Baseball Was Born in Brooklyn |publisher=Oldbrooklynbaseball.com |access-date=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

Brooklyn's most famous historical team, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], named for "trolley dodgers" played at [[Ebbets Field]].<ref>[http://www.ebbets-field.com/FAQ/index.htm Ebbets Field] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009222151/http://www.ebbets-field.com/FAQ/index.htm |date=October 9, 2007 }}. Retrieved October 10, 2007.</ref> In 1947 [[Jackie Robinson]] was hired by the Dodgers as the first African-American player in Major League Baseball in the modern era. In 1955, the Dodgers, perennial National League pennant winners, won the only [[World Series]] for Brooklyn against their rival [[New York Yankees]]. The event was marked by mass euphoria and celebrations. Just two years later, the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. [[Walter O'Malley]], the team's owner at the time, is still vilified, even by Brooklynites too young to remember the Dodgers as Brooklyn's ball club.

After a 43-year hiatus, professional baseball returned to the borough in 2001 with the [[Brooklyn Cyclones]], a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] team that plays in [[MCU Park]] in [[Coney Island]]. They are an affiliate of the [[New York Mets]]. The [[New York Cosmos (2010)|New York Cosmos]] of the NASL began playing at MCU Park in 2017.<ref>Elstein, Aaron.

Brooklyn was once served by [[list of streetcar lines in Brooklyn|an extensive network of streetcars]], but many were replaced by the [[List of bus routes in Brooklyn|public bus network]] that covers the entire borough. There is also daily express bus service into Manhattan.<ref>{{Cite NYC bus map|B}}</ref> New York's famous yellow cabs also provide transportation in Brooklyn, although they are less numerous in the borough. There are three commuter rail stations in Brooklyn: [[East New York (LIRR station)|East New York]], [[Nostrand Avenue (LIRR station)|Nostrand Avenue]], and [[Atlantic Terminal]], the terminus of the [[Atlantic Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]. The terminal is near the [[Atlantic Avenue&nbsp;– Barclays Center]] subway station, with ten connecting subway services.

Much of Brooklyn has only named streets, but [[Park Slope]], [[Bay Ridge]], [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], [[Bensonhurst]], and [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] and the other western sections have [[List of numbered Brooklyn streets|numbered streets]] running approximately northwest to southeast, and numbered avenues going approximately northeast to southwest. East of Dahill Road, lettered avenues (like Avenue M) run east and west, and numbered streets have the prefix "East". South of Avenue O, related numbered streets west of Dahill Road use the "West" designation. This set of numbered streets ranges from West 37th Street to East 108 Street, and the avenues range from A–Z with names substituted for some of them in some neighborhoods (notably Albemarle, Beverley, Cortelyou, Dorchester, Ditmas, Foster, Farragut, Glenwood, Quentin). Numbered streets prefixed by "North" and "South" in Williamsburg, and "Bay", "Beach", "Brighton", "Plumb", "Paerdegat" or "Flatlands" along the southern and southwestern waterfront are loosely based on the old grids of the original towns of Kings County that eventually consolidated to form Brooklyn. These names often reflect the bodies of water or beaches around them, such as [[Plumb Beach]] or [[Paerdegat Basin]].

Brooklyn is connected to Manhattan by three bridges, the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]], [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]], and [[Williamsburg Bridge]]s; a vehicular tunnel, the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]] (also known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel); and several subway tunnels. The [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]] links Brooklyn with the more suburban borough of [[Staten Island]]. Though much of its border is on land, Brooklyn shares several water crossings with [[Queens]], including the [[Pulaski Bridge]], the [[Greenpoint Avenue Bridge]], the [[Kosciuszko Bridge]] (part of the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]]), and the [[Grand Street Bridge]], all of which carry traffic over [[Newtown Creek]], and the [[Marine Parkway Bridge]] connecting Brooklyn to the [[Rockaway Peninsula]].
