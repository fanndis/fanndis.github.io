In contrast, as of November 2, 2005, the paper reported daily [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 177,714; Saturday circulation of 199,489 and Sunday circulation of 250,575.

It is owned by [[Gannett]], which also owns several smaller community newspapers in Middle Tennessee, including ''[[The Dickson Herald]]'', the ''[[Gallatin News-Examiner]]'', the ''[[Hendersonville Star-News]]'', the ''[[Fairview Observer]]'', and the ''[[Ashland City Times]]''. Its circulation area overlaps those of the ''[[Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle]]'' and ''[[The Daily News Journal]]'' in Murfreesboro, two other independent Gannett papers.

The company publishes several specialty publications, including ''[[Nashville Lifestyles]]'' magazine.

The paper's primary print competitors are the weekly ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' and the ''[[Nashville Business Journal]]''. In 2004 Gannett announced the acquisition of the ''[[Franklin Review-Appeal]]'', and ''[[The Daily News Journal]]'' in Murfreesboro from [[Morris Multimedia]]. The ''Review-Appeal'' became a supplement of ''The Tennessean'', while the ''Daily News Journal'' continued to operate as an independent newspaper.

The paper maintains two Goss Colorliner presses. In 2002, the paper completed installation of a MAN Roland [[UNISET]] press, which is now used to print regional editions of ''[[USA Today]]'', as well as commercial printing jobs. In early 2019 it was announced that the ''Tennessean'' would begin to be printed in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on presses which it would share with the ''[[Knoxville News-Sentinel]]''.

[[John Seigenthaler]] joined ''The Tennessean'' in 1949, resigning in 1960 to act as [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s administrative assistant. He rejoined ''The Tennessean'' as editor in 1962, publisher in 1973, and chairman in 1982 before retiring as chairman emeritus in 1991.

Ellen Leifeld was named as publisher in September 2005, succeeding Leslie Giallombardo, who became the newspaper's first female publisher in April 2002. Carol Hudler was named publisher in 2009 when Leifeld retired. Hudler was replaced by Laura Hollingsworth, who was named president and publisher in May 2013.

[[Frank Sutherland]] served as editor of the newspaper from 1989&ndash;2004. He began his [[journalism]] career as a reporter at the paper in the 1960s, and returned as editor after a serving in several leadership positions at other newspapers. He announced his retirement in September 2004.  He was briefly succeeded by [[Everett J. Mitchell II]], the former managing editor of the ''[[Detroit News]]'', who was the first [[African American]] to be editor of ''The Tennessean''. In September 2006, Mark Silverman was announced as editor. He was replaced by Maria De Varenne in 2011, who held the executive editor post until February 2014.

==History==
''The Tennessean'', Nashville's primary daily newspaper, traces its roots back to the ''Nashville Whig'', a weekly paper that began publication on September 1, 1812. The paper underwent  various mergers and acquisitions throughout the 19th century, emerging as the ''Nashville American''.

The first issue of the ''Nashville Tennessean'' was printed on Sunday May 12, 1907. The paper was founded by Col. [[Luke Lea (1879–1945)|Luke Lea]], a 28-year-old [[lawyer|attorney]] and local political activist.

In 1910, the publishers purchased a controlling interest in the ''Nashville American''.  They began publishing an edition known as ''The Tennessean American''.  When the ''American'' formally folded in 1911, some of its employees banded together to found the ''Nashville Democrat''.  This paper was purchased by the ''Tennessean'' in 1913.

In 1931, Col. Luke Lea and his son Luke Lea, Jr. were [[indicted]] for their role in the failure of the Central Bank and Trust Co. of [[Asheville, North Carolina]].  On March 3, 1933, the newspaper was placed under federal [[Receiver (legal)|receivership]], and [[Ashland City, Tennessee|Ashland City]] attorney and former ''Tennessean'' editorial writer [[Littleton J. Pardue]] was appointed to direct the paper. Under his leadership circulation grew swiftly, but the newspaper continued to lose money.

In 1935, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] acquired a large portion of the paper's outstanding bonds.  It eventually sold them to Paul Davis, president of the [[First American National Bank]] of Nashville.

Still suffering from effects of the [[Great Depression]], the paper was sold at auction in 1937, when it was purchased for $850,000 by Silliman Evans, Sr. a former reporter for the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''.  Evans came to an agreement with ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' publisher James Stahlman to move both newspapers into new offices at 1100 Broadway.  He created the [[Newspaper Printing Corporation]] as a business agent for both papers. As part of this agreement, the ''Tennessean'' ceased publication of its evening editions, and the ''Banner'' ceased publication of its Sunday edition. The two newspapers maintained a [[joint operating agreement]] from 1937 until the ''Banner'' ceased publication February 20, 1998.  The two papers operated out of the same building and shared advertising and production staff, but maintained separate (and distinct) ownership and editorial voices.

On June 2, 1955, Silliman Evans Jr. was named president of the paper. After his father died unexpectedly of a [[heart attack]] on June 26, the board of the paper elected him publisher, and he became president of the Newspaper Printing Corporation in August.

In 1957, ''Tennessean'' [[cartoonist]] [[Tom Little (cartoonist)|Tom Little]] won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his cartoon, ''"[[:File:Wonder Why My Parents Didn't Give Me Salk Shots?.jpg|Wonder Why My Parents Didn't Give Me Salk Shots?]]"'', encouraging parents to have their children [[Polio vaccine|immunized against polio]].

In 1961, Silliman Evans Jr. died of a heart attack at age 36 while on his boat on [[Old Hickory Lake]]. Ownership of the newspaper passed to his mother, and several months later his brother [[Amon Carter Evans]] was named Chief Executive of the paper.

''Tennessean'' reporters [[Nat Caldwell]] and [[Gene Graham]] won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1962 "[f]or their exclusive disclosure and six years of detailed reporting, under great difficulties, of the undercover cooperation between management interests in the coal industry and the [[United Mine Workers]]." In the same year, [[John Seigenthaler Sr.]] was named editor of the newspaper. He would earn the additional title of publisher in 1973.

[[File:Tennessean office.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Offices for ''The Tennessean''. The Gannett logo replaced the ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' logo in 1998.]]
In 1972, the Gannett Corporation purchased the ''Nashville Banner'' from the Stahlman family. In 1979, Gannett sold the ''Banner'' to a group of local investors including political figure [[John Jay Hooker]], businessman Brownlee Currey and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]] banker Irby Simpkins for about $25 million. It then purchased the ''Tennessean'' from the Evans family for about $50 million. John Seigenthaler became president, publisher, and editor of the Gannett-owned ''Tennessean''. Historian [[E. Thomas Wood]] says that "without question" Seigenthaler ran the newspaper as a liberal one.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wood|first=E. Thomas|title=Al Gore's other big week: the Vice-President as investigative reporter|newspaper=Columbia Journalism Review|date=January–February 1993}}</ref>

In 1976, when it was revealed that ''Tennessean'' reporter [[Jacqueline Srouji]] had for many years been working as an informant (and possibly ''[[agent provocateur]]'') for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], including spying on her colleagues at the paper, Seigenthaler fired her immediately. Srouji claimed that when she had started as a reporter for the ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' over a decade before, that paper's publisher had encouraged her to hand over information to the FBI.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879750,00.html?iid=chix-sphere "A Special Relationship"], ''TIME'', May 24, 1976</ref>

In 1989, Frank Sutherland was named editor. He had begun his career as a reporter at the paper in 1963. Seigenthaler retired as publisher in 1991. He was replaced by Craig Moon, who held the post until he moved into a corporate position with Gannett in 2002; Moon was later named publisher of ''[[USA Today]]''. Leslie Giallombardo was publisher from 2002 to 2005. Seigenthaler remained "Chairman Emeritus"{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} until he died.

In September 1998, the paper launched Tennessean.com, its news and information [[website]].

Among the notable journalists who have worked for ''The Tennessean'' are Vice President [[Al Gore]] and his wife [[Tipper Gore|Tipper]], [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[David Halberstam]], and cartoonist [[Anthony Wright (cartoonist)|Anthony Wright]].

In early 2019, ''The Tennessean'' confirmed that it would be leaving its long-time headquarters at 1100 Broadway for a smaller facility nearby, and that its printing operations would be consolidated with those of the Gannett-owned ''[[Knoxville News-Sentinel]]'' at a facility near Knoxville, resulting in much earlier [[time limit|deadline]]s for its print editions.
