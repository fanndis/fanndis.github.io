{{main|History of North Carolina State University}}
[[File:NCSU-Freshmen 1889.JPG|thumb|right|First freshman class at North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1889]]
The [[North Carolina General Assembly]] founded NC State on March 7, 1887 as a [[land-grant university|land-grant college]] under the name "North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts," or "North Carolina A&M" for short.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onboarding.ncsu.edu/nc-state-university-history-fun-facts/|title=NC State University History & Fun Facts – Onboarding Center|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926231807/https://onboarding.ncsu.edu/nc-state-university-history-fun-facts/|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the segregated system, it was open only to white students.

The [[G.I. Bill]] enabled thousands of veterans to attend college, and enrollment shot past the 5,000 mark in 1947.

State College created new academic programs, including the School of Architecture and Landscape Design in 1947 (renamed as the School of Design in 1948), the School of Education in 1948, and the School of Forestry in 1950.<ref name="BriefHistory" /> In the summer of 1956, following the US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v.

In 1963, State College officially became North Carolina State of the University of North Carolina. Students, faculty, and alumni continued to express dissatisfaction with this name, however, and after two additional years of protest, the name was changed to the current North Carolina State University at Raleigh.<ref name="BriefHistory" />

Celebrating its centennial in 1987, NC State reorganized its internal structure, renaming all its schools to colleges (e.g. School of Engineering to the [[North Carolina State University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]). Also in this year, it gained {{convert|700|acre|km2|1|abbr=on}} of land that was developed as [[Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University|Centennial Campus]]. Since then, NC State has focused on developing its new Centennial Campus.

{{main|Main Campus of North Carolina State University}}
[[File:HolladayHallNCSU.JPG|thumb|left|Holladay Hall, the first building built on NC State's campus in 1889, now houses the Chancellor's Office.]]
NC State's Main Campus has three sub-campuses: North Campus, Central Campus, and South Campus. North Campus is the oldest part of NC State and is home to most academic departments and a few residence halls. Central Campus is mainly residence halls, cafeterias, gymnasiums and student support facilities. Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the [[North Carolina Railroad]]. Pedestrian tunnels allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and [[Reynolds Coliseum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/campus_history/index.htm|title=Campus History|publisher=NC State Facilities Division|accessdate=May 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509011224/http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/campus_history/index.htm|archive-date=May 9, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[North Carolina State University Memorial Bell Tower|Memorial Bell Tower]], located in the Northeast corner of North Campus, serves as the signature of NC State and appears in the NC State Chancellor's Seal. It was constructed as a monument to alumni killed in World War I. The granite tower, completed in 1937, is 115&nbsp;feet (35 m) tall. As a tradition, the Belltower is lit in red at night immediately following athletic victories and certain academic achievements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chancellor.ncsu.edu/belltower.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901090821/http://chancellor.ncsu.edu/belltower.html|title=Belltower Celebrations|publisher=NC State Office of the Chancellor|archive-date=September 1, 2006 }}</ref>

The [[Court of North Carolina]], just west of the Memorial Bell Tower, is surrounded by the 1911 Building; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tompkins, Caldwell, Winston Halls and The College of Education in Poe Hall; Page Hall, home to College of Engineering offices; and Leazar Hall, former location of the Computer Science Teaching Labs. It was once home to 100 trees (one for every [[County (United States)|county]] in [[North Carolina]]), but damage caused by [[Hurricane Fran]] in 1996 reduced the number significantly, including the destruction of a particularly old and large tree which was some {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter. Some replanting has occurred, but the Court's former appearance is far from being restored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/buildings/tower.html|title=Memorial Bell Tower|publisher=NC State Facilities Division|accessdate=May 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705044636/http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/buildings/tower.html|archive-date=July 5, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The university's program was renamed the Plants for Human Health Institute when the N.C. Research Campus was officially dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order "to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease."<ref>{{cite web|title=N.C.

NC State athletic teams are nicknamed the 'Wolfpack' (most women's teams are also called the "Wolfpack," except for the women's basketball team who go by the "Wolfpack Women"). The name was adopted in 1922 when a disgruntled fan described the behavior of the student body at athletic events as being "like a wolf pack." Prior to the adoption of the current nickname, NC State athletic teams went by such names as the Aggies, the Techs, and the Red Terrors. Since the 1960s the Wolfpack has been represented at athletic events by its mascots, Mr. and Mrs. Wuf. In print, the 'Strutting Wolf' is used and is known by the name 'Tuffy.'<ref name="ncsu2"/>

The NC State wrestling team was established in 1925, and is coached by Pat Popolizio, named head wrestling coach for the Wolfpack on April 10, 2012. The team has won 14 [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Championships & 5 individual NCAA Champions.

===Student government===
Founded in 1921, NC State [[Student Government]] is a student-run organization that serves as the official voice of the student body and attempts to better the student experience at the university. Both a governing body and an advocacy group, Student Government is involved in policy-making, adjudication, programming, advocating, community service, and countless other activities. The organization is a clearinghouse for concerns from students and answers from administrators. The organization also is responsible for distributing a portion of the fees it receives to student organizations in a process known as appropriations. Student organizations must be registered through Student Involvement to become eligible for appropriations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |title=Description of the NC State Student Government. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926234901/http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''Student Government Structure'''

The student government at NC State is composed of three branches and headed by four student body officers (SBOs). The Student Body President heads the executive branch. The president executes policy passed by the senate and is a member of the NC State Board of Trustees. The president runs for office and serves with a student body vice president, who assumes the presidency if that office becomes vacant. The Student Senate is a 72-member body<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} Student Government|url=https://orgs.ncsu.edu/student-govt/history/|access-date=2020-06-30|website=orgs.ncsu.edu}}</ref> that considers legislative policy on behalf of the students of the university. Senators draft legislation to address student concerns, act as checks on the Executive branch, and helps approve the annual Student Government Budget.  It is headed by the student senate president, who serves as the executive student body vice president. The budget is drafted each year by the Student Body Treasurer who oversees the monetary status of the entirety of Student Government and as such is a member of both the Legislative and Executive branches. The student chief justice heads the [[judicial branch]] and is the only member of that branch elected by the student body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |title=NC State's Judicial Branch. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926235109/http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Shack-A-Thon====
Shack-A-Thon, a tradition since 1991, is NC State's [[Habitat for Humanity]]'s annual fall fundraiser. Habitat for Humanity at NC State's Campus Chapter partners with many other student organizations to take over the Brickyard by building shacks that the students live, sleep, and study in for an entire week. Each group raises money by collecting from people walking through the brickyard and online donations. This money goes toward funding a house through Habitat for Humanity of Wake County. In 2014 students raised over $46,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/stud_orgs/habitat/doShack.php |title=Shack-A-Thon at NCSU |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526091639/http://www.ncsu.edu/stud_orgs/habitat/doShack.php |archive-date=May 26, 2007 }}</ref>
