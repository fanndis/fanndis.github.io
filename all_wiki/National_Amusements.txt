'''National Amusements, Inc.''' is an American privately owned theater company and mass media [[holding company]] based in [[Norwood, Massachusetts]], and incorporated in [[Maryland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=National+Amusements&owner=exclude&action=getcompany|title=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission EDGAR|author=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|date=2018-03-26}}</ref> It is the parent company of [[ViacomCBS]].

== History ==
{{ViacomCBS evolution}}
The company was founded by [[Michael Redstone]] in 1936 in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] as Northeast Theater Corporation, operating a chain of [[Movie theater|movie theaters]] in the region. Fifty years later in 1986, when the founder's son [[Sumner Redstone]] joined the company, it had been renamed National Amusements. That year, the company acquired [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]], a former [[CBS]] subsidiary syndicating [[television]] programs to stations around the [[United States]]. NA retained the Viacom name and made a string of large acquisitions in the early 1990s, announcing plans to merge with Paramount Communications (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]), parent of [[Paramount Pictures]], in 1993, and buying the [[Blockbuster Video]] chain in 1994. The acquisition of Paramount Communications in July 1994 made Viacom one of the world's largest entertainment companies.

In March 2005, the company announced plans of looking into splitting into two publicly traded companies under the continuing ownership of [[National Amusements]] because of a stagnating stock price. The internal rivalry between [[Les Moonves]] and [[Tom Freston]], longtime heads of [[CBS]] and [[MTV Networks]] respectively, and [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|the controversy of Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]], which resulted in MTV being banned from producing any more [[Super Bowl]] halftime shows, were also seen as factors. After the departure of [[Mel Karmazin]] in 2004, Redstone, who served as [[chairman]] and [[chief executive officer]], decided to split the offices of [[President (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief operating officer]] between Moonves and Freston. Redstone was set to retire in the near future, and a split would be a creative solution to the matter of replacing him.

The split was approved by Viacom's board on June 14, 2005, and took effect on January 1, 2006, and effectively reversed the Viacom/CBS merger of 1999. The existing Viacom was renamed [[CBS Corporation]] (thus restoring its pre-merger name) and was headed by Moonves. It was intended to include Viacom's slower-growing business, namely [[CBS]], [[The CW]] (a merger of [[UPN]] and [[The WB Television Network|The WB]]), [[CBS Radio]] (since sold to [[Entercom]] as of November 17, 2017<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.insideradio.com/free/entercom-sets-friday-morning-close-for-cbs-radio-merger/article_c613cfd8-caab-11e7-8e38-eb120211080a.html|title=Entercom Sets Friday Morning Close For CBS Radio Merger.|work=Insideradio.com|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}</ref>), [[Simon & Schuster]], [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]] (formerly [[Viacom Outdoor]]), [[Showtime Networks]], [[CBS Television Studios]], [[CBS Television Distribution]] and [[CBS Studios International]].

In addition, CBS Corporation was given [[Paramount Parks]], which it later sold to [[amusement park]] operator [[Cedar Fair]] on June 30, 2006, and the [[CBS College Sports Network]], now known as the [[CBS Sports Network]].

Additionally, a spun-off company was created called [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]], which was headed by Freston. It comprised [[MTV Networks]], [[BET Networks]], Paramount Pictures, and Paramount Pictures' home entertainment operations. These businesses were categorized as the high-growth businesses.

At the end of 2008, due to financial troubles, owners [[Sumner Redstone]] and [[Shari Redstone]] sold $400 million of nonvoting shares in National Amusements.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/11/business/fi-redstone11 |title=Redstone hit by credit troubles |first=Meg |last=James |work=[[LA Times]] |date=October 11, 2008 |accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/shari-redstone-sumner-redstone-viacom-cbs-buyout-1201665973/|title=Report: Shari Redstone Rejected $1 Billion Buyout Offer of Her Stake in Family Empire|work=Variety|date=21 December 2015|publisher=}}</ref> In October 2009, the company sold almost $1 billion of its interest in the stock of CBS and Viacom<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynewstranscript.com/business/x576554618/National-Amusements-Inc-to-sell-nearly-1B-of-its-Viacom-CBS-stock |title=National Amusements Inc. to sell nearly $1B of its Viacom, CBS stock |author=Edward B.

As of December 2019, National Amusements, directly and through subsidiaries, holds approximately 79.4% of the Class A (voting) common stock of ViacomCBS Inc., constituting 10.2% of the overall equity of the Company. The company may hold an unspecified stake in [[Entercom]], as part of the [[reverse Morris trust]] that spun [[CBS Radio|CBS's radio assets]] off to that company; CBS Corporation shareholders overall held a 72% stake in Entercom as of the spin-off.<ref name="variety-cbsentercom">{{cite web|title=CBS Sets Radio Division Merger With Entercom|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/cbs-entercom-radio-division-merger-1201976392/|website=Variety|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>
