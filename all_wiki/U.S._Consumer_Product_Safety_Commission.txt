The '''United States Consumer Product Safety Commission''' ('''USCPSC''', '''CPSC''', or '''commission''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]].  The CPSC seeks to promote the safety of consumer products by addressing “unreasonable risks” of injury (through coordinating recalls, evaluating products that are the subject of consumer complaints or industry reports, etc.); developing uniform safety standards (some mandatory, some through a voluntary standards process); and conducting research into product-related illness and injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2051|title=15 U.S. Code § 2051 - Congressional findings and declaration of purpose|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref> In part due to its small size, the CPSC attempts to coordinate with outside parties—including companies and consumer advocates—to leverage resources and expertise to achieve outcomes that advance consumer safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov//Global/About-CPSC/Nord/NordstatementonBassinetsCradlesFinalRule20130930%20.pdf|title=Statement on the Commission’s decision to adopt a safety standard for bassinets and cradles, 16 C.F.R. part 1218|last=Nord|first=Nancy|date=2013-09-30|publisher=CPSC|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref> The agency was created in 1972 through the [[Consumer Product Safety Act]].

The commissioners set policy for the CPSC. The CPSC is headquartered in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].<ref name="www.cpsc.gov"/>

==Leadership==
The commissioners of the CPSC are appointed by the U.S. president and with the consent of the U.S. Senate. As with some other U.S. federal independent agencies, commissioners are selected as members of political parties. Although the president is entitled by statute to select the chairman (with the consent of the Senate),<ref>15 U.S.C. § 2053(a)[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2053 .]</ref> no more than three commissioners may belong to the same party.<ref>15 U.S.C. § 2053(c)[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2053].</ref> Thus, the president is generally expected to consult with members of the opposite party in the Senate to select members of the commission from the opposite party. The commissioners (including the chairman) vote on selecting the vice chairman, who becomes acting chairman if the chairman’s term ends upon resignation or expiration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.adlawaccess.com/2017/01/articles/cpsc-commissioner-ann-marie-buerkle-elected-vice-chair-cpsc-under-regulatory-freeze/#page=1|title=CPSC Commissioner Ann Marie Buerkle Elected Vice Chair; CPSC under Regulatory Freeze {{!}} Ad Law Access|date=2017-01-23|newspaper=Ad Law Access|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Chairmen ===
The commission is led by acting Chairman [[Robert S. Adler]], a Democrat who had previously served as acting chairman during the interim period between [[Inez Tenenbaum]] and [[Elliot F. Kaye]]’s chairmanships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2020/Robert-Adler-Becomes-Acting-Chairman-of-U-S-Consumer-Product-Safety-Commission/|title=Robert Adler Becomes Acting Chairman of U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|date=2019-10-01|website=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Adler’s immediate predecessor was [[Ann Marie Buerkle]], who held that position for the majority of the 2017-to-2019 period. Although she was nominated to be full, rather than acting, chairman, the Senate never acted on her nomination. The commission has not had a Senate-confirmed chairman since Kaye stepped down as chair following a White House request after Donald Trump’s inauguration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerprotectioncxn.com/2017/02/1235/|title=Elliot Kaye Steps Down as CPSC Chair|last=Cardon|first=Nathan|last2=Millar|first2=Sheila|date=2017-02-09|website=Consumer Protection Connection|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> In March 2020, President Trump nominated Nancy Beck, an official at the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], to chair the commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/116th-congress/1687|title=PN1687 - Nomination of Nancy B.

==Scope==
[[image:ATV Safety--Take Knowledge to the Extreme - CPSC.jpg|thumb|150px|All-terrain vehicle safety poster]]
The CPSC regulates the manufacture and sale of more than 15,000 different consumer products, from [[infant bed|cribs]] to [[all-terrain vehicles]]. Products excluded from the CPSC’s jurisdiction include those specifically named by law as under the jurisdiction of other federal agencies. For example, on-road automobiles are regulated by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], guns are regulated by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]], and drugs are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].

==Activities==
The CPSC fulfills its mission by banning dangerous consumer products, establishing safety requirements for other consumer products, issuing recalls of products already on the market, and researching potential hazards associated with consumer products.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About CPSC|url = http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/|website = U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref>

=== Recalls, voluntary & otherwise ===
The aspect of CPSC’s work that most U.S. citizens might recognize is the “recall,” formally a “corrective action” in which a company develops a “a comprehensive plan that reaches throughout the entire distribution chain to consumers who have the product” and addresses a potential or alleged failure of a product.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/8002.pdf|title=Recall Handbook: A Guide for Manufacturers, Importers, Distributors and Retailers on Reporting Under Sections 15 and 37 of the Consumer Product Safety Act and Section 102 of the Child Safety Protection Act and Preparing for, Initiating, and Implementing Product Safety Recalls Including CPSC Fast Track Product Recall Program and use of Social Media|date=March 2012|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Office of Compliance & Field Operations|location=Bethesda, Maryland|pages=17|format=PDF}}</ref> Recalls are nearly always voluntary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/09/how-the-cpsc-keeps-consumers-safe-from-products-that-get-recalled.html|title=How the CPSC keeps consumers safe from products that get recalled|last=Day|first=Jennifer Schlesinger,Andrea|date=2017-09-09|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> While many recalls involve consumers returning consumer products to the manufacturer for a replacement or, more rarely, a refund, recalls have also involved tasks such as instructing users on how to clean an item<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Fisher-Price-Recalls-to-Inspect-Rock-N-Play-Infant-Sleepers-Due-to-Risk-of-Exposure-to-Mold/|title=Fisher-Price Recalls to Inspect Rock ‘N Play Infant Sleepers Due to Risk of Exposure to Mold|date=2016-07-23|website=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> or publishing a software patch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2014/Nest-Labs-Recalls-to-Repair-Nest-Protect-Smoke-CO-Alarms/|title=Nest Labs Recalls to Repair Nest Protect Smoke CO Alarms|date=2016-07-23|website=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Most recalls recover very few consumer products, for a variety of hypothesized reasons. Industry and consumer advocates are often at odds over whether recalls need to be more effective, as many consumers may simply discard products that are the subject of recalls. Whether a consumer learns of a recall in the first place is a different question. One commissioner has called for companies to spend as much on recall advertising as the companies do on their advertising of the products before recalls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/about-cpsc/commissioner/elliot-f-kaye/statements/statement-of-commissioner-elliot-f-kaye-on-consumer|title=Statement of Commissioner Elliot F. Kaye on Consumer-Friendly Product Recalls: Six Basic Principles That Will Put Safety First and Improve Effectiveness|date=2017-07-19|website=CPSC.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>

=== Rulemaking ===
The CPSC makes rules about consumer products when it identifies a consumer product hazard that is not already addressed by an industry [[voluntary consensus standards|voluntary consensus standard]], or when Congress directs it to do so. Its rules can specify basic design requirements, or they can amount to product bans, as in the case of small high-powered magnets, which the CPSC attempted to ban.<ref>{{cite web|title=After death and recalls, feds ban high-powered magnets|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-deaths-and-recalls-feds-ban-high-powered-magnets/|publisher=CBS News|access-date=6 May 2015}}</ref> For certain infant products, the CPSC regulates even when voluntary standards exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/Global/About-CPSC/Nord/NordstatementonBassinetsCradlesFinalRule20130930%20.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement on the Commission's decision to adopt a safety standard for bassinets and cradles, 16 C.F.R. part 1218 |publisher=Cpsc.gov |access-date=2015-05-06}}</ref> The CPSC is required to follow a rigorous, scientific process to develop mandatory rules. Failing to do so can justify the revocation of a rule, as was the case in a Tenth Circuit  decision vacating the CPSC’s ban on small high-powered magnets.<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15096729491025306680&hl=en&as_sdt=20006 Zen Magnets v. CPSC]'', 841 F.3d 1,141 (10th Cir. 2016).</ref>

===Information gathering & information sharing===
The CPSC learns about unsafe products in several ways. The agency maintains a consumer hotline through which consumers may report concerns about unsafe products or injuries associated with products. Product safety concerns may also be submitted through SaferProducts.gov. The agency also operates the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a probability sample of about 100 [[hospitals]] with 24-hour [[emergency rooms]]. NEISS collects data on consumer product related injuries treated in [[Emergency room|ERs]] and can be used to generate national estimates.

The agency also works with and shares information with other governments, both in the U.S. (with states and public health agencies) and with international counterparts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/about-cpsc/chairman/speeches/press-event-launching-globalrecalls-web-portal/|title=Statement at press event launching Global Recalls Web Portal, OECD, Brussels, Belgium|last=Tenenbaum|first=Inez|date=2012-11-12|website=CPSC.gov|access-date=2017-08-20}}</ref>

====Publicity & communication====
[[File:Screen shot of CPSC Fireworks Safety Demonstration 2017.png|thumb|Mannequin targeted in CPSC Fireworks Safety Demonstration 2017]]The CPSC works on a variety of publicity campaigns to raise awareness of safety.

===== Drowning prevention =====

== Mid-2000s reform following the “Year of the Recall” ==
{{Main|2007 Chinese export recalls|Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act}}
The year 2007 was called the “Year of the Recall” by some CPSC-watchers in the United States. The CPSC worked with manufacturers and importers on a record 473 voluntary recalls that year,<ref name=Flaherty2008/> and other U.S. federal agencies promoted other widely noted recalls. CPSC recalls included many incidents with lead in toys and other children’s products.

=== Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 ===
These issues led to the legislative interest in the reform of the agency, and the final result of these efforts was the passage of the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] in 2008. The bill increased funding and staffing for the CPSC, placed stricter limits on lead levels in children’s products (redefined from products intended for children age seven and under to children age twelve and under), restricted certain [[phthalate]]s in children’s toys and child care articles, and required mandatory testing and certification of applicable products. The Danny Keysar Child Product Notification Act required the CPSC to create a public database of recalled products and to provide consumers with a postage-paid postcard for each durable infant or toddler product. This act was named after [[Linda E. Ginzel|Danny Keysar]], who died in a recalled crib.<ref name="Flaherty2008" /> Danny’s parents, [[Linda E. Ginzel]] and [[Boaz Keysar]], founded [[Kids In Danger]] and were instrumental in working with the CPSC to strengthen product safety standards.

=== Creation of public database ===
The [[public database]] ([http://www.saferproducts.gov// saferproducts.gov]), constructed at a cost of around US$3 million and launched in March 2011, “publicizes complaints from virtually anyone who can provide details about a safety problem connected with any of the 15,000 kinds of consumer goods regulated by the CPSC.”<ref name="wp20110412">{{cite news

=== Industry-sponsored travel in the early 2000s ===
On November 2, 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that between 2002 and the date of their report, former chairman [[Hal Stratton]] and current commissioner and former acting chairman [[Nancy Nord]] had taken more than 30 trips paid for by manufacturing groups or lobbyists representing industries that are under the supervision of the agency. According to the ''Post'', the groups paid for over $60,000 travel and related expenses during this time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/01/AR2007110102732.html?hpid=topnews|title=Industries Paid for Top Regulators' Travel|last=Williamson|first=Elizabeth|date=2007-11-02|access-date=2007-11-02|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

=== Surviving challenges to the commission’s continued existence ===
The CPSC’s creation was not without controversy, and the agency survived attempts to close it in its first decades. In 1981, President Ronald [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan’s]] [[OMB Director|head]] of the [[Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management & Budget]], [[David Stockman]], sought to end the authorization for the agency to move it inside the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/05/10/reagan-wants-to-ax-product-safety-agency/d8c1749f-87ea-4483-bf1f-370f41ef6b0b/ |title=Reagan Wants to Ax Product Safety Agency|last=Brown|first=Merrill|date=1981-05-10|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> The agency was given a new lease on life following agreement among U.S. senators.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/07/us/2-key-senators-agree-to-a-reprieve-for-consumer-product-safety-unit.html|title=2 Key Senators Agree to a Reprieve for Consumer Product Safety Unit|last=Sulzberger |first=A.
