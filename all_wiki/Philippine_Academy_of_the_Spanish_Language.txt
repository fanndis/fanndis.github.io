The '''Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language''' ({{Lang-es|Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española}}, abbreviated '''AFLE'''; {{lang-fil|Akademyang Pilipino ng Wikang Espanyol}}) is the [[language regulator]] for the [[Philippine Spanish|Spanish languages]] in the [[Philippines]]. It is one of two Spanish language regulators located in countries where the language does not have an official status nationwide, the other being the [[North American Academy of the Spanish Language]] in the [[United States]].<ref name="donquijote">{{cite web | title=The North American Academy of Spanish Language | url=http://blog.donquijote.org/2013/11/the-north-american-academy-of-spanish-language | publisher=Don Quijote Spanish School | date=November 14, 2013 | accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref>

A founding member of the [[Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española]] (ASALE), the Academy was formerly headquartered in the [[Casino Español de Manila]] in [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]], [[Manila]] before moving to its current headquarters in [[Makati]].

==Background==
[[File:Países con academia de la lengua española.png|thumb|350px|right|Countries with institutes that are members of the ASALE.]]

The Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language was established in [[Manila]] on July 25, 1924. The eleventh Spanish language academy in the world to be founded, its establishment reflected the preeminent position of Spanish as a language in the Philippines at the time despite already-existing cultural influences coming from the United States.<ref name="laregion">{{cite news | author=Llano, Juan | title=José Rodríguez: "Filipinas se ha convertido en una oportunidad para los españoles" | url=http://www.laregion.es/articulo/ourense/jose-rodriguez-filipinas-ha-convertido-oportunidad-espanoles/20150412081112536768.html | work=[[La Región]] | publisher=La Región S.A. | language=Spanish | date=April 12, 2015 | accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref>

Despite the diminishing position of Spanish in the Philippines relative to English, the Academy continued to exist despite intermittent criticism. In 1986, Spanish poet [[Dámaso Alonso]] unsuccessfully called for its dissolution, citing Enrique Fernández Lumba, a member who had dismissed the organization as a "relic".<ref name="donoso">{{cite book | author=Donoso, Isaac | editor=Donoso, Isaac | title=Historia cultural de la lengua española en Filipinas: ayer y hoy | language=Spanish | trans-title=Cultural history of the Spanish language in the Philippines: then and now | chapter=Sociolingüística histórica del español en Filipinas | trans-chapter=Historical sociolinguistics of Spanish in the Philippines | page=343 | year=2013 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm4yAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA343&dq=academia+filipina+de+la+lengua+espa%C3%B1ola&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbq5eTsfLoAhUNpZ4KHZCrBqIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=academia%20filipina%20de%20la%20lengua%20espa%C3%B1ola&f=false | place=Madrid | publisher=Editorial Verbum | isbn=9788479628130 | via=[[Google Books]] }}</ref>

In 2008, ''[[El País]]'' reported that the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] revoked the Academy's corporate registration in 2003 due to its non-filing of annual returns.<ref name="elpais">{{cite news | title=La Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española no tiene licencia | url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2008/10/28/actualidad/1225148401_850215.html | work=[[El País]] | publisher=Ediciones El País, S.L. | language=Spanish | date=October 28, 2008 | accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref> Despite this, the Academy nonetheless is recognized as possibly playing a key role again in revitalizing the Spanish language and promoting Spanish culture in the Philippines,<ref name="newprospects">{{cite web | author=Rodríguez-Ponga, Rafael | title=New Prospects for the Spanish Language in the Philippines (ARI) | url=http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/spanish+language+culture/ari27-2009 | publisher=[[Elcano Royal Institute|Real Instituto Elcano]] | date=February 26, 2009 | accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref> a role that it also played in previous years.<ref name="cambridgecore">{{cite book | author=Fernández, Mauro | editor=del Valle, José | title=A Political History of Spanish: The Making of a Language | url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/political-history-of-spanish/representation-of-spanish-in-the-philippine-islands/B6092993563CF09F91FF84D511A25A80/core-reader | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2013 | pages=364–379 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511794339.030 | isbn= 9780511794339 | accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref>

[[Darío Villanueva]], director of the [[Real Academia Española]], visited the Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language in July 2017 as part of his official visit to the Philippines. During his visit, where he also presided over a meeting of the Academy's board of directors, he remarked that the Academy served as "the perennial lighthouse of the Spanish language" in the country.<ref name="elperiodico">{{cite news | title=El director de la RAE culmina su visita a la Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española, "faro del español" en el país | url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/ocio-y-cultura/20170708/el-director-de-la-rae-culmina-su-visita-a-la-academia-filipina-de-la-lengua-espanola-faro-del-espanol-en-el-pais-6155884 | work=[[El Periódico de Catalunya]] | publisher=Grupo Zeta | language=Spanish | date=July 8, 2017 | accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref>

==Status of Spanish in the Philippines==
{{main|Spanish language in the Philippines}}
Section 7, Article XIV of the present [[1987 Constitution|1987 Philippine Constitution]] specifies Spanish (along with [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) as a language to "be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis".

Spanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries (333 years) of the Philippines being part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and continued to serve as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' until the first half of the 20th century.

In December 2007, former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in [[Spain]] requiring the teaching and learning of the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.<!-- ref name=SpanishGMA2 --> The Under-Secretary of the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]], Vilma L. Labrador, circulated a Memorandum (17/XII/2007), on the ''"Restoration of the Spanish language in Philippine Education"''. In it, the Department mandates secondary schools to offer basic and advanced Spanish.
