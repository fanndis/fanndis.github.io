'''BRIC''' is a grouping [[acronym]] referring to the [[countries]] of [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], and [[China]] deemed to be [[developing countries]] at a similar stage of newly advanced [[economic development]], on their way to becoming [[developed countries]]. It is typically rendered as "the BRIC," "the BRIC countries," "the BRIC economies," or alternatively as the "Big Four". A related acronym, [[BRICS]], adds [[South Africa]]. 

The term was coined by economist [[Jim O'Neill (economist)|Jim O'Neill]] in 2001 as an acronym for the four countries, which were deemed to be at a similar stage of newly advanced economic development.<ref name=original>{{cite book|last1=O'Neill|first1=Jim |authorlink1=Jim O'Neill (economist)|title=Building Better Global Economic BRICs, Global Economics Paper No: 66|date=30 November 2001|publisher=Goldman Sachs|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/archive/archive-pdfs/build-better-brics.pdf|access-date=2015-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114114835/http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/archive/archive-pdfs/build-better-brics.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=howsolild>{{cite book|author1=O'Neill, Jim |author2=Dominic Wilson|author3=Roopa Purushothaman|author4=Anna Stupnytska|title=How Solid are the BRICs?

==Thesis==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Central-mumbai-skyline.jpg|thumb|225x225px|[[Mumbai]], India]] -->The [[economic potential]] of [[Economy of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Economy of Russia|Russia]], [[Economy of India|India]] and [[Economy of China|China]] is such that they could become among the four most dominant economies by the year 2050. The thesis was proposed by [[Jim O'Neill (economist)|Jim O'Neill]], global economist at Goldman Sachs.<ref name=askexpert>

On almost every scale, they would be the largest entity on the global stage. These four countries are among the biggest and fastest-growing [[emerging market]]s.{Incal 2011}

They have taken steps to increase their political cooperation, mainly as a way of influencing the [[United States]] position on major trade accords, or, through the implicit threat of political cooperation, as a way of extracting [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] from the United States, such as the proposed nuclear cooperation with India.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Apec and the Rise of China|last=Lok-sang Ho|first=John Wong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=118}}</ref>

The BRIC thesis recognizes that [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]] and [[China]] have changed their political systems to embrace global [[capitalism]].<ref>

</ref> Goldman Sachs predicts that China and India, respectively, will become the dominant global suppliers of [[manufactured good]]s and [[Service (economics)|services]], while Brazil and Russia will become similarly dominant as suppliers of raw materials. Of the four countries, Brazil remains the only [[polity]] that can continue all elements, meaning manufacturing, services, and resource supplying simultaneously. Cooperation is thus hypothesized to be a logical next step among the BRICs because Brazil and Russia together form the logical commodity suppliers.

In 2016, an economist from Australia predicted that in 2050, based on [[Gross Domestic Product]] per capita spending, China will be the first and followed by India and the United States. [[Indonesia]] which nowadays does not belong to BRIC countries will jump from 9th position to 4th position. And Brazil will be in the fifth position. It is due to the global economic center is shifting from the Atlantic to the Asia Pacific region.<ref>

===Follow-up report (2004)===
The [[Goldman Sachs]] global economics team released a follow-up report to its initial BRIC study in 2004.<ref>
[http://www2.goldmansachs.com/hkchina/insight/research/pdf/BRICs_3_12-1-05.pdf BRICs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227020712/http://www2.goldmansachs.com/hkchina/insight/research/pdf/BRICs_3_12-1-05.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} - Goldman Sachs Research Report {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227020712/http://www2.goldmansachs.com/hkchina/insight/research/pdf/BRICs_3_12-1-05.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}
</ref> The report states that in BRIC nations, the number of people with an annual income over a threshold of $3,000 will double in number within three years and reach 800 million people within a decade. This predicts a massive rise in the size of the middle class in these nations. In 2025, it is calculated that the number of people in BRIC nations earning over $15,000 may reach over 200 million people. This indicates that a huge pickup in demand will not be restricted to basic goods but impact higher-priced goods as well. According to the report, first China and then a decade later India will begin to dominate the world economy.

Yet despite the balance of growth swinging so decisively towards the BRIC economies, the average level of individuals in the more [[Developed countries|advanced economies]] will continue to far outstrip the BRIC economic average for the foreseeable future.

The report also highlights India's inefficient [[Energy policy of India|energy consumption]] and mentions the dramatic under-representation of these economies in the global [[capital market]]s. The report also emphasizes the enormous populations that exist within the BRIC nations, which makes it relatively easy for their aggregate wealth to eclipse the [[Group of Six|G6]], while per-capita income levels remain far below the norm of today's [[industrialized countries]]. This phenomenon, too, will affect world markets as multinational corporations will attempt to take advantage of the enormous potential markets in the BRICs by producing, for example, far cheaper [[automobile]]s and other manufactured goods affordable to the consumers within the BRICs in lieu of the luxury models that currently bring the most income to automobile manufacturers. India and China have already started making their presence felt in the service and manufacturing sector respectively in the global arena. Developed economies of the world have already taken serious note of this fact.

===(2007) ''Second Follow-up report''===
This report compiled by lead authors Tushar Poddar and Eva Yi gives insight into "India's Rising Growth Potential". It reveals updated projection figures attributed to the rising growth trends in India over the last four years. Goldman Sachs asserts that "India's influence on the world economy will be bigger and quicker than implied in our previously published BRICs research". They noted significant areas of research and development, and expansion that is happening in the country, which will lead to the prosperity of the growing middle-class.<ref name="India's Rising Growth Potential">

India has 10 of the 30 fastest-growing urban areas in the world. Based on current trends, an estimated a massive 700 million people will move to cities by 2050. This will have significant implications for demand for urban infrastructure, real estate, and services.<ref name="India's Rising Growth Potential"/>

In the revised 2007 figures, based on increased and sustaining growth, more inflows into foreign direct investment, Goldman Sachs predicts that "from 2007 to 2020, India's GDP per capita in US$ terms will quadruple", and that the Indian economy will surpass the [[United States]] (in US$) by 2043.<ref name="India's Rising Growth Potential"/> At the same time, the report indicated that Russia, while continuing its dominance of the [[Energy policy of the European Union|European energy market]], would continue to struggle economically, as its population declines.

According to The [[National Institute of Economic and Social Research]] (NIESR) based on [[International Monetary Fund]] figures, in 2012 Brazil has become the sixth-biggest economy in the world by overtaking United Kingdom with $2.52 trillion and $2.48 trillion, respectively. In 2010, the Brazilian economy was worth $2.09 trillion and UK with $2.25 trillion. Significant increase is caused by Brazilian economic boom on high food and oil prices.<ref>

Goldman Sachs has quietly closed down its BRIC fund after lost 88 percent of its asset value since 2010, instead channeling the fund into emerging markets countries. Historically, Jim O'Neill, the inventor of the term "BRIC," was the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs. The head of emerging markets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Ruchir Sharma, has released a book in 2012: ''[[Breakout Nations]]'' which mentioned that it is hard to sustain rapid growth for more than a decade.<ref name="Rana Foroohar"/>

Based on a March 2011 ''[[Forbes]]'' report, the BRIC countries counted 301 [[billionaire]]s among their combined populations, exceeding the number of billionaires in Europe, which stood at 300 in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rappeport|first1=Alan|title=Brics becoming billionaire factory|url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bc9b6d80-4a8d-11e0-82ab-00144feab49a.html|work=Financial Times|date=9 March 2011}}</ref>

</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' publishes an annual table of socio-economic national statistics in its "Pocket World in Figures".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Extrapolating the global rankings from their 2008 Edition for the BRIC countries and economies in relation to various categories provides an interesting touchstone in relation to the economic underpinnings of the BRIC thesis. It also illustrates how, despite their divergent economic bases, the economic indicators are remarkably similar in global rankings between the different economies. It also suggests that, while economic arguments can be made for linking Mexico into the BRIC thesis, the case for including South Korea looks considerably weaker.

The following three tables are lists of economies by incremental GDP from 2006 to 2050 by [[Goldman Sachs]]. They illustrate that the BRICs and N11 nations are replacing G7 nations as the main contributors to the world's economic growth. From 2020 to 2050, nine of the ten largest countries by incremental GDP are occupied by the BRICs and N11 nations, in which the [[United States]] remains to be the only G7 member as one of the three biggest contributors to the global economic growth.<ref name="N11"/>

At the [[World Economic Forum]] 2011, there were 365 corporate executives from BRIC and other emerging nations out of 1000 participants. It was a record number of executives from emerging markets. Nomura Holdings Inc's co-head of global investment banking said that "It's a reflection of where economic power and influence is starting to move." The [[International Monetary Fund]] estimated emerging markets might expand 6.5 percent in 2011, more than double the 2.5 percent rate for developed countries. BRIC's takeover made record by 22 percent of global deals or increase by 74 percent in one year and more than quadrupled in the last five years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mobile.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2065100&sid=a7CGZv5B2Guo |work=Bloomberg |title=Your Playlist is currently empty }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:BRIC2010.jpg|thumb|The BRIC leaders in 2010]]

Various sources refer to a purported "original" BRIC agreement that predates the Goldman Sachs thesis. Some of these sources claim that President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia was the driving force behind this original cooperative coalition of developing BRIC countries. However, thus far, no text has been made public of any formal agreement to which all four BRIC states are signatories. This does not mean, however, that they have not reached a multitude of bilateral or even quadrilateral agreements. Evidence of agreements of this type are abundant and are available on the foreign ministry websites of each of the four countries. Trilateral agreements and frameworks made among the BRICs include the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (member states include Russia and China, observers include India) and the [[IBSA Dialogue Forum|IBSA Trilateral Forum]], which unites Brazil, India, and [[South Africa]] in annual dialogues. Also important to note is the [[G-20]] coalition of developing states which includes all the BRICs.

Also, because of the popularity of the Goldman Sachs thesis "BRIC", this term has sometimes been extended whereby "BRICK"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24224508-5001942,00.html|title=The Australian Business - Emerging markets put China, India in the shade|publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au|date=27 August 2008|accessdate=2010-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418033346/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24224508-5001942,00.html|archive-date=2009-04-18|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>

===Marketing===

The BRIC term is also used by companies who refer to the four named countries as key to their [[emerging market]]s strategies. By comparison, the reduced acronym IC would not be attractive, although the term "[[Chindia]]" is often used. BRIC's study specifically focuses on large countries, not necessarily the wealthiest or the most productive and was never intended to be an investment thesis. If investors read Goldman's research carefully and agreed with the conclusions, then they would gain exposure to Asian debt and equity markets rather than to [[Latin America]]. According to estimates provided by the USDA, the wealthiest regions outside of the G6 in 2015 will be [[Hong Kong]], South Korea and [[Singapore]]. Combined with China and India, these five economies are likely to be the world's five most influential economies outside of the G6.

On the other hand, when the "R" in BRIC is extended beyond Russia and is used as a loose term to include all of Eastern Europe as well, then the BRIC story becomes more compelling. At issue are the multiple serious problems which confront Russia (potentially unstable government, environmental degradation, critical lack of modern infrastructure, etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}), and the comparatively much lower growth rate seen in Brazil. However, Brazil's lower growth rate obscures the fact that the country is wealthier than China or India on a per-capita basis, has a more developed and global integrated financial system and has an economy potentially more diverse than the other BRICs due to its raw material and manufacturing potential. Many other Eastern European countries, such as [[Poland]], [[Romania]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], and several others were able to continually sustain high economic growth rates and do not experience some of the problems that Russia experiences or experience them to a lesser extent. In terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]] in 2008, Brazil ranked 64th, Russia 42nd, India 113th, and China 89th. By comparison, South Korea ranked 24th and Singapore 3rd.

Brazil's stock market, the [[Bovespa]], has gone from approximately 9,000 in September 2002 to over 70,000 in May 2008. Government policies have favored investment (lowering interest rates), retiring foreign debt and expanding growth, and a reformulation of the tax system is being voted in the congress. The British author and researcher Mark Kobayashi-Hillary wrote a book in 2007 titled ''Building a Future with BRICs'' for European publisher [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag]] that examines the growth of the BRICs region and its effect on global sourcing. Contributors to the book include [[Nandan Nilekani]], and [[Shiv Nadar]].

===International law===
Brazilian lawyer and author Adler Martins has published a paper called "Contratos Internacionais entre os países do BRIC"<ref>MARTINS, Adler. Available at http://jus.com.br/artigos/17419/contratos-internacionais-entre-os-paises-do-bric</ref> (International Agreements Among BRIC countries) which highlights the international conventions ratified by the BRIC countries, which allow them to maintain trade and investment activities safely within the group. Martin's study is being further developed by the Federal University of the Minas Gerais State, in Brazil.

===Financial diversification===
It has been argued that geographic [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] would eventually generate superior risk-adjusted returns for [[long-term]] global investors by reducing overall portfolio risk while capturing some of the higher rates of return offered by the [[emerging markets]] of [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Latin America]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/FONDS_DASIE-PACIFIQUE_REVUE_AF_APR_09.95131642.pdf |accessdate=2009-04-02 |title=see M. Nicolas J. Firzli, Asia-Pacific Funds as Diversification Tools for Institutional Investors |language=fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508172054/http://canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/FONDS_DASIE-PACIFIQUE_REVUE_AF_APR_09.95131642.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-08 }}</ref> By doing so, these [[institutional investor]]s have contributed to the financial and economic development of key emerging nations such as Brazil, India, China, and Russia. For global investors, India and China constitute both large-scale production platforms and reservoirs of new consumers, whereas Russia is viewed essentially as an exporter of oil and commodities- Brazil and Latin America being somehow "in the middle".

===Criticism===
A criticism is that the BRIC projections are based on the assumptions that resources are limitless and endlessly available when needed. In reality, many important resources currently necessary to sustain economic growth, such as [[peak oil|oil, natural gas, coal, other fossil fuels, and uranium]] might soon experience a peak in production before enough renewable energy can be developed and commercialized, which might result in slower economic growth than anticipated, thus throwing off the projections and their dates. The economic emergence of the BRICs will have unpredictable consequences for the global environment. Indeed, proponents of a set [[carrying capacity]] for the Earth may argue that, given current technology, there is a finite limit to how much the BRICs can develop before exceeding the ability of the global economy to supply.

Academics and experts have suggested that China is in a league of its own compared to the other BRIC countries.<ref>

This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near-optimal conditions while many South American and South Asian economies suffered from various development bottlenecks (poor transportation, aging power grids, mediocre schools).<ref>{{Cite news|author=M.

The preeminence of China and India as major manufacturing countries with unrealized potential has been widely recognized, but some commentators state that China's and Russia's large-scale disregard for human rights and democracy could be a problem in the future.{{By whom|date=September 2020}} Human rights issues do not inform the foreign policies of these two countries to the same extent as they do the policies of other large states such as Japan, India, the EU states and the United States. There is also the possibility of conflict over [[Taiwan]] in the case of China, or Ukraine in the case of Russia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

There is also the issue of population growth. The population of Russia has been declining rapidly in the 1990s and only recently did the Russian government predict the population to stabilize and grow in 2020. Brazil's and China's populations will begin to decline in several decades,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} with their demographic windows closing in several decades as well. This may have implications for those countries' future, for there might be a decrease in the overall labor force and a negative change in the proportion of workers to retirees.

Brazil's economic potential has been anticipated for decades, but it had until recently consistently failed to achieve investor expectations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Only in recent years has the country established a framework of political, economic, and social policies that allowed it to resume consistent growth. The result has been solid and paced economic development that rival its early 1970s "miracle years", as reflected in its expanding capital markets, lowest unemployment rates in decades, and consistent international trade surpluses—that led to the accumulation of reserves and liquidation of foreign debt (earning the country a coveted investment grade by the S&P and Fitch Ratings in 2008).

Finally, [[India–Pakistan relations|India's relations with Pakistan]] have always been tense. In 1998, there was a nuclear standoff between Pakistan and India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/monj98a.html |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408051939/http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/monj98a.html|title=India and Pakistan's nuclear tests: How should the international community respond?|archivedate=April 8, 2011 }}</ref> Border conflicts with Pakistan, mostly over the long-held dispute over Kashmir, has further aggravated any economic ties. This impedes progress by limiting government finances, increasing social unrest, and limiting potential domestic economic demand. Factors such as international conflict, civil unrest, unwise political policy, outbreaks of disease and terrorism are all factors that are difficult to predict and that could have an effect on the destiny of any country.

Other critics suggest that BRIC is nothing more than a neat acronym for the four largest emerging market economies,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} but in economic and political terms nothing else (apart from the fact that they are all big emerging markets) links the four. Two are manufacturing-based economies and big importers (China and India), but two are huge exporters of natural resources (Brazil and Russia). ''[[The Economist]]'', in its special report on Brazil, expressed the following view: "In some ways, Brazil is the steadiest of the BRICs. Unlike China and Russia, it is a full-blooded democracy; unlike India, it has no serious disputes with its neighbors. It is the only BRIC without a nuclear bomb". The [[Heritage Foundation]]'s "[[Indices of Economic Freedom|Economic Freedom Index]]", which measures factors such as protection of property rights and free trade ranks Brazil ("moderately free") above the other BRICs ("mostly unfree").<ref>

In a not-so-subtle dig critical of the term as nothing more than a shorthand for emerging markets generally, critics have suggested a correlating term, CEMENT (''C''ountries in ''E''merging ''M''arkets ''E''xcluded by ''N''ew ''T''erminology). Whilst they accept there has been spectacular growth of the BRIC economies, these gains have largely been the result of the strength of emerging markets generally, and that strength comes through having BRICs and CEMENT.<ref>

Based on IMF's World Economic Outlook Database, October 2016, the top economies in 2021 (by projected nominal [[gross domestic product]] (GDP)) are going to be China, the U.S., India, Japan, Germany, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, the U.K., and France respectively.<ref>

</ref> Nowadays [[Indonesia]] is not BRIC country, but as solely emerging economies in the list sets on seven in projected 2021 top economies. There are '''no''' South Africa and '''no''' (South Korea, Mexico, (GCC Arab countries—Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates), Eastern Europe and Turkey) as mentioned above.

==Proposed inclusions==
Mexico and South Korea are currently the world's 13th and 15th largest by [[nominal GDP]] just behind the BRIC and G7 economies. Both are experiencing rapid GDP growth of 5% every year, a figure comparable to Brazil from the original BRICs. [[Jim O'Neill (economist)|Jim O'Neill]], expert from the same bank and creator of the economic thesis, stated that in 2001 when the paper was created, it did not consider Mexico, but today it has been included because the country is experiencing the same factors that the other countries first included present.<ref name=lefigaro/><ref name=UNuniversity/> While South Korea was not originally included in the BRICs, recent solid economic growth led to Goldman Sachs proposing to add Mexico and South Korea to the BRICs, changing the acronym to BRIMCK, with Jim O'Neill pointing out that Korea "is better placed than most others to realize its potential due to its growth-supportive fundamentals".<ref>

A Goldman Sachs paper published later in December 2005 explained why Mexico and South Korea were not included in the original BRICs. According to the paper,<ref name="Ref-1"/> among the other countries they looked at, only Mexico and South Korea have the potential to rival the BRICs, but they are economies that they decided to exclude initially because they looked to them as already more developed. However, due to the popularity of the Goldman Sachs thesis, "BRIMC" and "BRICK" are becoming more generic marketing terms to refer to these six countries.

In their paper "BRICs and Beyond", Goldman Sachs stated that "Mexico, the four BRIC countries and South Korea should not be really thought of as emerging markets in the classical sense", adding that they are a "critical part of the modern globalised economy" and "just as central to its functioning as the current G7".<ref name="www2.goldmansachs.com">

The term is primarily used in the economic and financial spheres as well as in [[academia]]. Its usage has grown specially in the investment sector, where it is used to refer to the bonds emitted by these emerging markets governments.<ref name=correio>

===Mexico===
[[File:Atardecer reforma.jpg|thumb|[[Mexico City]]]]
Primarily, along with the BRICs,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gs.com/insight/research/reports/99.pdf |title=BRIC thesis Goldman Sachs Investment Bank, "BRIC" |publisher=Gs.com |accessdate=2010-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305114725/http://www.gs.com/insight/research/reports/99.pdf |archive-date=2006-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Goldman Sachs argues that the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico and [[China]] is such that they may become (with the United States) the six most dominant economies by the year 2050. Due to Mexico's rapidly advancing infrastructure, increasing middle class and rapidly declining poverty rates it is expected to have a higher GDP per capita than all but three European countries by 2050, this newfound local wealth also contributes to the nation's economy by creating a large domestic consumer market which in turn creates more jobs.

===South Korea===
South Korea is one of the world's most highly [[developed countries]] and including it with [[developing countries]] like the BRICs is not deemed correct. However, commentators such as William Pesek from [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] argue that Korea is "Another 'BRIC' in Global Wall", suggesting that it stands out from the [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next Eleven|Next Eleven]] economies with its BRIC-like growth rate, despite its [[Human Development Index]] being higher than some of the world's most advanced economies, including [[France]], [[UK]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Belgium]]. South Korean workers are the wealthiest among major Asian countries, with a higher income than [[Japan]] and the strongest growth rate in the [[OECD]]. More importantly, it has a significantly higher Growth Environment Score (Goldman Sachs' way of measuring the long-term sustainability of growth) than all of the BRICs or N-11s.<ref name="www2.goldmansachs.com"/> According to the [[IMF]], South Korea's [[GDP]] measured by [[purchasing power parity]] is already larger than [[Canada]] and [[Spain]]. In terms of [[List of countries by past and future GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita (PPP)]], South Korea overtook [[Spain]] in 2010. According to Citibank, South Korea will continue by overtaking [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]] and [[Sweden]] by 2020, surpassing [[Canada]], [[Switzerland]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Norway]] by 2030 and taking over the [[United States]] by 2040 to become the world's wealthiest major economy. While measuring the [[South Korean economy]] by [[nominal GDP]] is inaccurate as the [[South Korean won]] is artificially kept low to boost [[exports]], [[IMF]] predicts South Korea's nominal GDP and GDP per capita will surpass [[Spain]] in 2015. Economists from other investment firms argue that even when measured by [[Nominal GDP|nominal GDP per capita]], South Korea will achieve over $145,000 in 2040, surpassing the [[United States]], suggesting that wealth is more important than size for bond investors, stating that Korea's [[Bond credit rating|credit rating]] will be rated AAA sooner than 2050.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.strattonstreetcapital.com/abf/reports/a%20pile%20of%20brics.pdf |title=Archived Document |access-date=2008-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225114014/http://www.strattonstreetcapital.com/abf/reports/a%20pile%20of%20brics.pdf |archive-date=2009-02-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====United Korea====
{{Main|United Korea}}
In September 2009, Goldman Sachs published its 188th Global Economics Paper named "A United Korea?" which highlighted in detail the potential economic power of a United Korea, which will surpass all current G7 countries except the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] within 30–40 years of reunification, estimating GDP to surpass $6 trillion by 2050.<ref name="koreatimes.co.kr">

</ref> The young, skilled labor and large amount of natural resources from the North combined with advanced technology, infrastructure and large amount of capital in the South, as well as Korea's strategic location connecting three economic powers, is likely going to create an economy larger than the bulk of the G7. According to some opinions, a [[Korean reunification|reunited Korea]] could occur before 2050,<ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/> or even between 2010 and 2020.<ref>
