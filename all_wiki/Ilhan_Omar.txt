====Ban from entering Israel====
In August 2019, Omar and Representative [[Rashida Tlaib]] were banned from entering Israel, a reversal from the July 2019 statement by [[Israeli Ambassador to the United States]] [[Ron Dermer]] that "any member of Congress" would be allowed in. Israeli [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] attributed the ban to [[Amendment No. 28 to the Entry Into Israel Law|Israeli law]] preventing the entry of people who call for a boycott of Israel (as Omar and Tlaib had done with their support for [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS]]). Netanyahu also cited Omar and Tlaib listing their destination as Palestine instead of Israel, claiming he thus viewed their visit as an attempt to "hurt Israel and increase its unrest". Netanyahu also said that Omar and Tlaib did not plan on visiting or meeting with any Israeli officials from the government or the opposition, and additionally accused Miftah, the sponsor of Omar's trip, of having members who support terrorism against Israel (in 2016, Israel approved a visit by five U.S. Representatives to Israel that Miftah co-sponsored, but that was before Israel enacted its anti-BDS law<ref name=miftah/><ref>{{cite news|first1=Niraj|last1=Chokshi|accessdate=2019-08-27|title=The Anti-Boycott Law Israel Used to Bar Both Omar and Tlaib|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/world/middleeast/bds-israel-boycott.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 15, 2019|issn=0362-4331 }}</ref>).

=== Venezuela crisis ===
In January 2019, amid the [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis]], Omar joined Democrats [[Ro Khanna]] and [[Tulsi Gabbard]] in denouncing the Trump administration's decision to recognize [[Juan Guaidó]], the president of the [[Venezuelan National Assembly]], as Venezuela's interim president.<ref name="Daugherty">{{Cite news |first=Alex |last=Daugherty |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article225071465.html |title=New liberals in Congress call Trump's Venezuela action 'a U.S. backed coup' |newspaper=The Miami Herald |date=January 25, 2019 |access-date=April 5, 2019}}</ref> She described Trump's action as a "U.S. backed coup" to "install a far right opposition" and said that the U.S. should not "hand pick" foreign leaders<ref>{{cite news|last=Bowden|first=John|title=New Dem Rep.

In February 2019, Omar questioned whether [[Elliott Abrams]], whom Trump appointed as Special Representative for Venezuela in January 2019, was the correct choice given his past support of right-wing authoritarian regimes in [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]], his initial doubts about the number of reported deaths in the [[El Mozote massacre]] in 1982, and his two 1991 misdemeanor convictions for withholding information from Congress about the [[Iran–Contra affair]], for which he was later pardoned by [[George H.

In May 2019, Omar said in an interview on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' that she believed [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] and [[International sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis|economic sanctions]] are aimed at regime change and have contributed to the "devastation in Venezuela."<ref>{{cite news |last=Mindock|first=Clark |date=May 2, 2019 |title=Ilhan Omar says US 'helped lead devastation in Venezuela' through regime change sanctions|url=https://news.yahoo.com/ilhan-omar-says-us-helped-170322174.html|work=[[Yahoo!

=== Minneapolis Police Department === 

In June 2020, the "[[Defund the police]]" slogan gained widespread popularity following the death of [[George Floyd]]. [[Black Lives Matter]] and other activists used the phrase to call for police budget reductions and a plan to delegate certain police responsibilities to other organizations.  Reacting to the death of Floyd, the majority of the Minneapolis City Council voted to dismantle the city's police department.  In a statement, the Minneapolis mayor said they planned to work to address "systemic racism in police culture."<ref>{{cite web |title=Majority Of Minneapolis City Council Backs Dismantling Police Department |url=https://www.wlen.com/2020/06/08/majority-of-minneapolis-city-council-backs-dismantling-police-department/ |website=WLEN Radio |accessdate=October 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kesslen |first1=Ben |title=Calls to reform, defund, dismantle and abolish the police, explained. |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/calls-reform-defund-dismantle-abolish-police-explained-n1227676 |website=NBC |accessdate=October 6, 2020}}</ref>  Following the death of Floyd, Omar advocated for the dismantlement of the [[Minneapolis Police Department]], saying that the Department had "proven themselves beyond reform."<ref>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/calls-reform-defund-dismantle-abolish-police-explained-n1227676</ref> Omar hoped to see a new police department that would be modeled after the [[Camden County Police Department]] in New Jersey.

=== False connection to 9/11 ===
On March 1, 2019, the [[West Virginia Republican Party]] held "WV GOP Day," an event to celebrate the Republican Party, at the West Virginia Capitol. An exhibitor, not associated with the Republican Party, displayed a poster at the event falsely connecting Omar to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]], along with Islamophobic flyers. State delegate [[Mike Pushkin]], in attendance at the event, said that no Republican delegates condemned the poster.

According to prosecutors, Hasson is a self-described "long time White Nationalist" and former skinhead who wanted to use violence to "establish a white homeland." Prosecutors also alleged that Hasson was in contact with an American neo-Nazi leader, stockpiled weapons, and compiled a hit list.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.fox9.com/news/rep-ilhan-omar-on-hit-list-of-coast-guard-lieutenant-arrested-last-week |title=Rep.

===Patriotism questioned===

On March 9, 2019, speaking on her [[Fox News]] show ''[[Justice with Judge Jeanine]]'', Jeanine Pirro was said to have questioned Omar's patriotism by noting Omar's hijab, saying, "Think about it: Omar wears a hijab. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?" Following her comments Fox issued a statement that they did "not reflect [the views] of the network and we have addressed the matter with her directly", and suspended her show for a week. Several advertisers "distanced" themselves from the show. Hufsa Kamal, a producer of Fox's ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', tweeted: "@JudgeJeanine can you stop spreading this false narrative that somehow Muslims hate America or women who wear a hijab aren't American enough? You have Muslims working at the same network you do, including myself."<ref>{{cite web |title=Jeanine Pirro is off the air at Fox News one week after controversial comments about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar |url=https://myfox8.com/2019/03/16/jeanine-pirro-is-off-the-air-at-fox-news-one-week-after-controversial-comments-about-congresswoman-ilhan-omar/ |website=Fox News |accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Politi |first1=Daniel |title=Fox News' Jeanine Pirro: Rep.

===Target of online hate speech===

According to a study by the [[Social Science Research Council]] of more than 113,000 tweets about Muslim candidates in the weeks leading up to the 2018 midterm elections, Omar "was the prime target. Roughly half of the 90,000 tweets mentioning her included hate speech or Islamophobic or anti-immigrant language."<ref name="OnlineCacophony">{{cite news|first1=Lawrence|last1=Pintak|first2=Jonathan|last2=Albright|first3=Brian J.|last3=Bowe|title=The Online Cacophony of Hate Against Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib|journal=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/opinion/ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage|date=5 November 2019|accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref> According to the study, "Key themes included Muslims as subhumans or 'Trojan horses' seeking to impose Shariah law on America.... A large proportion of these trolls were likely bots or automated accounts run by people, organizations or state actors seeking to spread political propaganda and hate speech. That's based on telltale iconography, naming patterns, webs of linkages and the breadth of the postelection scrubbing."<ref name="OnlineCacophony" />
