Walters began her career on ''[[The Today Show]]'' in the early 1960s as a writer and segment producer of women's interest stories. Her popularity with viewers resulted in Walters receiving more airtime, and in 1974 she became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a title on an American news program.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walters|first=Barbara|title=Audition: a memoir|year=2008|publisher=Knopf|location=NY|isbn=978-0-307-26646-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_B004FR2X2W/page/205 205]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_B004FR2X2W|url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Walters|first=Barbara|title=Audition: a memoir|year=2008|publisher=Knopf|location=NY|isbn=978-0-307-26646-0|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_B004FR2X2W}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Meaney, VP-TV News Programming|first=Donald|title=NBC-TV Press Release|date=April 22, 1974}}</ref> In 1976, she continued to be a pioneer for women in broadcasting by becoming the first female co-anchor of a network evening news program, alongside [[Harry Reasoner]] on the ''ABC Evening News''.

According to Walters, her father made and lost several fortunes throughout his life in show business. He was a booking agent, and unlike her uncles who were in the shoe and dress business, his job was not very safe. During the good times, Walters recalls her father taking her to the rehearsals of the night club shows he directed and produced. The actresses and dancers would make a huge fuss over her and twirl her around until she was dizzy. Then she said her father would take her out for hot dogs, their favorite.<ref name="Walters, Barbara 2008">Walters, Barbara (2008). ''Audition: A Memoir''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf</ref>

According to Walters, being surrounded by celebrities when she was young kept her from being "in awe" of them.<ref name="actors" /> When she was a young woman, Walters's father lost his night clubs and the family's [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] on [[Central Park West]]. As Walters recalled, "He had a [[Mental breakdown|breakdown]]. He went down to live in our house in Florida, and then the government took the house, and they took the car, and they took the furniture." Of her mother, she said, "My mother should have married the way her friends did, to a man who was a doctor or who was in the dress business."<ref name="Bumiller">Elisabeth Bumiller, "So Famous, Such Clout, She Could Interview Herself", ''The New York Times'', April 21, 1996, page H1</ref>

Walters attended Lawrence School, a public school in Brookline, Massachusetts, to the middle of fifth grade, when her father moved the family to Miami Beach in 1939, where she also attended public school. After her father moved the family to New York City, she went to eighth grade at [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School]], after which the family moved back to Miami Beach. Then, she went back to New York City, where she attended [[Birch Wathen Lenox|Birch Wathen School]]<ref name="New York Magazine">[https://nymag.com/news/features/28519/index1.html "Can Barbara Walters's Career Survive Rosie and Donald's War?"] ''New York'' (March 5, 2007).

After about a year at a small advertising agency, she began working at the NBC network affiliate in New York City, WNBT-TV (now [[WNBC]]), doing publicity and writing press releases. She began producing a 15-minute children's program, ''Ask the Camera'', directed by [[Roone Arledge]] in 1953. She began producing for TV host [[Igor Cassini]] (Cholly Knickerbocker). However, she left the network after her boss pressured her to marry him and engaged in a fist-fight with a man she preferred to date. Then she went to WPIX to produce the ''Eloise McElhone Show''; it was canceled in 1954. She became a writer on ''The Morning Show'' at [[CBS]] in 1955.

==Career==

===''The Today Show''===
[[File:Today show panel 1973.JPG|thumb|[[Gene Shalit]], Barbara Walters, and [[Frank McGee (journalist)|Frank McGee]] in ''The Today Show'', 1973.]]
After a few years as a publicist with [[Tex McCrary]] Inc. and a job as a writer at [[Redbook]] magazine, Walters joined [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' as a writer and researcher in 1961.<ref name="actors" /> She moved up to become that show's regular "Today Girl," handling lighter assignments and the weather. In her autobiography, she describes this era before the [[Feminism|Women's Movement]] as a time when it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting "hard news." Previous [[Today (NBC program)#Today Girls|"Today Girls"]] (whom Walters called "tea pourers") included [[Florence Henderson]], [[Helen O'Connell]], [[Estelle Parsons]] and [[Lee Meriwether]].<ref>''Audition'', pp. 107–114</ref> Within a year, she had become a reporter-at-large developing, writing, and editing her own reports and interviews. One very well received film segment was "A Day in the Life of a Novice Nun," edited by then-first assistant film editor Donald Swerdlow (now Don Canaan), who was subsequently promoted to become a full film editor at NBC News.<ref name="actors" /> She had a great relationship with host Hugh Downs for years. When [[Frank McGee (journalism)|Frank McGee]] was named host, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions. She was not named co-host of the show until McGee's death in 1974 when NBC officially designated Walters as the program's first female co-host. Beginning in 1971, she also hosted her own local NBC affiliate show, ''[[Not for Women Only]],'' which ran in the mornings after ''The Today Show.''<ref name="thompson">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Kathleen |title=Barbara Walters |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/walters-barbara |website=Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>''Audition'', p. 190</ref>

===''ABC Evening News'' and ''20/20''===
Walters has seldom minced words when describing the visible, on-the-air disdain her co-anchor [[Harry Reasoner]] displayed for her when she was teamed up with him on the ''[[ABC Evening News]]'' from 1976 to 1978. Reasoner had a difficult relationship with Walters, because he disliked having a co-anchor, even though he worked with former CBS colleague [[Howard K. Smith]] nightly on ABC for several years. In 1981, five years after the start of their short-lived ABC partnership and well after Reasoner returned to CBS News, Walters and her former co-anchor had a memorable (and cordial) ''20/20'' interview on the occasion of Reasoner's new book release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/barbara-walters-legendary-career-offers-view-back-today-2D79669608|title=Barbara Walters' legendary career offers a 'View' back to TODAY|website=TODAY.com|language=en|access-date=February 24, 2019}}</ref>

Walters is also known for her years on the ABC newsmagazine ''20/20'' where she reunited with former ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' host [[Hugh Downs]] in 1979.<ref name="actors" /> Throughout her career at ABC, Walters has appeared on ABC news specials as a commentator, including presidential inaugurations and the coverage of [[9/11]].

====Interviews====
[[File:Barbara Walters-The Fords.jpg|right|thumb|Walters interviewing President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Betty Ford]] in 1976.]]

Walters is known for "personality journalism" and her "scoop" interviews.<ref name="actors" /> In November 1977, she achieved a joint interview with Egypt's president, [[Anwar Al Sadat]], and Israel's Prime Minister, [[Menachem Begin]]. According to ''The New York Times'', when she went mano a mano with Walter Cronkite to interview both world leaders, at the end of Cronkite's interview, he is clearly heard saying: "Did Barbara get anything I didn't get?"<ref>{{cite news|last=Maselin|first= J. |date=May 5, 2008|title=Hard sell, soft touch, and the right question|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/books/05masl.html?_r=1&}}</ref> Her interviews with world leaders from all walks of life are a chronicle of the latter part of the 20th century.<ref name="actors" /> They include the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], and his wife, the Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]]; Russia's [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]]; China's [[Jiang Zemin]]; the UK's [[Margaret Thatcher]]; Cuba's [[Fidel Castro]], as well as India's [[Indira Gandhi]], Czechoslovakia's [[Václav Havel]], Libya's [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], King [[Hussein of Jordan]], King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]], and Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]], among many others. Other interviews with influential people include pop icon [[Michael Jackson]], actress [[Katharine Hepburn]], ''Vogue'' editor [[Anna Wintour]], and in 1980 [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]]. Walters considered [[Robert Smithdas]], a deaf-blind man who spent his life improving the lives of other individuals who are deaf-blind, as her most inspirational interview.

Walters was widely lampooned for asking actress [[Katharine Hepburn]], "If you were a tree, what kind would you be?" On her last 20/20 television episode, Walters showed video of the Hepburn interview, showing the actress saying that she would like to be a tree. Walters merely followed up with the question, "What kind of a tree?",<ref name="actors" /><ref>[http://katethegreatnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=tv&action=display&thread=1133561741 Kate the Great, The Katharine Hepburn Forum – The Barbara Walters Interview] Retrieved May 10, 2008{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2008|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref> and Hepburn responded "an oak" because they are strong and pretty. According to Walters, for years Hepburn refused her requests for an interview. And when she finally agreed to one, she said she wanted to meet her first. Walters walked in all smiles and ready to please, while Hepburn was at the top of the stairs and barked, "You're late. Have you brought me chocolates?" Walters hadn't but said she never showed up without them from then on. They had several other meetings since that first time, mostly in Hepburn's living room where she would give Walters her opinions. Careers and marriage did not mix. Children and careers were out of the question. Walters said Hepburn's opinions stuck with her so much, she could repeat them almost verbatim to this day.<ref name="Walters, Barbara 2008" />

Her television special about Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] aired on ABC-TV on June 9, 1977. Although the footage of her two days of interviewing Castro in Cuba showed his personality, in part, as freewheeling, charming, and humorous,<ref>{{cite book |last=Walters |first=Barbara |title=Audition: a memoir |year=2008 |publisher=Alfred A.

Your newspapers, radio, television, motions picture are under state control." To this, he replied, "Barbara, our concept of freedom of the press is not yours. If you asked us if a newspaper could appear here against socialism, I can say honestly no, it cannot appear. It would not be allowed by the party, the government, or the people. In that sense we do not have the freedom of the press that you possess in the U.S. And we are very satisfied about that."<ref>{{cite book |last=Walters |first=Barbara |title=Audition: a memoir |year=2008 |publisher=Alfred A.

On March 3, 1999, her interview of [[Monica Lewinsky]] was seen by a record 74 million viewers, the highest rating ever for a news program.<ref>{{cite web |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=Monica Lewinsky Beats the Competition |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/tv030599.htm |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=May 12, 2013 |date=March 5, 1999}}</ref> Walters asked Lewinsky, "What will you tell your children when you have them?"

Walters was a co-host of the daytime talk show ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]],'' of which she also is co-creator and co-executive producer with her business partner, [[Bill Geddie]]. It premiered on August 11, 1997.<ref name="actors" />

Walters described the show in its original opening credits as a forum for women of "different generations, backgrounds, and views." She added, "Be careful what you wish for..." on the opening credits of its second season. Through ''The View'', she was able to clinch two [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s for Best Talk Show in 2003 and Best Talk Show Host (with longtime host [[Joy Behar]], moderator [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]], and [[Sherri Shepherd]]) in 2009.

Walters retired from being a co-host on May 15, 2014. Although retired, Walters returned as a guest co-host on an intermittent basis throughout 2014 and 2015.

===Health===
In May 2010, Walters said she would be having [[open heart surgery]] to replace a faulty [[aortic valve]]. She had known for quite a while that she was suffering from [[aortic valve stenosis]], even though she was symptom-free. The procedure to fix the faulty heart valve "went well, and the doctors are very pleased with the outcome," Walters's spokeswoman, Cindi Berger, said four days later.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/05/14/barbara_walters_heart_valve_surgery_went_well/ |title=Barbara Walters' heart valve surgery 'went well' |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=May 14, 2010 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}</ref>

Barbara Walters was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] in 1989. On June 15, 2007, Walters received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. She has won Daytime and Prime Time Emmy Awards, a [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards|Women in Film Lucy Award]], and a [[GLAAD]] Excellence in Media award. Her impact on popular culture is illustrated by [[Gilda Radner]]'s "Baba Wawa" impersonation of her on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'',<ref name="actors" /> featuring her idiosyncratic speech with its [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rounded "R"]]. Her name also appeared in the January 23, 1995 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' Monday [[Crossword|Crossword Puzzle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/1995/01/23|title=The Crossword|last=Robbins|first=Sidney L.|date=January 23, 1995|editor-last=Shortz|editor-first=Will|website=New York Times|url-status=live|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> In 2008, she was honored with the [[Disney Legends]] award, given to those who made an outstanding contribution to [[The Walt Disney Company]], which owns the network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

==Books==
In the late 1960s, Walters wrote a magazine article, "How to Talk to Practically Anyone About Practically Anything", which drew upon the kinds of things people said to her, which were often mistakes.<ref name="Memoir186-189">''Audition: A Memoir'', pp. 186–9</ref> Shortly after the article appeared, she received a letter from [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] expressing interest in expanding it into a book. Walters felt that it would help "tongue-tied, socially awkward people—the many people who worry that they can't think of the right thing to say to start a conversation."<ref name="Memoir186-189" /> She published the book ''How to Talk with Practically Anybody about Practically Anything'' in 1970, with the assistance of [[ghostwriter]] [[June Callwood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/media/topics/1393-8719/ |title=June Callwood interview by Patrick Watson |date=September 21, 1979 |accessdate=October 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521164734/http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/media/topics/1393-8719/ |archivedate=May 21, 2011 }}</ref> To Walters's great surprise, the book was a success. As of 2008, it had gone through eight printings, sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, and had been translated into at least six languages.<ref name="Memoir186-189" />

She published her autobiography, ''[[Audition: A Memoir]]'', in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/books/05masl.html |title='Audition: A Memoir' by Barbara Walters |first=Janet |last=Maslin |date=May 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 17, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>
