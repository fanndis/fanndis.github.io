'''Hartford''' is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital city]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Connecticut]]. It was the seat of [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]] until Connecticut disbanded county government in 1960. It is the core city in the [[Greater Hartford]] metropolitan area. Census estimates since the [[2010 United States Census]] have indicated that Hartford is the [[List of cities in Connecticut|fourth-largest city]] in Connecticut, behind the coastal cities of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]].<ref>https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-8.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722024429/https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-8.pdf |date=July 22, 2017 }} ''Connecticut: 2010 Population and Housing Unit Counts,'' U.S. Census Bureau, June 2012, table 8, page 11.

Hartford was founded in 1635 and is among the oldest cities in the United States. It is home to the country's oldest public art museum ([[Wadsworth Atheneum]]), the oldest publicly funded park ([[Bushnell Park]]), the oldest continuously published newspaper (the ''[[Hartford Courant]]''), and the second-oldest secondary school ([[Hartford Public High School]]). It is also home to the [[Mark Twain House]], where the author wrote his most famous works and raised his family, among other historically significant sites. [[Mark Twain]] wrote in 1868, "Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see this is the chief."

Hartford was the richest city in the United States for several decades following the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Paul Zielbauer, "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E0D8103CF935A1575BC0A9649C8B63 Poverty in a Land of Plenty: Can Hartford Ever Recover?]" ''The New York Times'', August 26, 2002.</ref> Today, it is one of the poorest cities in the U.S., with 3 out of every 10 families living below the poverty threshold. In sharp contrast, the Greater Hartford metropolitan statistical area was ranked 32nd of 318 metropolitan areas in total economic production and 8th out of 280 metropolitan statistical areas in per capita income in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metrohartfordprogresspoints.org/downloads/Metro_Hartford_Progress_Points_2014.pdf |title=Metro Hartford Progress Points.

===Colonial Hartford===
[[File:Hartford, Connecticut (NYPL b12349142-422931).jpg|thumb|Hartford, circa 1770s]]

The first Europeans known to have explored the area were the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] under [[Adriaen Block]], who sailed up the Connecticut in 1614. Dutch fur traders from [[New Amsterdam]] returned in 1623 with a mission to establish a trading post and fortify the area for the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The original site was located on the south bank of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]] in the present-day Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood. This fort was called [[Fort Hoop]] or the "House of Hope." In 1633, Jacob Van Curler formally bought the land around Fort Hoop from the [[Pequot]] chief for a small sum. It was home to perhaps a couple families and a few dozen soldiers. The fort was abandoned by 1654, but the area is known today as Dutch Point; the name of the Dutch fort "House of Hope" is reflected in the name of Huyshope Avenue.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sterner|first=Daniel|title=A Guide to Historic Hartford, Connecticut |year=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-60949-635-7|page=81 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x6QkVFi7l6UC&q=sheldon+charter+oak+neighborhood&pg=PA81 |access-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=House of Hope |url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope/ |publisher=The New Netherland Institute |access-date=April 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410075959/http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope |archive-date=April 10, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Dutch outpost and the tiny contingent of Dutch soldiers who were stationed there did little to check the English migration, and the Dutch soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered. The House of Hope remained an outpost, but it was steadily swallowed up by waves of English settlers. In 1650, [[Peter Stuyvesant]] met with English representatives to negotiate a permanent boundary between the Dutch and English colonies; the line that they agreed on was more than {{convert|50|mi|km}} west of the original settlement.

The English began to arrive in 1636, settling upstream from Fort Hoop near the present-day Downtown and Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite book

The fledgling colony along the Connecticut River was outside of the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's charter and had to determine how it was to be governed. Therefore, Hooker delivered a sermon that inspired the writing of the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], a document ratified January 14, 1639 which invested the people with the authority to govern, rather than ceding such authority to a higher power. Historians suggest that Hooker's conception of self-rule embodied in the Fundamental Orders inspired the [[Connecticut Constitution]], and ultimately the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Today, one of Connecticut's nicknames is the "Constitution State".<ref>{{cite web|last=Voigt|first=Steven|title=Lessons from Thomas Hooker about the frailty of humanity and the importance of a worldview|url=http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/voigt/050905|publisher=Renew America|accessdate=February 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031100147/http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/voigt/050905|archivedate=October 31, 2005 }}</ref>

The original settlement area contained the site of the [[Charter Oak]], an old white oak tree in which colonists hid [[Connecticut Constitutional History#The Connecticut Charter of 1662|Connecticut's Royal Charter of 1662]] to protect it from confiscation by an English governor-general. The state adopted the oak tree as the emblem on the Connecticut state quarter. The Charter Oak Monument is located at the corner of Charter Oak Place, a historic street, and Charter Oak Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Charter Oak Fell – Today in History: August 21|url=http://connecticuthistory.org/the-charter-oak-fell/|website=connecticuthistory.org|publisher=Connecticut Humanities|accessdate=August 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728110520/http://connecticuthistory.org/the-charter-oak-fell/|archive-date=July 28, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1860, Hartford was the site of the first "[[Wide Awakes]]", abolitionist supporters of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. These supporters organized torch-light parades that were both political and social events, often including fireworks and music, in celebration of Lincoln's visit to the city. This type of event caught on and eventually became a staple of mid-to-late 19th-century campaigning.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hartford Wide-Awakes – Today in History: July 26 |url=https://connecticuthistory.org/hartford-wide-awakes-today-in-history/ |publisher=connecticuthistory.org  |access-date=April 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501231223/http://connecticuthistory.org/hartford-wide-awakes-today-in-history/ |archive-date=May 1, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Industrialization and the Colt legacy====
Industrialist and inventor [[Samuel Colt]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Jarvis Colt|Elizabeth]] had a great influence on Hartford's development in the 100 years after independence. Colt is often considered the father of the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]] [[industrial revolution]], although there were a handful of small outfits already in operation by the time that he purchased a large tract of land in the area in the 1840s.

In 1836, Connecticut-born Colt received a U.S. patent for a revolver mechanism which enabled a gun to be fired multiple times without reloading. Sales were initially slow and his business ventures struggled. Then the U.S. government ordered 1,000 Colt revolvers in 1846, with the [[Mexican–American War]] under way. In 1848, Colt was able to start again with a new business of his own, and he converted it into a corporation in 1855 under the name of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company]]. The original factory is situated in the Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood just south of [[downtown Hartford]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Luke|title=Coltsville, USA: Inside America's Gun-Funded Utopia|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/coltsville_abandoned_utopian_guns_village|accessdate=June 8, 2015|agency=Atlas Obscura|date=May 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516203640/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/coltsville_abandoned_utopian_guns_village|archive-date=May 16, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

With business booming by 1855, Colt entered an aggressive expansionary phase and opened the Colt Armory, the world's largest private armament factory. He employed advanced manufacturing techniques such as interchangeable parts and an organized production line. By 1856, the company could produce 150 weapons per day. The Civil War led to a surge in demand, and Colt supplied the [[Union Army]]. Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company operated at full capacity and employed over 1,000 people in its Hartford factory. By that time, Colt had become one of the wealthiest men in America. He was presiding over his enterprise from [[Armsmear]], an ornate [[Italianate]] manor built near the armory in 1857. Upon his death in 1862, he was worth over $15&nbsp;million ($380&nbsp;million by 2015 standards).<ref name="Smith2004">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony|title=Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War|url=https://archive.org/details/machinegunstoryo00anth|url-access=registration|date=November 2, 2004|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-93477-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/machinegunstoryo00anth/page/52 52]–53|access-date=October 16, 2015}}</ref>

Colt's methods were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, and his successes secured Hartford's place as a major 19th century manufacturing center. It is estimated that his company produced over 400,000 revolvers in its first 25 years of manufacturing. His use of [[interchangeable parts]] helped him become one of the first to exploit the [[assembly line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehto|first1=Mark R.|last2=Buck|first2=James R.|title=Introduction to Human Factors and Ergonomics for Engineers|date=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5308-7|page=30}}</ref> Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing. His business practices were also innovative, involving a shrewd use of patents to protect his products, as well as new developments in marketing and business organization to create a highly successful business which long outlived him.

Elizabeth Colt inherited a controlling interest in her late husband's manufacturing company following his death in 1862. At the time, Colt firearms were producing an estimated 1/996th of the entire gross national product of the United States. She steered the company until 1901 with her brother [[Richard Jarvis]] as president, becoming one of the most prominent female industrialists in America. Together they transitioned the company from the end of the American Civil War into the 20th century, seeing the evolution from [[percussion cap|percussion]] revolvers to cartridge revolvers to [[semiautomatic pistol]]s and machineguns.<ref>{{cite book|title =The Colt legacy: the Colt Armory in Hartford, 1855–1980 |first= Ellsworth S.|last= Grant |pages=22, 58|publisher= Mowbray Co.|year= 1982|isbn =978-0-917218-17-0 }}</ref>

In addition, the Colts left an indelible imprint on Hartford's architectural environment. Samuel Colt was inspired by what he had seen during a trip to London in 1851, and he embarked upon one of the boldest real estate development campaigns in Hartford's history. His intention was to build an industrial community to house his workers adjacent to the Colt Armory. By 1856, it was a city within a city, where workers of many nationalities and religions worked and lived alongside one another. [[Coltsville Historic District|Coltsville]] was among the first of America's 19th century [[company towns]], and it was easily the most advanced of its time—though not the largest, the most prominent, or the most tightly controlled. Colt's complex also included the largest armory in the world, as well as wharf and ferry facilities on the Connecticut River.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hosley|first1=William|title=Making a Success of Coltsville|url=http://www.hogriver.org/issues/v04n01/coltsville.htm|work=Hog River Journal|accessdate=August 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083845/http://www.hogriver.org/issues/v04n01/coltsville.htm|archive-date=August 19, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A major fire destroyed the original armory in 1864, but Elizabeth Colt had it rebuilt, including its most dramatic feature: the blue onion dome with gold starts, topped by a gold orb and a rampant colt, the original symbol of [[Colt Manufacturing Company]]. The Colt Armory is visible to commuters on I-91 and stands as a monument to Hartford's first "celebrity industrialist" and the once mighty empire that he created.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Editorial Staff|title=Sam Colt's 200th Birthday|url=http://articles.courant.com/2014-07-11/news/hc-ed-sam-colt-birthday-maker-of-gun-that-won-the--20140711_1_sam-colt-colt-park-coltsville|accessdate=August 16, 2014|newspaper=Hartford Courant|date=July 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125621/http://articles.courant.com/2014-07-11/news/hc-ed-sam-colt-birthday-maker-of-gun-that-won-the--20140711_1_sam-colt-colt-park-coltsville|archive-date=August 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Elizabeth Colt dedicated her final decades to philanthropy and public works. She commissioned the [[Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House|Church of the Good Shepherd]] in 1866 as a monument to her husband; the adjacent parish house was built in 1895 and is dedicated to the memory of her son. The ensemble is built in [[High Victorian Gothic]] style, and architectural features include a variety of gun parts, such as bullet molds, gun sights, and cylinders—likely the only church in the world with a gun motif.<ref>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=75001925}}|format=PDF|title=Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref>

With no remaining children, Elizabeth willed her extensive collection of rare art to the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, one of the oldest art galleries in America. The Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt Memorial Wing was the first American museum wing to bear the name of a female patron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt|url=http://cwhf.org/inductees/arts-humanities/elizabeth-hart-jarvis-colt#.VXVwuYcW2_c|website=Connecticut Women's Hall of Fam|accessdate=June 8, 2015|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329062938/http://www.cwhf.org/inductees/arts-humanities/elizabeth-hart-jarvis-colt#.VXVwuYcW2_c|archive-date=March 29, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

When Elizabeth Colt died in 1904, she willed the majority of her estate Armsmear to the City of Hartford for use as a public park. Today the {{convert|105|acre}} [[Colt Park]] serves the community with a number of athletic fields, playgrounds, a swimming pool, skating rink, and [[Dillon Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hartford Parks Department|title=Colt Park and Dillon Stadium|url=http://www.hartford.gov/parks/193-colt-park|website=hartford.gov|publisher=City of Hartford|accessdate=August 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812220615/http://www.hartford.gov/parks/193-colt-park/|archive-date=August 12, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Hartford was a major manufacturing city from the 19th century until the mid-20th century. During the Industrial Revolution into the mid-20th century, the Connecticut River Valley cities produced many major precision manufacturing innovations. Among these was Hartford's pioneer bicycle and automobile maker [[Pope Manufacturing Company|Pope]].<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.37.</ref> Many factories have been closed or relocated, or have reduced operations, as in nearly all former Northern manufacturing cities.

====Rise of a major manufacturing center====

The building was completed in 1882 and demolished in 1934.|220x220px]]Around 1850, Hartford native Samuel Colt perfected the precision manufacturing process that enabled the mass production of thousands of his revolvers with interchangeable parts. A variety of industries adopted and adapted these techniques over the next several decades, and Hartford became the center of production for a wide array of products, including: [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]], [[Richard Gatling]], and [[John Browning]] firearms; Weed [[sewing machines]]; Royal and Underwood typewriters; Columbia bicycles; and Pope automobiles.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hintz|first1=Eric|title=Samuel Colt&nbsp;... and Sewing Machines?|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2012/06/samuel-coltand-sewing-machines-part-1.html|accessdate=June 8, 2015|work=O, Say Can You See Blog|publisher=National Museum of American History|date=June 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608195811/http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2012/06/samuel-coltand-sewing-machines-part-1.html|archive-date=June 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt & Whitney Company]] was founded in Hartford in 1860 by Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney. They built a substantial factory in which the company manufactured a wide range of machine tools, including tools for the makers of sewing machines, and gun-making machinery for use by the Union Army during the American Civil War. Pratt Street (off Main St) continues to reflect this heritage.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} In 1925, the company expanded into aircraft engine design at its Hartford factory.

Just three years after Colt's first factory opened, the [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company]] set up shop in 1852 at a nearby site along the now-buried [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]], located in the present-day neighborhood of [[Frog Hollow, Hartford, Connecticut|Frog Hollow]]. Their factory heralded the beginning of the area's transformation from marshy farmland into a major industrial zone. The road leading from town to the factory was called Rifle Lane; the name was later changed to College Street and then Capitol Avenue.<ref name="Flayderman 2007 193–196">{{cite book|last=Flayderman|first=Norm|title=Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THeWYkwoLSUC&pg=PA195|year=2007|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-89689-455-6|pages=193–196|access-date=October 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102051906/https://books.google.com/books?id=THeWYkwoLSUC&pg=PA195|archive-date=January 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A century earlier, mills had located along the Park River because of the water power, but by the 1850s water power was approaching obsolescence. Sharps located there specifically to take advantage of the railroad line that had been constructed alongside the river in 1838.

The Sharps Rifle Company failed in 1870, and the Weed Sewing Machine Company took over its factory. The invention of a new type of sewing machine led to a new application of mass production after the principles of interchangeability were applied to clocks and guns. The Weed Company played a major role in making Hartford one of three machine tool centers in New England and even outranked the [[Colt Armory]] in nearby Coltsville in size.<ref name="Flayderman 2007 193–196"/> Weed eventually became the birthplace of both the bicycle and automobile industries in Hartford.

Industrialist [[Albert Augustus Pope|Albert Pope]] was inspired by a British-made, high-wheeled bicycle (called a velocipede) that he saw at the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]], and he bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. He wanted to contract out his first order, however, so he approached George Fairfield of Weed Sewing Machine Company, who produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878.<ref>{{cite web|title=Invention hot spot: Beginnings of mass production in 19th-century Hartford, Connecticut |url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/poi-hartford.aspx |website=invention.smithsonian.org |publisher=Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=August 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083138/http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/poi-hartford.aspx |archivedate=August 19, 2014 }}</ref> Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success, and production expanded in the Weed factory, with Weed making every part but the tires. Demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market by 1890, so Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the Pope Manufacturing Company. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near the turn of the century when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand.

In an effort to save his business, Pope opened a motor carriage department and turned out electric carriages, beginning with the "Mark III" in 1897. His venture might have made Hartford the capital of the automobile industry were it not for the ascendancy of Henry Ford and a series of pitfalls and patent struggles that outlived Pope himself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Stephen B.|title=Colonel Albert Pope and His American Dream Machines: The Life and Times of a Bicycle Tycoon Turned Automotive Pioneer|date=December 30, 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4089-4|pages=176–182}}</ref>

In 1876, Hartford Machine Screw was granted a charter "for the purpose of manufacturing screws, hardware and machinery of every variety." The basis for its incorporation was the invention of the first single-spindle automatic screw machine. For its next four years, the new firm occupied one of Weed's buildings, milling thousands of screws daily on over 50 machines. Its president was George Fairfield, who ran Weed, and its superintendent was Christopher Spencer, one of Connecticut's most versatile inventors. Soon Hartford Machine Screw outgrew its quarters and built a new factory adjacent to Weed, where it remained until 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/nyregion/116-year-old-company-thrives-on-innovation.html|title=116-Year-Old Company Thrives on Innovation|last=Hamilton|first=Robert A.|date=April 12, 1992|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 30, 2017|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526054145/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/nyregion/116-year-old-company-thrives-on-innovation.html|archive-date=May 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
