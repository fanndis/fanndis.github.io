== History ==
The first edition of ''The Australian'' was published by [[Rupert Murdoch]] on 15 July 1964, becoming the third [[Newspaper|national newspaper]] in Australia following shipping newspaper ''[[Lloyd's List Australia|Daily Commercial News]]'' (1891)<ref>{{citation | publisher = [[National Library of Australia]] Trove | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17114605?selectedversion=NBD6648874 | title = Daily commercial news and shipping list | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326171825/http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17114605?selectedversion=NBD6648874 | archivedate = 26 March 2014}}</ref> and ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' (1951). Unlike other original Murdoch newspapers, it is not a tabloid publication.<ref name=flagship>{{cite book|last=Cryle|first=Denis|title=Murdoch's flagship|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne University Press|isbn=978-0-522-85675-0|url=http://www.mup.com.au/uploads/files/acmo/MurdochFlagship_pre.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035333/http://www.mup.com.au/uploads/files/acmo/MurdochFlagship_pre.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2012}}</ref> At the time, a national paper was considered commercially unfeasible, as newspapers mostly relied on local advertising for their revenue. ''The Australian'' was printed in Canberra, then plates flown to other cities for copying.<ref name="OzAt45" /> From its inception the paper struggled for financial viability and ran at a loss for several decades.<ref name=flagship />

A Sunday edition, ''The Sunday Australian'', was established in 1971.<ref>[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/cabinet/by-year/1971-events-issues.aspx Events and issues that made the news in 1971] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109165050/http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/cabinet/by-year/1971-events-issues.aspx |date=9 November 2014 }}, National Archives of Australia</ref> However, it was discontinued in 1972 because there was insufficient press capacity to print it as well as ''[[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[The Daily Mirror (Sydney)|Sunday Mirror]]''.<ref>[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/50th-birthday/time-for-a-change/story-fnlk0fie-1226893551728 Time for a change] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823054640/https://www.theaustralian.com.au/50th-birthday/time-for-a-change/story-fnlk0fie-1226893551728 |date=23 August 2019 }}, ''The Australian'', 2014</ref>

''The Australian's'' first editor was [[Maxwell Newton]], before leaving the newspaper within a year,<ref name=OzAt45>{{cite web|last=Tiffen|first=Rodney|title=The Australian at forty-five|url=http://inside.org.au/the-australian-at-forty-five/|publisher=inside.org.au|accessdate=16 April 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421063550/http://inside.org.au/the-australian-at-forty-five/|archivedate=21 April 2013}}</ref> and was succeeded by Walter Kommer, and then by [[Adrian Deamer]]. Under his editorship ''The Australian'' encouraged female journalists, and was the first mainstream daily newspaper to hire an Aboriginal reporter, [[John Newfong]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42zI5MWxp7cC&q=newfong&pg=PA173|title=Murdoch's Flagship: The First Twenty-five Years of the Australian Newspaper|last=Cryle|first=Denis|publisher=Academic Monographs|year=2008|isbn=9780522859911|pages=174|via=Google books}}</ref>

===Stimulus Watch===

In 2009, ''The Australian'' ran many articles about the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]]'s [[Building the Education Revolution]] policy, which uncovered evidence of over-pricing, financial waste and mismanagement of the building of improvements to schools such as halls, gymnasiums and libraries. On the newspaper's website, there was a section named "Stimulus Watch", subtitled "How your Billions Are Being Spent", which contained a large collection of such articles.<ref name="jgam">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/stimulus-watch|title=Stimulus Watch|author=various|date=2009|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130219165700/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/stimulus-watch|archive-date=19 February 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> 

The following year, other media outlets also reported these issues and the policy turned into a political embarrassment for the government, which until then had been able to ignore ''The Australian{{'}}''s reports. Along with the government's [[Energy Efficient Homes Package|insulation stimulus policy]], it contributed to criticisms, perceptions of incompetence and general dissatisfaction with the government's performance.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/blogs/tim-blair/incompetence-and-waste-versus-waste-and-incompetence/news-story/97eab6a4f9d4d05230a2c3971fd9c8ac |title= Incompetence And Waste Versus Waste And Incompetence|author=Tim Blair|accessdate=19 April 2019|date=21 April 2016|newspaper=The Australian |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|author-link= Tim Blair}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.menzieshouse.com.au/kevin-rudd-literally-the-most-incompetent-and-cowardly-prime-minister-in-australian-history/ |title=Kevin Rudd: Literally the most incompetent and cowardly Prime Minister in Australian history |author=Geoff Rossiter |accessdate=6 May 2010 |date=19 April 2019 |newspaper=The Australian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514103332/http://www.menzieshouse.com.au/kevin-rudd-literally-the-most-incompetent-and-cowardly-prime-minister-in-australian-history/ |archive-date=14 May 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 16 July 2010, it was reported that [[Julia Gillard]] had admitted that the school-building program was flawed and that errors had been made because the program was designed in haste to protect jobs during the [[global financial crisis]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/julia-gillard-admits-school-mistakes/story-e6frgczf-1225892389548 |title=Julia Gillard admits school mistakes |author=Matthew Franklin and Patricia Karvelas |accessdate=3 April 2011 |date=16 July 2010 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122062559/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/julia-gillard-admits-school-mistakes/story-e6frgczf-1225892389548 |archive-date=22 January 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===AWU Affair===

In 2011, [[Glenn Milne]] reported on the allegations against Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] concerning the [[AWU affair]] including a claim regarding Gillard's living arrangements with [[Australian Workers' Union]] official Bruce Wilson. Gillard contacted the chief executive of ''The Australian'', resulting in the story being removed and an apology and retraction posted in its place.<ref name=Bombshell>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Tony|title=Bombshell for Gillard explodes under Murdoch press|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/bombshell-for-gillard-explodes-under-murdoch-press-20110829-1jipb.html|accessdate=22 August 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717174437/http://www.smh.com.au/national/bombshell-for-gillard-explodes-under-murdoch-press-20110829-1jipb.html|archive-date=17 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>
 
On 18 August 2012, [[Hedley Thomas]] reported that Gillard had left her job as a partner with law firm [[Slater and Gordon Lawyers|Slater and Gordon]] as a direct result of a secret internal investigation in 1995 into corrupt conduct on behalf of her then-boyfriend Ralph Blewett.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/investigations/revealed-julia-gillard-lost-her-job-after-law-firms-secret-investigation/story-fn6tcxar-1226452973559|title=Revealed: Julia Gillard lost her job after law firm's secret investigation|last=Thomas|first=Hedley|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=18 August 2012|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|author-link=Hedley Thomas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118061857/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/investigations/revealed-julia-gillard-lost-her-job-after-law-firms-secret-investigation/story-fn6tcxar-1226452973559|archive-date=18 January 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The story was ignored for a long time by other media outlets until after Gillard held a press conference to respond to the allegations against her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/aunty-still-in-denial-but-proving-political-bias-is-as-easy-as-abc/story-fn8qlm5e-1226578726810|title=Aunty still in denial, but proving political bias is as easy as ABC|last=Kenny|first=Chris|access-date=16 February 2013|date=16 February 2013|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216062305/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/aunty-still-in-denial-but-proving-political-bias-is-as-easy-as-abc/story-fn8qlm5e-1226578726810|archive-date=16 February 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013 the [[Fair Work Commission]] commenced initial inquiries into allegations of improper union financial conduct, and the government initiated a judicial inquiry into the [[AWU affair]] in December of that year as part of a royal commission into trade unions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/abbott-government-to-launch-royal-commission-into-union-slush-funds-20131211-2z76h.html#ixzz3j8aXrt4w |title=Abbott government to launch royal commission into union 'slush funds' |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=12 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221192742/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/abbott-government-to-launch-royal-commission-into-union-slush-funds-20131211-2z76h.html#ixzz3j8aXrt4w |archive-date=21 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Australian of the Year Award ==

In 1971, ''The Australian'' instituted their own "Australian of the Year award" separate and often different from the [[Australian of the Year]] chosen by the government's [[National Australia Day Council]]. Starting in 1968, the official award had long had links to the Victorian Australia Day Council, and at the time there was a public perception it was state based. As a national newspaper, ''The Australian'' felt they were better situated to create an award that more truly represented all of Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/the-awards/awards-history/whose-australian-of-the-year/|title=Whose Australian of the Year?|website=Australian of the Year Awards|access-date=7 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107124524/https://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/the-awards/awards-history/whose-australian-of-the-year/|archive-date=7 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Nominees are suggested by readers, decided upon by an editorial board, and awarded in January of every year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/calum-thwaites-and-tony-morris-make-a-stand-for-free-speech/news-story/1df5e04ca483005287b7db5cee8e65a4|title=The Australian's Australians of the Year 2017|last=Walker|first=Jamie|date=21 January 2017|work=The Australian|access-date=7 January 2019}}</ref>
