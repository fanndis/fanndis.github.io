The '''Women's Army Corps''' ('''WAC''') was the women's branch of the [[United States Army]]. It was created as an [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] unit, the '''Women's Army Auxiliary Corps''' ('''WAAC''') on 15 May 1942 by Public Law 554,<ref>Moore, Brenda. (1996). ''To Serve My Country, to Serve My Race''. New York: New York University Press.</ref> and converted to an active duty status in the [[Army of the United States]] as the WAC on 1 July 1943. Its first director was [[Oveta Culp Hobby]], a prominent woman in Texas society.<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|pp=28–30}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|1996|pp=16–18}}</ref> The WAC was disbanded in 1978, and all units were integrated with male units.

==History==
[[File:WAAC_Insignia.jpg|thumb|WAAC Insignia]]
The WAAC's organization was designed by numerous Army bureaus coordinated by Lt. Col. Gillman C. Mudgett, the first WAAC Pre-Planner; however, nearly all of his plans were discarded or greatly modified before going into operation because he expected a corps of only 11,000 women.<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|pp=26–28}}</ref> Without the support of the War Department, Representative [[Edith Nourse Rogers]] of Massachusetts introduced a bill on 28 May 1941, providing for a women's army auxiliary corps. The bill was held up for months by the [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] but was resurrected after the United States entered the war. The senate approved the bill on 14 May 1941 and became law on 15 May 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellafaire|2003|pp=2}}</ref> When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill the next day, he set a recruitment goal of 25,000 women for the first year. That goal was unexpectedly exceeded, so Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson decided to increase the limit by authorizing the enlistment of 150,000 volunteers.<ref name="ccxxxvi">{{harvnb|Bellafaire|2003|p=2}}</ref>

The WAAC was modeled after comparable British units, especially the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]], which caught the attention of [[Chief of Staff]] [[George C. Marshall]].<ref>Bernard A. Cook, ''Women and war: a historical encyclopedia from antiquity to the present'' (2006) Volume 1 p. 242</ref> Members of the WAC became the first women other than nurses to serve within the United States Army.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellafaire|2003|pp=1}}</ref> In 1942, the first contingent of 800 members of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps began basic training at [[Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School]], Iowa. The women were fitted for uniforms, interviewed, assigned to companies and barracks and inoculated against disease during the first day.<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|loc=ch 3–4}}</ref>

The WAAC were first trained in three major specialties. The brightest and nimblest were trained as switchboard operators. Next came the mechanics, who had to have a high degree of mechanical aptitude and problem solving ability. The bakers were usually the lowest scoring recruits and were stereotyped as being the least intelligent and able by their fellow WAACs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This was later expanded to dozens of specialties like Postal Clerk, Driver, Stenographer, and Clerk-Typist. WAC armorers maintained and repaired small arms and heavy weapons that they were not allowed to use.

A physical training manual titled "You Must Be Fit" was published by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in July 1943, aimed at bringing the women recruits to top physical standards. The manual begins by naming the responsibility of the women: "Your Job: To Replace Men. Be Ready To Take Over."<ref name=WACmanual>''W. A. C. Field Manual Physical Training'' (FM 35-20). War Department, 15 July 1943. United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.</ref> It cited the commitment of women to the war effort in England, Russia, Germany and Japan, and emphasized that the WAC recruits must be physically able to take on any job assigned to them.  The fitness manual was state-of-the-art for its day, with sections on warming up, and progressive body-weight strength-building exercises for the arms, legs, stomach, and neck and back.  It included a section on designing a personal fitness routine after basic training, and concluded with "The Army Way to Health and Added Attractiveness" with advice on skin care, make-up, and hair styles.<ref name=WACmanual/>

Inept publicity and the poor appearance of the WAAC/WAC uniform, especially in comparison to that of the other services, handicapped recruiting efforts.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} A resistance by senior Army commanders was overcome by the efficient service of WAACs in the field, but the attitude of men in the rank and file remained generally negative and hopes that up to a million men could be replaced by women never materialized. The [[United States Army Air Forces]] became an early and staunch supporter of regular military status for women in the army.<ref name="ccxxxvi"/>

About 150,000<ref>{{harvnb|Bellafaire|1972|p=2}}</ref> American women eventually served in the WAAC and WAC during World War II. They were the first women other than nurses to serve with the Army.<ref>{{cite video

While most women served stateside, some went to various places around the world, including Europe, North Africa, and New Guinea. For example, WACs landed on Normandy Beach just a few weeks after the initial invasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|pp=387–388}}</ref>

===Slander campaign===
[[File:"Calling WAAC..." - NARA - 514016.jpg|thumb|''Calling WAAC...'']]
In 1943 the recruiting momentum stopped and went into reverse as a massive slander campaign on the home front challenged the WACs as sexually immoral.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leisa D.

===Evaluations===
[[File:WACsOperateTeletype.jpg|thumb|WACs operate [[teletype machine]]s during World War II.]]
General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called the WACs "my best soldiers", adding that they worked harder, complained less, and were better disciplined than men.<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|p=460}}</ref> Many generals wanted more of them and proposed to draft women but it was realized that this "would provoke considerable public outcry and Congressional opposition", and so the War Department declined to take such a drastic step.<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|pp=95–96}}</ref> Those 150,000 women who did serve released the equivalent of 7 divisions of men for combat. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said that "their contributions in efficiency, skill, spirit, and determination are immeasurable".<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|p=408}}</ref> Nevertheless, the slander campaign hurt the reputation of the WAC and WAVES; many women did not want it known they were veterans.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|p= 45}}</ref>

During the same time period, other branches of the U.S. military had similar women's units, including the Navy [[WAVES]], the [[SPARS]] of the Coast Guard, [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve]], and the (civil) [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]]. The British Armed Forces also had similar units, including the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] ("Wrens"), the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. and the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]].

According to historian D'Ann Campbell, American society was not ready for women
in military roles:
:The WAC and WAVES had been given an impossible mission: they not only had to raise a force immediately and voluntarily from a group that had no military traditions, but also had overcome intense hostility from their male comrades. The situation was highly unfavorable: the women had no clear purpose except to send men to the battlefront; duties overlapped with civilian employees and enlisted male coworkers, causing confusion and tension; and the leadership cadre was unprestigious, inexperienced, and had little control over women, none over men. Although the military high command strongly endorsed their work, there were no centers of influence in the civilian world, either male or female, that were committed to the success of the women's services, and no civilian institutions that provided preliminary training for recruits or suitable positions for veterans. Wacs, Waves, Spars and women Marines were war orphans whom no one loved.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|p=49}}</ref>

== Manhattan Project ==
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}
Wacs were assigned to the Corps of Engineers since early 1943. Four-hundred twenty-two personnel were employed on the project. Maj. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, commander of the project, wrote: "Little is known of the significance of the contribution to the Manhattan Project by hundreds of members of the Women's Army Corps ... Since you received no headline acclaim, no one outside the project will ever know how much depended upon you."

The women interviewed for positions on the project were told they would do a hard job, would never be allowed to go overseas or attend officer candidate school, would never receive publicity, and would live at isolated stations with few recreational facilities. A surprising number of highly qualified women responded.

WAC units involved in this effort were awarded the Meritorious Unit Service Award; twenty women received the Army Commendation Ribbon; and one received the Legion of Merit.<ref>{{harvnb|Treadwell|1954|pp=326–29}}</ref> In addition, all members of the WAAC and the WAC who served in World War 2 received the [[Women's Army Corps Service Medal]].

==Disbanded==

The WAC as a branch was disbanded in 1978 and all female units were integrated with male units. Women serving as WACs at that time converted in branch to whichever [[Military Occupational Specialty]] they worked in. Since then, women in the US Army have served in the same units as men, though they have only been allowed in or near combat situations since 1994 when Defense Secretary [[Les Aspin]] ordered the removal of "substantial risk of capture" from the list of grounds for excluding women from certain military units. In 2015 Jeanne Pace, at the time the longest-tenured female warrant officer and the last former member of the WAC on active duty, retired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theredstonerocket.com/news/article_0c55b8ea-307f-11e5-9047-f7769498c74c.html |title=Women's Army Corps veteran values support systems – The Redstone Rocket: News |publisher=The Redstone Rocket |date=1971-09-09 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}</ref><ref name="armytimes1">{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/careers/army/2015/07/09/jeanne-pace-1st-cavalry-division-womens-army-corps/29922227/ |title=Longest-serving female warrant to retire after 43 years |publisher=Armytimes.com |date=2015-07-09 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://kdhnews.com/fort_hood_herald/across_the_fort/trooper-reflects-on-years-of-selfless-service/article_f22050f4-2505-11e5-9da9-63c9b1200a0e.html |title=Trooper reflects on 43 years of selfless service – Fort Hood Herald: Across The Fort |publisher=Kdhnews.com |accessdate=2015-07-25}}</ref> She had joined the WAC in 1972.<ref name="armytimes1"/>

== WAAC ranks ==
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}
[[File:WAC Signal Corps field switchboard operators 1944.jpg|thumb|WAC Signal Corps field telephone operators, 1944]]
Originally there were only four enlisted (or "enrolled") WAAC ranks (auxiliary, junior leader, leader, and senior leader) and three WAC officer ranks (first, second and third officer). The Director was initially considered as equivalent to a major, then later made the equivalent of a colonel. The enlisted ranks expanded as the organization grew in size. Promotion was initially rapid and based on ability and skill. As members of a volunteer auxiliary group, the WAACs got paid less than their equivalent male counterparts in the US Army and did not receive any benefits or privileges.

WAAC organizational insignia was a Rising Eagle (nicknamed the "Waddling Duck" or "Walking Buzzard" by WAACs). It was worn in gold metal as cap badges and uniform buttons. Enlisted and NCO personnel wore it as an embossed circular cap badge on their Hobby Hats, while officers wore a "free" version (open work without a backing) on their hats to distinguish them. Their auxiliary insignia was the dark blue letters "WAAC" on an Olive Drab rectangle worn on the upper sleeve (below the stripes for enlisted ranks). WAAC personnel were not allowed to wear the same rank insignia as Army personnel. They were usually authorized to do so by post or unit commanders to help in indicating their seniority within the WAAC, although they had no authority over Army personnel.

[[File:"WAAC - SILENCE MEANS SECURITY" - NARA - 515987.tif|thumb|100px|Women's Army Corps anti-rumor propaganda (1941–1945)]]
The organization was renamed the Women's Army Corps in July 1943<ref>[[Public Law 78-110]] (signed into law on 3 July 1943)</ref> when it was authorized as a branch of the US Army rather than an auxiliary group. The US Army's  "GI Eagle" now replaced the WAAC's Rising Eagle as the WAC's cap badge. The WAC received the same rank insignia and pay as men later that September and received the same pay allowances and deductions as men in late October.<ref>'''''Servicemen's Allowance Act of 1942''''', amendment of 25 October 1943.</ref> They were also the first women officers in the army allowed to wear officer's insignia; the Army Nursing Corps did not receive permission to do so until 1944.

The WAC had its own branch insignia (the Bust of Pallas Athena), worn by "Branch Immaterial" personnel (those unassigned to a Branch of Service). US Army policy decreed that technical and professional WAC personnel should wear their assigned Branch of Service insignia to reduce confusion. During the existence of the WAC (1943 to 1978) women were prohibited from being assigned to the combat arms branches of the Army – such as the Infantry, Cavalry, Armor, Tank Destroyers, or Artillery and could not serve in a combat area. However, they did serve as valuable staff in their headquarters and staff units stateside or in England.

The army's technician grades were technical and professional specialists similar to the later specialist grade. Technicians had the same insignia as NCOs of the same grade but had a "T" insignia (for "technician") beneath the chevrons. They were considered the same grade for pay but were considered a half-step between the equivalent pay grade and the next lower regular pay grade in seniority, rather than sandwiched between the junior enlisted (i.e., private – private first class) and the lowest NCO grade of rank (viz., corporal), as the modern-day specialist (E-4) is today. Technician grades were usually mistaken for their superior NCO counterparts due to the similarity of their insignia, creating confusion.

There were originally no warrant officers in the WAC in July, 1943. Warrant officer appointments for army servicewomen were authorized in January 1944. In March 1944 six WACs were made the first WAC Warrant Officers – as administrative specialists or band leaders. The number grew to 10 by June, 1944 and to 44 by June, 1945. By the time the war officially ended in September 1945, there were 42 WAC warrant officers still in Army service. There was only a trickle of appointments in the late 1940s after the war.

Most WAC officers were [[company-grade officer]]s (lieutenants and captains), as the WAC were deployed as separate or attached detachments and companies. The field grade officers (majors and lieutenant-colonels) were on the staff under the director of the WAC, its solitary colonel.<ref>Mrs. Hobby received the commissioned rank of colonel in the US Army on 5 July 1943</ref> Officers were paid by pay band rather than by grade or rank and did not receive a pay grade until 1955.

*There were no chief warrant officer appointments in the WAC during the war because they did not meet the skill or seniority requirements for the rank. However, few servicemen did either. It required ten or more years of time in grade as either a warrant officer (junior grade) – a rank first created in 1941, staff warrant officer – a rank waitlisted since 1936, or an [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Army Mine Planter Service]] warrant officer – an Army sea auxiliary unit that was not allowed to recruit women.

==Women's Army Corps Veterans' Association==
The Women's Army Corps Veterans' Association—Army Women's United (WACVA) was organized in August 1947. Women who have served honorably in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) or the Women's Army Corps (WAC) and those who have served or are serving honorably in the United States Army, the United States Army Reserve, or the Army National Guard of the United States, are eligible to be members. The association is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization representing women who "served their country in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Persian Gulf Bosnia and in Iraq and Afghanistan." WACVA sponsors an annual national convention and projects honoring women veterans. Local chapters of WACVA focus on volunteer work in Veterans Administration Hospitals and Community Service in the local and national community. The organization's newsletter THE CHANNEL "keeps the members aware of our national business, projects and pertinent veterans information."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armywomen.org/aboutUs.shtml|title=Women's Army Corps Veterans' Association – Army Women United|website=armywomen.org|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>
