'''''Kelo v. City of New London''''', 545 U.S. 469 (2005), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] involving the use of [[eminent domain]] to transfer land from one private owner to another private owner to further economic development. In a 5–4 decision, the Court held that the general benefits a community enjoyed from economic growth qualified private redevelopment plans as a permissible "[[public use]]" under the [[Takings Clause|Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment]].<ref name="citation">{{ussc|name=Kelo v. City of New London|link=|volume=545|page=469|pin=|year=2005}}.</ref>

The case arose in the context of [[eminent domain|condemnation]] by the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], of privately owned [[real property]], so that it could be used as part of a "comprehensive redevelopment plan." After the Court's decision, the city allowed a private developer to proceed with its plans; however, the developer was unable to obtain financing and abandoned the project, and the contested land remained an undeveloped empty lot in 2019.<ref name="APSep252009"/>

== Background ==
This case was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] from a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Connecticut]] in favor of the City of New London. The owners, including lead plaintiff Susette Kelo of 8 East Street, sued the city in Connecticut courts, arguing that the city had misused its eminent domain power. The power of eminent domain is limited by the [[Takings Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The Takings Clause reads, ". . . nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." Under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, this limitation also applies to the actions of state and local governments.  The plaintiffs argued that economic development, the stated purpose of the taking and subsequent transfer of land to the New London Development Corporation, did not qualify as a public use under the Fifth Amendment.

The [[Connecticut Supreme Court]] heard arguments on December 2, 2002. The state court issued its decision (268 Conn. 1, SC16742) on March 9, 2004, siding with the city in a 4–3 decision, with the majority opinion authored by Justice [[Flemming L. Norcott, Jr.]], joined by Justices [[David M. Borden]], [[Richard N. Palmer]] and [[Christine Vertefeuille]].<ref>''Kelo v. The city of New London'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11983576373624813537 268 Conn. 1], 843 [[A.2d]] 500 ([[Connecticut Supreme Court|Conn.]] 2004).</ref> Justice [[Peter T. Zarella]] wrote the dissent, joined by Chief Justice [[William J. Sullivan]] and Justice [[Joette Katz]].<ref>''Kelo'', 268 Conn. at 144, 843 A.2d at 587 (Zarella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</ref>

The State Supreme Court held that the use of eminent domain for economic development did not violate the [[Public Use Clause|public use clauses]] of the state and federal constitutions.  The court held that if a legislative body has found that an economic project will create new jobs, increase tax and other city revenues, and revitalize a depressed urban area (even if that area is not [[Urban decay|blighted]]), then the project serves a public purpose, which qualifies as a public use.  The court also ruled that the government’s delegation of its eminent domain power to a private entity was constitutional under the Connecticut Constitution.
The United States Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] to consider questions raised in ''[[Berman v. Parker]],'' {{ussc|348|26|1954}} and later in ''[[Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff]]'', {{ussc|467|229|1984}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/4supreme.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430022623/http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/4supreme.html|url-status=dead|title=4 is the Supreme Number of the Universe |archive-date=April 30, 2008|website=cubicao.tk}}</ref> Namely, whether a "public purpose" constitutes a "public use" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause: "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." Specifically, does the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the states through the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (see main article: [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Incorporation of the Bill of Rights]]), protect landowners from takings for economic development, rather than, as in ''Berman,'' for the elimination of slums and blight?

''Kelo'' was the first major eminent domain case heard at the Supreme Court since 1984.  In that time, states and municipalities had slowly extended their use of eminent domain, frequently to include economic development purposes.  In the ''Kelo'' case, Connecticut had a statute allowing eminent domain for "economic development" even in the absence of blight. There was also an additional twist in that the development corporation was ostensibly a private entity; thus the plaintiffs argued that it was not constitutional for the government to take private property from one individual or corporation and give it to another, if the government was simply doing so because the repossession would put the property to a use that would generate higher tax revenue.

''Kelo'' became the focus of vigorous discussion and attracted numerous supporters on both sides.  Some 40 ''[[amicus curiae]]'' briefs were filed in the case, 25 on behalf of the petitioners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ij.org/new-london-connecticut-amicus-briefs |title=Amicus Briefs |publisher=The Institute for Justice |accessdate=2014-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726122044/http://www.ij.org/new-london-connecticut-amicus-briefs |archive-date=2014-07-26 }}</ref> Susette Kelo's supporters ranged from the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Institute for Justice]] (the lead attorneys on the case) to the [[NAACP]], [[American Association of Retired Persons|AARP]], the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] and South Jersey Legal Services. The latter groups signed an amicus brief arguing that eminent domain has often been used against politically weak communities with high concentrations of minorities and elderly.

The case was argued on February 22, 2005. Oral arguments were presented on behalf of the petitioners (plaintiffs) by Scott G. Bullock of the Institute for Justice in Washington D.C. and on behalf of the respondents (defendants) by Wesley W. Horton of Horton, Shields & Knox in Hartford, CT. The case was heard by only seven members of the court with Associate Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] presiding, as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] was recuperating from medical treatment at home and Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] was delayed on his return to Washington from Florida; both absent Justices read the briefs and oral argument transcripts and participated in the case decision.

During the case, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], asked whether a ruling in favor of the city would destroy "the distinction between private use and public use,". He also asked if private use, which provided merely incidental benefits to the state, was "not enough to justify use of the condemnation power."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/04-108|title=Kelo ''v.'' New London |website=[[Oyez Project|Oyez]] |publisher=[[Chicago-Kent College of Law]]}}</ref>

== Opinion of the Court ==
=== Majority and concurring ===
On June 23, 2005, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled in favor of the City of New London.  Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[David Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer]]. Justice Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion setting out a more detailed standard for judicial review of economic development takings than that found in Stevens's majority opinion.  In so doing, Justice Kennedy contributed to the Court's trend of turning minimum scrutiny—the idea that government policy need only bear a rational relation to a legitimate government purpose—into a fact-based test.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In ''Romer v. Evans'', 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996), the Court said that the government purpose must be "independent and legitimate."  And in ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), the Court said the government purpose "must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation."  Thus, the Court made it clear that, in the scrutiny regime established in ''[[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]]'', 300 U.S. 379 (1937), government purpose is a question of fact for the trier of fact.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Kennedy fleshed out this doctrine in his ''Kelo'' concurring opinion; he sets out a program of civil discovery in the context of a challenge to an assertion of government purpose.  However, he does not explicitly limit these criteria to eminent domain, nor to minimum scrutiny, suggesting that they may be generalized to all health and welfare regulation in the scrutiny regime. He wrote:

<blockquote>
A court confronted with a plausible accusation of impermissible favoritism to private parties should [conduct]... a careful and extensive inquiry into 'whether, in fact, the development plan [chronology]

[1.]  is of primary benefit to... the developer... and private businesses which "may" eventually locate in the plan area...

[2.]   and in that regard, only of incidental benefit to the city...'"

Kennedy is also interested in facts of the chronology which show, with respect to government,

[3.]  awareness of... depressed economic condition and evidence corroborating the validity of this concern...

[4.]  the substantial commitment of public funds... before most of the private beneficiaries were known...

[5.]  evidence that [government] reviewed a variety of development plans...

[6.]  [government] chose a private developer from a group of applicants rather than picking out a particular transferee beforehand and...

[7.]  other private beneficiaries of the project [were]... unknown [to government] because the... space proposed to be built [had] not yet been rented...<ref>''Kelo'', 545 U.S. at 491–92.</ref>
</blockquote>

''Kelo v. City of New London'' did not establish entirely new law concerning eminent domain. Although the decision was controversial, it was not the first time "public use" had been interpreted by the Supreme Court as "public purpose." In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens wrote the "Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public" (545 U.S. 469). Thus precedent played an important role in the 5–4 decision of the Supreme Court. The Fifth Amendment was interpreted the same way as in ''Midkiff'' (467 U.S. 229) and other earlier eminent domain cases.

===Dissenting opinions===
The principal dissent was issued on 25 June 2005 by Justice O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]].  The dissenting opinion suggested that the use of this taking power in a reverse [[Robin Hood]] fashion—take from the poor, give to the rich—would become the norm, not the exception:

{{Quote|Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random.  The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.<ref>''Kelo'', 545 U.S. at 505 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).</ref>}}

O'Connor argued that the decision eliminates "any distinction between private and public use of property—and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment."<ref>''Kelo'', 545 U.S. at 494 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).</ref>

Thomas also issued a separate [[originalism|originalist]] dissent, in which he argued that the precedents the court's decision relied upon were flawed.  He accuses the majority of replacing the Fifth Amendment's "Public Use" clause with a very different "public purpose" test:

{{Quote|This deferential shift in phraseology enables the Court to hold, against all common sense, that a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation, is for a 'public use.'<ref>''Kelo'', 545 U.S. at 506 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</ref>}}

Thomas additionally observed:

{{Quote|Something has gone seriously awry with this Court's interpretation of the Constitution. Though citizens are safe from the government in their homes, the homes themselves are not.<ref>''Kelo'', 545 U.S. at 518.</ref>}}

Thomas also made use of the argument presented in the NAACP/AARP/SCLC/SJLS amicus brief on behalf of three low-income residents' groups fighting redevelopment in [[New Jersey]], noting: {{Quote|Allowing the government to take property solely for public purposes is bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will fall disproportionately on poor communities.  Those communities are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use, but are also the least politically powerful.<ref>''Kelo'', 545 U.S. at 521.</ref>}}

Following the decision, many of the plaintiffs expressed an intent to find other means by which they could continue contesting the seizure of their homes.<ref name="newsday">{{cite news| first=Matt| last= Apuzzo |author-link=Matt Apuzzo |date=June 23, 2005| url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/connecticut/ny-bc-ct--seizingproperty-r0623jun23,0,122027.story?coll=ny-region-apconnecticut| title=High court ruling divides New London| publisher=Newsday.com}}</ref>  Soon after the decision, city officials announced plans to charge the residents of the homes for back rent for the five years since condemnation procedures began.  The city contended that the residents have been on city property for those five years and owe tens of thousands of dollars of rent.  In June 2006, Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] intervened with New London city officials, proposing the homeowners involved in the suit be deeded property in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood so they may retain their homes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-02143800.apds.m0296.bc-ct--seizjun02,0,595545.story?coll=hc-headlines-local| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-11-02| publisher=Courant.com}}{{Dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> A group of New London residents formed a local political party, One New London, to combat the takings.

[[Pfizer]], whose employees were supposed to be the clientele of the Fort Trumbull redevelopment project, completed its merger with [[Wyeth]], resulting in a consolidation of research facilities of the two companies.  Pfizer chose to retain the [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] campus on the east side of the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], closing its New London facility in late 2010 with a loss of over 1,000 jobs. That coincided with the expiration of tax breaks on the New London site that would have increased Pfizer's property tax bill by almost 400 percent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/business/hc-pfizer1110nov10,0,766810.story|title=Pfizer to close New London Headquarters|publisher=[[Hartford Courant]]|first=Eric|last=Gershon|quote=Pfizer Inc. will shut down its massive New London research and development headquarters and transfer most of the 1,400 people working there to Groton, the pharmaceutical giant said Monday.

After the Pfizer announcement, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', in November 2009, in its lead editorial called the ''Kelo'' decision infamous:
<blockquote> The well-laid plans of redevelopers, however, did not pan out. The land where Susette Kelo's little pink house once stood remains undeveloped. The proposed hotel-retail-condo "urban village" has not been built. And earlier this month, Pfizer Inc. announced that it is closing the $350 million research center in New London that was the anchor for the New London redevelopment plan, and will be relocating some 1,500 jobs.<ref name=SFChron20091128>{{cite news |title=After the homes are gone |url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/After-the-homes-are-gone-3209347.php |accessdate=May 19, 2018 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 28, 2009 |page=A-11}}</ref></blockquote>
The ''Chronicle'' editorial quoted from ''[[The New York Times]]'': <blockquote> "They stole our home for economic development," ousted homeowner Michael Cristofaro told the ''New York Times''. "It was all for Pfizer, and now they get up and walk away."<ref name=SFChron20091128/></blockquote>

The final cost to the city and state for the purchase and bulldozing of the formerly privately held property was $78 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704402404574527513453636326| title=Pfizer and Kelo v.

Opposition to the ruling was widespread, coming from groups such as [[AARP]], the [[NAACP]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and the [[Institute for Justice]]. The [[American Conservative Union]] condemned the decision.<ref>[http://www.conservative.org/pressroom/06232005_un.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913192249/http://www.conservative.org/pressroom/06232005_un.asp |date=September 13, 2006 }}</ref> Much of the public viewed the outcome as a gross violation of property rights and as a misinterpretation of the Fifth Amendment, the consequence of which would be to benefit large corporations at the expense of individual homeowners and local communities. Many owners of family farms also disapproved of the ruling, as they saw it as an avenue by which cities could seize their land for private developments.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Since the opposition to the ruling was so widespread American journalist [[Charles C.

As a result, many states changed their eminent domain laws. Prior to the ''Kelo'' decision, only seven states specifically prohibited the use of eminent domain for economic development except to eliminate blight. Since the decision, forty-five states have amended their eminent domain laws, although some of these changes are cosmetic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castlecoalition.org/?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=119|title=The Castle Coalition – Citizens Fighting Eminent Domain Abuse|website=castlecoalition.org}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://reason.com/2019/04/23/will-connecticut-finally-enact-meaningful-eminent-domain-reform/|title=Will Connecticut Finally Enact Meaningful Eminent Domain Reform?|date=2019-04-23|website=Reason.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>
The ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial board agreed with the ruling, calling it "a welcome vindication of cities' ability to act in the public interest."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/opinion/24fri1.html The Limits of Property Rights], ''The New York Times'', June 24, 2005</ref> The ''[[Washington Post]]''{{'}}s editorial board also agreed with the ruling, writing, "[t]he court's decision was correct. . . . New London's plan, whatever its flaws, is intended to help develop a city that has been in economic decline for many years."<ref>However the ''New York Times'' has a conflict of interest because its current headquarters building was erected on land taken by eminent domain for economic redevelopment.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/23/AR2005062301698.html Eminent Latitude], ''The Washington Post'', June 24, 2005</ref>

The ''Kelo'' fiasco eventually cost the taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, with nothing to show for it. The "carefully vetted" municipal plans that formed the basis for the Supreme Court's decision proved to be illusory. Eventually, the City of New London extended an apology to Susette Kelo and her neighbors, and so did one of the Connecticut Supreme Court justices who voted for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theday.com/article/20120131/NWS01/120139919|title=Mayor announces restructuring of NLDC; apologizes to eminent domain property owners|date=31 January 2012|website=The Day}}</ref>

=== Presidential reaction ===
On June 23, 2006, the first anniversary of the original decision, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] issued an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]<ref name="georgewbush-whitehouse">{{cite web |url= https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/06/20060623-10.html |title=Executive Order: Protecting the Property Rights of the American People |first= George W.  |last=Bush |work=The White House |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}</ref> instructing the federal government to restrict the use of eminent domain {{quote|...for the purpose of benefiting the general public and not merely for the purpose of advancing the economic interest of private parties to be given ownership or use of the property taken.<ref name="georgewbush-whitehouse"/> }} However, since eminent domain is most often exercised by local and state governments, the presidential order may have little overall effect.

=== Congressional reaction ===
On June 27, 2005, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Cornyn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas|Tex.]]) introduced legislation, the "[[Protection of Homes, Small Businesses and Private Property Act of 2005]]" (S.B. 1313), to limit the use of eminent domain for economic development. The operative language
# prohibits the federal government from exercising eminent domain power if the only justifying "public use" is economic development; and
# imposes the same limit on state and local government exercise of eminent domain power "through the use of Federal funds."
Similar bills have subsequently been put forth in the House of Representatives by Congressman [[Dennis Rehberg]] (R-[[Montana|Mont.]]), [[Tom DeLay]] (R-Tex.), and [[John Conyers]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Michigan|Mich.]]) with [[James Sensenbrenner]] (R-[[Wisconsin|Wisc.]]). As some small-scale eminent domain condemnations (including notably those in the ''Kelo'' case) can be local in both decision and funding, it is unclear how much of an effect the bill would have if it passed into law.<ref name="volokh">Professor [[Eugene Volokh]], [http://volokh.com/posts/1119903026.shtml "Senator Cornyn (R-Tex.) Proposes Limits on Eminent Domain."] [[The Volokh Conspiracy]], June 27, 2005</ref> This bill has been reintroduced several times.

=== Scholarly reaction ===
In 2008, land use Professor [[Daniel R. Mandelker]] argued that the public backlash against ''Kelo'' is rooted in the historical deficiencies of urban renewal legislation.<ref>{{Bluebook website|first=Daniel E. |last=Mandelker |title=Kelo’s Lessons for Urban Redevelopment: History Forgotten |publisher=Wash.

In 2009, Professor [[Edward J. Lopez]] of [[San Jose State University]] studied passed laws and found that states with more economic freedom, greater value of new housing construction, and less racial and income inequality were more likely to have enacted stronger restrictions sooner.<ref name="lopez">{{cite journal

Severe criticism of the ''Kelo'' decision came from Professor Gideon Kanner of the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.<ref>{{Bluebook journal | first=Gideon | last=Kanner | title=The Public Use Clause: Constitutional Mandate or "Hortatory Fluff"? | volume=33 | journal=Pepp. L.

=== State legislation ===
Prior to ''Kelo'', eight states specifically prohibited the use of eminent domain for economic development except to eliminate blight: [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].<ref name="ncsl">[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090705105001/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/natres/emindomaincase.htm NCSL: State Case Law Prohibiting Eminent Domain for Economic Development, August 2005].</ref> {{As of|2019|April|df=}}, 45 states had enacted some type of reform legislation in response to the ''Kelo'' decision.<ref name=":0" /> Of those states, 22 enacted laws that severely inhibited the takings allowed by the Kelo decision, while the rest enacted laws that place some limits on the power of municipalities to invoke eminent domain for economic development. The remaining five states have not passed laws to limit the power of eminent domain for economic development.<ref name="lopez"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castlecoalition.org/pdf/publications/report_card/50_State_Report.pdf |title=50 State Report Card: Tracking Eminent Domain Reform Legislation since Kelo |work=Castle Coalition |date=August 2007 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}</ref>

==== Arizona ====
[[Arizona Proposition 207 (2006)|Proposition 207]], the Private Property Rights Protection Act, passed in 2006.

==== California ====
Under pre-existing California law, takings (for conveyance to a private party, as opposed to a public use that may incidentally benefit private parties) were already illegal.

[[California Proposition 90 (2006)|Proposition 90]], which attempted to exploit the unpopularity of ''Kelo'' for a different objective, failed in the November 2006 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/prop/00.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214133336/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/prop/00.htm |archive-date=2006-12-14 }}</ref> The initiative also included language requiring that government pay financial compensation to any property owners who could successfully argue that regulation caused them significant economic loss. Subsequently, [[California Propositions 98 and 99 (2008)|Proposition 99]] passed in the June 2008 election. It amends the state constitution to prohibit (subject to some exceptions):{{quote|state and local governments from using eminent domain to acquire an owner-occupied residence [if the owner has occupied the residence for at least one year], as defined, for conveyance to a private person or business entity.}}  In 2012, California abolished its redevelopment agencies.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/29/local/la-me-redevelopment-20111230 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Maura | last1=Dolan | first2=Jessica | last2=Garrison | first3=Anthony | last3=York | title=California high court puts redevelopment agencies out of business | date=December 29, 2011}}</ref>

The Iowa Legislature passed a 2006 bill restricting the use of eminent domain for economic development. Gov.

==== Kansas ====
In response to the ''Kelo'' decision, the Kansas Legislature enacted K.S.A. 26-501a and K.S.A. 26-501b and amended K.S.A. 26-501.

K.S.A. 26-501a. Eminent domain; limited to public use; transfer to private entity prohibited; exception. On and after July 1, 2007: (a) Private property shall not be taken by eminent domain except for public use and private property shall not be taken without just compensation.
(b) The taking of private property by eminent domain for the purpose of selling, leasing or otherwise transferring such property to any private entity is prohibited except as provided in K.S.A. 2009 Supp. 26–501b, and amendments thereto.
(c) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the eminent domain procedure act.
History: L. 2006, ch. 192, § 1; May 25.

K.S.A. 26-501b. Eminent domain; transfer to private entity authorized, when. On and after July 1, 2007, the taking of private property by eminent domain for the purpose of selling, leasing, or otherwise transferring such property to any private entity is authorized if the taking is:
(a) By the Kansas department of transportation or a municipality and the property is deemed excess real property that was taken lawfully and incidental to the acquisition of right-of-way for a public road, bridge or public improvement project including, but not limited to a public building, park, recreation facility, water supply project, wastewater and waste disposal project, storm water project and flood control and drainage project;
(b) by any public utility, as defined in K.S.A. 66-104, and amendments thereto, gas gathering service, as defined in K.S.A. 55-1,101, and amendments thereto, pipe-line companies, railroads and all persons and associations of persons, whether incorporated or not, operating such agencies for public use in the conveyance of persons or property within this state, but only to the extent such property is used for the operation of facilities necessary for the provision of services;
(c) by any municipality when the private property owner has acquiesced in writing to the taking;
(d) by any municipality for the purpose of acquiring property which has defective or unusual conditions of title including, but not limited to, clouded or defective title or unknown ownership interests in the property;
(e) by any municipality for the purpose of acquiring property which is unsafe for occupation by humans under the building codes of the jurisdiction where the structure is situated;
(f) expressly authorized by the legislature on or after July 1, 2007, by enactment of law that identifies the specific tract or tracts to be taken. If the legislature authorizes eminent domain for private economic development purposes, the legislature shall consider requiring compensation of at least 200% of fair market value to property owners.
(g) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the eminent domain procedure act.

Michigan passed a restriction on the use of eminent domain in November 2006, Proposition 4, 80% to 20%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iandrinstitute.org/BW%202006-5%20%28Election%20results%29.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720014250/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/BW%202006-5%20%28Election%20results%29.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Election Results 2006|archive-date=July 20, 2010}}</ref>  The text of the ballot initiative was as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://house.michigan.gov/hfa/PDFs/FINAL%20BallotProp%20Nov06.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128144032/http://house.michigan.gov/hfa/PDFs/FINAL%20BallotProp%20Nov06.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Analysis of Proposals on the Ballot November 7, 2006 |archive-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref>

A proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit government from taking private property by eminent domain for certain private purposes
<br>
The proposed constitutional amendment would:
* Prohibit government from taking private property for transfer to another private individual or business for purposes of economic development or increasing tax revenue.
* Provide that if an individual's principal residence is taken by government for public use, the individual must be paid at least 125% of property’s fair market value.
* Require government that takes a private property to demonstrate that the taking is for a public use; if taken to eliminate blight, require a higher standard of proof to demonstrate that the taking of that property is for a public use.
* Preserve existing rights of property owners.
</blockquote>

==== Minnesota ====
The state restricts eminent domain to public use. Minnesota Statute 117.025 Subd. 11(b) (passed in 2006) clearly states: "The public benefits of economic development, including an increase in tax base, tax revenues, employment, or general economic health, do not by themselves constitute a public use or public purpose."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/117.025|title=Sec. 117.025 MN Statutes|website=revisor.mn.gov}}</ref>

(2) The above provisions shall not apply where the use of eminent domain (a) removes a public nuisance; (b) removes a structure that is beyond repair or unfit for human habitation or use; (c) is used to acquire abandoned property; or (d) eliminates a direct threat to public health or safety caused by the property in its current condition.}}

==== Nevada ====
On 25 November 2008 a voter-approved amendment to the Nevada constitution, colloquially titled the ''People’s Initiative to Stop the Taking of Our Land'', or ''PISTOL'', was put into effect following its review by the Nevada State Supreme Court.<ref name="NV_LVRJ">{{cite web| url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/35075129.html| title=Eminent domain limits become part of state constitution| author=Ed Vogel| publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal| date=November 25, 2008| accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>  Among other provisions, the amendment included the following text:

{{quote|Public use shall not include the direct or indirect transfer of any interest in property taken in an eminent domain proceeding from one private party to another private party. In all eminent domain actions, the government shall have the burden to prove public use.}}

The amendment also modifies the definition of "fair market value"—used to determine the monetary compensation a property owner receives—to represent the highest value the property would be sold for on the open market, and returns seized property to the original property owner "if the property is not used within five years for the original purpose stated by the government."<ref name="NV_PISTOL">{{cite web| url=http://www.nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=475| title=Initiative Petition, Nevada Property Owners' Bill of Rights| publisher=Nevada Secretary of State| accessdate=2011-07-01| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011124057/http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=475| archive-date=2011-10-11}}</ref>

==== New Hampshire ====
In New Hampshire, various libertarian activists, in response to the decision, sought to use eminent domain to seize Justice [[David Souter]]'s farmhouse in [[Weare, New Hampshire]] and build a hotel (the "Lost Liberty Hotel") on the site.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8406056/ns/us_news-weird_news/t/eminent-domain-justices-farm-target/ Eminent domain this!

In 2006, the [[New Hampshire Legislature]] proposed an amendment to the [[New Hampshire Constitution|state constitution]] providing that "no part of a person's property shall be taken by eminent domain and transferred, directly or indirectly, to another person if the taking is for the purpose of private development or other private use of the property."<ref>Lawrence Friedman, ''The New Hampshire State Constitution'' (2d ed.: Oxford University Press: 2015), pp. 65–66.</ref> The amendment was overwhelmingly approved by New Hampshire voters in the November 2006 elections.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2006/NH/2006-11-08-initiatives_x.htm N.H. voters opt to curb eminent domain; smaller House districts also at stake], Associated Press (November 8, 2006).</ref> Some New Hampshire commentators suggested that the state had gone too far in restricting the exercise of eminent domain in the ''Kelo'' backlash.<ref>Elizabeth E.

An attempted use of eminent domain was brought before the Ohio Supreme Court in ''[[City of Norwood v. Horney]]''. In July 2006, the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]] unanimously held in favor of the property owners, finding the seizure would violate the [[Constitution of Ohio]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/eminent_domain_ohio_supreme.pdf |title=Recent Case: Ohio Supreme Court Holds That Economic Development Cannot by Itself Satisfy the Public Use Limitation of the Ohio Constitution |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=120 |page=643 |year=2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite court |litigants=City of Norwood v.

==== Wisconsin ====
On 29 March 2006 Gov. [[Jim Doyle]] signed into law 2005 Wisconsin Act 233, which prohibits condemnation of nonblighted property for transfer to a private entity. Nonblighted property is defined by a list of conditions that may make the property a detriment to the "public health, safety, or welfare." Two days earlier the governor signed into law 2005 Wisconsin Act 208, which creates procedures designed to protect property owners including public notice and public hearing requirements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/Lb/06Lb5.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028231803/http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/Lb/06Lb5.pdf|url-status=dead|title=New Eminent Domain Restrictions and Zoning Notice Laws |archive-date=October 28, 2008}}</ref>

The Wisconsin law has been criticized as one having little or no real protection for property owners because it provides protection against property condemnation for economic development but does allow property condemnation under a broadly defined description of blighted.<ref>[http://volokh.com/posts/1244662023.shtml A Questionable Taking in Milwaukee].</ref><ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/pi/47483262.html City set to take family's land] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508140919/http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/pi/47483262.html |date=2016-05-08 }}.</ref>
