In British parliamentary procedure, a '''humble address''' is a communication from one of the houses of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]].  For example, following the [[speech from the throne]] opening a parliament, each house will debate the contents of the speech under a motion for a humble address thanking the Queen for the speech.<ref>For example [https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-06-22/debates/83DB2A19-E587-4268-A161-94A6C2F156F9/DebateOnTheAddress Debate on the Address], House of Commons Hansard 22 June 2017 Volume 626 Column 228</ref>

== Address for a return ==
In the United Kingdom, a '''humble address for a return''' is a rarely used [[parliamentary procedure]] by which either the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] or [[House of Lords]] may petition the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]], and by extension [[Government of the United Kingdom|HM Government]], to order documents to be produced.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/01/labour-use-arcane-19th-century-parliamentary-procedure-try-force/|title=Labour to use arcane 19th-Century parliamentary procedure to try to force Government to publish secret Brexit files|last=Maidment|first=Jack|date=2017-11-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> ''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice|Erskine May]]'' notes that this power was used frequently until the mid-19th century, though most such information is now provided by [[command paper]]s or the explanatory documents attached to [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Acts of Parliament]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://constitution-unit.com/2017/11/10/labours-motion-for-a-return-what-and-why/|title=Labour’s ‘motion for a return’: what and why?|date=2017-11-10|work=The Constitution Unit Blog|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

===1866=== 
In 1866, as part of a campaign to extend the [[Women's suffrage|electoral franchise to women]], [[John Stuart Mill]] moved an address for a "Return of the number of Freeholders, Householders, and others in England and Wales who, fulfilling the conditions of property or rental prescribed by Law as the qualification for the Electoral Franchise, are excluded from the Franchise by reason of their sex" in order to debate the petition he had presented.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1866/jul/17/motion-for-a-return HC Deb 17 July 1866 vol 184 cc996-8]</ref> The government of the day accepted the motion, but may not have provided the information specifically requested.

===2017===
In 2017, the House of Commons voted to issue a humble address to request the government to reveal documents about the potential impact of [[Brexit]] on the British economy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/01/government-may-bow-to-pressure-to-release-brexit-impact-studies|title=Government may bow to pressure to release Brexit impact studies|first=Peter |last=Walker|date=2017-11-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The motion, put forward by the opposition, requested:

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that the Queen was not happy at being drawn into a political issue, which the monarch, by [[Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom|convention]], avoids.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/01/exclusive-queen-not-happy-dragged-labour-row-brexit-papers/|title=Exclusive: Queen 'not happy' after being dragged by Labour into row over Brexit papers|last=Hope|first=Christopher|date=2017-11-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

===2018===
A second Brexit-related humble address was placed before the House on 13 November 2018, seeking the release of legal advice given to the government regarding the proposed EU withdrawal agreement:

{{quote|That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be laid before parliament: any legal advice in full, including that provided by the attorney general, on the proposed withdrawal agreement on the terms of the UK’s departure from the European Union including the [[Northern Ireland backstop]] and framework for a future relationship between the UK and the European Union.<ref>{{cite news |title=Labour aims to force ministers to publish official legal advice on proposed EU deal |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-live-latest-update-theresa-may-deal-legal-advice-irish-border-parliament-a8631091.html |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=13 November 2018}}</ref>}}

The government's response was presented to Parliament by [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Geoffrey Cox (British politician)|Geoffrey Cox]] on 3 December. However, the following day, it was deemed by MPs to be incomplete, which led to a vote in which, for the first time in history, the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] was found to be in [[contempt of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Full Brexit legal advice to be published after government loses vote |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/04/mps-demand-for-brexit-legal-advice-too-vague-says-geoffrey-cox |accessdate=5 December 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=4 December 2018}}</ref>

Former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Dominic Grieve]] laid a third Brexit-related humble address before the House on 9 September 2019; requiring the publication of documents related to no-deal Brexit ([[Operation Yellowhammer]]) and to the prorogation of Parliament scheduled for later that day, it was passed by 311 votes to 302.<ref>{{cite news |title=MPs demand publication of no-deal Brexit and prorogation documents |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-09-09/emergency-debates-ahead-of-vote-on-early-election/ |accessdate=9 September 2019 |agency=ITV News |date=9 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=MPs order Johnson to hand over aides' messages about prorogation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/mps-order-johnson-to-hand-over-aides-messages-about-prorogation |accessdate=9 September 2019 |publisher=The Guardian |date=9 September 2019}}</ref> The motion provided as follows:
