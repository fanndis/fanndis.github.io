'''Baby of the House''' is the unofficial title given to the youngest member of a [[parliament|parliamentary house]]. The term is most often applied to members of the British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] from which the term originated.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN06399/-of-the-house-house-of-commons-background-paper of the House: House of Commons Background Paper – Commons Library Standard Note] from UK Parliament, accessed on 1 January 2015.</ref> The title is named after the [[Father of the House]], which is given to the ''longest serving'' member of the British and other parliaments.

==United Kingdom==
Becoming the Baby of the House is regarded as something of an achievement despite the lack of any special treatment that comes with the title. However, some MPs who have held the position for a considerable period – [[Matthew Taylor (Liberal politician)|Matthew Taylor]] was the Baby of the House for over ten years – have found it somewhat embarrassing, as it may suggest that they have a lack of experience, although many holders of the title have gone on to enjoy long and distinguished parliamentary careers.

At the turn of the twenty-first century (August 1999 to September 2001), all three of the leaders of the main political parties had been the youngest MPs in their party when they began their political careers ([[William Hague]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Charles Kennedy]]).

Of those whose ages can be verified, the youngest MP since the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]]<ref>Prior to 1832 minors could be elected; precise information on those MPs is often unclear.</ref> is [[Mhairi Black]], elected in 2015 aged 20 years 237 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/snp-mhairi-black-20-labour-student-mp|title=Mhairi Black: the 20-year-old who beat a Labour heavyweight|first1=Ewen|last1=MacAskill|first2=Rebecca|last2=Ratcliffe|date=8 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> The [[age of candidacy]] for Parliament was lowered from 21 to 18 by the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006|Electoral Administration Act of 2006]]. [[William Pitt the Younger]] was elected at 21 and became Prime Minister two years later in 1783.

===Youngest member of the House of Lords===
The title 'Baby of the House' is not used in the House of Lords, though the youngest member is recorded on the House website.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-lords-faqs/lords-members/ Parliament.UK – House of Lords FAQS – Membership and principal office holders] at parliament.uk</ref> The youngest life peer and youngest woman in the House is [[Joanna Penn, Baroness Penn|Baroness Penn]] (born 1985) who was created a [[life peer]] in October 2019 at the age of 34.
The youngest man in the House of Lords is [[James Wharton, Baron Wharton of Yarm|Lord Wharton of Yarm]] (born 1984) who was created a [[life peer]] in September 2020 at the age of 36. <ref>[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2020-0050/LLN-2020-0050.pdf Parliament.UK – House of Lords in 2020: Profile of Membership] at parliament.uk</ref>

Standing Orders state that "No Lord under the age of one and twenty years shall be permitted to sit in the House". When most members of the Lords were hereditary peers, a peer who had inherited his or her peerage(s) while under age was entitled to take a seat on the day before his or her 21st birthday. In theory, such a hereditary peer could still be [[List of elected hereditary peers under the House of Lords Act 1999|elected to sit in the House]] at that age; in practice, the youngest hereditary peer to have been elected was [[Valerian Freyberg, 3rd Baron Freyberg|Lord Freyberg]] (born 15 December 1970), who was elected in October 1999 at the age of 28. 
Hereditary peer [[Rupert Mitford, 6th Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] (born 18 July 1967) was created a life peer on 18 April 2000 at the age of 32, becoming the youngest ever life peer, to enable him to continue to sit after the removal of the majority of hereditary peers.

==Philippines==
In the [[Congress of the Philippines]], the term "Baby of the House" is rarely used; the term "Benjamin" of the chamber is used instead.<ref name=":2" /> Special treatment is not given to the youngest member of either chamber. However, by tradition, the youngest member of the chamber usually administers the oath of office to their incoming leader (i.e. [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President of the Senate]] and [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker of the House of Representatives]]).

The minimum age for being a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] is 25 years old, while for the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], it is 35, as stipulated in the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]]. In 1933, [[Benigno Aquino, Sr.]] became senator at the age of 33;<ref>{{cite news|title=FAST FACTS: Trivia on the Philippine Senate|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/149332-trivia-philippine-senate|accessdate=10 February 2018|work=Rappler|date=2016-10-16|language=en}}</ref> the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Law]], which created the Senate, had prescribed the minimum age of 30.

The current ''Benjamin of the House'' is Representative Braeden John Biron of the [[Legislative districts of Iloilo#4th District|4th District of Iloilo]]. Meanwhile, Senator Manny Pacquiao has been the youngest Senator since 2016.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=18th Congress, by the numbers|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/234302-numbers-composition-18th-congress-philippines|last=Bueza|first=Michael|website=Rappler|language=en|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref>

{{main|List of youngest members of the United States Congress}}
While the term is used in the Commonwealth Parliaments, Baby of the House or Senate is not in general contemporary use in the United States, nor does being the youngest member confer special treatment in either house of Congress.

Members of the US Congress tend to be older than parliamentarians elsewhere in the English-speaking world, a main factor being that the minimum ages for members of Congress is written into [[Article One of the United States Constitution]], which forbids those under the age of 25 from serving in the House, and those under the age of 30 from serving in the Senate. Moreover, election to the federal Congress is expensive and requires extensive contacts and recognition across a very wide area. Individuals aiming to serve in the federal legislature generally seek election to the [[state legislature (United States)|state legislature]] (which generally have lower minimum ages for entry) or other state office before seeking to serve in Washington.

In the [[116th United States Congress|116th Congress]], which began on 3 January 2019, the youngest member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] is [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], who was born on {{birth date and age|df=yes|1989|10|13}}, and was first elected in 2018 a few weeks after her 29th birthday. She is also the youngest woman elected to the House in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-now-the-youngest-woman-elected-to-congress.html|title=29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez makes history as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress|first=Abigail|last=Hess|date=7 November 2018|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref>

Currently the youngest [[United States Senate|US Senator]] is [[Josh Hawley]], born on {{birth date and age|df=yes|1979|12|31}}, and first elected in 2018.
