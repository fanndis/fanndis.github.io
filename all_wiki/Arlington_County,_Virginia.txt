The county is situated in [[Northern Virginia]] on the southwestern bank of the [[Potomac River]] directly across from the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], of which it was [[District of Columbia retrocession|once a part]]. The county is coterminous with the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]]'s [[census-designated place]] of Arlington. Arlington is considered to be the second-largest "[[principal city]]" of the [[Washington metropolitan area]].

In 2019, the county's population was estimated at 236,842,<ref name="US Census Bureau Estimates 2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage_739801612 |title=County Population Totals and Components of Change: 2010-2018 |access-date=May 25, 2019}}</ref> making Arlington the [[List of cities and counties in Virginia|sixth-largest county in Virginia by population]]; if it were incorporated as a city, Arlington would be the fourth most-populous city in the state. With a land area of {{convert|26|sqmi|km2}}, Arlington is the geographically smallest [[Political subdivisions of Virginia|self-governing county]] in the U.S., and by reason of state law regarding population density, it has no incorporated towns within its borders.

==History==

===Colonial Virginia===
The area that now constitutes Arlington County was originally part of [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]]. Land grants from the British monarch were awarded to prominent Englishmen in exchange for political favors and efforts at development. One of the grantees was [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], who lends his name to both Fairfax County and the [[Fairfax, Virginia|City of Fairfax]]. The county's name "Arlington" comes via [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Henry Bennet]], [[Earl of Arlington]], a [[plantations in the American South|Plantation]] along the Potomac River, and [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the family residence on that property. [[George Washington Parke Custis]], grandson of First Lady [[Martha Washington]], acquired this land in 1802. The estate was eventually passed down to [[Mary Anna Custis Lee]], wife of General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/willofgeorgewashingtonparkecustis.htm |title=Will of George Washington Parke Custis |publisher=Nathanielturner.com |date=2008-06-29 |access-date=2011-11-04}}</ref> The property later became [[Arlington National Cemetery]] during the [[American Civil War]], and eventually lent its name to present-day Arlington County.

===Alexandria County, District of Columbia (D.C.)===

The area that now contains almost all of Arlington County was ceded to the new United States federal government by Virginia, along with most of what is now the city of Alexandria. With the passage of the [[Residence Act]] in 1790, Congress approved a new permanent capital to be located on the [[Potomac River]], the exact area to be selected by U.S. President [[George Washington]]. The Residence Act originally only allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as what is now the [[Anacostia River]]. However, President Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast in order to include the existing town of Alexandria at the District's southern tip.
[[File:Map of the District of Columbia, 1835.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the District of Columbia in 1835, prior to the retrocession of Alexandria County]]

In 1791, Congress, at Washington's request, amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including the territory ceded by Virginia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb|author3=John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

As permitted by the [[United States Constitution]], the initial shape of the federal district was a square, measuring {{convert|10|mi|km|}} on each side, totaling {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|}}. During 1791–92, [[Andrew Ellicott]] and several assistants placed [[Boundary Stones (District of Columbia)|boundary stones]] at every mile point. Fourteen of these markers were in Virginia and many of the stones are still standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/ |title=Boundary Stones of Washington, D.C. |publisher=BoundaryStones.org |access-date=May 27, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515194639/http://www.boundarystones.org/| archive-date= May 15, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

When Congress arrived in the new capital, they passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801|Organic Act of 1801]] to officially organize the District of Columbia and placed the entire federal territory, including the cities of Washington, [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown]], and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], under the exclusive control of Congress. Further, the territory within the District was organized into two counties: the [[Washington County, D.C.|County of Washington]] to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. It included almost all of the present Arlington County, plus part of what is now the [[independent city]] of Alexandria.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb|author3=John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

===Retrocession===

{{main|District of Columbia retrocession}}

Residents of Alexandria County had expected the federal capital's location to result in higher land prices and the growth of commerce.{{when|date=December 2016}} Instead the county found itself struggling to compete with the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] at the port of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], which was farther inland and on the northern side of the Potomac River next to the city of Washington.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C |url=http://www.historydc.org/aboutdc.aspx |publisher=[[Historical Society of Washington, D.C.]] |access-date=October 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918042009/http://www.historydc.org/aboutdc.aspx |archive-date=September 18, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Members of Congress from other areas of Virginia also used their power to prohibit funding for projects, such as the [[Alexandria Canal (Virginia)|Alexandria Canal]], which would have increased competition with their home districts. In addition, Congress had prohibited the federal government from establishing any offices in Alexandria, which made the county less important to the functioning of the national government.<ref name="debates">{{cite journal|last=Richards |first=Mark David |date=Spring–Summer 2004 |title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801–2004 |journal=Washington History |publisher=www.dcvote.org |pages=54–82 |url=http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf |access-date=January 16, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118053203/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf |archive-date=January 18, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Alexandria had also been an important center of the [[Slavery in the United States|slave trade]] (see [[Franklin and Armfield Office]]). Rumors circulated that [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] in Congress were attempting to end slavery in the District; such an action would have further depressed Alexandria's slavery-based economy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greeley |first=Horace |title=The American Conflict: A History of the Great Rebellion in the United States|publisher=G. & C.W. Sherwood |year=1864 |location=Chicago |url=https://archive.org/details/americanconflic06greegoog |pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanconflic06greegoog/page/n154 142]–144}}</ref> At the same time, an active abolitionist movement arose in Virginia that created a division on the question of slavery in the Virginia General Assembly. Pro-slavery Virginians recognized that if Alexandria were returned to Virginia, it could provide two new representatives who favored slavery in the state legislature. During the American Civil War, this division led to the formation of the state of [[West Virginia]], which comprised by what was then 51 counties in the northwest that favored abolitionism.<ref name="richards">{{cite journal|last=Richards |first=Mark David |date=Spring–Summer 2004 |title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801–2004 |journal=Washington History |publisher=Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |pages=54–82 |url=http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf |access-date=January 16, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118053203/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf |archive-date=January 18, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Largely as a result of the economic neglect by Congress, divisions over slavery, and the lack of voting rights for the residents of the District, a movement grew to return Alexandria to Virginia from the District of Columbia. From 1840 to 1846, Alexandrians petitioned Congress and the Virginia legislature to approve this transfer known as [[District of Columbia retrocession|retrocession]]. On February 3, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria if Congress approved. Following additional lobbying by Alexandrians, [[List of United States federal legislation, 1789–1901#1841 to 1851|Congress passed legislation on July 9, 1846]], to return all the District's territory south of the Potomac River back to Virginia, pursuant to a referendum; President [[James K. Polk]] signed the legislation the next day. A referendum on retrocession was held on September 1–2, 1846. The voters in the City of Alexandria voted in favor of the retrocession, 734 to 116, while those in the rest of Alexandria County voted against retrocession 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in rural Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846. However, the Virginia legislature did not immediately accept the retrocession offer. Virginia legislators were concerned that the people of Alexandria County had not been properly included in the retrocession proceedings. After months of debate, the Virginia General Assembly voted to formally accept the retrocession legislation on March 13, 1847.<ref name=debates />

In 1852, the Virginia legislature voted to incorporate a portion of Alexandria County to make the City of Alexandria, which until then had been administered only as an unincorporated town within the political boundaries of Alexandria County.<ref name="Incorporation_of_Alexandria">{{cite web| url= http://alexandriava.gov/city/about-alexandria/about.html#history| title= Alexandria's History| access-date= August 30, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829220638/http://alexandriava.gov/city/about-alexandria/about.html#history| archive-date= August 29, 2006| url-status= dead| df= mdy-all}}</ref>

===Civil War===
During the [[Virginia in the American Civil War|American Civil War]], Virginia seceded from the Union as a result of a statewide referendum held on May 23, 1861; the voters from Alexandria County approved secession by a vote of 958–48. This vote indicates the degree to which its only town, Alexandria, was pro-secession and pro-Confederate. The rural county residents outside the city were Union loyalists and voted against secession.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bradley E.

Although Virginia was part of the Confederacy, the Confederacy did not control all of northern Virginia. In 1862, the [[United States Congress]] passed a law that some claimed had required that owners of property in those districts in which the "insurrection" existed were to pay their real estate taxes in person.<ref name=Hunter>(1) [[s: Bennett v.

In 1864, during the war, the federal government confiscated the [[Abingdon (plantation)|Abingdon]] estate, which was located on and near the present [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]], when its owner failed to pay the estate's property tax in person because he was serving in the [[Confederate Army]].<ref name=Hunter/> The government then sold the property at auction, whereupon the purchaser leased the property to a third party.<ref name=Hunter/>
[[File:Arlington House.jpg|thumb|The façade of [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] appears on Arlington's seal, flag, and logo.]]
After the war ended in 1865, the Abingdon estate's heir, Alexander Hunter, started a legal action to recover the property. [[James A. Garfield]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who had been a [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] in the [[Union Army]] during the Civil War and who later became the [[List of Presidents of the United States|20th President of the United States]], was an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] on Hunter's legal team.<ref name=Hunter/> In 1870, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in a precedential ruling, found that the government had illegally confiscated the property and ordered that it be returned to Hunter.<ref name=Hunter/>

The property containing the home of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s family at and around [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] was subjected to an appraisal of $26,810, on which a tax of $92.07 was assessed. However, Lee's wife, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee]], the owner of the property, did not pay this tax in person.<ref name="tax">{{cite web|access-date=2011-09-30|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/historical_information/arlington_house.html|title=Arlington House|work=History of Arlington National Cemetery|publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913093837/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/historical_information/arlington_house.html|archive-date=September 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Kaufman>(1) [[s: United States v.

Confederate incursions from Falls Church, [[Minor's Hill]] and [[Upton's Hill]]—then securely in Confederate hands—occurred as far east as the present-day area of [[Ballston, Arlington, Virginia|Ballston]]. On August 17, 1861, an armed force of 600 Confederate soldiers engaged the 23rd New York Infantry near that crossroads, killing one. Another large incursion on August 27 involved between 600 and 800 Confederate soldiers, which clashed with Union soldiers at Ball's Crossroads, Hall's Hill and along the modern-day border between the City of Falls Church and Arlington. A number of soldiers on both sides were killed. However, the territory in present-day Arlington was never successfully captured by Confederate forces.<ref>Gernand, ''A Virginia Village Goes to War'', pp. 73–74, 89.</ref>

===Separation from Alexandria===
[[File:1878 Alexandria County Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|1878 map of Alexandria County, now (with the removal of Alexandria City) Arlington County]]
In 1870, the City of Alexandria became legally separated from Alexandria County by an amendment to the Virginia Constitution that made all Virginia [[incorporated cities]] (but not [[incorporated towns]]) independent of the counties of which they had previously been a part. Because of the confusion between the city and the county having the same name, a movement started to rename Alexandria County. In 1920, the name '''Arlington County''' was adopted, after [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the home of the [[American Civil War]] Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]], which stands on the grounds of what is now [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The [[Potomac, Virginia|Town of Potomac]] was incorporated as a town in Alexandria County in 1908. The town was annexed by the [[independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in 1930.

In 1896, an electric trolley line was built from Washington through Ballston, which led to growth in the county (see [[Northern Virginia trolleys]]).

===20th century===
[[File:Seal of Arlington County, Virginia (1983–2007).png|thumb|upright|left|The former Arlington County seal, used from June 1983 to May 2007]]

In 1920, the Virginia legislature renamed the area Arlington County to avoid confusion with the City of Alexandria which had become an [[independent city]] in 1870 under the new Virginia Constitution adopted after the Civil War.

In the 1930s, [[Hoover Field]] was established on the present site of the Pentagon; in that decade, Buckingham, Colonial Village, and other apartment communities also opened. World War II brought a boom to the county, but one that could not be met by new construction due to rationing imposed by the war effort.

In October 1942, not a single rental unit was available in the county.<ref>''Arlington Sun Gazette'', October 15, 2009, "Arlington history", page 6, quoting from the ''Northern Virginia Sun''</ref> On October 1, 1949, the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] created an extension center in the county named Northern Virginia University Center of the University of Virginia.

In February 1959, Arlington County Schools [[desegregated]] racially at Stratford Junior High School (now Dorothy Hamm) with the admission of black pupils Donald Deskins, Michael Jones, Lance Newman, and Gloria Thompson. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in 1954, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka'', Kansas had struck down the previous ruling on racial segregation ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' that held that facilities could be racially "separate but equal." ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruled that "racially separate educational facilities were inherently unequal." The elected Arlington County School Board presumed that the state would defer to localities and in January 1956 announced plans to integrate Arlington schools. The state responded by suspending the county's right to an elected school board. The Arlington County Board, the ruling body for the county, appointed conservatives to the school board and blocked plans for desegregation. Lawyers for the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed suit on behalf of a group of parents of both white and black students to end segregation. Black pupils were still denied admission to white schools, but the lawsuit went before the U.S. District Court, which ruled that Arlington schools were to be desegregated by the 1958–59 academic year. In January 1959 both the U.S. District Court and the Virginia Supreme Court had ruled against Virginia's [[massive resistance]] movement, which opposed racial integration.<ref>Les Shaver, "Crossing the Divide: The Desegregation of Stratford Junior High," ''Arlington Magazine'' November/December 2013, pp. 62–71</ref> The Arlington County Central Library's collections include written materials as well as accounts in its Oral History Project of the desegregation struggle in the county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.arlingtonva.us/center-for-local-history/virginiana-collection/|title=Virginiana Collection|publisher=Arlington Public Library |access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

Arlington during the 1960s was undergoing tremendous change after the huge influx of newcomers in the 1950s. [[M.T. Broyhill & Sons Corporation]] was at the forefront of building the new communities for these newcomers, which would lead to the election of [[Joel Broyhill]] as the representative of [[Virginia's 10th congressional district]] for 11 terms.<ref name="broyhill">{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Charlie|title=Our Man in Arlington|url=https://fcnp.com/2013/01/30/our-man-in-arlington-12/|access-date=January 27, 2018|work=fncp.com|publisher=Falls Church News-Press Online|date=January 30, 2013}}</ref> The old commercial districts did not have ample off-street parking and many shoppers were taking their business to new commercial centers, such as Parkington and Seven Corners. Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar to what happened in other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the [[Washington Metro]], which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The ensuing gentrification caused the mostly working and lower middle class white Southern residents to either be priced out of rent or in some cases sell their homes. This permanently changed the character of the city, and ultimately resulted in the virtual eradication of this group over the coming 30 years, being replaced with an increasing presence of a white-collar transplant population mostly of Northern stock. While a population of white-collar government transplant workers had always been present in the county, particularly in its far northern areas and in Lyon Village, the 1980s, 90s and 2000s saw the complete dominance of this group over the majority of Arlington's residential neighborhoods, and mostly economically eliminated the former working-class residents of areas such as Cherrydale, Lyon Park, Rosslyn, Virginia Square, Claremont, and Arlington Forest, among other neighborhoods. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as [[Little Saigon, Arlington, Virginia|Little Saigon]], and has now been significantly gentrified - its former Vietnamese population barely visible save for several holdout businesses. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.<ref>Kevin Craft, "When Metro Came to Town: How the fight for mass transit was won.

In 1965, after years of negotiations, Arlington swapped some land in the south end with the city Alexandria, though less than originally planned. The land was located along King Street and Four Mile Run. The swap allowed the two jurisdictions to straighten out the boundary and allow highway and sewer projects to go forward. It moved into Arlington several acres of land to the south of the old county line that had not been a part of the District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cheek III |first1=Leslie |title=Arlington Approves Alexandria Land Swap |work=The Washington Post |date=11 April 1965}}</ref>

Arlington County is located in northeast Virginia and is surrounded by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] to the southwest, the [[Alexandria, Virginia|City of Alexandria]] to the southeast, and Washington, D.C., to the northeast directly across the [[Potomac River]], which forms the county's northern border.

The county is governed by a five-person County Board; members are elected at-large on staggered four-year terms. They appoint a [[County manager (United States)|county manager]], who is the chief executive of the County Government.  Like all [[Virginia counties]], Arlington has five elected constitutional officers: a clerk of court, a commissioner of revenue, a [[commonwealth's attorney]], a sheriff, and a treasurer. The budget for the fiscal year 2009 was $1.177 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/ManagementAndFinance/budget/fy09adopted/C.2_Budget%20REsolution.pdf |title=Department of Management and Finance - Departments & Offices |publisher=Arlingtonva.us |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225070658/http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/ManagementAndFinance/budget/fy09adopted/C.2_Budget%20REsolution.pdf |archive-date=February 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Incorporation ====
{{Further|Administrative divisions of Virginia}}
{{see also|Unincorporated area (United States)}}
Under Virginia law, the only municipalities that may be contained within counties are [[incorporated town]]s; incorporated [[Independent city (United States)|cities]] are independent of any county. Arlington, despite its population density and largely urban character, is wholly unincorporated with no towns inside its borders. In the 1920s, a group of citizens petitioned the [[Courts of Virginia|state courts]] to incorporate the [[Clarendon, Arlington, Virginia|Clarendon]] neighborhood as a town, but this was rejected; the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] held, in ''Bennett v. Garrett'' (1922), that Arlington constituted a "continuous, contiguous, and homogeneous community" that should not be subdivided through incorporation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Office of the County Manager (Arlington, Virginia)|date=1967|title=A History of the Boundaries of Arlington County, Virginia|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36902/36902-h/36902-h.htm#27|access-date=2020-07-13|website=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>

Current state law would prohibit the incorporation of any towns within the county because the county's population density exceeds 200 persons per square mile.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Peaslee|first1=Liliokanaio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nF92AwAAQBAJ&q=Bennett%20v.%20Garrett,%20112%20S.E.%20772&pg=PA137|title=Virginia Government: Institutions and Policy|last2=Swartz|first2=Nicholas J.|date=2013-10-07|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=978-1-4833-0146-4|pages=136–137|language=en}}</ref> In 2017, then-county board chairman [[Jay Fisette]] suggested that the county as a whole should incorporate as an independent city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=No Longer A County Boy: Arlington Official Says County Should Become A City|url=https://wamu.org/story/17/07/14/no-longer-county-boy-arlington-official-says-county-become-city/|access-date=2020-07-13|website=WAMU|language=en}}</ref>

Arlington elects four members of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] and two members of the [[Virginia State Senate]]. State Senators are elected for four-year terms, while Delegates are elected for two-year terms.

In the Virginia State Senate, Arlington is split between the 30th and 31st districts, represented by [[Adam Ebbin]] and [[Barbara Favola]], respectively. In the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], Arlington is divided between the 45th, 47th, 48th, and 49th districts, represented by [[Mark Levine (journalist)|Mark Levine]], [[Patrick A. Hope|Patrick Hope]], [[Rip Sullivan]], and [[Alfonso H. Lopez|Alfonso Lopez]], respectively.  All are Democrats.

At the presidential level, Arlington was once a fairly reliable GOP stronghold, supporting the Republican candidate in all but two elections from 1944 to 1980.  However, in 1984, Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] carried the county by a narrow margin, despite Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]'s electoral landslide nationally.  It has gone Democratic in every presidential election since then. In fact, in 2016, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] received the fewest raw votes of a major-party candidate in the county since [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in 1956, in addition to receiving the lowest proportion of Arlington's vote for a Democratic or Republican candidate in the past century. Arlington is part of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat [[Don Beyer]].

===Arlington National Cemetery===
{{Main|Arlington National Cemetery}}

Arlington National Cemetery is an American [[military cemetery]] established during the [[American Civil War]] on the grounds of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (also known as the Custis-Lee Mansion). It is directly across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C., north of [[the Pentagon]]. With nearly 300,000 graves, Arlington National Cemetery is the second-largest national cemetery in the United States.

Arlington House was named after the Custis family's homestead on Virginia's Eastern Shore. It is associated with the families of Washington, Custis, and Lee. Begun in 1802 and completed in 1817, it was built by [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. After his father died, young Custis was raised by his grandmother and her second husband, the first [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George Washington]], at [[Mount Vernon]]. Custis, a far-sighted agricultural pioneer, painter, playwright, and orator, was interested in perpetuating the memory and principles of George Washington. His house became a "treasury" of Washington heirlooms.

In 1804, Custis married [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. Their only child to survive infancy was Mary Anna Randolph Custis, born in 1808. Young Robert E. Lee, whose mother was a cousin of Mrs. Custis, frequently visited Arlington. Two years after graduating from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], Lieutenant Lee married Mary Custis at Arlington on June 30, 1831. For 30 years, Arlington House was home to the Lees. They spent much of their married life traveling between [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] duty stations and Arlington, where six of their seven children were born. They shared this home with Mary's parents, the Custis family.

When George Washington Parke Custis died in 1857, he left the Arlington estate to Mrs. Lee for her lifetime and afterward to the Lees' eldest son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]].

The U.S. government confiscated Arlington House and {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of ground immediately from the wife of General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The government designated the grounds as a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. In 1882, after many years in the lower courts, the matter of the ownership of Arlington National Cemetery was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Court decided that the property rightfully belonged to the Lee family. The [[United States Congress]] then appropriated the sum of $150,000 for the purchase of the property from the Lee family.

Veterans from all the nation's wars are buried in the cemetery, from the [[American Revolution]] through the military actions in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. Pre-Civil War dead were re-interred after 1900.

The [[Tomb of the Unknowns]], also known as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, DC.  President [[John F. Kennedy]] is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and some of their children. His grave is marked with an [[eternal flame]]. His brothers, Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], are also buried nearby. [[William Howard Taft]], who was also a [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, is the only other [[President of the United States|President]] buried at Arlington.

Other frequently visited sites near the cemetery are the [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]], commonly known as the Iwo Jima Memorial, the [[United States Air Force Memorial|U.S. Air Force Memorial]], the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]], the [[Netherlands Carillon]] and the U.S. Army's [[Fort Myer]].

===The Pentagon===

{{Main|The Pentagon}}
[[The Pentagon]] in Arlington is the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. It was dedicated on January 15, 1943, and it is the world's largest office building. Although it is located in Arlington, the [[United States Postal Service]] requires that "Washington, D.C." be used as the place name in mail addressed to the six [[ZIP code]]s assigned to The Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html |title=Facts & Figures: Zip Codes |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311141422/http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html|archive-date=March 11, 2008 |access-date=July 12, 2017}}</ref>

The building is [[pentagon]]-shaped and houses about 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel. It has five floors and each floor has five ring corridors.  The Pentagon's principal law enforcement arm is the [[United States Pentagon Police]], the agency that protects the Pentagon and various other DoD jurisdictions throughout the National Capital Region.

Built during the early years of [[World War II]], it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. It has {{convert|17.5|mi|abbr=on}} of corridors, yet it takes only seven minutes or so to walk between any two points in the building.

It was built from {{convert|680000|ST}} of sand and gravel dredged from the nearby [[Potomac River]] that were processed into 435,000 cubic yards (330,000 m³) of concrete and molded into the pentagon shape. Very little steel was used in its design due to the needs of the war effort.

The open-air central plaza in the Pentagon is the world's largest "no-salute, no-cover" area (where U.S. servicemembers need not wear hats nor salute). The snack bar in the center is informally known as the [[ground zero|Ground Zero Cafe]], a nickname originating during the [[Cold War]] when the Pentagon was targeted by Soviet [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]].

During World War II, the earliest portion of the [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] was built in Arlington in conjunction with the parking and traffic plan for the Pentagon. This early freeway, opened in 1943 and completed to [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], in 1952, is now part of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]].
