[[File:Ndr-lokstedt-ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|upright|NDR television buildings in Hamburg]]
NDR's studios in Hamburg are in two locations, both within the borough of [[Eimsbüttel]]: the television studios are in the quarter of [[Lokstedt]] while the radio studios are in the quarter of [[Harvestehude]] (though they are called "Funkhaus am Rothenbaum"), a little closer to the city centre. There are also regional studios, having both radio and television production facilities, in the state capitals [[Hanover]], [[Kiel]] and [[Schwerin]]. The facility in Hanover is now called the [[Landesfunkhaus Niedersachsen]]. In addition, NDR maintains facilities at [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]'s national studios in [[Berlin]].

===Funding===
NDR is in part funded by the limited sale of on-air commercial advertising time; however, its principal source of income is the revenue derived from viewer and listener [[television licence|licence fee]]s. As of 2015, the monthly fee due from each household for radio and television reception was €17.50. These fees are collected not directly by NDR but by a [[Beitragsservice von ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio|joint agency]] of [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] (and its member institutions), [[ZDF]], and [[Deutschlandradio]].

==History==
''For 1924–1955 in detail, see [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]].''

===Pre-war===
In 1924 broadcasting began in Hamburg, when ''Norddeutsche Rundfunk AG'' (NORAG) was created. In 1934 it was incorporated into the ''Großdeutscher Rundfunk'', the national broadcaster controlled by [[Joseph Goebbels]]'s [[Propagandaministerium]], as ''Reichssender Hamburg''.

In 1930, NORAG commissioned the Welte-Funkorgel – a large [[theatre organ]] custom-built by the firm of [[Welte-Mignon|M. Welte & Sons]] to meet the specific acoustic requirements of radio broadcasting – and installed it in their radio studio (today the world's oldest such facility still in use) on Rothenbaumchaussee 132, Hamburg, where it continues to be played, now maintained by volunteers.<ref>{{cite web |author=Staff |publisher=Freunde der Welte-Funkorgel Hamburg e.V. |url=http://www.weltefreunde.de |title=www.weltefreunde.de |accessdate=1 February 2009 |date=14 December 2008 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101154450/http://www.weltefreunde.de/ |archive-date=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Post-war===
In the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#British Zone|British Zone]] of occupied Germany, the military authorities quickly established ''Radio Hamburg'' to provide information to the population of the area.

The British Control Commission appointed [[Hugh Greene]] to manage the creation of public service broadcasting in their Zone. On 22 September 1945, ''Radio Hamburg'' became ''Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk'', the single broadcasting organisation of the British Zone.

===Länder control===
In 1948, the Control Commission transferred the [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]] (NWDR) to the control of the constituent Länder. At first, NWDR had just one radio station, later known as NWDR1. In 1950, it introduced a regional station for the north, ''NWDR Nord'' (later to become NDR2), and a regional station for the west, ''NWDR West'' (later WDR2).

That same year, NWDR became a founding member of ARD. The NWDR also played a founding role in launching [[Standard-definition television|625-line]] television in Germany, starting broadcasts on 25 December 1952.

===NWDR split===
In February 1955, North Rhine-Westphalia decided to establish its own broadcaster, whilst Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein continued with the existing system. To this end, the NWDR was split into two broadcasters, Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) in the north and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) in North Rhine-Westphalia.

NDR continued to operate out of Hamburg. The split was effective from 1 January 1956, although the station NWDR1 remained a joint operation with regional opt-outs.

The NWDR television service also remained a joint operation, from 1 April 1956 under the name '' Nord- und Westdeutsche Rundfunkverband'' (North and West German Broadcasting Federation – NWRV). NDR and WDR launched separate television services for their respective areas in 1961.

On 1 December 1956 NDR started its third radio channel, NDR3 (from 1962 to 1973, it was operated jointly with [[Sender Freies Berlin]]).

In 1958 [[Han Koller]] became the musical director of Hamburg's [[NDR Jazz Workshop]], which became a popular radio broadcast. Numerous names in [[Jazz]] performed on these broadcasts including; [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Lucky Thompson]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Johnny Griffin]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Sahib Shihab]], [[Carmell Jones]], [[Lee Konitz]], [[Cecil Payne]], [[Slide Hampton]], [[Phil Woods]], [[Jazz Composers Orchestra]], [[Howard Riley (musician)|Howard Riley]], [[Barry Guy]], [[John Surman]], the [[Kuhn Brothers]] and [[Barney Wilen]]. Some of these have been released since 1987, while the older ones only exist as rare [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]], sought after by many [[Jazz]] aficionados.

On 4 January 1965  NDR, Radio Bremen and SFB began a joint "third channel" television service, ''Norddeutsches Fernsehen'', later ''Nord 3'' and ''N3''. Since December 2001, this service is called ''NDR Fernsehen''. [[Sender Freies Berlin|SFB]] started a separate TV channel for Berlin in 1992, called B1, later SFB1, now [[RBB Fernsehen]].

In 1977, Gerhard Stoltenberg, the minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein unilaterally cancelled the ''NDR-Staatsvertrag'', the governing body of NDR. This caused a discussion how to organise broadcasting in the North German region.

In 1980, NDR signed a new convention with the three Länder, changing the pattern of broadcasting and creating new regional services. NDR1 was divided into three independent radio stations from 2 January 1981:
* ''NDR 1 Radio Niedersachsen'' (from 2002, ''NDR 1 Niedersachsen'') for Lower Saxony
* ''NDR 1 Welle Nord'' for Schleswig-Holstein
* '''NDR Hamburg-Welle 90.3''' (from 2 December 2001, ''NDR 90.3'') for Hamburg
NDR2 and NDR3 (now NDR Kultur) continued as regional stations.

These regional services were further subdivided with opt-outs for specific areas. ''NDR 1 Niedersachsen'' established regions based around Oldenburg-Ostfriesland-Bremen-Cuxhaven, Osnabrück-Emsland, greater Hanover, Braunschweig-southern Lower Saxony and northern Lower Saxony. ''NDR 1 Welle Nord'' was subdivided with studio centres in Flensburg, Heide, Norderstedt, Lübeck and Kiel.

On 30 September 1988 NDR introduced a [[teletext]] service on its ''N3'' television channel. Originally called ''Nordtext'', it became ''NDR Text'' on 2 December 2001. The teletext service also offers information for viewers in the Radio Bremen area under the title ''Radio Bremen Text''.

On 1 April 1989, NDR introduced its fourth radio service, NDR4. This service was later renamed ''NDR4 Info'' and since 2 June 2002 has been known as ''NDR Info''. The station is a news and information service for the whole NDR region.

On 1 January 1992, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the former East Germany joined NDR as the fourth state in the organisation. The area receives the main NDR radio and television stations, plus the regional ''NDR 1 Radio mV'', which has subregions based in Schwerin, Rostock, Neubrandenburg and Greifswald. In October of the same year, SFB in Berlin stopped relaying the ''Nord 3'' television service in favour of its own ''Berlin 1'' TV channel.

On 4 April 1994, NDR introduced ''N-Joy Radio'' (known simply as ''N-Joy'' since 2001), a radio station aimed at 14 to 29-year-old listeners.

On 3 October 1997, NDR3 was relaunched as ''Radio 3'', produced in co-operation with Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg. At the end of 2000, SFB joined Radio 3. This arrangement lasted until ORB and SFB merged on 1 January 2003 and started íts own classical and culture network. NDR3 became ''NDR Kultur'' on 1 January 2003.

On 1 November 2001, NDR and Radio Bremen launched a joint radio station, ''Nordwestradio'', to serve Bremen and northwestern Lower Saxony. This service replaced ''[[Radio Bremen 2]]'' and control of the service remains with Radio Bremen.

As the organization responsible within the [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD consortium of German public-service broadcasters]] for overseeing the country's participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], NDR staged the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|56th annual contest]] which was held in [[Düsseldorf]] on 10–14 May 2011, outside their own broadcasting area.
