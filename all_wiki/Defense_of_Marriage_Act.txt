The '''Defense of Marriage Act''' ('''DOMA''') is a [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]] passed by the [[104th United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]]. It defines marriage for federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman, and allows states to refuse to recognize [[same-sex marriage]]s granted under the laws of other states. The act's provisions were ruled unconstitutional or left effectively unenforceable by [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions in the cases of ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' (2013) and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015).

Same-sex marriage emerged as an issue in the late 1980s, drawing opposition especially from [[Social conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] groups. Congressman [[Bob Barr]] and Senator [[Don Nickles]], both members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], introduced the bill that became DOMA in May 1996. It passed both houses of Congress by large, veto-proof majorities, with opposition coming from approximately one-third of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] caucus in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Clinton criticized the law as "divisive and unnecessary," but nonetheless signed it into law in September 1996.

Section 2 of the act allows states to deny recognition of same-sex marriages conducted by other states. Section 3 codifies non-recognition of [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriages]] for all federal purposes, including insurance benefits for government employees, [[Social Security (United States)|social security]] survivors' benefits, immigration, bankruptcy, and the filing of joint [[tax return (United States)|tax returns]]. It also excludes same-sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers, laws evaluating financial aid eligibility, and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite-sex spouses.<ref name="Opinion">{{cite web | url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf | title =United States v. Windsor | author =''[[Supreme Court of the United States]]'' | publisher =supremecourt.gov | date =June 26, 2015}}</ref>{{rp|23–24}}

After its passage, DOMA was subject to numerous lawsuits and repeal efforts. In ''United States v. Windsor'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declared Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional under the [[Due Process Clause]], thereby requiring the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages conducted by the states. In ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', the Court held that same-sex marriage was a fundamental right protected by both the Due Process Clause and the [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The ruling requires all states to perform and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples, leaving Section 2 of DOMA as superseded and unenforceable.

==Background==
{{main|Same-sex marriage in the United States}}
The issue of legal recognition of same-sex marriage attracted mainstream attention infrequently until the 1980s. A sympathetic reporter heard several gay men raise the issue in 1967 and described it as "high among the deviate's hopes".<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/11/12/83645750.pdf |first=Webster |last=Schott |title=Civil Rights and the Homosexual: A 4-Million Minority Asks for Equal Rights |date=November 12, 1967 |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> In one early incident, gay activist [[Jack Baker (activist)|Jack Baker]] brought suit against the state of Minnesota in 1970 after being denied a marriage license to marry another man; the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled (in ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'') that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples did not violate the Constitution. Baker later changed his legal name to Pat Lynn McConnell and married his male partner in 1971, but the marriage was not legally recognized.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/01/07/119453382.pdf |title=Homosexual Wins Fight to Take Bar Examination in Minnesota |date=January 7, 1973 |accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name=mw1>{{cite web |work=Metro Weekly |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6213 |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=Domestic Disturbance |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref> A 1972 off-Broadway play, ''Nightride'', depicted "a black–white homosexual marriage".<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/01/23/91318536.pdf |last=Barton |first=Lee (pseudonym) |title=Why Do Homosexual Playwrights Hide their Homosexuality? |date=January 23, 1973 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref><ref group=n>For a review of the play see {{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/12/10/90705873.pdf |first=Clive |last=Barnes |title='Nightride'–No Apologies and No Regrets |date=December 10, 1971 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref> In 1979, [[IntegrityUSA]], an organization of gay Episcopalians, raised the issue when the U.S. Episcopal Church considered a ban on the ordination of homosexuals as priests.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/09/17/120959164.pdf |first=Nathaniel |last=Sheppard |title=Panel bids Episcopalians Bar Homosexual priests |date=September 17, 1979 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref><ref group=n>For the theological background beginning in 1967, see {{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/12/03/84992192.pdf |first=Edward B. |last=Fiske |title=Views on Homosexuals |date=December 3, 1967 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref>

[[Gary Bauer]], head of the [[social conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] [[Family Research Council]], predicted the issue would be "a major battleground in the 1990s".<ref name=gutis /> In 1991, Georgia Attorney General [[Mike Bowers|Michael J.

In ''[[Baehr v. Miike]]'' (1993), the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] ruled that the state must show a compelling interest in prohibiting same-sex marriage.<ref>The case was originally ''Baehr v.

The [[House Judiciary Committee]]'s 1996 Report called for DOMA as a response to ''Baehr'', because "a redefinition of marriage in Hawaii to include homosexual couples could make such couples eligible for a whole range of federal rights and benefits".<ref>{{cite web |author=United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-104hrpt664/pdf/CRPT-104hrpt664.pdf |title=Report 104-664: Defense of Marriage Act |date=July 9, 1996 |pages=4–11 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

==Enactment and role of President Clinton==
Georgia Representative [[Bob Barr]], then a Republican, authored the Defense of Marriage Act and introduced it in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on May 7, 1996. Senator [[Don Nickles]], (R) Oklahoma, introduced the bill in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref name=nytdunlap>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/09/us/congressional-bills-withhold-sanction-of-same-sex-unions.html |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |title=Congressional Bills Withhold Sanction of Same-Sex Unions |date=May 9, 1996 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref> The [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] stated that the Act was intended by Congress to "reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality".<ref name="judiciary">{{cite web |publisher=Yahoo!

Nickles said, "If some state wishes to recognize same-sex marriage, they can do so". He said the bill would ensure that "the 49 other states don't have to and the Federal Government does not have to."<ref name=nytdunlap /> In opposition to the bill, Colorado Rep. [[Patricia Schroeder]] said, "You can't amend the Constitution with a statute. Everybody knows that. This is just stirring the political waters and seeing what hate you can unleash."<ref name=nytdunlap /> Barr countered that the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] of the Constitution grants Congress power to determine "the effect" of the obligation of each state to grant "full faith and credit" to other states' acts.<ref name=nytdunlap />

The 1996 Republican Party platform endorsed DOMA, referencing only Section 2 of the act: "We reject the distortion of [anti-discrimination] laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25848 |title=Republican Party Platform of 1996 |date=August 12, 1996 |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> The Democratic Party platform that year did not mention DOMA or same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29611 |title=Democratic Party Platform of 1996 |date=August 26, 1996 |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> In a June 1996 interview in the gay and lesbian magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Clinton said, "I remain opposed to same-sex marriage.

The bill moved through Congress on a legislative fast track and met with overwhelming approval in both houses of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]-controlled Congress.  On July 12, 1996, with only 65 Democrats and then Rep. [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT) and Rep.

In 2013, [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]], the White House press secretary at the time, recalled that Clinton's "posture was quite frankly driven by the political realities of an election year in 1996."<ref name=pppqvagay /> [[James Hormel]], who was appointed by Clinton as the first openly gay [[U.S. Ambassador]], described the reaction from the gay community to Clinton signing DOMA as shock and anger.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zccaNSshIsI "David Perry interviews Ambassador James C.

On August 13, 2009, during Netroots Nation, when confronted by LGBT activist Lane Hudson, Clinton explained that he had to sign DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment that would proscribe same-sex marriage: "We were attempting at the time, in a very reactionary Congress, to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states.  And if you look at the eleven referenda much later—in 2004, in the election—which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Bill Clinton's Justifications for Signing DOMA|url=http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/bill-clinton-doma-2012-3/|accessdate=October 28, 2015|magazine=New York Magazine|date=February 26, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Chris|title=Gay activists unhappy with Clinton remarks on DOMA|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/10/25/gay-activists-unhappy-with-clinton-remarks-on-doma/|accessdate=October 28, 2015|work=[[Washington Blade]] |date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>

In an op-ed written on March 7, 2013, for ''The Washington Post'', Clinton again suggested that DOMA was necessary in order to preclude, at that time, the passage of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and urged the Supreme Court, which would shortly hear arguments on ''[[United States v.

Clinton's explanation for signing DOMA has been disputed by gay rights activist Elizabeth Birch: "In 1996, I was President of the Human Rights Campaign, and there was no real threat of a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].  That battle would explode about eight years later, in 2004, when President Bush announced it was a central policy goal of his administration to pass such an amendment."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Birch|first1=Elizabeth|title=President Clinton is wrong about the history of DOMA|url=http://americablog.com/2013/03/president-clinton-wrong-history-doma.html|accessdate=October 28, 2015|publisher=AMERICAblog News|date=March 12, 2013}}</ref>

Evan Wolfson, who in 1996 ran the National Freedom to Marry Coalition, while an attorney at Lambda Legal, has also criticized the suggestion that DOMA was stopping something worse: "That's complete nonsense.  There was no conversation about something 'worse' until eight years later.  There was no talk of a constitutional amendment, and no one even thought it was possible—and, of course, it turned out it wasn't really possible to happen.  So, the idea that people were swallowing DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment is really just historic revisionism and not true.  That was never an argument made in the '90s."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Geidner|first1=Chris|title=Becoming Law|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2011/09/becoming-law/|accessdate=October 28, 2015|work=Metro Weekly|date=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

However, political discussion of the possibility of using a constitutional amendment to restrict marriage rights was not unheard of in the 1990s. In January 1996, for example, the House Judiciary Committee for the state of Hawaii voted 12–1 in favor of passing bill HB 117, which was aimed at amending the constitution of Hawaii to define marriage as involving one man and one woman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_mar5c.htm#con_amen|title=Same-sex marriages in Hawaii - 1997: Legislative activity|accessdate=Dec 26, 2015 |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org}}</ref> In 1998, the first anti-same-sex marriage amendment was added to the constitution of a U.S. state,<ref name="relig-tol-alaska">"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_mar9.htm Homosexual (same-sex) marriage in Alaska]".

Accessed 2015-DEC-26.</ref> though it was not until 2002 that a federal marriage amendment was first introduced in the U.S. Congress.

==Impact==
The [[General Accounting Office]] issued a report in 1997 identifying "1,049 federal statutory provisions classified to the United States Code in which benefits, rights, and privileges are contingent on marital status or in which marital status is a factor".<ref name=gao1997>{{cite web |publisher=General Accounting Office |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/223674.pdf |title=OGC-97-16: Defense of Marriage Act |date=January 31, 1997 |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref> In updating its report in 2004, the GAO found that this number had risen to 1,138 as of December 31, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=General Accounting Office |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf |title=GAO-04-353R Defense of Marriage Act: Update to Prior Report |date=January 23, 2004 |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref> With respect to Social Security, housing, and food stamps, the GAO found that "recognition of the marital relationship is integral to the design of the program[s]." The report also noted several other major program categories that were affected—veterans' benefits, including pensions and survivor benefits; taxes on income, estates, gifts, and property sales; and benefits due federal employees, both civilian and military—and identified specifics such as the rights of the surviving spouse of a creator of copyrighted work and the financial disclosure requirements of spouses of Congress members and certain officers of the federal government. Education loan programs and agriculture price support and loan programs also implicate spouses. Financial aid to "family farms" for example, is restricted to those in which "a majority interest is held by individuals related by marriage or blood."<ref name=gao1997 />

Because the federal [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) controls most employee benefits provided by private employers, DOMA removed some tax breaks for employers and employees in the private sector when it comes to health care, pension, and disability benefits to same-sex spouses on an equal footing with opposite-sex spouses. ERISA does not affect employees of state and local government or churches, nor does it extend to such benefits as employee leave and vacation.<ref>{{cite journal |publisher=America Bar Association |url=http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/youraba/201112article07.html |title=Providing benefits to same-sex spouses of employees: Legal issues, best practices |journal=ABA Journal |issue=December 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

Under DOMA, persons in same-sex marriages were not considered married for immigration purposes. U.S. citizens and permanent residents in same-sex marriages could not petition for their spouses, nor could they be accompanied by their spouses into the U.S. on the basis of a family or employment-based visa. A non-citizen in such a marriage could not use it as the basis for obtaining a waiver or relief from removal from the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Immigration Policy Center |url=http://immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/immigration-and-defense-marriage-act-doma-qa-fact-check |title=Immigration and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA): A Q&A Fact Check |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

Following the end of the U.S. military's ban on service by open gays and lesbians, "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]," in September 2011, Admiral [[Mike Mullen]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], noted that DOMA limited the military's ability to extend the same benefits to military personnel in same-sex marriages as their peers in opposite-sex marriages received, notably health benefits.<ref>{{cite web |work=Daily Courier-Observer |url=http://www.mpcourier.com/article/20110921/DCO01/309219962/0/dco01 |first=Marc |last=Heller |title=Gillibrand Urges Equal Benefits |date=September 21, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref> Same-sex spouses of military personnel were denied the same access to military bases, legal counseling, and housing allowances provided to different-sex spouses.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/us/17military.html |first=James |last=Dao |title=Same-Sex Marriage Faces Military Limits |date=July 16, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Political debate==
The 2000 Republican Party platform endorsed DOMA in general terms and indicated concern about [[judicial activism]]: "We support the traditional definition of 'marriage' as the legal union of one man and one woman, and we believe that federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25849 |title=Democratic Party Platform of 2000 |date=July 31, 2000 |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> The Democratic Party platform that year did not mention DOMA or marriage in this context.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29612 |title=Democratic Party Platform of 1996 |date=August 14, 2000 |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

===Bush administration===
In 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] endorsed a [[Federal Marriage Amendment|proposed constitutional amendment to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples]] because he found DOMA to be vulnerable: "After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization. Their actions have created confusion on an issue that requires clarity."<ref>{{cite news |publisher=CNN |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-02-24/politics/elec04.prez.bush.marriage_1_single-state-or-city-marriage-rights-marriage-licenses |title=Bush calls for ban on same-sex marriages |date=February 25, 2004 |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> In January 2005, however, he said he would not lobby on its behalf, since too many U.S. senators thought DOMA would survive a constitutional challenge.<ref>{{cite web |work=Orlando Sentinel |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-01-17/news/0501170143_1_same-sex-marriage-marriage-act-defense-of-marriage |first=Leslie |last=Hoffecker |title=Bush Won't Lobby For Amendment |date=January 17, 2005 |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>

On February 23, 2011, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] released a statement regarding lawsuits challenging DOMA Section 3. He wrote:<ref name=holder/>

<blockquote>After careful consideration, including a review of my recommendation, the President has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The President has also concluded that Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional. Given that conclusion, the President has instructed the Department not to defend the statute in such cases.</blockquote>

He also announced that although it was no longer defending Section 3 in court, the administration intended to continue to enforce the law "unless and until Congress repeals Section 3 or the judicial branch renders a definitive verdict against the law's constitutionality."<ref name=holder/>

In a separate letter to [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[John Boehner]], Holder noted that Congress could participate in these lawsuits.<ref name=HolderLetter>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/letter-attorney-general-congress-litigation-involving-defense-marriage-act  |title=Letter from the Attorney General to Congress on Litigation Involving the Defense of Marriage Act|date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}</ref>

On February 24, the Department of Justice notified the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]] that it would "cease to defend" ''[[Gill v.

In June 2012, filing an [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] in ''Golinski'', two former Republican Attorneys General, [[Edwin Meese]] and [[John Ashcroft]], called the DOJ's decision not to defend DOMA Section 3 "an unprecedented and ill-advised departure from over two centuries of Executive Branch practice" and "an extreme and unprecedented deviation from the historical norm".<ref>{{cite web|work=Metro Weekly |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/06/former-ags-meese-ashcroft-call.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=Former AGs Meese, Ashcroft Call Obama Move on DOMA 'Extreme' in Appeals Court Filing |date=June 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617190007/http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/06/former-ags-meese-ashcroft-call.html |archivedate=June 17, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Following Holder's announcement that the Obama Administration would no longer defend DOMA Section 3 in court, on March 16, 2011, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] introduced the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate again<ref>{{USBill|112|S.|598}}</ref> and Nadler introduced it in the House.<ref>{{USBill|112|H.R.|1116}}</ref> The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10–8 in favor of advancing the bill to the Senate floor, but observers believed it would not gain the 60 votes needed to end debate and bring it to a vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Senate panel OKs repeal of Defense of Marriage Act |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |date=November 10, 2011 |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-11-10/democrats-gay-marriage/51152184/1}}</ref>

==Challenges to Section 3 in Federal court==
Numerous plaintiffs have challenged DOMA. Prior to 2009, all federal courts upheld DOMA in its entirety.

Later cases focused on Section 3's definition of marriage. The courts, using different standards, have all found Section 3 unconstitutional. Requests for the Supreme Court to hear appeals were filed in five cases, listed below (with Supreme Court docket numbers):
* ''[[Gill v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' ([https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-13.htm 12-13] as ''BLAG v. Gill'')
* ''[[Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services]]'' ([https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-15.htm 12-15] as ''Dept. of HHS v. Massachusetts'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-97.htm 12-97])
* ''[[Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' ([https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-16.htm 12-16] ''OPM v. Golinski'')
* ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'' ([https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-63.htm 12-63])
* ''[[Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' ([https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-231.htm 12-231])

===''Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management''===
''[[Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' was a challenge to Section 3 of DOMA in federal court based on a judicial employee's attempt to receive spousal health benefits for her partner. In 2008, Karen Golinski, a 19-year employee of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, applied for health benefits for her wife.
