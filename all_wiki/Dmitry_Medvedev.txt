Medvedev was [[2008 Russian presidential election|elected President in the 2008 election]]. He was regarded as more liberal than his predecessor, [[Vladimir Putin]], who was also appointed Prime Minister during Medvedev's presidency. Medvedev's top agenda as president was a wide-ranging [[Medvedev modernisation programme|modernisation programme]], aiming at modernising Russia's economy and society, and lessening the country's reliance on oil and gas. During Medvedev's tenure, the [[New START]] [[Nuclear disarmament|nuclear arms reduction]] treaty was signed by Russia and the United States, Russia emerged victorious in the [[Russo-Georgian War]], and recovered from the [[Great Recession]]. Medvedev also launched an [[Russian anti-corruption campaign|anti-corruption campaign]], despite having been accused of corruption himself. 

He served a single term in office and was succeeded by former President Vladimir Putin in [[2012 Russian presidential election|2012]]. Medvedev was then appointed by Putin as Prime Minister. [[Resignation of Russian government|He resigned as Prime Minister along with the rest of the government]] on 15 January 2020 to allow President Putin to make sweeping constitutional changes; he was succeeded by [[Mikhail Mishustin]] on 16 January 2020.

==Background==
===Early life===
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev baby photo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dmitry Medvedev in 1967, at approximately 2 years old]]
Dmitry Medvedev was born on 14 September 1965 in [[Leningrad]], in the Soviet Union. His father, Anatoly Afanasyevich Medvedev (November 1926&nbsp;– 2004), was a chemical engineer teaching at the [[Leningrad State Institute of Technology]].<ref>[http://www.viperson.ru/wind.php?ID=634&wpg=1900 Медведев Дмитрий Анатольевич] Viperson.ru</ref><ref>[http://eg.ru/daily/politics/10229/ Потомок пахарей и хлеборобов] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093858/http://www.eg.ru/daily/politics/10229/ |date=12 March 2009}} ''Ekspress Gazeta'' 4 April 2008</ref>  Dmitry's mother, Yulia Veniaminovna Medvedeva (née Shaposhnikova, born 21 November 1939),<ref name="Rost">{{cite web |url=http://www.rost.ru/official/2008/01/240000_12571.shtml |title=Transcript interview, First Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev |accessdate=26 July 2008 |date=24 January 2008 |publisher=Government of the Russian Federation |language=ru |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130706094524/http://www.rost.ru/official/2008/01/240000_12571.shtml |archive-date=6 July 2013}}</ref> studied languages at [[Voronezh University]] and taught Russian at [[Herzen State Pedagogical University]].  Later, she would also work as a tour guide at [[Pavlovsk Palace]]. The Medvedevs lived in a 40 m² apartment at 6 Bela Kun Street in the Kupchino Municipal Okrug (district) of Leningrad.<ref name="kremlinbio">{{cite web |url=http://eng.medvedev.kremlin.ru/biography |title=Dmitry Medvedev: Biography |publisher=Kremlin.ru |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325135428/http://eng.medvedev.kremlin.ru/biography |archive-date=25 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="treisman">{{cite book |title=The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev |last=Treisman |first=Daniel |publisher=Free Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4165-6071-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/returnrussiasjou0000trei/page/123 123–163] |url=https://archive.org/details/returnrussiasjou0000trei/page/123}}</ref> Dmitry was his parents' only child. The Medvedevs were regarded at the time as a Soviet [[intelligentsia]] family.<ref name="treisman"/>  His maternal grandparents were Ukrainians whose surname was Kovalev, originally [[Koval (surname)|Koval]]. Medvedev traces his family roots to the [[Belgorod Oblast|Belgorod]] region.<ref name="ukrt">{{cite web |title=Ukrainian media interviews President Medvedev |url=http://rt.com/Politics/2010-05-16/medvedev-ukraine-relations-interview.html |publisher=Russia Today |accessdate=16 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518191906/http://rt.com/Politics/2010-05-16/medvedev-ukraine-relations-interview.html |archive-date=18 May 2010}}</ref>

As a child, Medvedev was intellectually curious, described by his first grade teacher Vera Smirnova as a "dreadful why-asker". After school, he would spend some time playing with his friends before hurrying home to work on his assignments.  In the third grade, Medvedev studied the ten-volume ''[[Small Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' belonging to his father.<ref name="treisman"/> In the second and third grades, he showed interest in [[dinosaur]]s and memorised primary Earth's [[Geological history of Earth|geologic development periods]], from the Archean up to the Cenozoic. In the fourth and fifth grades he demonstrated interest in chemistry, conducting elementary experiments. He was involved to some degree with sport. In grade seven, his adolescent curiosity blossomed through his relationship with [[Svetlana Medvedeva|Svetlana Linnik]], his future wife, who was studying at the same school in a parallel class.<ref name="treisman"/> This apparently affected Medvedev's school performance. He calls the school's final exams in 1982 a "tough period when I had to mobilize my abilities to the utmost for the first time in my life."<ref name="kremlinbio"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Andreyev |first=Sergey |title=Почему Медведев? |url=http://www.planputina2012.ru/2010/10/04/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%83-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811054958/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Experts%27+Panel&articleid=a1244223567 |archive-date=11 August 2010}}</ref>

===Student years and academic career===
[[File:Jurfak SPb.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Faculty of Law, Saint Petersburg State University|Faculty of Law]] building of [[Saint Petersburg State University]], the place where Medvedev studied and later taught.]]
In the autumn of 1982, 17-year-old Medvedev enrolled at [[Leningrad State University]] to study law. Although he also considered studying [[linguistics]], Medvedev later said he never regretted his choice, finding his chosen subject increasingly fascinating, stating that he was lucky "to have chosen a field that genuinely interested him and that it was really 'his thing'".<ref name="kremlinbio"/><ref name="treisman"/> Fellow students described Medvedev as a correct and diplomatic person who in debates presented his arguments firmly, without offending.<ref name="treisman"/>

During his student years, Medvedev was a fan of the English rock bands [[Black Sabbath]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Deep Purple]], fond of sports and participated in athletic competitions in [[rowing (sports)|rowing]] and [[olympic weight-lifting|weight-lifting]].<ref name="rt_who"/>

He graduated from the Law Department of Leningrad State University in 1987 (together with Ilya Yeliseyev, [[Anton Alexandrovich Ivanov|Anton Ivanov]], [[Nikolay Vinnichenko]] and [[Konstantin Chuychenko]], who later became associates). After graduating, Medvedev considered joining the prosecutor's office to become an investigator however, he took an opportunity to pursue graduate studies as the civil law chair, deciding to accept three budget-funded post-graduate students to work at the chair itself.<ref name="kremlinbio"/>

In 1990, Medvedev defended his dissertation titled, "Problems of Realisation of Civil Juridical Personality of State Enterprise" and received his [[Kandidat nauk|Candidate of Sciences]] degree in [[private law]].<ref name="rt_who">{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/who-is-dmitry-medvedev-2008-03-04/|title=Who is Dmitry Medvedev?|publisher=Russia Today|date=4 March 2008}}</ref>

[[Anatoly Sobchak]], a major democratic [[politician]] of the 1980s and 1990s was one of Medvedev's professors at the university. In 1988, Medvedev joined Sobchak's team of democrats and served as the de facto head of Sobchak's successful [[political campaign|campaign]] for a seat in the new Soviet [[parliament]], the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] of the USSR.<ref>{{cite news|last=Umland|first=Andreas|title=The Democratic Roots of Putin's Choice|newspaper=Washington Post |date=11 December 2007|url=https://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/10/AR2007121001560.html|accessdate=10 May 2008}}</ref>

After Sobchak's election campaign Medvedev continued his academic career in the position of [[docent]] at his alma mater, now renamed [[Saint Petersburg State University]].<ref>Levy, Clifford J.; p. A18</ref> He taught civil and Roman law until 1999. According to one student, Medvedev was a popular [[teacher]]; "strict but not harsh". During his tenure Medvedev co-wrote a popular three-volume civil law textbook which over the years has sold a million copies.<ref name="treisman"/> Medvedev also worked at a small law consultancy firm which he had founded with his friends Anton Ivanov and Ilya Yeliseyev, to supplement his academic salary.<ref name="treisman"/>

==Early career==
===Career in St Petersburg===
[[File:Вход в Смольный.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of the [[Smolny Institute]], meeting place of the City Hall's Committee for Foreign Affairs where Medvedev worked as a consultant.]]
In 1990, [[Anatoly Sobchak]] returned from Moscow to become Chairman of the Leningrad [[City council|City Council]]. Sobchak hired Medvedev who had previously headed his election campaign. One of Sobchak's former students, [[Vladimir Putin]], came on board as an adviser. The next summer Sobchak was elected Mayor of the city, and Medvedev became a consultant to City Hall's Committee for Foreign Affairs. It was headed by Putin.<ref name="kremlinbio"/><ref name="treisman"/>

In November 1993 Medvedev became the legal affairs director of Ilim Pulp Enterprise (ILP), a St. Petersburg-based [[lumber|timber]] [[company]]. Medvedev aided the company in developing a strategy as the firm launched a significant expansion. Medvedev received 20% of the company's stock. In the next seven years Ilim Pulp Enterprise became Russia's largest lumber company with an annual revenue of around $500&nbsp;million. Medvedev sold his shares in ILP in 1999. He then took his first job at the central government of Russia. The profits realised by Medvedev are unknown.<ref name="treisman"/>

===Career in the central government===
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Dmitry Medvedev-3.jpg|thumb|right|Medvedev with Vladimir Putin on 27 March 2000, a day after Putin's victory in the presidential election.]]
In June 1996, Medvedev's colleague Vladimir Putin was brought into the [[Russian presidential administration]]. Three years later, on 16 August 1999, he became [[Prime Minister of Russia]]. Three months later, in November 1999, Medvedev became one of several from St. Petersburg brought in by Vladimir Putin to top government positions in Moscow. On 31 December he was appointed deputy [[Presidential Administration of Russia|head of the presidential staff]], becoming one of the politicians closest to President Putin. During the [[2000 Russian presidential election|2000 Presidential elections]] he was Putin's [[campaign manager]]. Putin won the election with 52.94% of the popular vote. Medvedev was quoted after the election commenting he thoroughly enjoyed the work and the responsibility calling it "a test of strength".<ref name="treisman"/>

As President, Putin launched a campaign against corrupt [[Russian oligarch|oligarchs]] and economic mismanagement. He appointed Medvedev Chairman of gas company [[Gazprom]]'s board of directors in 2000 with [[Alexei Miller]]. Medvedev put an end to the large-scale tax evasion and asset stripping by the previous corrupt management.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Goldmann|first=Marshall|title=Petrostate: Putin, Power and the New Russia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/petrostateputinp00gold/page/141 141–142]|isbn=978-0-19-534073-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/petrostateputinp00gold/page/141}}</ref> Medvedev then served as deputy chair from 2001 to 2002, becoming chair for the second time in June 2002,<ref name="kremlinbio"/> a position which he held until his ascension to Presidency in 2008.<ref name="nyt_replaces">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/business/worldbusiness/27iht-27gaz.14046892.html|title=Zubkov replaces Medvedev as Gazprom chairman|work=The New York Times|date=27 June 2008}}</ref> During Medvedev's tenure, Gazprom's debts were restructured<ref name="willerton2"/> and the company's market capitalisation grew from $7.8&nbsp;billion<ref name="gazprom_cap">{{cite web|url=http://www.gazprom.com/investors/stock/|title=Shares|publisher=Gazprom}}</ref> in 2000 to $300&nbsp;billion in early 2008.

In October 2003 Medvedev replaced [[Alexander Voloshin]] as presidential chief of [[Russian presidential administration|staff]]. In November 2005 Medvedev moved from the presidential administration of the government when Putin appointed him as the First [[Deputy Prime Minister]] of Russia. In particular Medvedev was made responsible for the implementation of the [[Priority national projects of Russia|National Priority Projects]] focusing on improving [[public health]], [[Education in Russia|education]], [[housing]] and [[agriculture in Russia|agriculture]]. The program achieved some major results such as increase of wages in healthcare and education and construction of new apartments but its funding, 4% of the federal budget, was not enough to significantly overhaul Russia's infrastructure. According to opinion polls most Russians believed the money invested in the projects had been spent ineffectively.<ref name="treisman"/>

===Presidential candidate===
[[File:Vladimir Putin 11 March 2008-1.jpg|thumb|left|Medvedev with Vladimir Putin]]
Following his appointment as First Deputy Prime Minister, many political observers began to regard Medvedev as a potential candidate for the 2008 presidential elections,<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/01/19EAFDE9-0C0D-43BC-99A5-BBD88912B086.html Russia: President's Potential Successor Debuts At Davos]. 31 January 2007.</ref> although Western observers widely believed Medvedev was too liberal and too pro-Western for Putin to endorse him as a candidate. Instead, Western observers expected the candidate to arise from the ranks of the so-called [[siloviki]], security and military officials many of whom were appointed to high positions during Putin's presidency.<ref name="treisman"/> The silovik [[Sergei Ivanov]] and the administrator-specialist [[Viktor Zubkov]] were seen as the strongest candidates.<ref name="lenta20071210"/> In opinion polls which asked Russians to pick their favourite successor to Putin from a list of candidates not containing Putin himself, Medvedev often came out first, beating Ivanov and Zubkov as well as the opposition candidates.<ref name="treisman2">{{cite book|title=The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|publisher=Free Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4165-6071-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/returnrussiasjou0000trei/page/240 240–261]|url=https://archive.org/details/returnrussiasjou0000trei/page/240}}</ref> In November 2006, Medvedev's trust rating was 17%, more than double than that of Ivanov. Medvedev's [[popularity]] was probably boosted by his high-profile role in the [[National Priority Projects]].<ref name="sakwa_crisis">{{cite book|title=The Crisis of Russian Democracy: Dual State, Factionalism and the Medvedev Succession|last=Sakwa|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14522-0|year=2011}}</ref>

Many observers were surprised when on 10 December 2007, President Putin announced that Medvedev was his preferred successor. The announcement was staged on TV with four parties suggesting Medvedev's candidature to Putin, and Putin then giving his endorsement. The four pro-Kremlin parties were [[United Russia]], [[Fair Russia]], [[Agrarian Party of Russia]] and [[Civilian Power]].<ref name="lenta20071210">{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2007/12/10/medvedev/|script-title=ru:Дмитрий Медведев выдвинут в президенты России|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|language=ru|date=10 December 2007|accessdate=30 November 2008}}</ref> United Russia held its [[party congress]] on 17 December 2007 where by secret ballot of the delegates, Medvedev was officially endorsed as their candidate in the 2008 presidential election.<ref>[http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=12188392&PageNum=0 United Russia endorses D Medvedev as candidate for presidency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304134226/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=12188392&PageNum=0 |date=4 March 2008 }} ITAR-TASS, 17 December 2007.</ref> He formally registered his candidacy with the [[Central Election Commission of Russia|Central Election Commission]] on 20 December 2007 and said he would step down as chairman of Gazprom, since under the current laws, the president is not permitted to hold another post.<ref>[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100313033814/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aO3DYm6Qk.Nc Medvedev Registers for Russian Presidency, Will Leave Gazprom], Bloomberg, 20 December 2007.</ref> His [[Voter registration|registration]] was formally accepted as valid by the Russian Central Election Commission on 21 January 2008.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://cikrf.ru/postancik/Zp080688.jsp О регистрации Дмитрия Анатольевича Медведева кандидатом на должность Президента Российской Федерации] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305020714/http://cikrf.ru/postancik/Zp080688.jsp |date=5 March 2008 }}, Decision No. 88/688-5 of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, 21 January 2008.</ref> Describing his reasons for endorsing Medvedev, Putin said:

In December 2007, in preparation for his election campaign, Medvedev announced that funding of the [[National Priority Projects]] would be raised by 260&nbsp;billion rubles for 2008. Medvedev's election campaign was relatively low-key and, like his predecessor, Medvedev refused to take part in televised debates, citing his high workload as first deputy prime minister as the reason. Instead, Medvedev preferred to present his views on his election website [http://www.medvedev2008.ru Medvedev2008.ru].<ref>Sakwa 2011, pp.282–283</ref>

In January 2008, Medvedev launched his campaign with stops in the [[oblast]]s.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080117/wl_nm/russia_medvedev_dc_1 Putin's successor dismisses fears of state "grab"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121223751/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080117/wl_nm/russia_medvedev_dc_1 |date=21 January 2008 }}, Reuters, 17 January 2008.</ref> On 22 January 2008, Medvedev held what was effectively his first campaign speech at Russia's second Civic Forum, advocating a [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] agenda for modernising Russia. Medvedev argued that Russia needed "decades of stable development" because the country had "exhausted its share of revolutions and social upheavals back in the twentieth century". Medvedev therefore emphasised liberal [[modernisation]] while still aiming to continue his predecessor's [[Political agenda|agenda]] of stabilisation.<ref name="krasnoyarsk_speech">Sakwa 2011, p.287</ref> On 15 February 2008, Medvedev held a keynote [[speech]] at the Fifth [[Krasnoyarsk]] Economic Forum, saying that:

{{quote|Freedom is better than non-freedom&nbsp;– this principle should be at the core of our politics. I mean freedom in all its manifestations&nbsp;– personal freedom, economic freedom and, finally, freedom of expression.<ref name="krasnoyarsk_speech"/>}}

In the Krasnoyarsk speech, Medvedev harshly condemned Russia's "[[legal nihilism]]" and highlighted the need to ensure independence of the country's juridical system and the need for an anti-corruption program. In economy, Medvedev advocated private property, economic deregulation and lower taxes. According to him, Russia's economy should be modernised by focusing on four "I"s: institutions, infrastructure, innovation and investment.<ref name="krasnoyarsk_speech"/><ref>[https://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/newstex/AFX-0013-23484976.htm Foreign investors expect reforms from Russia's Medvedev]  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Flintoff |first=Corey |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87809345 |title=Focus Shifts to How Medvedev Will Run Russia |publisher=NPR |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref>

===Election victory===
[[File:Vladimir Putin 2 March 2008-2.jpg|Medvedev with Putin on election day on 2 March 2008|thumb]]
Medvedev was elected [[President of Russia]] on 2 March 2008. The final election results gave him 70.28% (52,530,712) of votes with a turnout of 69.78% of registered voters. The main contenders, [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]] received 17.72% and 9.35% respectively. Three-quarters of Medvedev's vote was Putin's electorate. According to surveys, had Putin and Medvedev both run for president in the same elections, Medvedev would have received 9% of the vote.<ref>Sakwa 2011, pp.284–275</ref>

The [[2008 Fairness of Russian presidential election|fairness of the election]] was disputed by observers and officials worldwide. Andreas Gross, head of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) mission, stated that the elections were "neither free nor fair". Moreover, the few western vote monitors bemoaned the inequality of candidate registration and the abuse of administrative resources by Medvedev allowing blanket television coverage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3164312,00.html|title=Europe Offers Congratulations and Criticism to Medvedev|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref> Russian programmer Shpilkin analysed the results of Medvedev's election and came to the conclusion that the results were falsified by the election committees.

On 8 May 2008, Dmitry Medvedev appointed Vladimir Putin [[Prime Minister of Russia]] as he had promised during his election campaign. The nomination was approved by the State Duma with a clear majority of 392–56, with only [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|communist]] deputies voting against.<ref name="willerton2"/>

==="Tandem rule"===
{{main|Tandemocracy}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin-1.jpg|thumb|right|Medvedev with Putin in 2008]]
From the beginning of Medvedev's tenure, [[Figurehead|the nature of his Presidency]] and his relationship with [[Vladimir Putin]] was subject to considerable media speculation. In a unique situation in the Russian Federation's political history, the constitutionally powerful President was now flanked with a highly influential Prime Minister (Putin), who also remained the country's most popular politician. Previous Prime Ministers had proven to be almost completely subordinate to the President and none of them had enjoyed strong public approval, with [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and Putin's previous tenure (1999–2000) as Prime Minister under [[Boris Yeltsin]] being the only exceptions.<ref name="willerton2"/> Journalists quickly dubbed the new system with a practically dual-headed executive as "government by tandem" or "tandemocracy", with Medvedev and Putin called the "ruling tandem".<ref name="treisman"/>

Daniel Treisman has argued that early in Medvedev's presidency, Putin seemed ready to disengage and started withdrawing to the background. In the first year of Medvedev's presidency, two external events threatening Russia—the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] and the [[2008 South Ossetia war]]—changed Putin's plans and caused him to resume a stronger role in Russian politics.<ref name="treisman"/>

===Main external events===

====2008 South Ossetia war====
{{main|2008 South Ossetia war}}

[[File:Decree recognising South Ossetia independence.png|thumb|right|Presidential decree recognising [[South Ossetia]]'s independence, signed by Medvedev on 26 August 2008]]
The long-lingering [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict|conflict]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the separatist regions of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]], which were supported by Russia, escalated during the summer of 2008. In the night of 7–8 August, Georgia launched a military operation in South Ossetia with 10,000–11,000 soldiers and 75 tanks. Several Russian peacekeepers were killed in the fighting, and many South Ossetians who had Russian citizenship.<ref name="eu_report2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceiig.ch/pdf/IIFFMCG_Volume_II.pdf |title=EU report, volume II |date=30 September 2009 |publisher=Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia |accessdate=30 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706223037/http://www.ceiig.ch/pdf/IIFFMCG_Volume_II.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011  }}</ref><ref name="rapidreaction">{{cite web|url=http://www.iiss.org/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=20268&type=full&servicetype=Attachment |title=Russia's rapid reaction |last=Nicoll |first=Alexander |author2=Sarah Johnstone |date=September 2008 |publisher=International Institute for Strategic Studies |accessdate=9 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021133353/http://www.iiss.org/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=20268&type=full&servicetype=Attachment |archive-date=21 October 2008 }}</ref>

At the time of the attack, Medvedev was on vacation and Putin was attending the opening ceremony of the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JI06Ad01.html China still on-side with Russia] Asia Times, 6 September 2008</ref> At about 1:00 a.m on 8 August, Medvedev held a telephone conversation with the Defence Minister, [[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]. It is likely that during this conversation, Medvedev authorised the use of force against Georgia.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Tanks of August|publisher=Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies|year=2010|last1=Lavrov|first1=Anton|editor=Ruslan Pukhov|isbn=978-5-9902320-1-3|page=49}}</ref> The next day, Medvedev released a statement, in which he said:

{{quote|Last night, Georgian troops committed what amounts to an act of aggression against Russian peacekeepers and the civilian population in South Ossetia ... In accordance with the Constitution and the federal laws, as President of the Russian Federation it is my duty to protect the lives and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they may be. It is these circumstances that dictate the steps we will take now. We will not allow the deaths of our fellow citizens to go unpunished.

In the early hours of 8 August, Russian military forces launched a counter-offensive against Georgian troops. After five days of heavy fighting, all Georgian forces were routed from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. On 12 August, Medvedev announced an end to the Russian military operation, entitled "Operation to force Georgia into peace". Later on the same day, a peace deal brokered by the French and EU President, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], was signed between the warring parties. On 26 August, after being unanimously passed by the [[State Duma]], Medvedev signed a decree [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia]] as independent states. The five-day conflict cost the lives of 48 Russian soldiers, including 10 peacekeepers, while the casualties for Georgia was 170 soldiers and 14 policemen.<ref>Treisman, p.153</ref>

The Russian popular opinion of the military intervention was broadly positive, not just among the supporters of the government, but across the political spectrum.<ref name="treisman_p154">Treisman, p.154</ref> Medvedev's popularity ratings soared by around 10 percentage points to over 70%,<ref>Treisman, p.259</ref> due to what was seen as his effective handling of the war.<ref>Sakwa 2011, p.343</ref>

Shortly in the aftermath of the conflict, Medvedev formulated a 5-point strategy of the Russian foreign policy, which has become known as the [[Medvedev Doctrine]]. On 30 September 2009, the [[European Union]]–sponsored ''Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia'' stated that, while preceded by months of mutual provocations, "open hostilities began with a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8281990.stm |title=Georgia 'started unjustified war' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=30 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/eu-report-independent-experts-blame-georgia-for-south-ossetia-war-a-650228.html |title= EU Report: Independent Experts Blame Georgia for South Ossetia War |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=21 September 2009}}</ref>

====2008–09 economic crisis====
In September 2008, Russia was hit by repercussions of the [[Late 2000s recession|global financial crisis]]. Before this, Russian officials, such as the Finance Minister, [[Alexei Kudrin]], had said they believed Russia would be safe, due to its stable macroeconomic situation and substantial reserves accumulated during the years of growth. Despite this, the recession proved to be the worst in the history of Russia, and the country's GDP fell by over 8% in 2009.<ref name="challenges"/> The government's response was to use over a trillion rubles (more than $40 billion U.S. Dollars) to help troubled banks,<ref name="Treisman, p.149">Treisman, p.149</ref> and initiated a large-scale stimulus programme, lending $50 billion to struggling companies.<ref name="challenges">{{cite book|editor1=Anders Åslund |editor2=Sergei Guriev |editor3=Andrew C.

The economic situation stabilised in 2009, but substantial growth did not resume until 2010. Medvedev's approval ratings declined during the crisis, dropping from 83% in September 2008 to 68% in April 2009, before recovering to 72% in October 2009 following improvements in the economy.<ref name="levada_president">{{cite web|url=http://www.russiavotes.org/president/presidency_performance_trends.php#190|title=President's performance in office&nbsp;— Trends|publisher=Levada Center|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref name="time_of_turmoil">{{cite book|editor=Anders Åslund |editor2=Sergei Guriev |editor3=Andrew C.

According to some analysts, the economic crisis, together with the 2008 South Ossetia war, delayed Medvedev's liberal programme. Instead of launching the reforms, the government and the Presidency had to focus their efforts on anti-crisis measures and handling the foreign policy implications of the war.<ref>Treisman, p.155</ref><ref name="valdai_achievements">{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20110511/163967901.html|title=Dmitry Medvedev's three years in office: achievements, results and influence|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=11 May 2011}}</ref>

In November 2010, on his [[State of the Nation (Russia)|annual speech]] to the [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Federal Assembly]] Medvedev stressed for greater [[Privatization in Russia|privatisation]] of unneeded state assets both at the federal and regional level, and that Russia's regions must sell-off non-core assets to help fund post-crisis spending, following in the footsteps of the state's planned $32&nbsp;billion 3-year asset sales. Medvedev said the money from privatisation should be used to help modernise the economy and the regions should be rewarded for finding their own sources of cash.<ref>{{cite news | title=Russia tells regions to join privatization drive | agency=Reuters | date=2010 | first1=Denis | last1=Dyomkin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15731844&PageNum=0 |title=Privatization in regions to yield tens of billions of rbls-Kremlin |publisher=Itar-tass.com |accessdate=19 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

====Police reform====
{{main|Russian police reform}}
Medvedev made reforming Russia's law enforcement one of his top agendas, the reason for which was a shooting started by a police officer in April 2009 in one of Moscow's supermarkets. Medvedev initiated the reform at the end of 2009, with a presidential decree issued on 24 December ordering the government to start planning the reform. In early August 2010 a draft law was posted on the Internet at the address http://www.zakonoproekt2010.ru for public discussion. The website was popular, with more than 2,000 comments posted within 24 hours of its opening.<ref name="rp_panel_2010">{{cite web|url=http://russiaprofile.org/experts_panel/a1282921466.html|title=Russia Profile Weekly Experts Panel: Will Police Reform Result in Name Change Only?|publisher=Russia Profile|date=27 August 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711234527/http://russiaprofile.org/experts_panel/a1282921466.html|archive-date=11 July 2011}}</ref> Based on citizen feedback, several modifications to the draft were made.

In July 2008, Medvedev's ''National Anti-Corruption Plan'' was published in the official [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] newspaper. It suggested measures aimed at making sanctions for corruption more severe, such as legislation to disqualify state and municipal officials who commit minor corruption offences and making it obligatory for officials to report corruption.

====Development of the political system====
[[File:Siergiej Mironow.jpg|thumb|right|[[A Just Russia]]'s [[Sergey Mironov]] was very critical of the 2009 regional elections]]
Regional elections held on 1 March 2009 were followed by accusations of [[administrative resources]] being used in support of [[United Russia]] candidates, with the leader of [[A Just Russia]], [[Sergey Mironov]], being especially critical. Responding to this, Medvedev met with the Chairman of the [[Central Election Commission of Russia]], [[Vladimir Churov]], and called for moderation in the use of administrative resources.<ref name="sakwa_p327"/> In August 2009, Medvedev promised to break the near-dominant position of United Russia party in national and regional legislatures, stating that "New democratic times are beginning".<ref name="reuters2009">[http://ca.reuters.com/article/idCATRE59929320091012 Polls show Russians back crisis plan: Putin's party] Reuters, 12 October 2009</ref> The next regional elections were held on 11 October 2009 and won by United Russia with 66% of the vote. The elections were again harshly criticised for the use of [[administrative resources]] in favour of United Russia candidates. [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist]], [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|LDPR]] and [[A Just Russia]] parliamentary deputies staged an unprecedented walkout on 14–15 October 2009 as a result.<ref name="sakwa_p327">Sakwa 2011, p.327</ref> Professor [[Richard Sakwa]] has noted, that although Medvedev has often promised to stand up for more political pluralism, after the 2009 regional elections, a gulf had formed between Medvedev's words and the worsening situation, with the question arising "whether Medvedev had the desire or ability to renew Russia's political system."<ref name="sakwa_p327"/>

On 26 October 2009, the First Deputy Chief of [[Russian presidential administration|Staff]], [[Vladislav Surkov]], warned that democratic experiments could result in more instability and that more instability "could rip Russia apart".<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/51329/ Kremlin warns against wrecking Russia with democracy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030002100/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/51329/ |date=30 October 2009 }}, [[Kyiv Post]] (26 October 2009)</ref> On 6 November 2010, Medvedev vetoed a recently passed bill which restricted antigovernment demonstrations.

In late November 2010, Medvedev made a public statement about the damage being done to Russia's politics by the dominance of the United Russia party. He claimed that the country faced political stagnation if the ruling party would "degrade" if not challenged; "this stagnation is equally damaging to both the ruling party and the opposition forces." In the same speech, he said Russian democracy was "imperfect" but improving. [[BBC]] Russian correspondents reported that this came on the heels of discontent in political circles and opposition that the authorities, in their view, had too much control over the political process.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|author=Steve Rosenberg |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11828222 |title=Medvedev warns of political 'stagnation' in Russia |publisher=BBC |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>

On 30 October 2009, due to the [[Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repressions]], President Medvedev published a statement in his video blog. He stressed that the memory of national tragedies is as sacred as the memory of victory. Medvedev recalled that for twenty of the pre-war years entire layers and classes of the Russian people [[Genocide|were destroyed]] (this period includes the [[Red Terror]] mainly under the lead of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], the crimes of Joseph Stalin and other [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|evil deeds of the Soviet Bolsheviks]]).

====Election reform====
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Cyprus 7 October 2010-14.jpeg|thumb|[[News conference]] following Russian–Cypriot talks in [[Nicosia]], ]]
In 2009, Medvedev proposed an amendment to the election law which would decrease the [[State Duma]] [[election threshold]] from 7% to 5%. The amendment was [[signed into law]] in Spring 2009. Parties receiving more than 5% but less than 6% of the votes will now be guaranteed one seat, while parties receiving more than 6% but less than 7% will get two seats. These seats will be allocated before the seats for parties with over 7%&nbsp;support.<ref name="levada_election_law">{{cite web|url=http://www.russiavotes.org/duma/duma_election_law.php?S776173303132=732d47538b10f64be14861adc60c411e|title=How the Duma electoral system works|publisher=Levada Center}}</ref>

[[Elections in Russia|Russian election law]] stipulates that parties with representatives in the State Duma are free to put forward a list of candidates for the Duma elections, while parties with no current representation need first to collect signatures. Under the 2009 amendments initiated by Medvedev, the amount of signatures required was lowered from 200,000 to 150,000 for the [[2011 Russian legislative election|2011 Duma elections]].

===Relationship with Putin===
Although the Russian constitution clearly apportions the greater power in the state to the President, speculation arose over the question of whether it was Medvedev or Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] who actually wielded the most power.<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|last=Osborn |first=Andrew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7386448/Dmitry-Medvedevs-Russia-still-feels-the-cold-hand-of-Vladimir-Putin.html |title=''Dmitry Medvedev's Russia still feels the cold hand of Vladimir Putin'', Telegraph |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=7 March 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "Kremlin-watchers" note that Medvedev uses the [[T–V distinction|more formal form of 'you']] (Вы, 'vy') when addressing Putin, while Putin addresses Medvedev with the less formal 'ty' (ты).<ref name=Telegraph/>

According to a poll conducted in September 2009 by the [[Levada Center]] in which 1,600 Russians took part, 13% believed Medvedev held the most power, 32% believed Putin held the most power, 48% believed that the two shared equal levels of influence, and 7% failed to answer.<ref>[http://www.levada.ru/press/2009092804.html Poll: Medvedev and Putin: who holds the power?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616052841/http://www.levada.ru/press/2009092804.html |date=16 June 2011 }} [[Levada Center]] Retrieved on 12 March 2010</ref> However, Medvedev attempted to affirm his position by stating, "I am the leader of this state, I am the head of this state, and the division of power is based on this."<ref name="TVNZ_2595589">{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/medvedev-insists-hes-boss-2595589 |title=Medvedev insists he's the boss |date=30 March 2009 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919105652/http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/medvedev-insists-hes-boss-2595589 |archive-date=19 September 2011 }}</ref>

===2012 presidential elections===
As both Putin and Medvedev could have run for President in the [[2012 Russian presidential election|2012 general elections]], there was a view from some analysts that some of Medvedev's contemporaneous actions and comments at the time were designed to separate his image from Putin's: examples noted by the [[BBC]] included his dealings in late 2010 with NATO and the United States, possibly designed to show himself as being better able to deal with Western nations,<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia 'to work with Nato on missile defence shield' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11803931 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> and comments in November about the need for a stronger opposition in Russian politics, to present himself as a moderniser. The BBC also noted that other analysts believed the split to be exaggerated, that Medvedev and Putin were "trying to maximise support for the authorities by appealing to different parts of society".<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> There was belief that the court verdict on former oligarch [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and his partner [[Platon Lebedev]], both of whom funded opposition parties before their arrests, would indicate whether or not Putin was "still calling all the shots".<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia's most important court trial |first=Andrei |last=Ostalski |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11994591 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>

On 24 September 2011, while speaking at the United Russia party congress, Medvedev announced that he would recommend the party nominate Vladimir Putin as its presidential candidate and that the two men had long ago cut a deal to allow Mr. Putin to return to the presidency in 2012 after he was forced to stand down in 2008 by term limits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vladimir Putin on course to be Russia's next president as Dmitry Medvedev steps aside |first=Andrew |last=Osborn |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8786314/Vladimir-Putin-on-course-to-be-Russias-next-president-as-Dmitry-Medvedev-steps-aside.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> This switch was termed by many in the media as "rokirovka", the Russian term for the chess move "[[castling]]".

On 22 December 2011, in his last state of the nation address in Moscow, Medvedev called for comprehensive reform of [[Politics of Russia|Russia's political system]] — including restoring the election of regional governors and allowing half the seats in the State Duma to be directly elected in the regions. "I want to say that I hear those who talk about the need for change, and understand them", Medvedev said in an address to the Duma. "We need to give all active citizens the legal chance to participate in political life." However, the opposition to the ruling United Russia party of Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin dismissed the proposals as political posturing that failed to adequately address protesters who claimed 4 December election was rigged.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russia's Medvedev tries to appease protesters |url=https://news.yahoo.com/russias-medvedev-says-backs-political-reform-084520020.html |accessdate=22 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112232907/http://news.yahoo.com/russias-medvedev-says-backs-political-reform-084520020.html |archive-date=12 January 2012 }}</ref>
On 7 May, on his last day in office, Medvedev signed the last documents as the head of state: in the sphere of [[civil society]], protection of [[human rights]] and modernisation. He approved the list of instructions by the results of the meeting with the Presidential council on Civil Society and Human Rights, which was held on 28 April.

In March 2017, [[2017–2018 Russian protests|discontentment]] was triggered through Medvedev's depiction in an investigative film by the [[Anti-Corruption Foundation]] titled ''He Is Not Dimon to You''.

On the [[Russian-language Internet]], Medvedev is sometimes associated with the ''[[Preved|Medved]]'' meme, linked to ''[[padonki]]'' slang, which resulted in many ironic and satirical writings and [[Photoshop contest|cartoons]] that blend Medvedev with a bear.

Medvedev is familiar with this phenomenon and takes no offence, stating that the [[web meme]] has the right to exist.<ref>[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/11/02/001.html A Soft-Spoken, 'Smart-Kid' Lawyer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122080505/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/11/02/001.html |date=22 November 2008 }}, The Moscow Times, 2 November 2007.</ref><ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://lenta.ru/news/2007/03/05/medved/ Дмитрий Медведев: учите олбанский!], Lenta.ru, 5 March 2007.</ref><ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.polit.ru/event/2007/12/10/medvedev1.html Превед, Медвед], Polit.ru, 18 December 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/759f1b8e-a789-11dc-a25a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 Medvedev palatable to Russian liberals and western states], Financial Times, 11 December 2007.</ref>

Medvedev initiated a few anti-corruption laws in Russia,{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} and has been a vocal corruption opponent in Russia who often pointed to corruption as one of the main challenges of Russia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBrs0dVeS44|title= Medvedev: Poverty and corruption are Russia's challenges |publisher= Russia Today on youtube.com |accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref>

In September 2016, [[Alexei Navalny]] published a report with information about Dmitry Medvedev's alleged summer residence ("[[dacha]]") – an 80 hectare estate with plethora of houses, a ski run, a cascading swimming pool, three helipads and purpose-built communications towers. The estate even includes a house for ducks, which received public ridicule and led to ducks becoming a protest symbol in Russia a year later.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-28/the-yellow-rubber-duck-is-a-potent-protest-symbol |title= The Yellow Rubber Duck Is a Potent Protest Symbol |publisher= Bloomberg |accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref> The area is surrounded by a six-foot (1.82 meter) fence and is allegedly 30 times the size of [[Red Square]], the iconic square in Moscow.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/medvedev-forgets-cares-of-office-at-a-350m-estate-on-the-volga-9xnczxt38 |title= Medvedev forgets cares of office at £350m estate on the Volga |publisher= The Times UK |accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref> This summer residence is an expensively renovated 18th century manor called {{ill|Milovka Estate|ru|Миловка (усадьба)|vertical-align=sup}} and located in [[Plyos, Ivanovo Oblast|Plyos]] on the shore of [[Volga River]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/e83878a6-e249-11e2-a7fa-00144feabdc0 |title= The dacha of my dreams|publisher= Finantial Times |accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref>

In March 2017, Navalny and the [[Anti-corruption Foundation]] published another in-depth investigation of properties and residences used by Medvedev and his family. A report called ''[[He Is Not Dimon To You]]'' shows how Medvedev allegedly owns and controls large areas of land, villas, palaces, yachts, expensive apartments, wineries and estates through complicated ownership structures involving shell companies and foundations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2017/03/03/ny-anklagelse-fran-aleksej-navalnyj-premiarminister-medvedev-inblandad-i|title= Ny anklagelse från Aleksej Navalnyj: "Premiärminister Medvedev inblandad i korruption"|publisher= Yle Nyheter|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=sv}}</ref> Their total value is estimated at around 1.2 billion USD. The report states that the original source of wealth is gifts by Russian oligarchs and loans from state owned banks. [[Don't call him Dimon|An hour long YouTube video in Russian]] was released together with the report. A month after release, the video had more than 24 million views.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g |script-title=ru:Он вам не Димон |publisher= [[Alexei Navalny]] on YouTube|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=ru}}</ref> Medvedev dismissed the allegations, calling them "nonsense".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39490293 |title=Corruption claims 'nonsense' – Russian PM Medvedev}}</ref> These revelations have resulted in [[2017 Russian protests|large protests]] throughout Russia.

On 23 June 2011, Medvedev participated in launching of the "Eternal Values" project of [[RIA Novosti]] state-operated news agency together with Russian chapter of [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. RIA Novosti granted free [[Creative Commons]] licences to one hundred of its images, while Medvedev registered as [[:Commons:User:Dmitry Medvedev for RIAN|Dmitry Medvedev for RIAN]] and personally uploaded one of those photographs to [[Wikimedia Commons]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rian.ru/news_company/20110623/391887496.html | title=Медведев запустил проект, открывающий доступ к фотоархиву РИА Новости | date=23 June 2011 | agency=[[RIA Novosti]] | accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti_celebrates_70th_anniversary_and_gifts_images_to_Wikimedia | title=RIA Novosti celebrates 70th anniversary, uploads 100 images to Wikimedia Commons | date=23 June 2011 | agency=[[WikiNews]] | accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>
