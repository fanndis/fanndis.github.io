During the early 1980s, British artists such as [[Gary Numan]], [[the Human League]], [[Soft Cell]], [[John Foxx]] and [[Visage (band)|Visage]] helped pioneer a new synth-pop style that drew more heavily from electronic music and emphasized primary usage of synthesizers,{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|pp= 296-308}} while the [[electro music|electro]] style was largely developed by [[Afrika Bambaataa]], who was heavily influenced by [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] and [[Kraftwerk]], and in turn influenced the 1980s [[pop music|pop-music]] style of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name="wire_1996">{{citation|title= A-Z Of Electro|work= [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue= 145|date= March 1996|author= David Toop|url= http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/|accessdate= 2011-05-29}}</ref>

{{Quote| Some fascinating new music began arriving on these shores; it was dubbed electropop, because electronic instrumentation — mainly synthesizers and syndrums — was used to craft pop songs. "[[Pop Muzik]]" by [[M (band)|M]] was one of the first. There was a gradual accumulation of worthy electropop discs, though they were still mostly heard only in rock discos. But in 1981, the floodgates opened, and "new music" at last made a mighty splash. The breakthrough song was "[[Don't You Want Me]]" by the Human League. |source= Anglomania: The [[Second British Invasion]], by Parke Puterbaugh for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', November 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title= Anglomania: The Second British Invasion |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/anglomania-the-second-british-invasion-52016/ |accessdate= 29 April 2019 |work= Rolling Stone}}</ref>}}

Singer Michael Angelakos of [[Passion Pit]] said in a 2009 interview that while playing electropop was not his intention, the limitations of dorm life made the genre more accessible.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://thephoenix.com/boston/music/87381-interview-michael-angelakos-of-passion-pit/?page=3#TOPCONTENT|title= Interview: Michael Angelakos of Passion Pit Boston Phoenix October 1, 2009}}</ref>

In 2009 ''The Guardian'' quoted James Oldham—head of [[artists and repertoire]] at [[A&M Records]]—as saying "All [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] departments have been saying to managers and lawyers: 'Don't give us any more bands because we're not going to sign them and they're not going to sell records.'
