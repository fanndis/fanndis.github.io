== Influences ==
In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' Glover stated, "I'm influenced by [[LCD Soundsystem]] as much as [[Ghostface Killah]]. A lot of the rap shows I saw as a kid were boring, but if you went to a [[Rage Against the Machine]] show or a [[Justice (band)|Justice]] show, the kids were losing their minds.
