Societies can respond to sea level rise in three different ways: to retreat, to accommodate, and to protect. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand, but at other times choices have to be made among different strategies.<ref name=":6" /> Ecosystems that adapt to rising sea levels by moving inland might not always be able to do so, due to natural or artificial barriers.<ref name=":7" />

== Past changes in sea level ==
[[File:Post-Glacial Sea Level.png|thumb|upright=1.25| Changes in sea level since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last glacial episode]]]]Understanding [[past sea level]] is important for the analysis of current and future changes. In the recent geological past, changes in land ice and thermal expansion from increased temperatures are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time the Earth was 2&nbsp;°C (3.6&nbsp;°F) <!-- DO NOT use {{convert}} for Celsius temperature changes. --> warmer than pre-industrial temperatures, sea levels were at least {{Convert|5|metres|}} higher than now:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2019-08-scientists-evidence-high-level-sea.html|title=Scientists discover evidence for past high-level sea rise|date=2019-08-30|website=phys.org|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref> this was when warming because of [[Milankovitch cycles|changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit]] caused the last [[interglacial]]. The warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years and the magnitude of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.<ref name="ipcc13" />{{rp|1139}} Also, a report by the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research stated that around three million years ago, levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere were similar to today's levels which increased temperature by two to three degrees Celsius and melted one third of Antarctica's ice sheets. This in turn caused sea-levels to rise 20 metres.<ref>[https://www.nioz.nl/en/news/present-co2-levels-caused-20-metre-sea-level-rise-in-the-past Present CO2 levels caused 20-metre-sea-level rise in the past]</ref>

Since the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last glacial maximum]] about 20,000 years ago, the sea level has risen by more than {{Convert|125|m|}}, with rates varying from less than a mm/year to 40+ mm/year, as a result of melting ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia. Rapid disintegration of ice sheets led to so called '[[Meltwater pulse 1A|meltwater pulses]]', periods during which sea level rose rapidly. The rate of rise started to slow down about 8,200&nbsp;years before present; the sea level was almost constant in the last 2,500 years, before the recent rising trend that started at the end of the 19th century or in the beginning of the 20th.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lambeck |first1=Kurt |last2=Rouby |first2=Hélène |last3=Purcell |first3=Anthony |last4=Sun |first4=Yiying |last5=Sambridge |first5=Malcolm |title=Sea level and global ice volumes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=28 October 2014 |volume=111 |issue=43 |pages=15296–15303 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1411762111 |pmc=4217469 |pmid=25313072 |bibcode=2014PNAS..11115296L }}</ref>

Sea level changes can be driven either by variations in the amount of water in the oceans, the volume of the ocean or by changes of the land compared to the sea surface. The different techniques used to measure changes in sea level do not measure exactly the same level. Tide gauges can only measure relative sea level, whilst [[satellite]]s can also measure absolute sea level changes.<ref name=":13" /> To get precise measurements for sea level, researchers studying the ice and the oceans on our planet factor in ongoing [[geomorphology|deformations of the solid Earth]], in particular due to [[Glacial isostatic adjustment|landmasses still rising from past ice masses retreating]], and also the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] and [[Earth's rotation|rotation]].<ref name="WCRP2018"/>

===Satellites===
[[File:TOPEX-JasonSeries2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jason-1]] continued the sea surface measurements started by TOPEX/Poseidon. It was followed by the [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission]] on [[Jason-2]], and by [[Jason-3]]]]

Since the launch of [[TOPEX/Poseidon]] in 1992, [[Satellite geodesy#Altimetry|altimetric satellites]] have been recording the changes in sea level.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/topex/ | title = Ocean Surface Topography from Space | publisher = NASA/JPL}}</ref> Those satellites can measure the hills and valleys in the sea caused by currents and detect trends in their height. To measure the distance to the sea surface, the satellites send a microwave pulse to the ocean's surface and record the time it takes to return. [[Microwave radiometer]]s correct the additional delay caused by [[water vapor]] in the [[atmosphere]]. Combining these data with the precisely known location of the spacecraft makes it possible to determine sea-surface height to within a few centimeters (about one inch).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/jason-3/mission.html|title=Jason-3 Satellite - Mission|website=www.nesdis.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref> Current rates of sea level rise from satellite altimetry have been estimated to be {{convert|3.0|±|0.4|mm}} per year for the period 1993–2017.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Nerem |first1=R.

Satellites are useful for measuring regional variations in sea level, such as the substantial rise between 1993 and 2012 in the western tropical Pacific. This sharp rise has been linked to increasing [[trade winds]], which occur when the [[Pacific Decadal Oscillation]] (PDO) and the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) change from one state to the other.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merrifield |first1=Mark A. |last2=Thompson |first2=Philip R. |last3=Lander |first3=Mark |title=Multidecadal sea level anomalies and trends in the western tropical Pacific |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=July 2012 |volume=39 |issue=13 |pages=n/a |doi=10.1029/2012gl052032 |bibcode=2012GeoRL..3913602M }}</ref> The PDO is a basin-wide climate pattern consisting of two phases, each commonly lasting 10 to 30 years, while the ENSO has a shorter period of 2 to 7 years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mantua |first1=Nathan J. |last2=Hare |first2=Steven R. |last3=Zhang |first3=Yuan |last4=Wallace |first4=John M. |last5=Francis |first5=Robert C. |title=A Pacific Interdecadal Climate Oscillation with Impacts on Salmon Production |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |date=June 1997 |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=1069–1079 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078<1069:APICOW>2.0.CO;2 |bibcode=1997BAMS...78.1069M }}</ref>

Another important source of sea-level observations is the global network of [[tide gauge]]s.

Some regional differences are also visible in the tide gauge data. Some of the recorded regional differences are due to differences in the actual sea level, while other are due to vertical land movements. In Europe for instance, considerable variation is found because some land areas are rising while others are sinking. Since 1970, most tidal stations have measured higher seas, but sea levels along the northern [[Baltic Sea]] have dropped due to [[post-glacial rebound]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/sea-level-rise-5/assessment|title=Global and European sea level|date=27 November 2017|website=European Environmental Agency|access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>

The three main reasons warming causes global sea level to rise are: oceans [[Thermal expansion#Expansion in liquids|expand]], ice sheets lose ice faster than it forms from snowfall, and [[glacier]]s at higher altitudes also melt. Sea level rise since the start of the 20th century has been dominated by retreat of glaciers and expansion of the ocean, but the contributions of the two large ice sheets (Greenland and Antarctica) are expected to increase in the 21st century.<ref name="Mengel">{{cite journal |last1=Mengel |first1=Matthias |last2=Levermann |first2=Anders |last3=Frieler |first3=Katja |last4=Robinson |first4=Alexander |last5=Marzeion |first5=Ben |last6=Winkelmann |first6=Ricarda |title=Future sea level rise constrained by observations and long-term commitment |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=8 March 2016 |volume=113 |issue=10 |pages=2597–2602 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1500515113 |pmc=4791025 |pmid=26903648 |bibcode=2016PNAS..113.2597M }}</ref> The ice sheets store most of the land ice (∼99.5%), with a sea-level equivalent (SLE) of {{Convert|7.4|m||abbr=on}} for Greenland and {{Convert|58.3|m||abbr=on}} for Antarctica.<ref name="WCRP2018"/>

Each year about {{Convert|8|mm||abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation#Measurement|precipitation (liquid equivalent)]] falls on the [[Antarctic ice sheet|ice sheets in Antarctica]] and [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]], mostly as snow, which accumulates and over time forms glacial ice. Much of this precipitation began as water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. Some of the snow is blown away by wind or disappears from the ice sheet by melt or by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] (directly changing into water vapor). The rest of the snow slowly changes into ice. This ice can flow to the edges of the ice sheet and return to the ocean by melting at the edge or in the form of [[iceberg]]s. If precipitation, surface processes and ice loss at the edge [[Glacier mass balance|balance]] each other, sea level remains the same. However scientists have found that ice is being lost, and at an accelerating rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-level-rise-overflowing-estimates|title=Sea level rise overflowing estimates|first=Tanya|last=Lewis|date=23 September 2013|website=Science News}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rignot |first1=Eric |last2=Mouginot |first2=Jérémie |last3=Scheuchl |first3=Bernd |last4=van den Broeke |first4=Michiel |last5=van Wessem |first5=Melchior J. |last6=Morlighem |first6=Mathieu |title=Four decades of Antarctic Ice Sheet mass balance from 1979–2017 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=22 January 2019 |volume=116 |issue=4 |pages=1095–1103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1812883116 |pmid=30642972 |pmc=6347714 }}</ref>

=== Ocean heating ===

Most of the additional heat trapped in the Earth's climate system by global warming is stored in oceans. They store more than 90% of the extra heat and act as a buffer against the [[effects of global warming]]. The heat needed to raise an average temperature increase of the entire world ocean by 0.01&nbsp;°C <!-- DO NOT use {{convert}} for Celsius temperature changes. --> would increase the atmospheric temperature by approximately 10&nbsp;°C <!-- DO NOT use {{convert}} for Celsius temperature changes. -->.<ref>Levitus, S., Boyer, T., Antonov, J., Garcia, H., and Locarnini, R.

For each degree, warmer water and water under great pressure (due to depth) expand more than cooler water and water under less pressure.<ref name="ipcc13" />{{rp|1161}}  This means that cold [[Arctic Ocean]] water will expand less compared to warm tropical water.

===Glaciers===
{{Main|Retreat of glaciers since 1850|}}
Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. Still, mountain glaciers have contributed appreciably to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radić |first1=Valentina |last2=Hock |first2=Regine |title=Regionally differentiated contribution of mountain glaciers and ice caps to future sea-level rise |journal=Nature Geoscience |date=9 January 2011 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=91–94 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1052 |bibcode=2011NatGe...4...91R }}</ref> The roughly 200,000 glaciers on earth are spread out across all continents.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Huss |first1=Matthias |last2=Hock |first2=Regine |title=A new model for global glacier change and sea-level rise |journal=Frontiers in Earth Science |date=30 September 2015 |volume=3 |pages=54 |doi=10.3389/feart.2015.00054 |bibcode=2015FrEaS...3...54H |s2cid=3256381 }}</ref> Different glaciers respond differently to increasing temperatures.

=== Sea ice ===
Sea ice melt contributes very slightly to global sea level rise. If the melt water from ice floating in the sea was exactly the same as sea water then, according to [[Archimedes' principle]], no rise would occur. However melted sea ice contains less [[salinity|dissolved salt]] than sea water and is therefore less [[density|dense]]: in other words although the melted sea ice weighs the same as the sea water it was displacing when it was ice, its volume is still slightly greater. If all floating [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] and [[icebergs]] were to melt sea level would only rise by about {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noerdlinger |first1=Peter D. |last2=Brower |first2=Kay R. |title=The melting of floating ice raises the ocean level |journal=Geophysical Journal International |date=July 2007 |volume=170 |issue=1 |pages=145–150 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03472.x |bibcode=2007GeoJI.170..145N }}</ref>

Humans impact how much water is stored on land. Building [[dam]]s prevents large masses of water from flowing into the sea and therefore increases the storage of water on land. On the other hand, humans extract water from [[lake]]s, [[wetland]]s and [[Aquifer|underground reservoirs]] for [[Food industry|food production]] leading to rising seas. Furthermore, the [[Water cycle|hydrological cycle]] is influenced by climate change and [[deforestation]], which can lead to further positive and negative contributions to sea level rise. In the 20th century, these processes roughly balanced, but dam building has slowed down and is expected to stay low for the 21st century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wada |first1=Yoshihide |last2=Reager |first2=John T. |last3=Chao |first3=Benjamin F. |last4=Wang |first4=Jida |last5=Lo |first5=Min-Hui |last6=Song |first6=Chunqiao |last7=Li |first7=Yuwen |last8=Gardner |first8=Alex S. |title=Recent Changes in Land Water Storage and its Contribution to Sea Level Variations |journal=Surveys in Geophysics |date=15 November 2016 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=131–152 |doi=10.1007/s10712-016-9399-6 |pmid=32269399 |pmc=7115037 }}</ref><ref name="ipcc13" />{{rp|1155}}

[[File:Sea level rise projections for the 21st century.png|thumb|Different sea level rise projections for the 21st century]]
There are broadly two ways of modelling sea level rise and making future [[General circulation model#Projections|projections]]. On the one hand, scientists use process-based modelling, where all relevant and well-understood physical processes are included in a physical model. An [[ice-sheet model]] is used to calculate the contributions of ice sheets and a [[general circulation model]] is used to compute the rising sea temperature and its expansion. A disadvantage of this method is that not all relevant processes might be understood to a sufficient level. Alternatively, some scientists use semi-empirical techniques that use geological data from the past to determine likely sea level responses to a warming world in addition to some basic physical modelling.<ref name="Mengel" /> Semi-empirical sea level models rely on statistical techniques, using relationships between observed (contributions to) global mean sea level and global mean temperature.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 ºC|last1=Hoegh-Guldberg|first1=O.|last2=Jacob|first2=Daniela|last3=Taylor|first3=Michael|publisher=In Press|year=2018|chapter=Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems|chapter-url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_Chapter3_Low_Res.pdf}}</ref> This type of modelling was partially motivated by the fact that in previous literature assessments by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) most physical models underestimated the amount of sea level rise compared to observations of the 20th century.<ref name="ipcc13" />

=== Projections for the 21st century ===
In its [[Fifth Assessment Report|fifth assessment report (2013)]] the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimated how much sea level is likely to rise in the 21st century based on different levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  These projections are based on well-known factors which contribute to sea level rise, but exclude other processes which are less well understood. If countries make rapid cuts to emissions (the RCP2.6 scenario), the IPCC deems it likely that the sea level will rise by {{cvt|26–55|cm}} with a 67% [[confidence interval]]. If emissions remain very high, the IPCC projects sea level will rise by {{cvt|52–98|cm}}.<ref name="ipcc13">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/|title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

Since the publication of the 2013 IPCC assessment, attempts have been made to include more physical processes and to develop models that can project sea level rise using paleoclimate data. This typically led to higher estimates of sea level rise.<ref name=pmid30013142/><ref name=":8" /><ref name="Hansen2016">{{cite journal |last1=Hansen |first1=James |last2=Sato |first2=Makiko |last3=Hearty |first3=Paul |last4=Ruedy |first4=Reto |last5=Kelley |first5=Maxwell |last6=Masson-Delmotte |first6=Valerie |last7=Russell |first7=Gary |last8=Tselioudis |first8=George |last9=Cao |first9=Junji |last10=Rignot |first10=Eric |last11=Velicogna |first11=Isabella |last12=Tormey |first12=Blair |last13=Donovan |first13=Bailey |last14=Kandiano |first14=Evgeniya |last15=von Schuckmann |first15=Karina |last16=Kharecha |first16=Pushker |last17=Legrande |first17=Allegra N. |last18=Bauer |first18=Michael |last19=Lo |first19=Kwok-Wai |title=Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming could be dangerous |journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics |date=22 March 2016 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=3761–3812 |doi=10.5194/acp-16-3761-2016 |arxiv=1602.01393 |bibcode=2016ACP....16.3761H|s2cid=9410444 }}</ref> For instance, a 2016 study led by [[Jim Hansen]] concluded that based on [[MIS 5e|past climate change]] data, sea level rise could accelerate exponentially in the coming decades, with a doubling time of 10, 20 or 40 years, respectively, raising the ocean by several meters in 50, 100 or 200 years.<ref name="Hansen2016" /> However, Greg Holland from the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], who reviewed the study, noted: “There is no doubt that the sea level rise, within the IPCC, is a very conservative number, so the truth lies somewhere between IPCC and Jim''.''”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/23/controversial-sea-level-rise-paper-is-now-published-online/|title=James Hansen's controversial sea level rise paper has now been published online|year=2015|website=The Washington Post}}</ref>

The possibility of a collapse of the West-Antarctic ice sheet and subsequent rapid sea level rise was suggested back in the 1970s.<ref name=pmid30013142/> For instance, Mercer published a study in 1978 predicting that anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming and its potential effects on climate in the 21st century could cause a sea level rise of around {{convert|5|m||abbr=}} from melting of the West Antarctic ice-sheet alone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mercer |first1=J.

In 2019, a study projected that in low emission scenario, sea level will rise 30 centimeters by 2050 and 69 centimetres by 2100, relatively to the level in 2000. In high emission scenario, it will be 34&nbsp;cm by 2050 and 111&nbsp;cm by 2100.

In September 2019 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] published a report about the impact of climate change on the oceans including sea level rise.

== Regional sea level change ==
Sea level rise is not uniform around the globe. Some land masses are moving up or down as a consequence of [[Subsidence|subsidence (land sinking or settling)]] or [[Post-glacial rebound |post-glacial rebound (land rising due to the loss of the weight of ice after melting)]], so that local relative sea level rise may be higher or lower than the global average. There are even regions near current and former glaciers and ice sheets where sea level falls. Furthermore, gravitational effects of changing ice masses and spatially varying patterns of warming lead to differences in the distribution of sea water around the globe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Katsman|first1=Caroline A.|last2=Sterl|first2=A.|last3=Beersma|first3=J.

Many ports, urban conglomerations, and agricultural regions are built on [[river delta]]s, where subsidence of land contributes to a substantially increased [[Relative sea level|''relative'' sea level]] rise. This is caused by both unsustainable extraction of groundwater (in some places also by extraction of oil and gas), and by [[levee]]s and other flood management practices that prevent accumulation of sediments from compensating for the natural settling of deltaic soils.<ref>{{Harvnb |Bucx|Marchand|Makaske|van de Guchte|2010|p=88}};{{Harvnb|Tessler|Vörösmarty|Grossberg|Gladkova|2015|p=638}}</ref> Total human-caused subsidence in the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]] (Netherlands) is estimated at {{Cvt|3 to 4|m||0|abbr=}}, over {{Cvt|3|m|ft|0|abbr=}} in urban areas of the [[Mississippi River Delta]] ([[New Orleans]]), and over {{Cvt|9|m|}} in the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Bucx|Marchand|Makaske|van de Guchte|2010|pp=81, 88,90}}</ref> Isostatic rebound causes relative sea level fall around the [[Hudson Bay]] in [[Canada]] and the northern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cazenave|first1=Anny|last2=Nicholls|first2=Robert J.|date=2010|title=Sea-Level Rise and Its Impact on Coastal Zones|journal=Science|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1517–1520|doi=10.1126/science.1185782|issn=0036-8075|pmid=20558707|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1517N|s2cid=199393735}}</ref>

== Effects ==
{{further|Regional effects of global warming}}Current and future sea level rise is set to have a number of impacts, particularly on [[coast]]al systems. Such impacts include increased [[coastal erosion]], higher [[storm surge|storm-surge]] flooding, inhibition of [[primary production]] processes, more extensive coastal inundation, changes in surface [[water quality]] and groundwater characteristics, increased loss of property and coastal habitats, increased flood risk and potential loss of life, loss of non-monetary cultural resources and values, impacts on agriculture and [[aquaculture]] through decline in soil and water quality, and loss of tourism, recreation, and transportation functions.<ref name=":10">{{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.</ref>{{rp|356}} Many of these impacts are detrimental. Owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the resilience and adaptive capacity of [[ecosystem]]s, sectors, and countries, the impacts will be highly variable in time and space. [[River delta]]s in Africa and Asia and small island states are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mimura|first=Nobuo|date=2013|title=Sea-level rise caused by climate change and its implications for society|journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy.

Globally tens of millions of people will be displaced in the latter decades of the century if greenhouse gases are not reduced drastically. Many coastal areas have large population growth, which results in more people at risk from sea level rise. The rising seas pose both a direct risk: unprotected homes can be flooded, and indirect threats of higher storm surges, tsunamis and [[king tide]]s.

In October 2019 a study was published in the journal Nature Communications, saying that the number of people who will be impacted from sea level rise during 21 century is 3 times higher that was previously thought. By the year 2050, 150 million will be under the water line during high tide and 300 million will live in zones with floodings every year. By the year 2100, those numbers differ sharply depending on the emission scenario. In a low emission scenario, 140 million will be under water during high tide and 280 million will have flooding each year. In high emission scenario, the numbers arrive to 540 million and 640 million respectively. 70% of these people will live in 8 countries in Asia: [[China]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kulp |first1=Scott A. |last2=Strauss |first2=Benjamin H. |title=New elevation data triple estimates of global vulnerability to sea-level rise and coastal flooding |journal=Nature Communications |date=29 October 2019 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4844 |doi=10.1038/s41467-019-12808-z |pmid=31664024 |pmc=6820795 |bibcode=2019NatCo..10.4844K }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/sea-level-rise-predictions-2641159739.html|title=300 Million People Worldwide Could Suffer Yearly Flooding by 2050|last1=Rosane|first1=Olivia|date=October 30, 2019|access-date=31 October 2019|agency=Ecowatch}}</ref> Several days after, [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[António Guterres]] cited the report calling to Asian countries to implement a [[carbon tax]], stop building new coal plants and stop subsidies to fossil fuels<ref>{{cite news |title=Climate change: Asia 'coal addiction' must end, UN chief warns |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50276983 |access-date=4 November 2019 |agency=BBC |date=2 November 2019}}</ref>

Due to numerous factors, sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate, which poses a great threat to the human environment, both now and in the future. Although this is a slow and continuous process, its long-term cumulative effects on the world, especially in coastal areas, pose a serious threat. In recent years, some coastal areas have already had to cope with effects accumulated over a long period of change. These areas are sensitive to rising sea levels, changes in the frequency and intensity of storms, increased precipitation, and rising ocean temperatures. Ten per cent of the world's population live in coastal areas that are less than {{Convert|10|m|feet}} above sea level.

Coastal ecosystems are facing drastic changes as a consequence of rising sea levels. Many systems might ultimately be lost when sea levels rise too much or too fast. Some ecosystems can move land inward with the high-water mark, but many are prevented from migrating due to natural or artificial barriers. This coastal narrowing, sometimes called 'coastal squeeze' when considering human-made barriers, could result in the loss of habitats such as [[mudflat]]s and [[marsh]]es.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/sea-level-rise-poses-a-major-threat-to-coastal-ecosystems-and-the-biota-they-support|title=Sea level rise poses a major threat to coastal ecosystems and the biota they support|date=2015|website=birdlife.org|publisher=Birdlife International}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pontee |first1=Nigel |title=Defining coastal squeeze: A discussion |journal=Ocean & Coastal Management |date=November 2013 |volume=84 |pages=204–207 |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2013.07.010 }}</ref>
The mangrove ecosystem is one of the ecosystems affected by rising sea levels. It is an ecological whole composed of mangrove plants growing in and around the mudflats of the tropical coast. Its ecological value is high because it is an ideal home for many species. In recent years, mangroves have been moving inland, but their success depends on various environmental information such as topography and geology. The warmer the climate, the bigger they grow.  The mangrove's breathing roots or pneumatophores might grow to be half a metre tall.<ref>https://www.nrc.govt.nz/for-schools/school-information-packs/mangroves/</ref><ref name="High mangrove density enhances surf">{{cite journal |last1=Kumara |first1=M.

==Adaptation==
{{further|Adaptation to global warming}}
[[File:People's Climate March 2017 in Washington DC 37.jpg|thumb|Placard "The sea is rising", at the [[People's Climate March (2017)]].|alt=|left]]Adaptation options to sea level rise can be broadly classified into ''retreat, accommodate'' and ''protect''. Retreating is moving people and [[infrastructure]] to less exposed areas and preventing further development in areas that are at risk. This type of adaptation is potentially disruptive, as displacement of people might lead to tensions. Accommodation options are measurements that make societies more flexible to sea level rise. Examples are the [[Agriculture|cultivation]] of food crops that tolerate a high salt content in the soil and making new [[Building code|building standards]] which require building to be built higher and have less damage in the case a flood does occur. Finally, areas can be protected by the construction of dams, dikes and by improving natural defenses.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Thomsen|first1=Dana C.|last2=Smith|first2=Timothy F.|last3=Keys|first3=Noni|date=2012|title=Adaptation or Manipulation?

In the United States, the environmental protection agency supports the development and maintenance of water supply infrastructure nationwide, especially in coastal cities, and more coastal cities and countries are actively implementing this approach.<ref name=":9">{{cite web|date=2 May 2016|title=Climate Adaptation and Sea Level Rise|url=https://www.epa.gov/arc-x/climate-adaptation-and-sea-level-rise|website=US EPA, Climate Change Adaptation Resource Center (ARC-X)|language=en}}</ref> Besides, storm surges and flooding can be instantaneous and devastating to cities, and some coastal areas have begun investing in storm water valves to cope with more frequent and severe flooding during high tides.<ref name=":9" />

These adaptation options can be further divided into ''hard'' and ''soft''. Hard adaptation relies mostly on capital-intensive human-built infrastructure and involves large-scale changes to human societies and ecological systems. Because of its large scale, it is often not flexible. Soft adaptation involves strengthening natural defenses and adaptation strategies in local communities and the use of simple and modular technology, which can be locally owned. The two types of adaptation might be complementary or mutually exclusive.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sovacool|first=Benjamin K.|date=2011|title=Hard and soft paths for climate change adaptation|url=http://www.adaptation-undp.org/sites/default/files/downloads/sovacool-cp-hardsoft.pdf|journal=Climate Policy|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1177–1183|doi=10.1080/14693062.2011.579315|s2cid=153384574}}</ref>
