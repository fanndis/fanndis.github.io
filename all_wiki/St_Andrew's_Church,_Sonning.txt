'''St Andrew's Church''' is [[Church of England]] [[Church of England parish church|parish church]] in a central position in the village of [[Sonning]], close to the [[River Thames]], in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]].<ref>[http://www.achurchnearyou.com/sonning-st-andrew/ Sonning St Andrew, Sonning], [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/ The Church of England].</ref> It is notable for its fine array of [[English church monuments|church monuments]] and for being the successor of an Anglo-Saxon Cathedral.

== Location ==
The church is located close to the historic [[Sonning Bishop's Palace|Bishop's Palace]], which has long since disappeared apart from some grassy mounds. The historic [[Bull Inn, Sonning|Bull Inn]] is immediately next to the church away from the river and is owned by the church. Also adjoining the churchyard is [[Deanery Gardens]], an early 20th-century [[Edwin Lutyens]] house with a [[Gertrude Jekyll]] garden, well hidden by high walls apart from a good view from the top of the church tower. Close by is the brick-built [[Sonning Bridge]], leading over the Thames into [[Oxfordshire]], with the [[Great House at Sonning]], a historic public house, now a hotel and restaurant, next to it on the river.

== History ==
[[Image:Sonning Bridge - 1799.jpg|thumb|Print of [[Sonning Bridge]] (1799) with the tower of St Andrew's Church, Sonning, in the background.]]
Sonning    was the location of an early [[Anglo-Saxon|Saxon]] minster. In 909 AD, this became one of the two cathedrals of the [[See of Ramsbury and Sonning]].<ref>Ford, David Nash, ''[http://www.berkshirehistory.com/churches/sonning.html Sonning: St Andrew's Church]'', [http://www.berkshirehistory.com/ Royal Berkshire History].</ref> Some Saxon stonework can still be seen in the church today.

The north aisle dates from the 13th century and the south aisle dates from the early 14th century. However, the church as it can be seen today is largely [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], with [[Victorian restoration|major restoration]] by [[Henry Woodyer]] in 1852–3 and 1876.<ref>{{cite book |author=Pevsner, Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |title=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]]: Berkshire |year=1966 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex | pages=219–220}}</ref> Of note is the ornate 17th-century monument to [[Sir Thomas Rich, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Rich]], now hidden in the base of the tower. In 1853, it was called "the vilest paganism imaginable".<ref>''[[The Ecclesiologist]]'', 1853.</ref> There is also a fine series of [[monumental brass|memorial brasses]] (largely hidden beneath the carpet). The church is a Grade II* listed building.<ref name="nhle" />

[[Hugh Pearson]] was a notable [[Victorian era|Victorian]] vicar at the church, under whom many of the changes took place. Pearson Hall (the village hall) and Pearson Road in the village are named after him.

== Graves ==
The following are notable burials in the churchyard:
* [[Edmund John Phipps-Hornby]] VC, CB, CMG, DL (1857–1947), a recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]]
* Major General [[Llewelyn Alberic Emilius Price-Davies]] VC CB CMG DSO (1878–1965), another recipient of the Victoria Cross
* Brigadier Sir [[Neil Hamilton Fairley]] KBE CStJ FRACP FRCP FRCPE FRS  (1891–1966), Australian physician and soldier
