'''George Leonard Carey, Baron Carey of Clifton''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|PC}} (born 13 November 1935)<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article6914645.ece ''The Times''], 12 November 2009.</ref> is a retired Anglican bishop who was the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from 1991 to 2002, having previously been the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]].  

During his time as archbishop the [[Church of England]] [[ordination|ordained]] its first [[women priests]] and the debate over [[Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion#Church of England|attitudes to homosexuality]] became more prominent, especially at the 1998 [[Lambeth Conference]] of [[Anglican]] [[bishop]]s. 

In June 2017 he resigned from his last formal role in the church after a finding that he had covered up child sex abuse allegations against the bishop [[Peter Ball (bishop)|Peter Ball]].<ref name="resign2">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-40407464|title=Ex-Archbishop Lord Carey resigns after child abuse"review|date=26 June 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> In 2018 the UK Child Sex Abuse Report found Carey had committed serious breaches of duty in covering up child sex abuse within the Church.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/09/church-of-england-put-reputation-above-abuse-victims-needs-inquiry-finds|title=Church of England put reputation above abuse victims' needs, inquiry finds|last=correspondent|first=Harriet Sherwood Religion|date=2019-05-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In February 2018 Carey was granted "[[permission to officiate]]" by [[Steven Croft (bishop)|Steven Croft]], the bishop of Oxford, allowing him to preach and preside at churches in the diocese.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/13/former-archbishop-of-canterbury-allowed-to-resume-a-church-role |title=George Carey allowed church role despite part in abuse cover-up |newspaper=The Guardian|author= Harriet Sherwood  |date= 13 July 2018}}</ref> This was revoked on 17 June 2020 as the Church of England said that there was new evidence linking Carey to a review into abuse committed by [[John Smyth (barrister)|John Smyth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-53086234 |title=George Carey: Former archbishop suspended over abuse inquiry|website= BBC News|date=18 June 2020|access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lawandreligionuk.com/2020/01/13/peter-ball-the-on-going-legacy/ |title=Peter Ball – the on-going legacy |website=Law & Religion UK|date=5 January 2020  |access-date= 17 June 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
George Carey was born on 13 November 1935 in the [[East End of London]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. He attended Bonham Road Primary School in [[Dagenham]], then failed his [[11-plus]].<ref name="kt">{{cite book | last=Carey | first=George | title=Know the Truth | publisher=Harper Perennial | isbn=0-00-712029-X}}</ref>{{Rp|14}} He then attended Bifrons Secondary Modern School in [[Barking, London|Barking]] before leaving at the age of 15. He worked for the [[London Electricity Board]] as an office boy before starting his [[National Service]] at age 18 in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a wireless operator, during which time he served in [[Iraq]].<ref name="kt" />{{Rp|32}}

==Conversion and ordination==
Carey became a committed [[Christians|Christian]] at age 17 when he attended a [[church service]] with some friends. He said that "I had a conversion experience which was very real&nbsp;... There were no blinding lights, simply a quiet conviction I had found something."<ref>{{cite news|title=George Carey: an archbishop of the people|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/41037.stm|work=BBC news|access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref>

During his National Service, Carey decided to seek [[ordination]] and after his [[military discharge|discharge]] he studied intensely, gaining six [[O-level]]s and three [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] in 15 months. He studied at [[King's College London]], graduated as a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] from the [[University of London]] in 1962 with a 2:1 degree, and was subsequently [[ordination|ordained]]. He later obtained a [[Master of Theology]] degree and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Durham]]. Carey is the first archbishop of Canterbury since the [[Middle Ages]] not to have been a graduate of either [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. The last archbishop of Canterbury before Carey who had not been a graduate of one or both was [[Simon Sudbury]] ({{circa}} 1316–1381).

==Offices==
Carey was a [[curate]] at [[St Mary's Church, Islington|St Mary's Islington]], worked at [[Oak Hill Theological College]] and [[St John's College, Nottingham|St John's Theological College, Nottingham]] and became [[Vicar]] of [[St Nicholas' Church, Durham]] in 1975. Within two years he had trebled the congregation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He later wrote a book on his experiences there called ''The Church in the Market Place''.

In 1981, Carey was appointed [[Principal (academia)|Principal]] of [[Trinity College, Bristol]]. He became [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] in 1987; he was [[Episcopal consecration|consecrated a bishop]] by [[Robert Runcie]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], at [[Southwark Cathedral]] on 3 December 1987<ref>{{Church Times | title = picture caption | archive = 1987_12_11_002 | issue = 6513 | date = 11 December 1987 | page = 2 | accessed = 26 December 2016 }}</ref> (by which point his [[Episcopal election|election]] must have been [[Confirmation of bishops|confirmed]]) and enthroned in February 1988.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=G5Ig4SDJFgkC&pg=PA81 Buchanan, Colin. Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism] p. 81 (Google Books; accessed 7 May 2014)</ref>

When [[Robert Runcie]] retired as Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], encouraged by her former Parliamentary Private Secretary, [[Michael Alison]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], put Carey's name forward to the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] for appointment.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The religious correspondent for ''The Times'', [[Clifford Longley]], commented that "Mrs Thatcher's known impatience with theological and moral woolliness ... will have been a factor."<ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher. The Iron Lady'' (Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 394.</ref>

Carey was [[Confirmation of bishops|confirmed]] as Archbishop of Canterbury on 27 March 1991<ref name="conf">[http://www.lambethpalacelibrary.org/files/places_of_confirmation.pdf Lambeth Palace Library Research Guide – Places of Confirmation of Election of Archbishops of  Canterbury] (Accessed 7 May 2014)</ref> and enthroned on 19 April 1991.

On 31 October 2002, he retired, resigning the See of Canterbury, and the next day was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Carey of Clifton''', ''of [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] in the City and County of [[Bristol]]'', meaning that he remained a member of the [[House of Lords]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=56744 |date=6 November 2002 |page=13421 }}</ref> where he sat as a [[crossbench]]er. He was succeeded as archbishop by [[Rowan Williams]]. Living in the [[Diocese of Oxford]], until 2017 Carey served there as an [[honorary assistant bishop]], as is customary for retired bishops. 

Carey was [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Gloucestershire]] for seven years, resigning in 2010,<ref name="THEGloucestershire">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/chancellor-follows-v-c-out-at-gloucestershire/411806.article?sectioncode=26&storycode=411806&c=1|title=Chancellor follows v-c out at Gloucestershire|last=Baker|first=Simon|date=29 May 2010|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref> and was president of the [[London School of Theology]].<ref name="LST">{{cite web|url=http://www.eauk.org/current-affairs/media/press-releases/dr-krish-kandiah-appointed-president-of-london-school-of-theology.cfm|title=Press Release:&nbsp;Dr Krish Kandiah appointed president of London School of Theology|date=22 Aug 2014|publisher=Evangelical Alliance|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref> He is also an Honorary Liveryman of the [[Worshipful Company of Scriveners]] and a [[Fellow|Distinguished Fellow]] of the [[Library of Congress]] (Washington DC).

==Theological and social positions==
Carey's theological roots are in the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] tradition of the [[Church of England]]. He strongly supported the ordination of women but also has close [[ecumenical]] links with the Roman Catholic Church, being chosen in 1976 to represent the Church of England at a meeting of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] in Rome.<ref name="kt" />{{Rp|84}}

Carey is tolerant of [[divorce]] and divorced people and the remarriage of divorced people. One of his sons is divorced and he also supported the marriage of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] to [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker-Bowles]], whose first husband is living. He opposed homosexual relationships among members of the clergy, although he admits to having consecrated two bishops whom he suspected of having same-sex partners.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} He presided over the [[Lambeth Conference]] of 1998 and actively supported the conference's resolution which uncompromisingly rejected all homosexual practice as "incompatible with scripture".<ref>Roche Coleman, ''Connecting the Chasm'' (WestBow Press, 2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IvGC1omX9CMC&pg=PA191#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 191]</ref>

Carey was criticised for his lack of neutrality on the issue of homosexuality by those attempting to reach a compromise position which had been presented to the conference by a working group of bishops on human sexuality.<ref name="lambethconference1998">{{cite web|title=Lambeth Conference 1998 Archives|url=http://www.lambethconference.org/1998/news/lc098.cfm|publisher=Lambeth Conference|access-date=1 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728181157/http://www.lambethconference.org/1998/news/lc098.cfm|archive-date=28 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Carey also voted against an expressed condemnation (which had been present in the original form of the resolution) of [[homophobia]]. The resolution as a whole prompted one of Carey's fellow primates, [[Richard Holloway]], [[Bishop of Edinburgh]] and [[Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church]], to declare "I feel gutted, I feel betrayed, but the struggle will go on".<ref name="lambethconference1998"/>

Carey said:  "If this conference is known by what we have said about homosexuality, then we will have failed."<ref name="lambethconference1998"/>  The resolution, however, was the beginning of an escalating crisis of unity within the Anglican Communion around the question of human sexuality, a crisis that continues. This resolution is at the heart of current divisions within the Anglican Communion on the issue. In 1999 he was one of four English bishops who expressly declined to sign the [[Cambridge Accord]]: an attempt to find agreement on affirming certain human rights of homosexuals, notwithstanding differences within the church on the morality of homosexual behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.changingattitude.org/lambeth_conf_cambridge_accord.html |title=Cambridge Accord (with UK signatories and refusals to sign) |access-date=27 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725154524/http://www.archive.changingattitude.org/lambeth_conf_cambridge_accord.html |archive-date=25 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> In an interview with [[Sir]] [[David Frost]] in 2002 he said:  "I don't believe in blessing same-sex relationships because frankly I don't know what I'm blessing."<ref>{{cite news

Carey was the first former archbishop of Canterbury to publish his memoirs, in 2004. The book, ''Know the Truth'', mentions meetings with the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]] and his thoughts that they should marry. In 2005, they did marry in a civil ceremony; the Church carried out a blessing after civil marriage at St George's Chapel, [[Windsor Castle]].

In 1998 he made a public call for the humane treatment of [[Augusto Pinochet]], the former [[dictator]] of [[Chile]], who was at the time in custody in the United Kingdom.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095158/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19981023/ai_n14200577 Colin Brown, "Straw may release Pinochet"], ''[[The Independent]]'' (London), 23 Octoctober 1998.

In 2000 Carey was critical of the document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', issued by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] under [[Pope John Paul II]], saying that it "did not reflect the deep comprehension that has been reached through ecumenical dialogue and cooperation [between Roman Catholics and Anglicans] during the past 30 years ... the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion does not for one moment accept that its orders of ministry and Eucharist are deficient in any way. It believes itself to be a part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ, in whose name it serves and bears witness, here and round the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/rcc_othe5.htm |title=Reactions to Dominus Iesus (2000) |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref>

==Public statements since retirement==
===On Muslims===
As Archbishop of Canterbury, Carey was active in inter-faith work and worked for better relations with [[Islam|Muslims]], calling for "deeper dialogue" between the two faiths. On 25 March 2004, after his retirement, he made a speech lamenting the lack of democracy and innovation in [[Islamic world|Muslim countries]], suggesting a lack of [[Critique|critical]] scholarship toward the ''[[Qur'an]]'' and saying that moderate Muslims should "resist strongly" the take-over of Islam by extremists. He also criticised the majority of Muslims, who do not support extremists, for not denouncing them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glcarey.co.uk/Speeches/2004/ChrisandIslam.html |title=Christianity and Islam |publisher=Glcarey.co.uk |access-date=11 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022421/http://www.glcarey.co.uk/Speeches/2004/ChrisandIslam.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some{{who|date=November 2011}} viewed his speech as an outspoken attack on Islam; Carey responded: "Those who took the trouble to read my lecture will have noted that I was as critical of the West, of Christianity and, for that matter, also sharply critical of Israel's policy with respect to Palestine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2004/nparticle-gyw-zx7-fxc|title=Lord Carey: Islam and the West Text of Lecture Delivered at University of Leicester, May&nbsp;12, 2004|publisher=University of Leicester|access-date=22 August 2009}}</ref>

In September 2006, he backed [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in the [[Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy|controversy over his comments on Islam]] and declared that "there will be no significant material and economic progress [in Muslim communities] until the Muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of Muslim conventions and even their most cherished [[shibboleth]]s."<ref>{{cite news

===On the British and migration===
Carey wrote an opinion piece in ''[[The Times]]'' on 10 September 2008 (p.&nbsp;26) in which he said: "Immigration must be kept under control if we are to retain the essentials of British society that have been built up over the generations. ... If this scale of immigration continues, with people of different faiths, cultures and traditions coming here, what will it mean to be British?"

In January 2010, Carey gave an interview on BBC Radio 4's ''Today'' programme, in which he said as part of the ''Balanced Migration Group''<ref>[http://www.balancedmigration.com/about.php www.balancedmigration.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708035949/http://www.balancedmigration.com/about.php |date=8 July 2012 }}</ref> he would want to start a debate on the UK's migration policy. He said that while the UK migration policy should not "give preference to any particular group", the points-based immigration system should give preferences to certain prospective migrants based on their values and backgrounds. In the same interview, however, he states that he was worried that the UK will become less of a Christian country and that he believes migration policy should foster the preservation of the Christian heritage of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8442662.stm |title=Former archbishop Carey backs '70m population cap' |work=BBC News |date=6 January 2010 |access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref>

===On Syriac Christians===
On 18 July 2015, he lent his name and efforts to the [[Barnabas Fund]], a charity designed to place [[Syria]]c Christians, whom [[ISIS]] target as part of their Islamic supremacist doctrine, at the front of the UK refugee queue. He called on government to “welcome Christian [[refugee]]s and give them priority as asylum seekers. Syrian and Iraqi Christians are being butchered, tortured and enslaved. We need the British Government to work with charities like the Barnabas Fund and others to evacuate those who are in desperate fear of their lives." He was joined by [[Lord Weidenfeld]] and the [[Andrew White (priest)|Vicar of Baghdad]], as well as many others, in his effort.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11748943/UK-is-denying-refuge-to-Christians-fleeing-Isil-say-church-leaders.html telegraph.co.uk: "UK is denying refuge to Christians fleeing Isil, say church leaders"], 18 July 2015</ref>

===On marriage===
In February 2012, speaking at the launch of the [[advocacy group]] Coalition for Marriage, Carey voiced his opposition to the government's proposal to legalise [[same-sex marriage]], stating that he was "worried and disappointed" and calling the proposal "cultural vandalism".<ref>{{cite news

 | title=Lord Carey: gay marriage would be 'cultural vandalism'
 | access-date=20 February 2012

}}</ref> In March 2013, Carey spoke of being "very suspicious" that behind plans for gay marriage "there lurks an aggressive secularist and relativist approach towards an institution that has glued society".<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21979034 | title= Lord Carey attacks PM over Christian 'support' | work=BBC News | date=30 March 2013 | access-date=4 June 2013}}</ref> In May 2013, Carey claimed same-sex marriage could set a "dangerous precedent" which could lead to sibling marriage or [[polygamy]]. Carey criticized the British government for seeking to change the definition of marriage to "a long-term commitment between two people of any sex, in which gender and procreation are irrelevant".<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22727808 | title= Gay marriage plan 'paves way for polygamy', says Lord Carey  | work=BBC News | date=31 May 2013 | access-date=4 June 2013}}</ref>

===On homosexuality===
{{see also|Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion}}

In 1994 Carey voted in the House of Lords to defeat equality legislation that would have lowered the age of consent for homosexual men, from 21 years, to the same age as for heterosexuals (16 years) and again, in 1998 he voted against the equalisation of age of consent, at that time 18, to 16.  Since his retirement, Carey has tolerated [[same-sex partnership]]s in secular law but continues to oppose [[same-sex marriage]] and church blessings of same-sex partnerships. In March 2006, he personally endorsed "with enthusiasm" a questionnaire to American bishops from what he described as "Lay [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] who wish their Church to remain faithful to Orthodox Christianity" in relation to the controversy in that church over the ordination of an openly gay bishop. For this, he was chided by [[Frank Griswold]], the Presiding Bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church in the United States]], "for allowing himself to be used by others whose political ambition is to sow division".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In late April 2006, Carey said in a televised interview that the ordination of Bishop [[Gene Robinson]] of [[New Hampshire]], US in 2003 verged on [[heresy]] because Bishop Robinson is gay and lives in a long-term relationship. His association with Episcopalians Concerned agitated some, and his decision to confirm anti-gay dissidents who refused the ministry of the Bishop of Virginia puzzled the same people. Carey, who remembered the difficulties of the [[Lambeth Conferences#Thirteenth: 1998|13th Lambeth Conference]] that he had presided over in 1998, sought to avoid a major schism in the communion by refraining from further consecrations of gay people.<ref name=ekk06>[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060427careys.shtml ekklesia.co.uk: "Lord Carey says ordaining a gay bishop verges on heresy"], 27 April 2006</ref>

In April 2010, Carey submitted a witness statement to an appeal court considering the [[McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd|dismissal of a relationship counsellor who had refused to work with homosexuals]], in which he suggested that intervention by senior clerics, including himself, was "indicative of a future civil unrest".<ref name="McFarlane v Relate Avon">{{cite news | title=McFarlane v Relate Avon | date=29 April 2010 | url =http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/B1.html | work=judgment of Lord Justice Laws | pages =paragraph 17 | access-date =3 May 2010 }}</ref>  In the same statement, he suggested that cases engaging religious rights should not be heard by any of the judges who had decided the previous cases, "as they have made clear their lack of knowledge about the Christian faith."<ref name="McFarlane v Relate Avon"/>  His submission was rejected by the Court as "misplaced"<ref>{{cite news | title=McFarlane v Relate Avon | date=29 April 2010 | url =http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/B1.html | work=judgment of Lord Justice Laws | pages =paragraph 18 | access-date =3 May 2010 }}</ref> and "deeply inimical to the public interest".<ref>{{cite news | title=McFarlane v Relate Avon | date=29 April 2010 | url =http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/B1.html | work=judgment of Lord Justice Laws | pages =paragraph 26 | access-date =3 May 2010 }}</ref>  Carey's position was widely criticised in the press.<ref>{{cite journal|title=McFarlane: more reports and views (links to newspaper report and commentary)|journal=Thinking Anglicans|date=30 April 2010|url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/004339.html|access-date=3 May 2010 }}</ref>  Andrew Brown, writing in ''The Guardian'', suggested that the effect of the judgment was to say that Carey was "a self-important and alarmist twit who has no idea what he is talking about".<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Brown | title=Carey slapped down by senior judgeCarey's intervention in the case of the Christian Relate counsellor has been fisked by an appeal court judge | date=29 April 2010 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/apr/29/law-christianity | work=The Guardian (London) | access-date =3 May 2010 }}</ref> The ''[[Church Times]]'' commented that "One might be forgiven for thinking that Lord Carey of Clifton has generated more column-inches since retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury than he did when in office.

===On religious freedom===
Carey was a leading advocate for the rights of Christians in advance of a case on religious freedom, begun on 4 September 2012 at the [[European Court of Human Rights]], regarding the case of two workers forced out of their jobs over the wearing of [[cross]]es as a visible manifestation of their [[faith]].<ref>{{cite news

In May 2006, he made a speech to the Virginia Theological Seminary, subsequently published on his personal website, which said "When I left office at the end of 2002 I felt the Anglican Communion was in good heart" but that, as a result of subsequent events "it is difficult to say in what way we are now a Communion."  This was reported on 11 June 2006 in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' ("Church has fallen apart since I was in charge, says Carey") and on 12 June 2006 in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' as an attack on his successor. An email from Carey on the day of publication was circulated in which he strongly denied this and said "I am hopping mad and will want a retraction from the ''Sunday Telegraph'', otherwise I will lodge a complaint."{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In November 2006, Carey was barred from delivering a [[Church Mission Society]] lecture at [[Bangor Cathedral]] by the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], who viewed that Carey had become "a factor of disunity and of disloyalty to Rowan Williams, a divisive force."<ref>{{cite news

===On ecumenical matters===
In October 2009, Carey said it was inexcusable that the Vatican gave a relatively short notice of its offer to receive some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] into the Roman Catholic Church within a [[personal ordinariate]], but he nonetheless gave a cautious welcome to the offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsok.com/anglicans-ex-leader-slams-vatican/article/feed/97169#ixzz0UqppeaVh |title=Anglicans' ex-leader slams Vatican |publisher=Newsok.com |date=24 October 2009 |access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref>

===On matters of trade===
In February 2006, Carey attracted more controversy by declaring in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' that a General Synod motion supported by his successor, [[Rowan Williams]], in favour of [[disinvestment]] in a company active in the occupied territories of Israel made him ashamed to be an Anglican.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lord Carey 'ashamed to be an Anglican' |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1138622572920&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708031020/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1138622572920&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |date=8 February 2006 |access-date=29 May 2008 }}</ref>

==Sex abuser Bishop Peter Ball==
During  Carey's term as Archbishop of Canterbury there were many complaints of serial sex abuse made against [[Peter Ball (bishop)|Peter Ball]], the bishop of Lewes and later of Gloucester until his resignation in 1993 after admitting to an act of gross indecency. Archbishop Carey wrote to the [[director of public prosecutions]] and the chief constable of Gloucester police, supporting Ball and saying that he was suffering "excruciating pain and spiritual torment".<ref>{{cite news|title=Archbishop and MPs wrote in support of bishop later convicted of sexual offences|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/archbishop-and-mps-wrote-in-support-of-accused-bishop-foi-request-reveals|access-date=11 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 December 2015}}</ref> In October 2015 Ball was sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment for misconduct in public office and indecent assault; he admitted the abuse of 18 young men aged 17–25.

[[Justin Welby]], who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013, commissioned an independent review by [[Moira Gibb]] in February 2016 to deal with the systematic failing of the Church in handling Ball's case.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dame Moira Gibb announced as Chair of independent review into Peter Ball case|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2016/02/dame-moira-gibb-announced-as-chair-of-independent-review-into-peter-ball-case.aspx|website=The Church Of England|access-date=11 October 2016|date=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Church appoints panel to examine its role in Peter Ball abuse case|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/23/church-appoints-panel-examine-role-peter-ball-abuse-case|access-date=11 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Inquiry to examine how much Church of England knew about sex abuser bishop|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12170893/Inquiry-to-examine-how-much-Church-of-England-knew-about-sex-abuser-bishop.html|access-date=11 October 2016|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=23 February 2016}}</ref>

In a statement submitted by Carey to pre-trial hearings regarding Ball, Carey said: "I was worried that if any other allegations were made it would reignite a police investigation. I was told quite categorically that any past indecency matters would not be taken further." Carey said the senior CPS official told him: "As far as we are concerned he has resigned. He is out of it. We are not going to take anything any further."<ref name=coverup/> He has repeatedly asserted that he was not trying to influence the outcome of the investigation.

On 22 October 2016 ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Carey accepted that he deserved criticism over his support of Peter Ball. Carey had requested that his, rather than the Church's, lawyers should represent him at the government's [[Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse]] where Carey had been granted "core participation" status, with the Church of England paying for the lawyers.<ref name=telegraph-20161022>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/22/former-archbishop-of-canterbury-admits-he-deserves-criticism-ove/ |title=Former Archbishop of Canterbury admits he deserves criticism over ex-bishop sex abuse 'cover up' |author=Robert Mendick |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=22 October 2016 |access-date=25 October 2016}}</ref>

Gibb's June 2017 report, "An Abuse of Faith", found that Carey was part of a [[cover-up]] that shielded Bishop Ball from prosecution.<ref name=coverup>{{cite news|title=Bishop Peter Ball victims accuse CoE police and CPS of sexual abuse cover up|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/08/bishop-peter-ball-victims-accuse-c-of-e-police-and-cps-of-sexual-abuse-cover-up|access-date=11 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 September 2015}}</ref><ref name="BBC colluded" /> The review found that Carey had received seven letters from families and individuals following Ball's arrest in 1992, but passed only one (the least disturbing) to the police.<ref name="BBC colluded" /> Carey did not add Ball to the Church of England's "Lambeth List" which names clergy about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised, provided Ball with funds, and wrote to Ball's brother [[Michael Ball (bishop)|Bishop Michael Ball]] in 1993, saying "I believed him to be basically innocent".<ref name="BBC colluded" />  Graham Sawyer, who survived abuse by Peter Ball, wants the police to investigate Carey's role in the Ball affair.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/church-of-england-colluded-with-bishop-peter-ball-who-abused-boys-says-justin-welby Justin Welby asks George Carey to quit over church abuse report]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40368573 Church 'colluded' with sex abuse bishop Peter Ball]</ref><ref>[http://freethinker.co.uk/2017/06/22/flaming-june-proves-a-harsh-month-for-church-of-england/ Flaming June proves a harsh month for Church of England]</ref>

Following production of the report, with its finding that he had covered up sex abuse allegations against bishop Peter Ball, Carey stated that the report made "deeply uncomfortable reading" and apologised to Ball's victims.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/22/senior-church-figures-colluded-disgraced-bishop-peter-ball-cover/ |title=Lord Carey criticised by damning report which finds Church 'colluded' with disgraced bishop Peter Ball to cover up sex offences |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 June 2017  |author=Olivia Rudgard |access-date= 26 June 2017}}</ref> Welby asked Carey to step down as an assistant bishop in the Church of England.<ref name="BBC colluded">{{cite news|title=Church 'colluded' with sex abuse bishop Peter Ball|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40368573|access-date=22 June 2017|agency=BBC|date=22 June 2017}}</ref> On 26 June, having spoken to the Bishop of Oxford, Carey resigned from his post as an honorary assistant bishop within the Diocese of Oxford, his last formal role in the church.<ref name="resign">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-40407464|title=Ex-Archbishop Lord Carey resigns after child abuse"review|date=26 June 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="BBC colluded" /> However, Carey did not resign his orders, nor his seat in the House of Lords, nor has he faced any formal ecclesiastical sanctions.
