For the opening night of the Oceanian leg of the tour in Auckland, New Zealand, Joanna Hunkin of the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' felt that Lady Gaga "group out-sang, outshone and out-sexed the Dolls, in half the time and half the space." Hunkin, who described the group as "poster girls"," criticized the "disappointingly budget set" and the lack of live musicians calling the show as "a glorified karaoke night [...] at the strip club." She concluded her negative review writing the "show proved the Dolls aren't dominating anything."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10572893|title=Review: Pussycat Dolls and Lady Gaga at Vector Arena|last=Hunkin|first=Joanna|date=May 18, 2009|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}</ref> Reviewing the same show, Clio Francis from the [[Stuff.co.nz]] agreed with Hunkin praising Gaga for "outshin[ing] the tawdry sexuality of the headliners." He also criticized the basic production while noting the "sound quality throughout their set was mediocre at best, with the over heavy bass at times smothering any passable melodies." However he noted that the night's encore "[brought] the night to a satisfying conclusion for most young fans."<ref name="Stuff.co.nz"/> Marissa Calligeros from ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' echoed previous comments, commending Gaga for "outshin[ing] and outclass[ing] the factory-made act of the headliners." She went to describe the Pussycat Dolls as "a teen dance troupe leading an amateur high school musical production," noting throughout show the audience largely stood motionless, due to the heavy bass. However she did praise Scherzinger's vocals calling them "impressive".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/pussycat-fans-go-gaga-instead-20090520-bf5g.html|title=Pussycat fans go Gaga instead|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa|date=May 20, 2009|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}</ref> Cameron Adams of the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' praised Gaga's vocal and piano skills whilst criticizing the group for an over-priced concert that looked more as "a shopping center performance than a headline arena show."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/lady-gaga-upstages-pussycat-dolls-at-rod-laver-arena/news-story/1192167ae680191228749602c47a0ce5|title=Lady Gaga upstages Pussycat Dolls at Rod Laver Arena|last=Adams|first=Cameron|date=May 26, 2009|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref>
