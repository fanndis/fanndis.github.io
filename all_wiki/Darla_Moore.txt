== Career ==

===Early career===
Moore started her career in 1976, working for the Republican National Committee in [[Washington, D.C.]] but decided that politics wasn't the field she wanted to pursue.<ref name=":2" /> In 1981, Moore then received an [[MBA]] from [[George Washington University]], three years after graduating from the University of South Carolina, and joined the training program at the [[Chemical Bank]].<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/sports/golf/darla-moore-new-augusta-member-knows-about-barriers.html?_r=0 |title=In World of Finance, One New Member Has Already Driven the Green|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-08-25|first=Mary|last=Pilon|date=2012-08-20}}</ref> She eventually served as vice-chair and subsequently as the banks managing director.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/01/12/reviews/970112.passell.html|title=Where the Money Is|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>

Moore has described her excitement to join the club in a statement to The New York Times, stating “I am honored to have accepted an invitation to join Augusta National Golf Club (...). Augusta National has always captured my imagination, and is one of the most magically beautiful places in the world, as everyone gets to see during the Masters each April. I am fortunate to have many friends who are members at Augusta National, so to be asked to join them as a member represents a very happy and important occasion in my life. Above all, Augusta National and the Masters tournament have always stood for excellence, and that is what is so important to me.

Moore met Richard Rainwater on a business trip to Texas.<ref name="knowitall1" /> In 1991, they were married in New York City in Park Avenue’s [[Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Brick Presbyterian Church]].<ref name="knowitall1" /> Rainwater’s net worth almost tripled due to his marriage to Moore, whose net worth was estimated at $2.3 billion in 2012.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="autogenerated1997" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2012/08/20/augusta-update-who-is-darla-moore/|title=Augusta Update: Who Is Darla Moore? - At Work - WSJ|author=|date=2012-08-20|accessdate=2015-08-25|publisher=Blogs.wsj.com}}</ref>

From 2001 forward Moore and Rainwater lived separately, she in [[South Carolina]], he in [[Texas]] and [[California]]. In March 2011, a court declared him incapacitated as a result of his battle with progressive [[supranuclear palsy]] (PSP), and his youngest child, Matthew, became his legal guardian. As his illness progressed, Rainwater's primary caregiver was his brother Walter until around-the-clock nursing care became necessary.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="nytimes.com" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/11/07/richard-rainwater-psp-fight/|title=The fight of Richard Rainwater's life - Fortune|author=|date=2011-11-07|accessdate=2015-08-25|publisher=Management.fortune.cnn.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314110245/http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/11/07/richard-rainwater-psp-fight/|archive-date=2013-03-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> Rainwater died September 27, 2015.

Since around 2008, Moore spends most of her time in Lake City in a house built on a plantation that has been in the Moore family for six generations (in recent years she has invested around $100 million into the city). Moore has turned the farmland of her property into the [[Moore Farms Botanical Garden]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/your-money/philanthropy-town-makeover.html|title=When Your Fixer-Upper Is Your Hometown|last=Sullivan|first=Paul|date=2018-04-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

She also owns homes in [[New York City]], [[Folsom, California]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Her hobbies include being a collector, mostly of 18th-century French furniture and rare books. In addition, Moore enjoyed riding with her husband in his [[1957 Chevy]], an iconic streetcar, before his illness began.<ref name="Don't Mess With Darla" />
