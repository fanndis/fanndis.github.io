The '''''New Statesman''''' is a British [[Political magazine|political]] and [[cultural]] [[magazine]] published in [[London]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Statesman |title=New Statesman {{!}} British magazine |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref> Founded as a weekly review of [[politics]] and [[literature]] on 12 April 1913, it was connected then with [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] and other leading members of the socialist [[Fabian Society]], such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], who was a founding director.

Today, the magazine is a print-digital hybrid. According to its present self-description, it has a [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|liberal]] and [[Progressivism in the United Kingdom|progressive]] political position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/page/about |title=About New Statesman |work=New Statesman |access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> [[Jason Cowley (journalist)|Jason Cowley]], the magazine's editor, has described the ''New Statesman'' as a publication "of the left, for the left"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-media-column-why-the-left-wing-new-statesman-is-stubbornly-resisting-the-lure-of-corbynmania-a6753721.html |title=Why the New Statesman is stubbornly resisting the lure of Corbynmania |date=2015-11-29 |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> but also as "a political and literary magazine" with "sceptical" politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/JasonCowleyNS/status/1121688267064336384|title=I thought that was very interesting and very revealing.

The magazine was founded by members of the Fabian Society as a weekly review of politics and literature. The longest-serving editor was [[Kingsley Martin]] (1930–1960), and the current editor is Jason Cowley, who assumed the post in 2008.

The magazine has recognised and published new writers and critics, as well as encouraged major careers. Its contributors have included [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], and [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]. Historically, the magazine was affectionately referred to as "The Staggers" because of its crises of funding, ownership, and circulation. The nickname is now used as the title of its politics blog.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bush |first=Stephen |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers |title=The Staggers |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2016-11-13 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

== History ==

===Early years===
[[File:New-Statesman-First-Issue-12-April-1913.jpg|thumb|The first issue of the ''New Statesman'', 12 April 1913]]
The ''New Statesman'' was founded in 1913 by Sidney and Beatrice Webb with the support of George Bernard Shaw and other prominent members of the Fabian Society.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/apr/09/fromthearchive |title=Launching the New Statesman &#124; From |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-04-09 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> The Fabians previously had supported ''[[The New Age]]'' but that journal by 1912 had moved away from supporting Fabian politics and issues such as [[women's suffrage]]. The first editor of the ''New Statesman'' was [[Clifford Sharp]], who remained editor until 1928. [[Desmond MacCarthy]] joined the paper in 1913 and became literary editor, recruiting [[Cyril Connolly]] to the staff in 1928. J.C. Squire edited the magazine when Sharp was on wartime duties during the First World War.

In November 1914, three months after the beginning of the war, the ''New Statesmen'' published a lengthy anti-war supplement by Shaw, "Common Sense About The War",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13635/13635-h/13635-h.htm#page11 |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Current History, The European War Volume I, by The New York Times Company }}</ref> a scathing dissection of its causes, which castigated all nations involved but particularly savaged the British. It sold a phenomenal 75,000 copies by the end of the year and created an international sensation. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reprinted it as America began its lengthy debate on entering what was then called "the European War".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13635/13635-h/13635-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Current History, The European War Volume I, by The New York Times Company |publisher=Gutenberg.org |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

During Sharp's last two years in the post, from around 1926, he was debilitated by chronic alcoholism and the paper was actually edited by his deputy [[Charles Mostyn Lloyd]]. Although the Webbs and most Fabians were closely associated with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Sharp was drawn increasingly to the [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/archive/2013/04/secret-life-clifford-sharp |title=The secret life of Clifford Sharp |work=New Statesman |first=Adrian |last=Smith |date=3 April 2013 |access-date=12 November 2018}}</ref>

Lloyd stood in after Sharp's departure until the appointment of Kingsley Martin as editor in 1930 – a position Martin was to hold for 30 years.

===1931–1960: Kingsley Martin===
In 1931 the ''New Statesman'' merged with the Liberal weekly ''[[The Nation and Athenaeum]]'' and changed its name to the ''New Statesman and Nation'', which it kept until 1964. The chairman of ''The Nation and Athenaeum''{{'}}s board was the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who came to be an important influence on the newly merged paper, which started with a circulation of just under 13,000. It also absorbed ''The Week-end Review'' in 1934 (one element of which survives in the shape of the ''New Statesman''{{'}}s Weekly Competition, and the other the "This England" feature). The Competition feature, in which readers submitted jokes and often parodies and pastiches of the work of famous authors, became one of the most famous parts of the magazine.<ref name="A competition!">{{cite web |title=A competition! |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2010/08/parodies |website=The Economist |access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref> Most famously, [[Graham Greene]] won second prize in a challenge to parody his own work.

During the 1930s, Martin's ''New Statesman'' moved markedly to the left politically. It became strongly anti-[[fascist]] and [[pacifist]], opposing British rearmament.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Benny|title=The Roots of Appeasement: The British Weekly Press and Nazi Germany During the 1930s|date=1991|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London|isbn=9780714634173|pages=26, 65, 73, 118, 134, 156, 178|edition=1st}}</ref> After the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'', Martin wrote: "Today if [[Neville Chamberlain|Mr. Chamberlain]] would come forward and tell us that his policy was really one not only of isolation but also of [[Little Englander|Little Englandism]] in which the [[British Empire|Empire]] was to be given up because it could not be defended and in which military defence was to be abandoned because war would totally end civilization, we for our part would wholeheartedly support him."<ref>''The Anti-Appeasers'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1971), pp. 156–157.</ref>

The magazine provoked further controversy with its coverage of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]]. In 1932, Keynes reviewed Martin's book on the Soviet Union, ''Low's Russian Sketchbook''. Keynes argued that Martin was "a little too full perhaps of good will" towards Stalin, and that any doubts about Stalin's rule had "been swallowed down if possible".<ref name="mt">{{cite book |last1=Beasley |first1=Rebecca |last2=Bullock |first2=Philip Ross |title=Russia in Britain, 1880-1940: From Melodrama to Modernism |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0199660865 |pages=209–224 |edition=1st}}</ref> Martin was irritated by Keynes's article but still allowed it to be printed.<ref name="mt"/> In a 17 September 1932 editorial, the magazine accused the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] press of misrepresenting the Soviet Union's agricultural policy but added that "the serious nature of the food situation is no secret and no invention". The magazine defended the Soviet [[Collective farming#Communist collectivization|collectivisation]] policy, but also said the policy had "proceeded far too quickly and lost the cooperation of farmers".<ref>{{cite book |first1=Patrick |last1=Wright |author-link=Patrick Wright (historian) |title=Iron Curtain: From Stage to Cold War |page=[https://archive.org/details/ironcurtainfroms0000wrig_a3q1/page/226 226] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0199231508 |url=https://archive.org/details/ironcurtainfroms0000wrig_a3q1/page/226}}</ref> In 1934 it ran an interview with Stalin by [[H. G. Wells]]. Although sympathetic to aspects of the Soviet Union, he disagreed with Stalin on several issues.<ref name="mt"/> The debate resulted in several more articles in the magazine; in one of them, George Bernard Shaw accused Wells of being disrespectful to Stalin during the interview.<ref name="mt"/>

In 1938 came Martin's refusal to publish [[George Orwell]]'s celebrated dispatches from Barcelona during the [[Spanish civil war]] because they criticised the communists for suppressing the [[anarchist]]s and the left-wing Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]). "It is an unfortunate fact", Martin wrote to Orwell, "that any hostile criticism of the present Russian regime is liable to be taken as propaganda ''against socialism''".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Bill |title=The Russia Complex: The British Labour Party and the Soviet Union |date=1977 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=Manchester, UK |isbn=9780719006968 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kPDoAAAAIAAJ&q=%22It%20is%20an%20unfortunate%20fact%2C%22%20Martin%20wrote%20to%20Orwell%2C%20%22that%20any%20hostile%20criticism%20of%20the%20present%20Russian%20regime%20is%20liable%20to%20be%20taken%20as%20propaganda%20against%20socialism.%22&pg=PA25}}</ref> Martin also refused to allow any of the magazine's writers to review [[Leon Trotsky]]'s anti-Stalinist book ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abu-Manneh |first1=Bashir |title=Fiction of the New Statesman, 1913-1939 |date=2011 |publisher=[[University of Delaware Press]] |location=Newark, DE |isbn=978-1611493528 |pages=169–170}}</ref>

Martin became more critical of Stalin after the [[Hitler-Stalin pact]], claiming Stalin was "adopting the familiar technique of the Fuhrer", and adding: "Like Hitler, he [Stalin] has a contempt for all arguments except that of superior force."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moorhouse |first1=Roger |title=The Devils' Alliance: Hitler's Pact with Stalin, 1939-1941 |date=2014 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1448104710 |page=cxxxviii}}</ref> The magazine also condemned the [[Winter War|Soviet Invasion of Finland]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corthorn |first1=Paul |title=In the Shadow of the Dictators: The British Left in the 1930s |date=2006 |publisher=Tauris Academic Studies |location=London [u.a.] |isbn=1850438439 |page=215}}</ref>

Circulation grew enormously under Martin's editorship, reaching 70,000 by the end of the Second World War. This number helped the magazine become a key player in Labour politics. The paper welcomed Labour's [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] victory but took a critical line on the new government's foreign policy. The young Labour [[Member of parliament|MP]] [[Richard Crossman]], who had become an assistant editor of the magazine before the war, was Martin's chief lieutenant in this period, and the ''Statesman'' published ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'', the pamphlet written by Crossman, [[Michael Foot]] and [[Ian Mikardo]], that most succinctly laid out the Labour left's proposals for a "third force" foreign policy rather than alliance with the United States.

During the 1950s, the ''New Statesman'' remained a left critic of British foreign and defence policy and of the Labour leadership of [[Hugh Gaitskell]], although Martin never got on personally with [[Aneurin Bevan]], the leader of the anti-[[Gaitskellite]] Labour faction. The magazine opposed the [[Korean War]], and an article by [[J. B. Priestley]] directly led to the founding of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

There was much less focus on a single political line in the back part of the paper, which was devoted to book reviews and articles on cultural topics. Indeed, with these pages managed by [[Janet Adam Smith]], who was literary editor from 1952 to 1960, the paper was sometimes described as a [[pantomime horse]]: its back half was required reading even for many who disagreed with the paper's politics. This tradition would continue into the 1960s with [[Karl Miller]] as Smith's replacement.

===1960-1996: After Kingsley Martin===
Martin retired in 1960 and was replaced as editor by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]], a politician and journalist who had resigned from the Labour government in 1951 along with Bevan and [[Harold Wilson]]. Freeman left in 1965 and was followed in the chair by [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], then on the left, under whose editorship the ''Statesman'' reached its highest ever circulation. For some, even enemies of Johnson such as [[Richard Ingrams]], this was a strong period for the magazine editorially.

After Johnson's departure in 1970, the ''Statesman'' went into a long period of declining circulation under successive editors: Richard Crossman (1970–72), who tried to edit it at the same time as playing a major role in Labour politics; [[Anthony Howard (journalist)|Anthony Howard]] (1972–78), whose recruits to the paper included [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Martin Amis]] and [[James Fenton]] (surprisingly, the arch anti-Socialist [[Auberon Waugh]] was writing for the ''Statesman'' at this time before returning to ''[[The Spectator]]''); Bruce Page (1978–82), who moved the paper towards specialising in investigative journalism, sacking [[Arthur Marshall (broadcaster)|Arthur Marshall]], who had been writing for the ''Statesman'' on and off since 1935, as a columnist, allegedly because of the latter's support for [[Margaret Thatcher]]; [[Hugh Stephenson (UK journalist)|Hugh Stephenson]] (1982–86), under whom it took a strong position again for [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]]; [[John Lloyd (journalist)|John Lloyd]] (1986–87), who swung the paper's politics back to the centre; [[Stuart Weir (UK journalist)|Stuart Weir]] (1987–90), under whose editorship the ''Statesman'' founded the [[Charter 88]] constitutional reform pressure group; and [[Steve Platt (UK journalist)|Steve Platt]] (1990–96).

The ''Statesman'' acquired the weekly ''[[New Society (magazine)|New Society]]'' in 1988 and merged with it, becoming ''New Statesman and Society'' for the next eight years, then reverting to the old title, having meanwhile absorbed ''[[Marxism Today]]'' in 1991. In 1993, the ''Statesman'' was sued by Prime Minister [[John Major]] after it published an article discussing rumours that Major was having an extramarital affair with a Downing Street caterer.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/29/world/british-premier-is-suing-two-magazines-for-libel.html |title=British Premier Is Suing Two Magazines for Libel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1993-01-29 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> Although the action was settled out of court for a minimal sum,<ref>{{cite news |author=Steve Platt, Fisk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/sue-grab-it-and-run-the-country-the-major-libel-case-was-a-farce-with-a-darker-side-says-steve-platt-editor-of-the-new-statesman-1483606.html |title=Sue, grab it and run the country: The Major libel case was a farce with a darker side, says Steve Platt, editor of the New Statesman |work=The Independent |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> the magazine's legal costs almost led to its closure.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2286916.stm |title=Major faces legal action over affair |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-09-29 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

In 1994, KGB defector [[Yuri Shvets]] said that the [[KGB]] utilised the ''New Statesman'' to spread disinformation. Shvets said that the KGB had provided disinformation, including forged documents, to the ''New Statesman'' journalist Claudia Wright which she used for anti-American and anti-Israel stories in line with the KGB's campaigns.<ref>The journal of intelligence history.

''New Statesman'' was the first periodical to go online, hosted by the www.cleanroom.co.uk, in 1995.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence. As written, it is unclear what this even means.|date=March 2018}}

===Since 1996===
The ''New Statesman'' was rescued from near-bankruptcy by a takeover by businessman Philip Jeffrey but in 1996, after prolonged boardroom wrangling<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-statesman |title=New Statesman {{!}} Media |website=The Guardian |access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref> over Jeffrey's plans, it was sold to [[Geoffrey Robinson]], the Labour MP and businessman. Following Steve Platt's resignation, Robinson appointed a former editor of ''[[The Independent]]'', [[Ian Hargreaves]], on what was at the time an unprecedentedly high salary. Hargreaves fired most of the left-wingers on the staff and turned the ''Statesman'' into a strong supporter of [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership of the Labour Party.<ref name=guardian-20050912/>

Hargreaves was succeeded by [[Peter Wilby]], also from the ''Independent'' stable, who had previously been the ''Statesman''{{′}}s books editor, in 1998. Wilby attempted to reposition the paper back "on the left". His stewardship was not without controversy. In 2002, for example, the periodical was accused of [[antisemitism]] when it published an investigative cover story on the power of the "Zionist lobby" in Britain, under the title "A Kosher Conspiracy?".<ref>{{cite news |last=Sewell |first=Dennis |title=A Kosher Conspiracy? |newspaper=New Statesman |date=14 January 2002 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200201140009 |access-date=26 August 2009}}</ref> The cover was illustrated with a gold [[Star of David]] resting on a [[Union Jack]]. Wilby responded to the criticisms in a subsequent issue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilby |first=Peter |title=The New Statesman and anti-Semitism |newspaper=New Statesman |date=11 February 2002 |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/194341 |access-date=26 August 2009}}</ref> During Wilby's seven-year tenure, the ''New Statesman'' moved from making a financial loss to having a good operating profit, though circulation only remained steady at around 23,000.<ref name=guardian-20050912>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/12/pressandpublishing.politicsandthemedia |title=Statesman-like regrets |last=Wilby |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Wilby |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 September 2005 |access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref>

[[John Kampfner]], Wilby's political editor, succeeded him as editor in May 2005 following considerable internal lobbying{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Under Kampfner's editorship, a relaunch in 2006 initially saw headline circulation climb to over 30,000. However, over 5,000 of these were apparently monitored free copies,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/18/pressandpublishing |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=The Statesman staggers on |last=Wilby |first=Peter |date=18 February 2008}}</ref> and Kampfner failed to maintain the 30,000 circulation he had pledged. In February 2008, Audit Bureau Circulation figures showed that circulation had plunged nearly 13% in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/14/abcs.pressandpublishing2 |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=New Statesman sales plummet |first=Chris |last=Tryhorn |date=14 February 2008}}</ref> Kampfner resigned on 13 February 2008, the day before the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)|ABC figures]] were made public, reportedly due to conflicts with Robinson over the magazine's marketing budget (which Robinson had apparently slashed in reaction to the fall in circulation).

In April 2008, Geoffrey Robinson sold a 50% interest in the magazine to businessman Mike Danson, and the remainder a year later.<ref>{{cite web |author=James Robinson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/14/new-statesman-ownership-mike-danson-geoffrey-robinson |title=Mike Danson takes full ownership of New Statesman &#124; Media |work=The Guardian |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> The appointment of the new editor [[Jason Cowley (journalist)|Jason Cowley]] was announced on 16 May 2008, but he did not take up the job until the end of September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |author=Brook, Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/16/pressandpublishing.media?gusrc=rss&feed=media |title=Jason Cowley named as New Statesman editor &#124; Media |work=The Guardian |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

The magazine published a 186-page centenary special in April 2013, the largest single issue in its history. It also published two special editions (250 and 150 pages), showcasing 100 years of the best and boldest journalism from its archives. In the following year it expanded its web presence by establishing two new websites: May2015.com, a polling data site focused on the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], and CityMetric, a cities magazine site under the tagline, "Urbanism for the social media age" and edited by Jonn Elledge.

It was announced in December 2016 that the Weekend Competition, a feature inherited from ''The Week-end Review'', would be discontinued, for reasons of space.

As of 2017, the ''New Statesman'' considers itself a "print-digital hybrid" with peak online traffic of over 4 million unique visitors per month, almost a four-fold increase since 2011. This compares to the magazine circulation of 35,000,<ref name=thedrum-20170223>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/02/23/new-statesman-editor-jason-cowley-shaking-its-house-journal-the-labour-party |title=New Statesman editor Jason Cowley on shaking off its 'house journal of the Labour Party' image |last=Burrell |first=Ian |newspaper=The Drum |date=23 February 2017 |access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> almost a third of which is given away for free each month.<ref>https://www.abc.org.uk/Certificates/49272086.pdf</ref>

At the 2017 British Society of Magazine Editors (BSME) awards, editor Jason Cowley was named Current Affairs and Politics editor of the year for the third time, defeating rivals from ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]''.

==Guest editors==
In March 2009 the magazine had its first guest editor, [[Alastair Campbell]], the former head of communications for Tony Blair. Campbell chose to feature his partner [[Fiona Millar]], Tony Blair (in an article "Why we must all do God"), football manager [[Alex Ferguson]], and [[Sarah Jane Brown|Sarah Brown]], the wife of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]. This editorship was condemned by [[Suzanne Moore]], a contributor to the magazine for twenty years. She wrote in a ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' article: "''New Statesman'' fiercely opposed the Iraq war and yet now hands over the reins to someone key in orchestrating that conflict".<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Suzanne |url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/debate/article-1163727/SUZANNE-MOORE-The-human-heart-Left-That-I-resign-New-Statesman-I-saw-Alastair-Campbell-did-it.html |title=SUZANNE MOORE: I had to resign from the New Statesman when I saw what Alastair Campbell did to it |work=[[The Mail on Sunday]] |date=2009-03-24 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>{{deprecated source|confirmed=y|date=November 2020}} Campbell responded: "I had no idea she worked for the ''New Statesman''. I don't read the ''Mail on Sunday''. But professing commitment to leftwing values in that rightwing rag lends a somewhat weakened credibility to anything she says."<ref>{{cite web |author=Owen Bowcott |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/23/new-statesman-alastair-campbell-labour |title=Knives out at New Statesman as Alastair Campbell editing stint sparks 'crisis of faith' &#124; Media |work=The Guardian |date=2009-03-23 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

In September 2009, the magazine was guest-edited by Labour politician [[Ken Livingstone]], the former mayor of London.<ref>{{cite web |author=Brook, Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/15/ken-livingstone-new-statesman |title=Ken Livingstone is New Statesman guest editor &#124; Media |work=The Guardian |date=2009-09-15 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

In October 2010, the magazine was guest-edited by British author and broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]]. The issue included a previously unpublished poem<ref>{{cite web |author=Kennedy, Maev |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/06/ted-hughes-sylvia-plath-poem-found |title=Unknown poem reveals Ted Hughes' torment over death of Sylvia Plath &#124; Books |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2010-10-06 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> by [[Ted Hughes]], "Last letter", describing what happened during the three days leading up to the suicide of his first wife, the poet [[Sylvia Plath]]. Its first line is: "What happened that night? Your final night."—and the poem ends with the moment Hughes is informed of his wife's death.

In April 2011, the magazine was guest-edited by human rights activist [[Jemima Khan]]. The issue featured a series of exclusives including the actor [[Hugh Grant]]'s secret recording<ref>{{cite web |author=Addley, Esther |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/06/phone-hacking-hugh-grant-taped |title=Phone hacking: Hugh Grant taped former NoW journalist &#124; Media |work=The Guardian |date=2011-04-06 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> of former ''[[News of the World]]'' journalist [[Paul McMullan (journalist)|Paul McMullan]], and a much-commented-on<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/07/nick-clegg-arm-candy-punchbag |title=Nick Clegg, you chose to be coalition arm-candy, so accept being a punchbag &#124; Simon Jenkins &#124; Opinion |work=The Guardian |date=2011-04-07 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> interview<ref>{{cite web |last=Phillipson |first=Bridget |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2011/04/clegg-interview-coalition-life |title=Jemima Khan meets Nick Clegg: 'I'm not a punchbag – I have feelings' |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2011-04-07 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> with Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]], in which Clegg admitted that he "cries regularly to music" and that his nine-year-old son asked him, "'Why are the students angry with you, Papa?'"

In June 2011, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], created a furore as guest editor by claiming that the Coalition government had introduced "radical, long term policies for which no one had voted" and in doing so had created "anxiety and anger" among many in the country. He was accused of being highly partisan, notwithstanding his having invited [[Iain Duncan Smith]], the Work and Pensions Secretary to write an article and having interviewed the Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] in the same edition. He also noted that the Labour Party had failed to offer an alternative to what he called "associational socialism". The ''Statesman'' promoted the edition on the basis of Williams' alleged attack on the government, whereas Williams himself had ended his article by asking for "a democracy capable of real argument about shared needs and hopes and real generosity".

In December 2011 the magazine was guest-edited by [[Richard Dawkins]]. The issue included the writer Christopher Hitchens's final interview,<ref>{{cite web |last=Reeves |first=Rachel |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/12/dawkins-hitchens-catholic |title=Preview: Richard Dawkins interviews Christopher Hitchens |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2011-12-13 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> conducted by Dawkins in Texas, and pieces by [[Bill Gates]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Philip Pullman]].

To evade China's internet censors, the ''New Statesman'' uploaded the issue to file-sharing sites such as [[BitTorrent]]. As well as writing that week's editorial,<ref>{{cite web |last=Weiwei |first=Ai |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/10/move-oppression-china-must-recognise-itself |title=To move on from oppression, China must recognise itself |work=New Statesman |date=2012-10-17 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> Ai Weiwei interviewed the Chinese civil rights activist [[Chen Guangcheng]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Weiwei |first=Ai |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/human-rights/2012/10/chen-guangcheng-facts-have-blood-evidence |title=Chen Guangcheng: "Facts have blood as evidence" |work=New Statesman |date=2012-10-17 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> who fled to the United States after exposing the use of compulsory abortions and sterilisations. The issue was launched on 19 October 2012 at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in London,<ref>{{cite web |last=Reeves |first=Rachel |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2012/10/pictures-ai-weiwei-launch-party |title=In pictures: Ai Weiwei launch party |work=New Statesman |date=2012-10-19 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> where speakers including artist [[Anish Kapoor]] and lawyer [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]] paid tribute to Ai Weiwei.

In October 2013 the magazine was guest-edited by [[Russell Brand]], with contributions from [[David Lynch]], [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Amanda Palmer]], and [[Alec Baldwin]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Reeves |first=Rachel |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2013/10/weeks-new-statesman-russell-brand-guest-edit |title=In this week's New Statesman: Russell Brand guest edit |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2013-10-25 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> as well as an essay by Brand.<ref>{{cite news |work=New Statesman |title=Russell Brand on revolution: "We no longer have the luxury of tradition" |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution |first=Russell |last=Brand |date=24 October 2013 |access-date=2013-10-25}}</ref>
