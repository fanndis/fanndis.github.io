==History==
The Aspen Music Festival and School was founded in 1949 by Chicago businessman [[Walter Paepcke]] and Elizabeth Paepcke as a two-week bicentennial celebration of the 18th-century German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref name="Berger2001">{{cite book|author=Bruce Berger|title=Music in the Mountains: The First Fifty Years of the Aspen Music Festival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftXgS5rrGAIC|year=2001|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|isbn=978-1-55566-311-7}}</ref> The event, which included both intellectual forums and musical performances, was such a success that it led to the formation of both the [[Aspen Institute]] and the Aspen Music Festival and School.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Proctor|first1=Jacob|title=Avant-Garde Aspen|url=http://www.aspensojourner.com/Aspen-Sojourner/Midwinter-2013/Avant-Garde-Aspen/|work=Aspen Sojourner|issue=Midwinter|date=2013}}</ref>

In the summers that followed, the participating musicians returned, bringing their music students, and the foundation was set for the AMFS as it is known today. In 1950, [[Igor Stravinsky]] became the first conductor to present his own works with the Festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=ADT19500727.2.12&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN--------0-|title=Aspen Daily Times July 27, 1950 — Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection|website=www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Brad|title=American Popular Music: Classical|date=2006|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=0-8160-5311-1|page=13}}</ref> The following year in 1951, the School enrolled its first official class, with 183 music students.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Romance of Commerce and Culture: Capitalism, Modernism, and the Chicago-Aspen Crusade for Cultural Reform|last1=Allen|first1=James Sloan|date=1986|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-01459-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/romanceofcommerc0000alle/page/262 262]|url=https://archive.org/details/romanceofcommerc0000alle/page/262}}</ref>

Early founding musicians included baritone [[Mack Harrell]] (father of cellist [[Lynn Harrell]]) and violinist [[Roman Totenberg]] (father of NPR legal correspondent Nina Totenberg).
