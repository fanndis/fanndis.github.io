== Media career ==
[[File:Xuxagemeas.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|News conference movie [[:pt:Xuxa Gêmeas|''Xuxa Gêmeas'']]]]

=== 1983–86: erotic film roles ===
Xuxa's first starring role was in ''[[Amor Estranho Amor]]'' (English title: Love Strange Love), a controversial 1982 Brazilian erotic film directed by [[Walter Hugo Khouri]] and produced by Anibal Massaini Neto for Cinearte.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Strange_Love|title=Love Strange Love|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} The plot involves an adult man's recollection of a short period in his life in 1937. As a teenager, he visited his mother, the favorite woman of an important politician, in a bordello owned by her, right before key political changes in Brazil. During this time he discovered his own sexuality. Although rather tame by modern standards, the movie was considered controversial because it contains two brief scenes of sensuality between the libertine character played by Xuxa and that of the innocent teenager.

=== 1983–86: Rede Manchete ===
Established as national beauty and sex symbol, Xuxa got the chance to move toward a career in television through an offer to host a small regional children's program, ''Clube da Criança'' for [[Rede Manchete]]. In this period, she worked as a model during the week in New York City and was taping her show during the weekend in Brazil.

Xuxa's triumphant entrances continued, in one of the stages, she stepped out of a pyramid. In the last segment of the program, Xuxa arrived in her iconic spaceship.

In parallel to ''Xuxa Park'', Xuxa commanded ''Xuxa Hits'' between 8 January and 16 April 1995 on Sunday afternoons on TV Globo. The program came as a picture of ''Xuxa Park'', but has become an independent program due to its great success. In attraction, Xuxa received several musical attractions like bands, DJs and singers. After its end, the program returned to be only a painting of the ''Xuxa Park''.

Inspired by ''Xuxa Hits'', the ''[[Planeta Xuxa]]'' was created, which premiered on 5 April 1997 and immediately became a fever among those who grew up following Xuxa's career. Initially, ''Planeta Xuxa'' was shown on TV Globo's Saturday afternoons, so Xuxa presented two shows simultaneously on the same day, as Xuxa Park occupied the broadcasters' mornings. As of 19 April 1998, the program began to be presented on Sunday afternoons due to the [[1998 World Cup]], remaining on Sundays until its closure in 2002. ''Planeta Xuxa'' was focused on the performances of musicians and bands.
