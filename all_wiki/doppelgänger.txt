A '''doppelgänger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|əl|ɡ|ɛ|ŋ|əɹ|,_|-|g|æ|ŋ|əɹ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈdɔpl̩ˌɡɛŋɐ|lang|De-doppelgaenger.ogg}}, literally "double-walker") is a biologically unrelated [[look-alike]], or a double, of a living person. 

In fiction and mythology, a doppelgänger is often portrayed as a ghostly or [[paranormal]] phenomenon and usually seen as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of bad luck. Other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an [[evil twin]]. In modern times, the term '''twin stranger''' is occasionally used.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|title=See what happened when 3 friends set out to find their ‘twin stranger’|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906134813/https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|archive-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The word "doppelgänger" is often used in a more general and neutral sense, and in slang, to describe any person who physically resembles another person.

==Spelling==
The word ''doppelgänger'' is a [[loanword]] from the German ''Doppelgänger'', a compound noun formed by combining the two nouns ''Doppel'' (double) and ''Gänger'' (walker or goer).<ref>''New Oxford American Dictionary'', 2nd Edition, 2005.</ref><ref>[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger Doppelgänger; Orthography, Meaning Synonyms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120074951/http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger |date=2012-11-20 }} http://www.duden.de {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AeW56Irr?url=http://www.duden.de/ |date=2012-09-13 }}.</ref> The singular and plural forms are the same in German, but English usually prefers the plural "doppelgängers". The first known use, in the slightly different form ''Doppeltgänger'', occurs in the novel ''[[Siebenkäs]]'' (1796) by [[Jean Paul]], in which he explains his [[neologism|newly coined word]] by a [[footnote]] – while actually the word ''Doppelgänger'' also appears, but with a quite different meaning.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pleasures of Abandonment: Jean Paul and the Life of Humor |url=https://archive.org/details/pleasuresofaband0000flem |url-access=registration |author=Paul Fleming |publisher=Königshausen & Neumann |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-8260-3247-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/pleasuresofaband0000flem/page/126 126], footnote 13 |quote=In one of the stranger twists of fate in literary history, Jean Paul coins two terms in ''Siebenkäs'', "Doppelgänger" and "Doppeltgänger." The term Jean Paul uses to describe Siebenkäs and Leibgeber is "Doppeltgänger," which he defines in a footnote: "So heißen Leute, die sich selber sehen" ["the name for people who see themselves"] (2, 67). Earlier in ''Siebenkäs'' the neologism "Doppelgänger" also appears for the first time and means something quite different. In a description of the wedding banquet in the first chapter, the food is so delicious and abundant that "not only was one course [''Gang''] served but also a second, a {{italics correction|''Doppelgänger''}}" ["nicht bloß ''ein'' Gang aufgetragen wurde, sondern ein zweiter, ein Doppelgänger"] (2, 42). "Gang" in German has multiple meanings, ranging from a "walk" to the "course" of a meal; according to Jean Paul, when people "see themselves," when one "goes twice," one is a "Doppeltgänger"; when one has a meal of two courses, in which the second doesn't come second but together with the first, this is a "Doppelgänger."}}</ref>

Like all [[noun]]s in German, the word is written with an initial [[capital letter]]. ''Doppelgänger'' and ''Doppelgaenger'' are essentially equivalent spellings, and ''Doppelganger'' is not alone different, but non-existent in German. Also, it would correspond to a different pronunciation. In English, the word should be written with a lower-case letter (doppelgänger) unless it is the first word of a sentence or part of a title; further, it is common to drop the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|umlaut]] on the letter "a", writing (and often pronouncing) "doppelganger".

==Mythology==
English-speakers have only recently applied this German word to a paranormal concept. [[Francis Grose]]'s, ''Provincial Glossary'' of 1787 used the term ''[[fetch (folklore)|fetch]]'' instead, defined as the "apparition of a person living." [[Catherine Crowe]]'s book on paranormal phenomena, ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848) helped make the German word well-known. However, the concept of [[alter ego]]s and double spirits has appeared in the folklore, myths, religious concepts, and traditions of many cultures throughout human history.<ref>Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}.</ref>

In [[Ancient Egyptian mythology]], a ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' was a tangible "spirit double" having the same memories and feelings as the person to whom the counterpart belongs. ''The Greek Princess'' presents an Egyptian view of the [[Trojan War]] in which a ''ka'' of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] misleads Paris, helping to stop the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} This memic sense also appears in [[Euripides]]' play [[Helen (play)|''Helen'']], and in [[Norse mythology]], a ''[[vardøger]]'' is a ghostly double who is seen performing the person's actions in advance. In [[Finnish mythology]], this is pattern is described as having an ''[[etiäinen]]'',<ref>Ganander, Christfrid.

==Examples in real life==

===John Donne===
[[Izaak Walton]] claimed that [[John Donne]], the English [[metaphysical poet]], saw his wife's doppelgänger in 1612 in Paris, on the same night as the stillbirth of their daughter.
<blockquote>
Two days after their arrival there, Mr. ''Donne'' was left alone, in that room in which Sir ''Robert'', and he, and some other friends had dinner together. To this place Sir ''Robert'' returned within half an hour; and, as he left, so he found Mr. ''Donne'' alone; but, in such ecstasy, and so altered as to his looks, as amazed Sir ''Robert'' to behold him in so much that he earnestly desired Mr. ''Donne'' to declare befallen him in the short time of his absence? to which, Mr. ''Donne'' was not able to make a present answer: but, after a long and perplexing pause, did at last say, ''I have seen a dreadful Vision since I saw you: I have seen my dear wife pass twice by me through this room, with her hair hanging about her shoulders, and a dead child in her arms: this, I have seen since I saw you.''  To which, Sir ''Robert'' replied; ''Sure Sir, you have slept since I saw you; and, this is the result of some melancholy dream, which I desire you to forget, for you are now awake.'' To which Mr. ''Donnes'' reply was: ''I cannot be surer that I now live, then that I have not slept since I saw you: and am, assure, that at her second appearing, she stopped, looked me in the face, and vanished.''<ref>Walton, Izaak. ''Life of Dr. John Donne.'' Fourth edition, 1675. Cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).</ref> </blockquote>

This account first appears in the edition of ''Life of Dr. Rizvan Rizing'' published in 1675, and is attributed to "a Person of Honour... told with such circumstances, and such asseveration, that... I verily believe he that told it to me, did himself believe it to be true. "At the time Donne was indeed extremely worried about his pregnant wife and was going through severe illness himself. However, R. C. Bald points out that Walton's account {{bquote|is riddled with inaccuracies. He says that Donne crossed from London to Paris with the Drurys in twelve days and that the vision occurred two days later; the servant sent to London to make inquiries found Mrs. Donne still confined to her bed in Drury House. Actually, of course, Donne did not arrive in Paris until more than three months after he left England, and his wife was not in London but in the [[Isle of Wight]]. The still-born child was buried on 24 January... Yet as late as 14 April Donne in Paris was still ignorant of his wife's ordeal.<ref>Bald, R.C. ''John Donne: a Life.'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1970.</ref> In January, Donne was still at [[Amiens]]. His letters do not support the story as given.<ref>Bennett, R.E. "Donne's Letters from the Continent in 1611-12."

===Percy Bysshe Shelley===
On July 8, 1822, the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] drowned in the [[La Spezia|Bay of Spezia]] near [[Lerici]] in [[Italy]]. On August 15, while staying at [[Pisa]], Percy's wife [[Mary Shelley]], an author and editor, wrote a letter to [[Maria Gisborne]] in which she relayed Percy's claims to her that he had met his own doppelgänger. A week after Mary's nearly fatal [[miscarriage]], in the early hours of June 23 Percy had had a [[nightmare]] about the house collapsing in a flood, and also

{{bquote|... talking it over the next morning he told me that he had had many visions lately — he had seen the figure of himself which met him as he walked on the terrace and said to him — "How long do you mean to be content" — No very terrific words & certainly not prophetic of what has occurred. But Shelley had often seen these figures when ill; but the strangest thing is that Mrs. Williams saw him. Now Jane, though a woman of sensibility, has not much imagination & is not in the slightest degree nervous — neither in dreams or otherwise. She was standing one day, the day before I was taken ill, [June 15] at a window that looked on the Terrace with Trelawny — it was day — she saw as she thought Shelley pass by the window, as he often was then, without a coat or jacket — he passed again — now as he passed both times the same way — and as from the side towards which he went each time there was no way to get back except past the window again (except over a wall twenty feet from the ground) she was struck at seeing him pass twice thus & looked out & seeing him no more she cried — "Good God can Shelley have leapt from the wall?.... Where can he be gone?" Shelley, said Trelawny — "No Shelley has past — What do you mean?" Trelawny says that she trembled exceedingly when she heard this & it proved indeed that Shelley had never been on the terrace & was far off at the time she saw him.<ref>Betty T. Bennett.

Percy Shelley's drama ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' (1820) contains the following passage in Act I: "Ere Babylon was dust, / The Magus Zoroaster, my dead child, / Met his own image walking in the garden. / That apparition, sole of men, he saw. / For know there are two worlds of life and death: / One that which thou beholdest; but the other / Is underneath the grave, where do inhabit / The shadows of all forms that think and live / Till death unite them and they part no more...."<ref>''Prometheus Unbound'', lines 191-199.</ref>

===Johann Wolfgang von Goethe===
Near the end of Book XI of his autobiography, ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' ("Poetry and Truth") (1811-1833), [[Goethe]] wrote, almost in passing:

<blockquote>
Amid all this pressure and confusion I could not forego seeing [[Friederike Brion|Frederica]] once more. Those were painful days, the memory of which has not remained with me. When I reached her my hand from my horse, the tears stood in her eyes; and I felt very uneasy. I now rode along the foot-path toward [[Drusenheim]], and here one of the most singular forebodings took possession of me. I saw, not with the eyes of the body, but with those of the mind, my own figure coming toward me, on horseback, and on the same road, attired in a dress which I had never worn, — it was pike-gray [''hecht-grau''], with somewhat of gold. As soon as I shook myself out of this dream, the figure had entirely disappeared. It is strange, however, that, eight years afterward, I found myself on the very road, to pay one more visit to Frederica, in the dress of which I had dreamed, and which I wore, not from choice, but by accident. However, it may be with matters of this kind generally, this strange illusion in some measure calmed me at the moment of parting. The pain of quitting for ever noble [[Alsace]], with all I had gained in it, was softened; and, having at last escaped the excitement of a farewell, I, on a peaceful and quiet journey, pretty well regained my self-possession.<ref>''The Autobiography of Wolfgang von Goethe.'' Translated by John Oxenford. Horizon Press, 1969. This example cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).</ref> </blockquote>

This is an example of a doppelgänger which was perceived by the observer to be both benign and reassuring.

===George Tryon===
A [[Victorian age]] example was the supposed appearance of [[Vice-Admiral]] [[George Tryon|Sir George Tryon]]. He was said to have walked through the drawing room of his family home in [[Eaton Square]], [[London]], looking straight ahead, without exchanging a word to anyone, in front of several guests at a party being given by his wife on 22 June 1893 while he was supposed to be in a ship of the Mediterranean Squadron, manoeuvering off the coast of Syria. Subsequently, it was reported that he had gone down with his ship, [[HMS Victoria (1887)|HMS ''Victoria'']], the very same night, after it collided with [[HMS Camperdown (1885)|HMS ''Camperdown'']] following an unexplained and bizarre order to turn the ship in the direction of the other vessel.<ref>{{cite book

In [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s novel, ''[[Glamorama]]'', protagonist actor-model Victor Ward, ostensibly, has a doppelgänger that people mistake for Ward, often claiming to have seen him at parties and events Ward has no recollection of attending. At one point in the novel, Victor heads to Europe but reports of him attending events in the states appear in newspaper headlines. However, Victor's doppelgänger may or may not have been placed by Victor's father, a United States senator looking to present a more intelligent and sophisticated replacement for his son that would improve his own image and boost his poll numbers for future elections. While the novel is narrated by Victor, various chapters are ambiguous, leading the reader to wonder if certain chapters are being narrated by the doppelgänger instead.
