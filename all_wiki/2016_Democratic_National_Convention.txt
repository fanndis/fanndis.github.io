The '''2016 Democratic National Convention''' was a [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating]] [[political convention|convention]], held at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], from July 25 to 28, 2016. The convention gathered [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], the majority of them elected through a preceding series of [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|primaries and caucuses]], to nominate a candidate for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election]]. Former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] was chosen as the party's nominee for president by a 54% majority of delegates present at the convention roll call, defeating primary rival Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], who received 46% of votes from delegates, and becoming the first female candidate to be formally nominated for president by a [[Political parties in the United States|major political party]] in the United States. Her running mate, Senator [[Tim Kaine]] from [[Virginia]], was confirmed by delegates as the party's nominee for vice president by [[acclamation]].

Delegates at the convention also adopted a party platform, through a [[voice vote]], to take to the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 elections]], touted as the "most [[progressivism in the United States|progressive]]" platform in the Democratic Party's history. The progressive shift was often credited to Sanders and the influence of platform-committee members appointed by him. The platform featured a focus on economic issues, such as [[Wall Street reform]], stronger [[financial regulation]], and raising the [[minimum wage]] to $15 an hour. [[Liberalism|Liberal]] stances on social issues, such as a call for [[criminal justice reform]] and an end to [[private prisons]], expansion of [[Social security (United States)|Social Security]], and the abolition of the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], also feature in the platform.

Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] delivered the keynote address of the convention, with [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] and Bernie Sanders serving as headlining speakers on the first day. Former President [[Bill Clinton]] served as headlining speaker on the convention's second day, while Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and President [[Barack Obama]] headlined on day three. Tim Kaine gave his vice presidential nomination acceptance speech on the third day of the convention, while [[Chelsea Clinton]] introduced Hillary Clinton to give her presidential nomination acceptance speech on the final day. Clinton's speech was generally well received, and she would go on to have a 7% [[convention bounce]] in national polling. Various performers also appeared during the convention, including [[Demi Lovato]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Lenny Kravitz]] and [[Katy Perry]]. Overall attendance at the convention was estimated to be around 50,000, according to Anna Adams-Sarthou, a representative of the DNC Host Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/dnc-by-the-numbers-226037|title=DNC by the numbers|work=[[Politico]]|author=Harrell, Donovan|date=July 26, 2016|access-date=September 27, 2018}}</ref>

The convention was not without controversy, as it was subject to various conflicts between supporters of the [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders]] and the Democratic Party. In the week prior to the convention, various emails from the [[Democratic National Committee]], the governing body of the Democratic Party, [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|were leaked and published]], showing bias against the Sanders' campaign on the part of the Committee and its chair, [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]]. Schultz subsequently resigned as chair of the Committee, and thus as chair of the [[Democratic National Convention]], with Congresswoman [[Marcia Fudge]] taking up the role of Convention chair. Some delegates in support of Sanders staged protests both outside and on the floor of the convention, opposing the nomination of Clinton and Kaine as the party's nominees for president and vice president, respectively.

Clinton and Kaine would go on to [[2016 United States presidential election#Results|win the popular vote]] in the general election, but ultimately lost the election to the Republican ticket of [[Donald Trump]] and his running mate [[Mike Pence]] in the electoral college.

== Background ==
In 2016, the Republican and Democratic conventions were held in late July before the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics]], instead of after the Olympics as in 2008 and 2012. One reason why the Republican Party scheduled its convention in July was to help avoid a longer, drawn-out primary battle (as in 2012). The Democrats then followed suit, scheduling their convention the week after the Republicans' convention, to provide a quicker response.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/23/politics/democratic-national-convention-date-set/ | title=Democratic National Convention date set | first=Alexandra | last=Jaffe | publisher=CNN | date=January 23, 2015 | access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

After all states had voted, Sanders stated, "I move that the convention suspend the procedural rules. I move that all votes, all votes cast by delegates be reflected in the official record, and I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States." Clinton had made a similar motion during the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|2008 convention]] roll call; however, Sanders (unlike Clinton in 2008) did not move to nominate Clinton by acclamation.<ref name="jwagner">{{cite news|last1=Wagner|first1=John|last2=Balz|first2=Dan|title=How Clinton and Sanders avoided a broken convention|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-clinton-and-sanders-avoided-a-broken-convention/2016/07/31/6fbaee28-5720-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html|access-date=31 July 2016|website=The Washington Post|date=31 July 2016}}</ref> Clinton became the first woman to be [[List of United States major party presidential tickets|nominated for president]] by a major U.S. political party.<ref>Alan Rappeport, Yamiche Alcindor & Jonathan Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/dnc-speakers-sanders-clinton.html "Democrats Nominate Hillary Clinton Despite Sharp Divisions"], ''The New York Times'' (July 26, 2016).</ref>

=== Platform provisions ===
[[File:Bernie Sanders (25878773721).jpg|thumb|Democratic presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] greatly influenced the party platform adopted at the convention, described by political commentators as the "most [[progressivism|progressive]]" in the party's history.]]
The full Platform Committee approved the Democratic platform following heated debate in Orlando on July 10, 2016; the platform was formally approved at the convention itself in Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-platform-draft-democrats-weigh-in-on-marijuana-climate-and-trade/|title=In platform draft, Democrats weigh in on marijuana, climate, and trade|website=CBS News|author=CBS News, Associated Press|date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>

The platform adopted by the platform committee was described by NBC News and by columnist [[Katrina vanden Heuvel]] as the most [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressive]] in party history, largely reflecting the influence of platform-committee members appointed by Bernie Sanders.<ref name="Seitz-Wald">Alex Seitz-Wald, [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/democrats-advance-most-progressive-platform-party-history-n606646 Democrats Advance Most Progressive Platform in Party History], NBC News (July 10, 2016).</ref><ref name="vanden Heuvel">Katrina vanden Heuvel, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-most-progressive-democratic-platform-ever/2016/07/12/82525ab0-479b-11e6-bdb9-701687974517_story.html The most progressive Democratic platform ever], ''The Washington Post'' (July 12, 2016).</ref>  The platform committee-drafted platform was praised by both Hillary Clinton's campaign<ref>Sophie Tatum, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/25/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-praises-democratic-platform-draft/ Clinton campaign hails progressive Democratic platform], CNN (June 25, 2016).</ref> and Bernie Sanders' campaign, with Sanders policy director Warren Gunnells saying his campaign achieved "at least 80 percent" of its goals.<ref name="Seitz-Wald" /> Although Sanders could have chosen, under party rules, to force a vote on the convention floor using a "minority report" process, he decided not to do so, with Gunnells telling supporters that the campaign had successfully secured the adoption of many of its platform goals and "that further platform fights would be portrayed in the corporate media as obstructionist and divisive".<ref>Alex Seitz-Wald, [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/bernie-sanders-rules-out-convention-floor-fights-platform-n608256 Bernie Sanders Rules Out Convention Floor Fights on Platform], NBC News (July 12, 2016).</ref>

The platform expresses support for raising the [[Minimum wage in the United States|federal minimum wage]] to $15 an hour and indexing it to inflation, a plank supported by Sanders.<ref name="Seitz-Wald" /><ref name="vanden Heuvel" /> The adoption of this point was a boost for the [[Fight for $15]] movement.<ref name="vanden Heuvel" /> The platform also calls for ending the [[Tipped wage in the United States|sub-minimum wage for tipped workers]] and workers with disabilities, and for twelve weeks of paid family and [[medical leave]].<ref name="vanden Heuvel" />

On health care, the platform committee adopted a provision supporting a [[public option]] for the [[Affordable Care Act]] and for legislation to allow Americans ages 55 and over to buy into Medicare.<ref name="vanden Heuvel" /> The platform committee voted down a more ambitious [[Medicare for All]] proposal supported by Sanders.<ref name="vanden Heuvel" /> The platform "repeats the Democratic Party pledge to empower Medicare to negotiate lower prices for [[prescription drug]]s" and also calls for "doubling support for [[community health center]]s that provide primary health-care services, particularly in rural areas.<ref name="vanden Heuvel" />

The platform expresses support for [[Wall Street reform]], the expansion of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and the abolition of the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], all points supported by Sanders.<ref name="Seitz-Wald" />

On [[financial regulation]] (Wall Street reform), the platform supports "a 21st-century [[Glass-Steagall Act]] to keep banks from gambling with [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|taxpayer-guaranteed deposits]]", calls for the breakup of "[[too big to fail]]" [[financial institution]]s, and supports a [[financial transactions tax|tax on excessive speculation]].<ref name="vanden Heuvel" />

The platform expresses support for [[criminal justice reform]], calls for an end to [[private prison]]s, and reforms to boost police accountability to communities.<ref name="vanden Heuvel" /> The platform calls for shutting "the [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] between Wall Street and Washington," calling for "a ban on golden parachutes for bankers taking government jobs, limits on conflict of interest, and a two-year ban on financial services regulators 'from lobbying their former colleagues.'"<ref name="vanden Heuvel" />

On taxation, the platform pledges "tax relief" to [[American middle class|middle-class families]]. The platform also calls for the end of overseas [[tax deferral]] and the [[carried interest]] tax loophole, as well as a crackdown on [[corporate inversion]]s.<ref name="vanden Heuvel" />

On [[K–12 education]], the party's platform was revised "in important ways, backing the right of parents to opt their children out of [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes]] [[standardized tests]], qualifying support for [[charter school]]s, and opposing using test scores for high-stakes purposes to evaluate teachers and students."<ref name="StraussEd">Valerie Strauss, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/07/12/democrats-make-key-education-revisions-to-2016-platform-and-a-key-reformer-is-furious/ Democrats make education revisions to 2016 platform — and a key reformer is furious], ''The Washington Post'' (July 12, 2016).</ref> The platform calls for "democratically governed great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools," and opposes "[[For-profit education|for-profit]] charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources".<ref name="StraussEd" />

On [[workers' rights]], "the platform endorses expanding and defending the right of workers to organize unions and [[Collective bargaining|bargain collectively]]."<ref name="vanden Heuvel" /> The platform supports the ability of workers to organize via [[card check]] and "calls for a 'model employer' executive order that would give preference in government procurement to employers who provide their workers with a [[living wage]], benefits and the opportunity to form a union."<ref name="vanden Heuvel" />

The platform committee approved compromise language on the controversial practice of [[hydraulic fracturing]] (fracking), calling for increased federal, state and local regulation of the practice but not a wholesale ban, as Sanders had pushed for.<ref name="Seitz-Wald" />

The platform drafting committee twice voted down an amendment, supported by Sanders and advanced by one of his appointees,  Rep.

In a close, 81–80 vote, the platform committee approved language supporting the [[removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|removal of marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act]], "providing a reasoned pathway for future [[Cannabis in the United States|legalization]]" of marijuana.<ref>David Weigel, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/09/democrats-call-for-pathway-to-marijuana-legalization/ Democrats call for 'pathway' to marijuana legalization], ''The Washington Post'' (July 9, 2016).</ref>

== Convention chair ==

On July 23, party officials announced that Democratic National Committee chairwoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] would not preside over or speak at the convention. The announcement came after the leak of 20,000 emails by seven DNC staffers from January 2015 to May 2016, during the Democratic primary season. The emails showed the staffers favoring Clinton and disparaging Sanders. Wasserman Schultz's removal from convention activities was approved by both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. In her place, the Rules Committee named Representative [[Marcia Fudge]] of [[Ohio]] as convention chair.<ref>Theodore Schleifer, Eugene Scott & Jeff Zeleny, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/dnc-wikileaks-emails/ Debbie Wasserman Schultz not presiding over Democratic convention], CNN (July 24, 2016).</ref> [[Chris Cillizza]] of ''The Washington Post'' described this as "a remarkable snub for a sitting party chair".<ref>Chris Cillizza, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/24/debbie-wasserman-schultzs-worst-week-in-washington-2/ Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Worst Week in Washington], ''The Washington Post'' (July 24, 2016).</ref>

== Superdelegate reform ==
On July 24, the DNC Rules Committee voted overwhelmingly, 158–6, to adopt a [[superdelegate]] reform package. The new rules were the result of a compromise between the Clinton and the Sanders campaigns; in the past, Sanders had pressed for the complete elimination of superdelegates.<ref name="Weigel">David Weigel, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/23/democrats-vote-to-bind-most-superdelegates-to-state-primary-results/ Democrats vote to bind most superdelegates to state primary results], ''The Washington Post'' (July 23, 2016).</ref>

Under the reform package, in future Democratic conventions about two-thirds of superdelegates would be bound to the results of state primaries and caucuses. The remaining one third—Democratic senators, Democratic governors and Democratic U.S. representatives—would remain unbound and free to support the candidate of their choice.<ref name="Weigel" />

Under the reform package, a 21-member unity commission, chaired by Clinton supporter Jennifer O'Malley Dillon and vice-chaired by Sanders supporter [[Larry Cohen (union leader)|Larry Cohen]], is to be appointed "no later than 60 days" after the November 2016 general election. The commission would report by January 1, 2018, and its recommendations would be voted on at the next Democratic National Committee meeting, well before the beginning of the 2020 Democratic primaries.<ref name="Weigel" /> The commission was to consider "a mix of Clinton and Sanders ideas, including expanding 'eligible voters' ability to participate in the caucuses in caucus states, a gripe of Clinton's campaign, and encouraging 'the involvement in all elections of unaffiliated or new voters who seek to join the Democratic Party through [[Same-day voter registration|same-day registration]] and re-registration'", which is one of Sanders' demands.<ref name="Weigel" /> The commission drew comparisons to the [[McGovern–Fraser Commission]], which established party primary reforms before the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name="Weigel" />
