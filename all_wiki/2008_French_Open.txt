On the men's side, [[Rafael Nadal]] won the Men's Singles, and equalled [[Björn Borg]]'s record of four consecutive French Open titles in the open era.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other competitions included men and women's doubles, junior singles and doubles as well as wheelchair and 'veteran' competitions.

The 2008 edition marked the first time in the [[Open Era]] no American man or woman reached the singles' quarterfinals at Roland Garros.

==Notable stories==

===Justine Henin's Retirement===
On May 14, 2008, less than two weeks before the start of the 2008 French Open, defending champion and [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] [[Justine Henin]], announced in a press conference her immediate retirement from the sport. Four-time winner in [[French Open|Roland-Garros]], where she defeated [[Kim Clijsters]] in [[2003 French Open|2003]], [[Mary Pierce]] in [[2005 French Open|2005]], [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in [[2006 French Open|2006]] and [[Ana Ivanovic]] in [[2007 French Open|2007]], Henin became the first player, at 25, to stop her career while holding the number one rank. Despite undergoing a poor run in the [[2008 WTA Tour|2008 season]], Henin was still considered to be a strong favourite for the [[French Open]] crown. Her retirement left [[Serena Williams]], the [[2002 French Open|2002]] champion and the tournament favourite this year, as the only former French Open champion remaining in the women's draw, and allowed [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] World No. 2 [[Maria Sharapova]] to be installed as the new World No. 1, and become the top seed for the tournament.<ref name="Henin Retires From Sony Ericsson WTA Tour">{{cite news|author=sonyericssonwtatour.com |title=Henin Retires From Sony Ericsson WTA Tour |url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2255 |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519144639/http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2255 |archivedate=2008-05-19 }}</ref><ref name="Henin">{{cite news|author=BBC Sport|title=Henin announces shock retirement| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7399963.stm|date =2008-05-14| accessdate =2008-06-11|work=BBC News}}</ref> Henin's last match was against [[Dinara Safina]], who went on to have a successful French Open, reaching the final, where she was beaten by Ana Ivanovic.

===The Williams' sisters performance===
[[Image:Katarina Srebotnik at the 2010 US Open 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Katarina Srebotnik]] knocked [[Serena Williams]] out of the French Open in the third round. Her triumph ensured that there would be a new champion in 2008.]]
This tournament saw the worst performance by any of the [[Williams sisters]] at a Grand Slam tournament since the [[2006 Australian Open]].<ref name="Williams-sisters-beaten">[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=3418434 Williams sisters sent packing -- on the same day - Tennis - ESPN]</ref>

[[Serena Williams]], the only former French Open champion left in the draw, was stunned in the third round by [[Katarina Srebotnik]], ensuring that there would be a new champion this year.<ref name="Serena-defeated"/> Williams had never previously lost to Srebotnik in four previous attempts, and had defeated her in the second round of the [[2001 French Open]] and as recently as in the third round of the [[2008 Family Circle Cup]], where she won the title as part of a seventeen-match winning streak compiled between February and May. Her third round exit was her worst performance at the tournament since 1999, when she also fell in the third round. Two [[ESPN]] experts had touted Serena Williams as the pre-tournament favourite; those same two experts also predicted that [[Ana Ivanovic]], the [[2007 French Open|2007]] runner-up whom Serena Williams would have met in the quarter-finals, would make an early exit,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/news/story?id=3409403 Who will win the French Open women's title? - Tennis - ESPN]</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/news/story?id=3409577 Devoid of Justine Henin, Williams, Sharapova looking to make their mark - Tennis - ESPN]</ref> when, in fact, the exact opposite occurred and Ivanovic won the championship amidst a form slump which saw her suffer early defeats in [[2008 Sony Ericsson Open|Miami]] and [[2008 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=3430890 Maturation, confidence evident in Ivanovic's title run - Tennis - ESPN]</ref> Williams had said prior to the French Open that she had "enjoyed her best preparation since winning the event in 2002"; entering the tournament, she had won 23 matches and lost just two (to [[Jelena Janković]] at the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and [[Dinara Safina]] in [[2008 German Open (tennis)|Berlin]]) for the season.

On the same day as Serena Williams' defeat, older sister [[Venus Williams]] was upset by World No. 26 [[Flavia Pennetta]], who had never previously advanced past the fourth round of the French Open, in the third round,<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-05-31/nadal-djokovic-on-course-in-paris/2454798 Nadal, Djokovic on course in Paris - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref> adding to her recent history of early exits at the French Open. This marked the first time since the [[2004 French Open]] that both the Williams sisters were defeated within 24 hours of each other;<ref name="Williams-sisters-beaten"/> on that occasion, both were defeated in the quarter-finals by [[Jennifer Capriati]] and [[Anastasia Myskina]], who then went on to contest a semi-final between each other.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-06-02/williams-sisters-sent-packing-from-paris/1985704 Williams sisters sent packing from Paris - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref>

===Guga's Goodbye===
The 2008 French Open saw the last appearance on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP Tour]] of [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|former World No. 1]] [[Gustavo Kuerten|Gustavo "Guga" Kuerten]].<ref name="Guga bids a champion's goodbye">{{cite news|author=Matthew Cronin|title=Guga bids a champion's goodbye| url =http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/news/articles/2008-05-25/200805251211738989328.html|date =2008-05-28| accessdate =2008-05-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527190544/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/news/articles/2008-05-25/200805251211738989328.html  |archivedate = 2008-05-27}}</ref> The 31-year-old Brazilian champion, had been awarded a wild card to play his final tournament in [[French Open|Roland-Garros]], where he won his three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles in [[1997 French Open|1997]], [[2000 French Open|2000]] and [[2001 French Open|2001]]. Kuerten played his first round, and final singles match on [[Court Philippe Chatrier]] against eighteenth-seeded [[Paul-Henri Mathieu]]. Kuerten conceded the victory in straight sets after a little less than two hours on the court. A ceremony followed, where Kuerten was awarded a trophy encasing the multiple layers of the French Open's clay courts. Kuerten played his last match in the men's doubles with [[Sébastien Grosjean]]. The pair was defeated after three sets by [[Florin Mergea]] & [[Horia Tecău]] on the score of 5–7, 6–3, 6–1, ending the very final appearance of Gustavo Kuerten on the tour.

===Prix Orange, Citron & Bourgeon===
As each year since 1981, three trophies are awarded during the tournament to the players of [[French Open|Roland-Garros]]: the Prix Orange (Orange Prize), awarded by the public to the player with the most sportsmanship, the Prix Citron (Lemon Prize), awarded by both the public and a journalists' association to the player with the strongest nature, and the Prix Bourgeon (Bud Prize), given by the journalists only to the most improved player of the year. In 2008, the Prix Orange was received, for the fourth year in a row, by [[Roger Federer]], who came first of a tally with five choices, followed by [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Gustavo Kuerten]], [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] and [[Carlos Moyá]]. The Prix Citron was obtained by [[Fabrice Santoro]], who preceded [[Novak Djoković]], [[Maria Sharapova]], [[Serena Williams]] and [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] in the votes. The Prix Bourgeon was given by the press to [[Alizé Cornet]], ahead of [[Janko Tipsarević]] and [[Ernests Gulbis]]. [[Gustavo Kuerten]], already the recipient of three Prix Orange in 1998, 2002, and 2004, was presented a special ten-year prize for fair-play, in honor of his career and his successes at the [[French Open]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.orange-citrontv.org/ |title=Prix Orange, Citron & Bourgeon website |access-date=2008-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531222414/http://www.orange-citrontv.org/ |archive-date=2007-05-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the men's field, all eyes were turned to a clash between [[Paul-Henri Mathieu]] and [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|former No. 1]], [[1997 French Open|1997]], [[2000 French Open|2000]] and [[2001 French Open]] champion [[Gustavo Kuerten]], which saw the Frenchman winning 6–3, 6–4, 6–2, marking the closure of Kuerten's career.

The men's doubles final featured second seeds Canadian [[Daniel Nestor]], a nine-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles finalist, winner of the [[2007 French Open]] with [[Mark Knowles]], & Serbian [[Nenad Zimonjić]], a two-time doubles final runner-up in [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], and unseeded South American duo, composed of Uruguayan [[Pablo Cuevas]], No. 50 in the doubles rankings, & Peruvian [[Luis Horna]], No. 43 in the doubles rankings, on their first ever [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] final appearance separately and together. The unseeded South Americans completely dominated the seasoned champions during the final, breaking them twice in each set, never losing their serve themselves, to crush Nestor & Zimonjic in only fifty-six minutes, on the score of 6–2, 6–3, and win their first doubles title together. [[Pablo Cuevas]] & [[Luis Horna]] knocked out four seeded teams, [[Arnaud Clément]] & [[Michaël Llodra]], [[Lukáš Dlouhý]] & [[Leander Paes]], World No. 1 pair [[Bob Bryan|Bob]] & [[Mike Bryan]], and ultimately [[Daniel Nestor]] & [[Nenad Zimonjić]] on their way to becoming the first South American team to win a Men's Doubles [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] title, and the [[List of French Open Men's Doubles champions|2008 French Open men's doubles champions]].<ref name="Horna/Cuevas Surprise Roland Garros Champions">{{cite news|author=atptennis.com|title=Horna/Cuevas Surprise Roland Garros Champions| url =http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/doubles/2008news/rolandgarros8.asp|date =2008-06-06| accessdate =2008-06-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Day 15===
The men's singles final took place at 15:00 ([[UTC+2]]) on the [[Court Philippe Chatrier|Philippe Chatrier Central Court]], and featured, for the third straight year after [[2006 French Open|2006]] and [[2007 French Open|2007]], the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] and holder of twelve [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles, [[Roger Federer]], and [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]], the winner in [[French Open|Roland-Garros]] since [[2005 French Open|2005]]. Federer decided to serve after being given the choice, but the Spaniard immediately attacked the Swiss' serve, and broke him, winning his own service game to quickly open a 2–0 lead. Though Federer won his following serve, he was not able in the rest of the set to convert the few break points he had on Nadal's serve, or win his own service games, allowing the Spaniard to close the first set in thirty-two minutes, on the score of 6–1. Despite being broken in the beginning of the second set, Federer started to fight back, as he finally took Nadal's serve, came back to 2–2, and held to 3–3. After a long game on Federer's serve, Nadal finally broke once more, and rapidly finished the set on the score of 6–3, after forty-nine minutes. There was no competition in what would become the final set as Nadal left no chances to Federer, and the Swiss was not able to find a second breath to start a comeback, not winning any game in the twenty-seven minutes set, and suffering a [[Tennis terminology#B|bagel]] for the first time in a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] since a [[1999 French Open – Men's Singles#Section 6|1999 Roland-Garros first round loss]] to [[Pat Rafter]].<ref name="Nadal storms to fourth French Open">{{cite news|author=BBC Sport|title=Nadal storms to fourth French Open| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7441733.stm|date =2008-06-08| accessdate =2008-06-08|work=BBC News}}</ref> Particularly relevant to the outcome of their meeting were Federer's thirty-five unforced errors to Nadal's seven during the brief match which never allowed him to gain a foothold. [[Rafael Nadal]] claimed his fourth consecutive [[French Open]] crown, on the final score of 6–1, 6–3, 6–0, and in becoming the [[List of French Open Men's Singles champions and finalists|2008 French Open champion]] equalled [[Björn Borg]]'s record of four straight [[French Open|Roland-Garros]] titles, and extended his win-loss record at the tournament to 28–0.<ref name="SundayTale3">{{cite news|author=Drew Lilley|title=Sunday 8 June: Tale of the day| url =http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/news/articles/2008-06-08/200806081212948555078.html|date =2008-06-08| accessdate =2008-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609180236/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/news/articles/2008-06-08/200806081212948555078.html  |archivedate = 2008-06-09}}</ref><ref name="Rafa Races to Fourth Straight Roland Garros Title">{{cite news|author=atptennis.com |title=Rafa Races to Fourth Straight Roland Garros Title |url=http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/rg_sunday3.asp |date=2008-06-08 |accessdate=2008-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828164234/http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/rg_sunday3.asp |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}</ref>
