'''Turner Classic Movies''' ('''TCM''') is an American [[movie channel|movie-oriented]] [[pay television|pay-TV]] [[television network|network]] operated by  [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[AT&T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]. Launched in 1994, TCM is headquartered at Turner's Techwood broadcasting campus in the [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]] business district of [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The channel's programming consists mainly of [[Golden age (metaphor)|classic]] theatrically released [[feature film]]s from the [[Turner Entertainment]] film library – which comprises films from [[Warner Bros.]] (covering films released before 1950), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (covering films released before May 1986), and the North American distribution rights to films from [[RKO Pictures]]. However, TCM also licenses films from other studios, and occasionally shows more recent films.

The channel is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, [[Latin America]], France,  Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the [[Nordic countries]], the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1986, eight years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, [[Ted Turner]] acquired the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio for $1.5 billion. Concerns over [[Turner Entertainment]]'s corporate [[debt]] load resulted in [[Turner Entertainment#Background|Turner selling the studio]] that October back to [[Kirk Kerkorian]], from whom Turner had purchased the studio less than a year before.<ref name="Fabrikant">[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/07/business/turner-to-sell-mgm-assets.html Fabrikant, Geraldine. "Turner to Sell MGM Assets."] ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 7, 1986.</ref>

As part of the deal, Turner Entertainment retained ownership of MGM's library of films released up to May 9, 1986. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was split into two companies; Turner Broadcasting System and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and reincorporated as [[MGM/UA Communications Co.]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The film library of Turner Entertainment would serve as the base form of programming for TCM upon the network's launch. Before the creation of Turner Classic Movies, films from Turner's library of movies aired on the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]'s advertiser-supported cable network [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] – along with [[colorized]] versions of black-and-white classics such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''.

===Launch and contributions===

[[File:Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards for Turner Classic Movies.jpg|thumb|In May 2009, host Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh, senior vice president for programming, accepted TCM's Institutional [[Peabody Award]] "for a continuing, powerful commitment to a central concept—the place of film in social and cultural experience".<ref name="Peabody">{{cite web |url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/institutional-award-turner-classic-movies |title=The Peabody Awards, Institutional Award: Turner Classic Movies (TCM) |publisher=Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Georgia |access-date=2018-07-12 }}</ref>]]
Turner Classic Movies debuted on April 14, 1994, at 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], with [[Ted Turner]] launching the channel at a ceremony in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164443/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15426709.html Mitchell, Kim; Rod Granger.

Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research.</ref> The date and time were chosen for their historical significance as "the exact centennial anniversary of the first public movie showing in New York City". The first movie broadcast on TCM was the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the same film that served as the debut broadcast of its sister channel [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] six years earlier in October 1988.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/03/arts/tv-notes.html|title=TV Notes|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|date=1988-10-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> At the time of its launch, TCM was available to approximately one million cable television subscribers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164517/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15308051.html Brown, Rich.

The network originally served as a competitor to [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]—which at the time was known as "American Movie Classics" and maintained a virtually identical format to TCM, as both networks largely focused on films released prior to 1970 and aired them in an uncut, [[colorizing|uncolorized]], and commercial-free format. AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films by 2002.

In 1996, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] merged with [[Time Warner]] which, besides placing Turner Classic Movies and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]] under the same corporate umbrella, also gave TCM access to Warner Bros.' library of films released after 1950 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar]], [[Saul Zaentz]] and [[National General Pictures]] libraries); incidentally, TCM had already been running select Warner Bros. film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164234/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14791509.html "Turner picks up Warner films"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', December 6, 1993. Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research:</ref>

In the early 2000s, AMC abandoned its commercial-free format, which then led to TCM being the only movie-oriented basic cable channel to devote its programming entirely to classic films without commercial interruption or content editing.

On March 4, 2019, Time Warner's new owner [[AT&T]] (who renamed the company WarnerMedia) announced a planned reorganization that would dissolve Turner Broadcasting. TCM, along with [[Cartoon Network]], [[Adult Swim]], and over-the-top video company [[Otter Media]], will be moved directly under Warner Bros. (the remaining Turner networks will be divided into WarnerMedia Entertainment and WarnerMedia News & Sports divisions). Speaking about the move, then-Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] explained that TCM was "a natural fit with Warner Bros." due to the company's massive film library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/warnermedia-shakeup-bob-greenblatt-hbo-turner-cnn-1203154109/|title=WarnerMedia Shakeup: Bob Greenblatt In, Jeff Zucker and Kevin Tsujihara Gain Turf|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|last2=Littleton|first2=Cynthia|date=2019-03-04|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/warner-bros-cartoon-network-hanna-barbera-1203154521/|title=Warner Bros.

===TCM Young Composers Film Competition===

In 2000, TCM started the annual Young Composers Film Competition, inviting aspiring composers to participate in a judged competition that offers the winner of each year's competition the opportunity to score a restored, feature-length [[silent film]] as a grand prize, mentored by a well-known composer, with the new work subsequently premiering on the network. As of 2006, films that have been rescored include the 1921 [[Rudolph Valentino]] film ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]]'', two [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] films: 1921's ''[[The Ace of Hearts (1921 film)|The Ace of Hearts]]'' and 1928's ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'', and [[Greta Garbo]]'s 1926 film ''[[The Temptress]]''.

===TCM Classic Film Festival===

In April 2010, Turner Classic Movies held the first TCM Classic Film Festival, an event—now held annually—at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]] and the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Initially hosted by [[Robert Osborne]], the four-day long annual festival celebrates Hollywood and its movies, and featured celebrity appearances, special events, and screenings of around 50 classic movies including several newly restored by ''[[The Film Foundation]]'', an organization devoted to preserving Hollywood's classic film legacy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605175654/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |title=New TCM Film Festival goes head-to-head with Tribeca |publisher=New York Post |date=November 5, 2009 |first=Lou |last=Lumenick |access-date=2012-03-16 }}</ref> The festival was postponed in 2020 and 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=TCM Classic Film Festival Postponed until 2022.|url=https://deadline.com/2020/10/tcm-classic-film-festival-cancels-2021-live-event-virtual-1234589801/#:~:text=In%20a%20letter%20sent%20to,a%20virtual%20format%20in%202021.}}</ref>

==Programming==
Turner Classic Movies essentially operates as a [[television commercial|commercial]]-free service, with the only advertisements on the network being shown between features – which advertise TCM products, [[Promo (media)|network promotions]] for upcoming special programs and the original [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for films that are scheduled to be broadcast on TCM (particularly those that will air during the primetime hours), and featurettes about classic film actors and actresses. In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects – from series such as ''The Passing Parade'', ''Crime Does Not Pay'', ''[[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith Specialties]]'', and [[Robert Benchley]] – under the banner name ''TCM Extras'' (formerly ''One Reel Wonders''). In 2007, some of the [[short film]]s featured on TCM were made available for [[streaming media|streaming]] on TCM's website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.

TCM's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or [[post-production|post-produced]] in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[MPAA film ratings system|ratings system]] and the concurrent disestablishment of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Because of this, TCM is formatted similarly to a [[pay television|premium channel]] with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring [[nudity]], sexual content, [[violence]] and/or strong [[profanity]]; the network also features rating [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] prior to the start of a program (most programs on TCM, especially films, are rated for content using the [[TV Parental Guidelines]], in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).

The network's programming season runs from March of one year until the following February of the next when a retrospective of [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called ''31 Days of Oscar''. As a result of its devoted format to classic [[feature film]]s, viewers who are interested in tracing the career development of actresses such as [[Barbara Stanwyck]] or [[Greta Garbo]] or actors like [[Cary Grant]] or [[Humphrey Bogart]] have the unique opportunity to see most of the films that were made during their careers, from beginning to end. Turner Classic Movies presents many of its features in their original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] ([[widescreen]] or full screen) whenever possible – widescreen films broadcast on TCM are [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] on the network's [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed. TCM also regularly presents widescreen presentations of films not available in the format on any [[home video]] release.

Occasionally, TCM shows restored versions of films, particularly old [[silent film]]s with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies is also a major backer of the [[Descriptive Video Service]] (created by [[Boston]] [[PBS]] member station [[WGBH-TV]]), with many of the films aired on the network offering [[video description|visual description]] for the [[blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]], which is accessible through the [[second audio program]] option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver.

===''Now Playing''===
TCM publishes ''Now Playing'', a monthly guide, originally available through a standalone subscription, which provides daily listings and descriptions for films scheduled to air on Turner Classic Movies in the coming month. The digest-size magazine highlights a featured actor on the cover, and features essays about the "guest programmer" as well as a movie-and-actor themed crossword puzzle. The May 2017 issue, following the death in March 2017 of host [[Robert Osborne]], contained "Remembering Robert Osborne" by [[Ben Mankiewicz]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TCM:NOW PLAYING: A Viewer's Guide to Turner Classic Movies.|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|date=May 2017|location=Palm Coast, Florida|pages=46}}</ref> TCM ceased print publication of ''Now Playing'' (which had been one of the few channel-specific program guides that remained in print circulation for most of the 2000s and 2010s) with the August 2017 issue, moving it to an electronic format available via email free of charge.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Canote|first=Terence Towles|date=2017-04-22|title=A Shroud of Thoughts: TCM To Cease Printing the Now Playing Guide|url=http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2017/04/tcm-to-cease-printing-now-playing-guide.html|access-date=2020-11-21|website=A Shroud of Thoughts}}</ref>

During the prime time hours, an ident for the "Watch TCM" app is shown after every movie.

===Movie library===
TCM's library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles. Besides broadcasting films owned or licensed by Warner Bros., Turner Classic Movies also licenses films from [[Universal Studios]], [[Paramount Pictures]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164239/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13266775.html Brown, Rich.

Also, TCM has aired movies from the 1900s through the 1920s. Although most movies shown on TCM are releases from the 1930s to the 1960s, some are more contemporary – Turner Classic Movies sometimes airs films from the 1970s and 1980s, and occasionally broadcasts movies released during the 1990s and the early 2000s.

===Hosted and special programming===
====Regular features====
[[File:Robert Osborne at the 73rd Annual Peabody Awards.jpg|175px|thumb|right|TCM prime time host Robert Osborne at the 73rd Annual Peabody Awards (May 2014)]]
Most feature movies shown during the [[prime time]] and early overnight hours (8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 2:30&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) were presented by film historian [[Robert Osborne]] (who had been with the network since its 1994 launch until 2016, except for a five-month medical leave from July to December 2011, when guest hosts presented each night's films),<ref>{{cite web | first=Lou | last=Lumenick | title=Robert Osborne taking leave from TCM | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/robert_osborne_taking_leave_from_lQNj8sE5YfsOP9EA3nJ9TM | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913190429/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/robert_osborne_taking_leave_from_lQNj8sE5YfsOP9EA3nJ9TM | url-status=dead | archive-date=September 13, 2012 | work=[[The New York Post]] | date=July 11, 2011 }}</ref> [[Ben Mankiewicz]] presenting primetime films on Wednesday through Sunday evenings, [[Jacqueline Stewart]] presenting "Silent Sunday Nights" on Sundays, Tiffany Vasquez presented the films on Saturday afternoons from 2016 to 2018 when Dave Karger began presenting Saturday afternoons and the primetime films on Mondays, and Alicia Malone presenting the films on Sunday afternoons, the primetime films on Tuesdays and "TCM Imports" on Sundays.

TCM regularly airs a "Star of the Month" throughout the year in which most, if not all, feature films from a film star are shown during that night's schedule. February and August are the only months to not have a "Star of the Month" due to special programming months. The network also marks the occurrence of a film actor's birthday (either [[Wikt:antemortem|antemortem]] or posthumously) or recent death with day- or evening-long festivals showcasing several of that artist's best, earliest or least-known pictures; by effect, marathons scheduled in honor of an actor's passing (which are scheduled within a month after their death) pre-empt films originally scheduled to air on that date. TCM also features a monthly program block called the "TCM Guest Programmer", in which the host is joined by celebrity guests responsible for choosing that evening's films (examples of such programmers during 2012 include [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Anthony Bourdain]], [[Debra Winger]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Regis Philbin]] and [[Jim Lehrer]]);<ref>{{cite web| title= TCM Announces Guest Programmers for 2012, Including Jules Feiffer, Anthony Bourdain, Debra Winger, Ellen Barkin, Spike Lee, Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer | url= http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/tcm-announces-guest-programmers-for-2012-including-jules-feiffer-anthony-bourdain-debra-winger-ellen-barkin-spike-lee-regis-philbin-and-jim-lehrer/121401/ | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120227024440/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/tcm-announces-guest-programmers-for-2012-including-jules-feiffer-anthony-bourdain-debra-winger-ellen-barkin-spike-lee-regis-philbin-and-jim-lehrer/121401/ | url-status= dead | archive-date= February 27, 2012 | date= February 22, 2012| first=Sara|last= Bibel | work= Press release | access-date=2012-03-16}}</ref> an offshoot of this block featuring Turner Classic Movies employees aired during February 2011.

''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'', with various hosts since 2001, is a weekly film showcase airing on Saturday evenings at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time which spotlights a culturally significant movie and contains a special introduction and post-movie discussion.

One of the weekly blocks is "Noir Alley", featuring [[film noir]] movies. It broadcasts on Saturday evenings and repeats on Sunday mornings at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time and is hosted by [[Eddie Muller]]. The channel also broadcasts two movie blocks during the late evening hours each Sunday: "Silent Sunday Nights", which features [[silent film]]s from the United States and abroad, usually in the latest restored version and often with new musical scores, and hosted by [[Jacqueline Stewart]]; and "TCM Imports" (which previously ran on Saturdays until the early 2000s{{Specify|date=March 2012}}), a weekly presentation of films originally released in foreign countries and hosted by Alicia Malone. ''[[TCM Underground]]'' – which debuted in October 2006 – as Saturday late night block which focuses on [[cult film]]s, the block was originally hosted by rocker/filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]] until December 2006 (though {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, it is the only regular film presentation block on the channel that does not have a host). ''[[TCM Underground]]'' recently changed its timeslot - it now airs early Saturday mornings at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time

====Seasonal blocks====<!--do NOT alter anchored subheader title-->
{{anchor|31 Days of Oscar}}
Turner Classic Movies suspends its regular schedule twice each year for a special month of film marathons.  ''31 Days of Oscar'' is a programming block aired each [[Oscar season]] by the U.S. and Asian Turner Classic Movies cable networks during the month of the [[Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lais |first=C. J. |date=February 1, 2019 |title=31 Days of Oscar begins ……… NOW! |url=https://blog.timesunion.com/movies/31-days-of-oscar-begins-now/20590/ |work=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref>  Each feature that TCM airs in this block can be either an Oscar winner or nominee.

Another is called "Summer Under the Stars", which features entire daily schedules devoted to the work of a particular actor, with movies and specials that pertain to the star of the day. In the summer of 2007, the channel debuted "Funday Night at the Movies", a block hosted by actor [[Tom Kenny]] (best known as the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]]). This summer block featured classic feature films (such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'') aimed at introducing these movies to new generations of children, and their families.

====Other programming blocks====
"Funday Night at the Movies" was replaced in 2008 by "Essentials Jr.", a youth-oriented version of its weekly series, ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'' (originally hosted by actors [[Abigail Breslin]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]], then by [[John Lithgow]] from 2009 to 2011, and then by [[Bill Hader]], starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'', ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'', and ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'', as well as more eclectic selections, such as ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'', ''[[The Music Box]]'', ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', and ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.

===TCM Remembers===
Most of the actors appearing in most TCM films are deceased. In December 1994, TCM debuted "TCM Remembers", a tribute to recently deceased notable film personalities (including actors, producers, composers, directors, writers, and cinematographers) that occasionally airs during promotional breaks between films. The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer end-of-year compilation. Following the recent death of an especially famous classic film personality (usually an actor, producer, filmmaker or director), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased's work.

Every December, a longer, more inclusive "TCM Remembers" interstitial is produced that honors all of the noted film personalities who died during the past year, interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down and is being dismantled (2013). Since 2001, the soundtracks for these clipreels have been introspective melodies by [[Indie rock|indie]] artists and/or singer-songwriters such as [[Badly Drawn Boy]] (2007) or [[Steve Earle]] (2009).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/282318/TCM-Remembers-2009-Movie-Promo-TCM-Original.html |title=TCM Remembers 2009 |work=TCM Website |year=2009 |access-date=11 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822052439/http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/282318/TCM-Remembers-2009-Movie-Promo-TCM-Original.html |archive-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> 2015's song, "Quickly Now", was written especially for ''TCM Remembers'' by Chuck Moore and Reid Hall, and sung by Eryn McHugh.<ref>[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/quickly-now-tcm-remembers-2015/id1016072611?i=1000359791573 'Quickly Now' at Apple Podcasts, with songwriting credit information.

TCM received a [[List of Peabody Award winners (2010–19)#2013|2013 Peabody Award]] for its presentation of [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]]' ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey]]'', a 15-episode documentary about the development and advancement of the medium of motion pictures. Drawing on its exhaustive film library, TCM complemented each episode with short films and feature films from the familiar to the little-seen.

==Turner Classic Movies HD==
Turner Classic Movies operates a [[high-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed, with programs broadcast in HD presented in an upconverted [[1080i]] resolution format; the HD feed of the network was launched in June 2009. Initial programming was not available in native high definition and was instead upconverted from [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], but benefited from the greater bandwidth allocated to the channel. By November 2014, film masters meant for high definition presentation, along with Osborne and Mankiewicz-hosted continuity had transitioned to the format (though films meant to be presented in the [[Academy ratio]] or other [[anamorphic format]]s lower than 16:9 are presented as intended by the director or studio with the appropriate black boxing around the frame).

==Merchandising==

===TCM Vault Collection===
The '''TCM Vault Collection''' consists of several different [[DVD]] collections of rare classic films that have been licensed, remastered and released by Turner Classic Movies (through corporate sister [[Warner Home Video]]). These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or [[VHS]]. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the TCM library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).
* ''Universal Collection'' – Featuring films licensed by TCM from the [[Universal Studios]] vault.
* ''The Lost RKO Collection'' – Featuring RKO films from the 1930s.
* ''TCM Spotlight'' – A series of DVD boxsets released by Warner Home Video featuring [[Charlie Chan]] and stars such as [[Esther Williams]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Deanna Durbin]], and [[Doris Day]].

In October 2015, TCM announced the launch of the TCM Wineclub, in which they teamed up with Laithwaite to provide a line of mail-order wines from famous vineyards such as famed writer-director-producer [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Ford Coppola's]] winery.  Wines are available in 3-month subscriptions and can be selected as reds, whites, or a mixture of both.  From the wines chosen, TCM also includes recommended movies to watch with each, such as a "True Grit" wine, to be paired with the [[John Wayne]] film [[True Grit (1969 film)|of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Tcmwineclub.com|title=About TCM Wine Club|url=http://tcmwineclub.com/about-tcm-wine-club}}</ref>

==International versions==
{{main|List of international Turner Classic Movies channels}}
Turner Classic Movies is available in many other countries around the world. In Canada, TCM began to be carried on [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]] and satellite provider [[Shaw Direct]] in 2005. [[Rogers Cable]] started offering TCM in December 2006 as a [[free preview]] for subscribers of its [[digital cable]] tier, and was added to its analogue tier in February 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian feed is generally the same as that of the U.S. network, some films are replaced for broadcast in Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Other versions of TCM are available in France, Greece, Italy, Middle East, Africa, Spain, Asia, [[Latin America]], [[Nordic countries]], the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta. The UK version operates two channels, including a spinoff called [[TCM 2]].
