He was one of the two candidates to reach the second stage of the 2007 [[2007 Guatemalan general election|presidential election]] on September 9, 2007 along with [[Partido Patriota]] candidate [[Otto Pérez Molina]].

In 2010 he appointed [[Helen Mack Chang]], a noted human rights activist, to investigate police corruption and make recommendations for changes. She noted that their low pay and poor working conditions made them open to influence and needed to be addressed.<ref name="ghrc">[http://www.ghrc-usa.org/resources/important-cases/myrna-mack/#sthash.OB7v5A7N.dpuf "Murder of Myrna Mack"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501015921/http://www.ghrc-usa.org/resources/important-cases/myrna-mack/ |date=2013-05-01 }}, Guatemala Human Rights Commission, 2011, accessed June 13, 2013</ref>

Although he is opposed to the [[Capital punishment in Guatemala|death penalty]], Colom stated that he would not pardon those sentenced to death out of respect for the country's laws, although the option to do so was granted in 2008.<ref>[http://www.ipsnews.net/2008/02/death-penalty-guatemala-green-light-for-executions/ Death Penalty Guatemala: Green Light for Executions] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130221153437/http://www.ipsnews.net/2008/02/death-penalty-guatemala-green-light-for-executions/ |date=2013-02-21 }}, Inter-Press Service News Agency</ref> The last execution in Guatemala, however, took place in 2000 and was since abolished for civilian crimes in 2017.
