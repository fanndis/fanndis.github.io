===Early abolition movement===
Three states abolished the death penalty for murder during the 19th century: [[Capital punishment in Michigan|Michigan]] (which has never executed a prisoner since achieving statehood) in 1847, [[Capital punishment in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] in 1853 and [[Capital punishment in Maine|Maine]] in 1887. [[Capital punishment in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.

Other states which abolished the death penalty for murder before ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' include: [[Minnesota]] in 1911, [[Capital punishment in Vermont|Vermont]] in 1964, [[Iowa]] and [[Capital punishment in West Virginia|West Virginia]] in 1965 and [[North Dakota]] in 1973. [[Hawaii]] abolished the death penalty in 1948 and [[Alaska]] in 1957, both before their statehood. [[Capital punishment in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] repealed it in 1929 and the [[Capital punishment in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by [[Suffrage|popular vote]] in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later; Arizona reinstated the death penalty in 1918 and Oregon in 1978. In Oregon, the measure reinstating the death penalty was overturned by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] in 1981, but Oregon voters again reinstated the death penalty in 1984.<ref name="Ballotpedia">{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Death_penalty_on_the_ballot|title= Death penalty on the ballot |publisher= ballotpedia.org |access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.

===Constitutional law developments===
Capital punishment was used by only 5 of 50 states in 2020. They were Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. Government executions, reported Amnesty International, took place in only 20 of the world's 195 countries. The federal government though which had not executed for 16 years did so in 2020, pushed by Donald Trump and his nominee Attorney General William Barr.
Executions for various crimes, especially murder and rape, occurred from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, "save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law", according to abolitionist [[Hugo Adam Bedau|Hugo Bedau]].<ref>The Courts, the Constitution, and Capital Punishment 118 (1977)</ref>

The possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided on ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'' in 1958. The Supreme Court declared explicitly, for the first time, that the Eighth Amendment's [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]] clause must draw its meaning from the "evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', the court made the first step of what would later be called "death is different" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases – a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]''.

===Capital punishment suspended (1972)===
{{Further|Furman v. Georgia}}In ''Furman v. Georgia'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a "unitary trial" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-''Furman'' execution was that of [[Luis Monge (mass murderer)|Luis Monge]] on June 2, 1967.

In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]]. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be ''per se'' unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of [[Byron White]] and [[Potter Stewart]], expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and [[William O. Douglas]] worried explicitly about [[Race and capital punishment in the United States|racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty]]. [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[William J. Brennan Jr.]] expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.

The ''Furman'' decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a "legal bombshell".<ref name="Latzer"/> The next day, columnist [[Barry Schweid]] wrote that it was "unlikely" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pAoQAAAAIBAJ&pg=3786,38609|title=The Free Lance-Star – Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>

===Capital punishment reinstated (1976)===
{{Further|Gregg v. Georgia}}
[[File:Panorama of United States Supreme Court Building at Dusk.jpg|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court seat in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Instead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in ''Furman''. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his ''Furman'' opinion. Other states adopted "bifurcated" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.

On July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''<ref>''Gregg v. Georgia'', {{ussc|428|153|1976}}</ref> and upheld 7–2 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any [[mitigating factor]]s exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty – either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in ''[[Woodson v. North Carolina]]''<ref>''Woodson v. North Carolina'', {{ussc|428|280|1976}}</ref> and ''[[Roberts v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>''Roberts v. Louisiana'', {{ussc|428|325|1976}}, {{ussc|431|633|1977}}</ref> the court struck down 5–4 statutes providing a [[mandatory death penalty|mandatory death sentence]].

Executions resumed on January 17, 1977, when [[Gary Gilmore (criminal)|Gary Gilmore]] went before a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] in [[Utah]]. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.

Following the decision, the use of capital punishment in the United States soared.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Steiker|first1=Carol S.|last2=Steiker|first2=Jordan M.|date=January 13, 2020|title=The Rise, Fall, and Afterlife of the Death Penalty in the United States|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=299–315|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-011518-024721|issn=2572-4568|doi-access=free}}</ref> This was in contrast to trends in other parts of advanced industrial democracies where the use of capital punishment declined or was prohibited.<ref name=":2" />

===Supreme Court narrows capital offenses===
In 1977, the Supreme Court's ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for this offense.

In the 1980 case ''[[Godfrey v. Georgia]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise [[aggravating factor]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Godfrey v. Georgia |url= https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/446/420/ |publisher= supreme.justia.com |access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', decided on June 20, 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html|title=DARYL RENARD ATKINS, PETITIONER v. VIRGINIA|access-date=August 6, 2006|date=June 20, 2002}}</ref> held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court's decision in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]''<ref>''Roper v. Simmons'', {{ussc|543|551|2005}}</ref> struck down executions for offenders [[Capital punishment for juveniles in the United States|under the age of 18 at the time of the crime]].

In the 2008 case ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'', the court also held 5–4 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including [[child rape]]. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/06/25/scotus.child.rape/index.html|title=Child rapists can't be executed, Supreme Court rules|first=Bill|last=Mears|publisher=CNN|date=June 25, 2008|access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref> Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] and was criticized by both major party candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |title=Obama Disagrees With High Court on Child Rape Case |access-date=May 7, 2017 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=June 25, 2008 |author=Sara Kugler |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524044856/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |archive-date=May 24, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Repeal movements and legal challenges===
In 2004, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Kansas]] capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective states' highest courts. Kansas successfully appealed the Kansas Supreme Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, who reinstated the statute in ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'' (2006), holding it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The decision of the New York Court of Appeals was based on the state constitution, making unavailable any appeal. The [[New York State Assembly|state lower house]] has since blocked all attempts to reinstate the death penalty by adopting a valid sentencing scheme.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47871-2005Apr12.html|title=In N.Y., Lawmakers Vote Not to Reinstate Capital Punishment|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 13, 2005|author=Powell, Michael|access-date=May 14, 2019|quote=NEW YORK, April 12 – New York's death penalty is no more.

[[Nebraska]]'s legislature also passed a repeal in 2015, but a [[referendum]] campaign gathered enough signatures to suspend it. Capital punishment was reinstated by popular vote on November 8, 2016.

===Lethal injection era===
[[File:Execution_chamber,_Florida.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The lethal injection room in [[Florida State Prison]].]]
From 1976 to {{Date}}, there were 1,527 executions, of which 1,347 were by lethal injection, 163 by electrocution, 11 by gas inhalation, 3 by hanging, and 3 by firing squad.<ref>{{cite web |title= USA Executions 2016 (as of 12/8/16) |url=https://people.smu.edu/rhalperi/exec16.html |publisher= people.smu.edu |access-date=March 16, 2017}}</ref> The South had the great majority of these executions, with 1,246; there were 189 in the Midwest, 86 in the West, and only 4 in the Northeast. No state in the Northeast has conducted an execution since [[Connecticut]], now abolitionist, in 2005. The state of [[Texas]] alone conducted 570 executions, over 1/3 of the total; the states of Texas, [[Virginia]], and [[Oklahoma]] combined make up over half the total, with 795 executions between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/number-executions-state-and-region-1976|title=Number of Executions by State and Region Since 1976 – Death Penalty Information Center|website=deathpenaltyinfo.org}}</ref> 11 executions have been conducted by the federal government. Executions increased in frequency until 1999; 98 prisoners were executed that year. Since 1999, the number of executions has greatly decreased, and the 20 executions in 2016 were the fewest since 1991. There has been a small increase since 2016, with 22 executions in 2019.<ref name="Update"/>

The death penalty became an issue during the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. It came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Michael Dukakis]], when [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]], the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" Dukakis replied, "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime." Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as the beginning of the end of his campaign.<ref>{{cite web |title= Obama's non-Dukakis answer |url=http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2008/06/25/4433621-obamas-non-dukakis-answer |publisher= nbcnews.com |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref>

In 1996, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]] to streamline the appeal process in capital cases. The bill was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]], who had endorsed capital punishment during his 1992 presidential campaign.

A study found that at least 34 of the 749 executions carried out in the U.S. between 1977 and 2001, or 4.5%, involved "unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner". The rate of these "botched executions" remained steady over the period.<ref>Borg and Radelet, pp. 144–147</ref> A study published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of [[hypnotic]]s in the prisoner was insufficient to ensure unconsciousness.<ref>Van Norman p. 287</ref> Nonetheless, the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 (''[[Baze v. Rees]]''), again in 2015 (''[[Glossip v. Gross]]''), and a third time in 2019 (''[[Bucklew v. Precythe]]''), that lethal injection does not constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]].<ref>Paternoster, R. (September 18, 2012). Capital Punishment. Oxford Handbooks Online.

=== Women's history and capital punishment ===
In 1632, 24 years after the first recorded male execution in the colonies, <!-- Baker says her first name was June, but other confirming sources appear absent. -->Jane Champion became the first woman known to have been lawfully executed. She was sentenced to death by hanging after she was convicted of infanticide; around two-thirds of women executed in the 17th and early 18th centuries were convicted of child murder. A married woman, it is not known whether Champion's illicit lover, William Gallopin, also convicted of their child's murder, was also executed, although it appears he was so sentenced.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=David V.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKUHCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|title=Women and Capital Punishment in the United States: An Analytical History

Women accounted for just one fifth of all executions between 1632 and 1759, in the [[colonial United States]]. Women were more likely to be acquitted, and the relatively low number of executions of women may have been impacted by the scarcity of female laborers. Slavery was not yet widespread in the 17th century mainland and planters relied mostly on Irish indentured servants, which is different than the hereditary chattel slavery experience of Africans.  To maintain subsistence levels in those days everyone had to do farm work, including women. These needs were met by unmarried Irish women who arrived in the early colonies as indentured servants after they were forced to leave Ireland as a result of rising rents, crop failures and disruption in the linen industry. Many were transported as part of what some call the "white slave trade", and were often poor women, prostitutes, or criminals who were brought to the United States against their will.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baker |first=David V. |title=Women and Capital Punishment in the United States: An Analytical History |date=2016}}</ref>

The second half of the 17th century saw the executions of 14 women and 6 men who were accused of witchcraft during the witch hunt hysteria and the Salem Witch Trials. While both men and women were executed, 80% of the accusations were towards women, so the list of executions disproportionately affected men by a margin of 6 (actual) to 4 (expected), i.e. 50% more men were executed than expected from the percentage of accused who were men.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/devilinshapeofwo00karl_0|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilinshapeofwo00karl_0/page/274 274]|title=The Devil in the Shape of a Woman: Witchcraft in Colonial New England|last=Karlsen|first=Carol F.|date=April 17, 1998|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=9780393347197|language=en}}</ref>

Other notable female executions include [[Mary Surratt]], [[Velma Barfield|Margie Velma Barfield]] and [[Wanda Jean Allen]]. Mary Surratt was executed by hanging in 1865 after being convicted of co-conspiring to [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinate Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surrattmuseum.org/mary-surratt|title=Mary Surratt's Story – Surratt House Museum|website=www.surrattmuseum.org|language=en|access-date=November 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104011659/http://www.surrattmuseum.org/mary-surratt|archive-date=November 4, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Margie Velma Barfield was convicted of murder and when she was executed by lethal injection in 1984, she became the first woman to be executed since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/barfield029.htm|title=Velma Margie Barfield #29|website=www.clarkprosecutor.org|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> Wanda Jean Allen was convicted of murder in 1989 and had a high-profile execution by lethal injection in January 2001.

The federal government executes women infrequently. [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Ethel Rosenberg]] was executed for espionage on June 19, 1953, and Bonnie Brown Heady was executed for kidnapping and murder later that same year on December 18. Since Heady's execution, the federal government has not executed a woman. However, the execution of [[Murder of Bobbie Jo Stinnett|Lisa Montgomery]], convicted of killing a pregnant woman and cutting out and kidnapping her baby, has been scheduled for December 8, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Croft|first=Jay|date=17 October 2020|title=US government to execute first woman since 1953|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/17/us/lisa-montgomery-brandon-bernard-executions-trnd/index.html|access-date=2020-10-17|website=CNN}}</ref>

=== Juvenile capital punishment ===
In 1642, the first ever juvenile, [[Thomas Granger|Thomas Graunger]], was sentenced to death in Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts, for [[bestiality]]. Since then, 361 other juveniles have been sentenced to the death penalty. ''Kent v. United States'' (1966), turned the tides for juvenile capital punishment sentencing when it limited the waiver discretion juvenile courts had. Before this case, juvenile courts had the freedom to waiver juvenile cases to criminal courts without a hearing, which did not make the waiving process consistent across states. Thoughts about abolishing the death penalty started happening between 1983 and 1986. In 1987, ''[[Thompson v. Oklahoma]]'', the Supreme Court threw away Thompson's death sentence due to it being cruel and unusual punishment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cothern|first=Lynn|date=November 2000|title=Juveniles and the Death Penalty|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/184748.pdf|journal=Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention|pages=1–16|via=NCJRS}}</ref>

It was not until ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' that the juvenile death penalty was abolished due to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] finding that the execution of juveniles is in conflict with the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which deal with cruel and unusual punishment. Prior to abolishing the juvenile death penalty in 2005, any juvenile aged 16 years or older could be sentenced to death in some states, the last of whom was [[Scott Hain]], executed in Oklahoma in 2003 for burning two people to death in a robbery at age 17.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Corrections|last=Maier|first=Shana|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc.|year=2017}}</ref> Since 2005, there have been no executions nor discussion of executing juveniles in the United States.

==Capital crimes==
===Aggravated murder===
Aggravating factors for seeking capital punishment of murder vary greatly among death penalty states. California has twenty-two.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Penal Code § 190.2|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=190.2&lawCode=PEN|work=[[California Office of Legislative Counsel]]|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref>
Some aggravating circumstances are nearly universal, such as robbery-murder, murder involving [[rape]] of the victim, and murder of an on-duty [[police officer]].<ref name="Aggravating">{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/aggravating-factors-capital-punishment-state|title=AGGRAVATING FACTORS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BY STATE|access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref>

Several states have included [[child murder]] to their list of aggravating factors, but the victim's age under which the murder is punishable by death varies. In 2011, Texas raised this age from six to ten.<ref>{{cite web |title= AN ACT relating to the murder of a child as a capital offense. |url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/html/SB00377F.HTM |publisher= legis.state.tx.us |access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>

In some states, the high number of aggravating factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, [[torture murder]], murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony).<ref>{{cite web |title= Official recommendations on the fair administration of the death penalty in california |url= http://www.ccfaj.org/rr-dp-official.html |publisher= ccfaj.org |access-date= March 24, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160314205412/http://www.ccfaj.org/rr-dp-official.html |archive-date= March 14, 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Columnist [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a capital crime when there is only one victim killed.<ref>Charles Lane (2010), ''Stay of Execution: Saving the Death Penalty from Itself'', Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, p.110-111</ref>

==== Aggravating factors in federal court ====
In order for a person to be eligible for a death sentence when convicted of aggravated first-degree murder, the jury or court (when there is not a jury) must determine at least one of sixteen aggravating factors that existed during the crime's commission. The following is a list of the 16 aggravating factors under federal law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3592|title=18 U.S. Code § 3592 – Mitigating and aggravating factors to be considered in determining whether a sentence of death is justified|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Crimes against the state===
The opinion of the court in ''Kennedy v. Louisiana'' says that the ruling does not apply to "treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State".<ref>''Kennedy v. Louisiana'', 554 U.S. 407, 437 (2007); see also {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/washington/26scotuscnd.html|title=Supreme Court Rejects Death Penalty for Child Rape|date=June 26, 2008|access-date=March 11, 2011|first=Linda|last=Greenhouse|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|quote=The court went beyond the question in the case to rule out the death penalty for any individual crime – as opposed to "offenses against the state", such as treason or espionage – "where the victim's life was not taken.}}</ref>

Since no one is on death row for such offenses, the court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the death penalty applied for them.

[[Treason]], [[espionage]] and [[Drug lord|large-scale drug trafficking]] are all capital crimes under federal law. Treason is also punishable by death in six states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri). Large-scale drug trafficking is punishable by death in two states (Florida and Missouri),<ref name="DPIC">{{cite web |title=Death Penalty for Offenses Other Than Murder |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?&did=2347 |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |year=2008 |access-date=January 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221191021/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?&did=2347 |archive-date=February 21, 2008 }}</ref> and [[aircraft hijacking]] in two others (Georgia and Mississippi). Vermont still has a pre-''Furman'' statute providing the death penalty for treason despite removing capital punishment for murder in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/13/075/03401|title=§ 3401. Definition and punishment of treason|publisher=legislature.vermont.gov|access-date=December 9, 2016}}</ref>

==Legal process==
The legal administration of the death penalty in the United States typically involves five critical steps: (1) [[prosecutor]]ial decision to seek the death penalty (2) [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]], (3) direct review, (4) state collateral review, and (5) federal [[habeas corpus]].

Clemency, through which the [[Governor]] or [[President (government title)|President]] of the [[jurisdiction]] can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence, is an [[executive power|executive]] rather than [[judicial power|judicial]] process.<ref>See generally [[Separation of powers]].</ref>

===Decision to seek the death penalty===
While judges in criminal cases can usually impose a harsher prison sentence than the one demanded by prosecution, the death penalty can be handed down only if the accuser has specifically decided to seek it.

In the decades since ''[[Furman v. Georgia|Furman]]'', new questions have emerged about whether or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing arbitrariness. A study by [[Pepperdine University School of Law]] published in ''[[Temple Law Review]]'', surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions are marked by local "idiosyncrasies", and that wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 "special circumstances", making nearly all first-degree murders potential capital cases.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/transparency-death-penalty/ |title = Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice: An Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org}}</ref>

A proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.<ref name="ReferenceGershowitz">{{cite web |title= Statewide Capital Punishment: The Case for Eliminating Counties' Role in the Death Penalty |url= http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1255/ |access-date= March 20, 2016 |author=Adam M. Gershowitz}}</ref>

In 2017, Florida governor [[Rick Scott]] removed all capital cases from local prosecutor [[Aramis Ayala]] because she decided to never seek the death penalty no matter the gravity of the crime.<ref>{{cite web |title= Florida Supreme Court backs Gov. Scott in Orlando death-penalty dispute |url=https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2017/08/31/florida-supreme-court-backs-gov-scott-in-orlando-death-penalty-dispute/ |access-date= May 10, 2020 |author=Kristen M. Clark}}</ref>

===Sentencing===
Of the 28 states with the death penalty, 26 require the sentence to be decided by a [[jury]], and 25 require a unanimous decision by that jury.

The only state which does not require a unanimous jury decision is Alabama. In Alabama, at least 10 jurors must concur. A retrial happens if the jury deadlocks.<ref>{{cite web |title= SB 16 To amend Sections 13A-5-45, 13A-5-46, and 13A-5-47, Code of Alabama 1975, relating to capital cases and to the determination of the sentence by courts; to prohibit a court from overriding a jury verdict.|url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/searchableinstruments/2017RS/bills/SB16.htm|publisher= legislature.state.al.us |access-date= April 12, 2017}}</ref>

Nebraska is the only state in which the sentence is decided by a three-judge panel. If one of the judges on the panel opposes death, the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/2014/chapter-29/statute-29-2521/ |title=2014 Nebraska Revised Statutes – Chapter 29 – CRIMINAL PROCEDURE – 29-2521 – Sentencing determination proceeding. |publisher=law.justia.com |access-date=April 16, 2017}}</ref>

Montana is the only state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0460/chapter_0180/part_0030/section_0010/0460-0180-0030-0010.html |title= 46-18-301. Hearing on imposition of death penalty. |publisher= leg.mt.gov |access-date=April 16, 2017}}</ref>

In all states in which the jury is involved, only [[Death-qualified jury|death-qualified]] veniremen can be selected in such a jury, to exclude both people who will always vote for the death sentence and those who are categorically opposed to it.

However, the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a [[hung jury]]:<ref>{{cite web |title= Provisions of state and federal statutes concerning sentence if capital sentencing jury cannot agree |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/JuryDeadlockLaws.pdf |publisher= A. Parrent, Conn. Public Def |access-date= March 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= SB 280: Sentencing for Capital Felonies |url=http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/0280/ |publisher= flsenate.gov |access-date= March 15, 2017}}</ref>
* In four states (Arizona, California, Kentucky and Nevada), a retrial of the penalty phase will be conducted before a different jury (the common-law rule for [[mistrial]]).<ref>See ''[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/22/579/case.html United States v. Perez]'', 1824</ref>
* In two states (Indiana and Missouri), the judge will decide the sentence.
* In the 19 other states, a hung jury results in a [[life sentence]], even if only one juror opposed death. Federal law also provides that outcome.

The first outcome is referred as the "true unanimity" rule, while the third has been criticized as the "single-juror veto" rule.<ref>K. Scheidegger, "Hurst v. Florida Remedial Legislation and SBP 7068", February 4, 2016</ref>

===Direct review===
If a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review.<ref name="18USC3595">See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3595- 18 U.S.C. § 3595.] ("In a case in which a sentence of death is imposed, the sentence shall be subject to review by the court of appeals upon appeal by the defendant.")</ref> The direct review process is a typical legal [[appeal]]. An [[Court of Appeals|appellate court]] examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not.<ref>See generally [[Appeal]].</ref> Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand.<ref name="18USC3595"/> If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing.<ref name="poland">[http://supreme.justia.com/us/476/147/case.html Poland v. Arizona, 476 U.S. 147 152–154 (1986)].</ref> Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.<ref name="poland"/> About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.<ref>Eric M. Freedman, "Giarratano is a Scarecrow: The Right to Counsel in State Postconviction Proceedings, Legalize Drugs" 91 Cornell L. Rev. 1079, 1097 (2001)</ref>

===State collateral review===
At times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/489/288/case.html Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 306 (1989)].</ref> Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. § 28.11(b) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. § 28.11(a) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Most often, these are claims, such as [[ineffective assistance of counsel]], which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary [[appeal]]. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.<ref name=autogenerated1>Eric M. Freedman, "Giarratano is a Scarecrow: The Right to Counsel in State Postconviction Proceedings", 91 Cornell L. Rev. 1079, 1097 (2006).</ref>

In Virginia, state habeas corpus for condemned men are heard by the [[Virginia Supreme Court|state supreme court]] under exclusive [[original jurisdiction]] since 1995, immediately after direct review by the same court.<ref>{{cite web |title= Code of Virginia – § 8.01-654.

To reduce litigation delays, other states require convicts to file their state collateral appeal before the completion of their direct appeal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/files/documents/Ch154RegCmnt.pdf |title= OJP Docket No. 1464, Certification Process for State Capital Counsel Systems |publisher=crimeandconsequences.com |access-date= March 15, 2017}}</ref> or provide adjudication of direct and collateral attacks together in a "unitary review".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl1997/sl_268.htm |title= AN ACT Concerning a unitary procedure for review in class 1 felony cases in which a death sentence is sought as punishment. |publisher= tornado.state.co.us |access-date= March 15, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151018093526/http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl1997/sl_268.htm |archive-date= October 18, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

===Federal ''habeas corpus''===
After a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal ''habeas corpus'' is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for [[certiorari]] to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal ''habeas corpus'' is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal ''habeas corpus'' is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal [[constitutional right]]s. Prisoners may also use federal ''habeas corpus'' suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.<ref>[[House v. Bell]], 126 S. Ct. 2064 (2006)</ref> According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal ''habeas corpus''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

James Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when ''habeas corpus'' petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was "a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995".<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DB1039F932A35757C0A960958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Habeas Corpus Studies | date=April 1, 1996 | access-date=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in ''habeas corpus'' cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between "1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walpin|first1=Ned|title=The New Speed-up in Habeas Corpus Appeals|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/speed.html|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref> The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to ''habeas corpus'' review.

A similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.<ref>see 28 U.S.C. § 2255.</ref>

The AEDPA also provides an expeditious ''habeas'' procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.<ref>28 USC §§ 2261 – 2266</ref> Under this program, federal ''habeas corpus'' for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the [[U.S. attorney general]], with a possible appeal of the state to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. {{as of|2016|March}}, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.<ref>{{cite web |title= Court Gives Green Light to Death Penalty Fast-Tracking |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-green-light-death-penalty-fast-tracking-37886309 |publisher= abcnews.go.com |access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>

===Section 1983===
If the federal court refuses to issue a [[writ]] of ''habeas corpus'', the death sentence ordinarily becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another avenue of federal litigation; the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] – codified at {{usc|42|1983}} – allows complainants to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.

While direct appeals are normally limited to just one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-7955/ |title = Glossip v. Gross 576 U.S. ___ (2015) |publisher = justia.com |access-date= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that ''habeas corpus'', not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-6188.ZS.html |title=Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |access-date=December 1, 2011}}</ref> In the 2006 ''[[Hill v. McDonough]]'' case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the ''Hill'' case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than ''habeas corpus'' to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as [[Clarence Hill (murderer)|Clarence Hill]]'s own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

===Execution warrant===
While the [[execution warrant]] is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.

The warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.<ref>{{cite web |title=2014 Georgia Code – § 17-10-34 – Sentence to specify time period for and place of execution |url=http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-17/chapter-10/article-2/section-17-10-34/ |publisher= law.justia.com |access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref>

==Distribution of sentences==
[[File:Death sentences United States (new).png|thumb|right|300px| Total number of prisoners on Death Row in the United States from 1953 to 2008]]
In recent years there has been an average of one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions in the United States.

Alabama has the highest ''per capita'' rate of death sentences. This is because Alabama was one of the few states that allowed judges to override a jury recommendation in favor of life imprisonment, a possibility it removed in March 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eji.org/deathpenalty |title=Death Penalty |publisher=Equal Justice Initiative |access-date=October 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823045344/http://eji.org/deathpenalty |archive-date=August 23, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrbl.com/2017/04/11/alabama-ends-death-penalty-by-judicial-override/|title=Alabama ends death penalty by judicial override|publisher=Associated Press at [[WBRL]]|date=March 11, 2017|access-date=March 13, 2017}}</ref>

===Among states===
The distribution of death sentences among states is loosely proportional to their populations and murder rates. [[California]], which is the most populous state, also has the largest death row, with over 700 inmates. [[Wyoming]], which is the least populous state, has only one condemned man.

But executions are more frequent (and happen more quickly after sentencing) in conservative states. [[Texas]], which is the second most populous state in the Union, carried out over 500 executions during the post-''Furman'' era, more than a third of the national total.

{{Main|Race and capital punishment in the United States}}
African Americans made up 41% of death row inmates while making up only 12.6% of the general population. They have made up 34% of those actually executed since 1976. However, this is an under-representation relative to the proportion of convicted murderers; 52.5% of all homicide offenders between 1980 and 2008 were African Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf|title=Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980–2008|page=3}}</ref>

Approximately 13.5% of death row inmates are of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] descent, while they make up 17.4% of the general population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-resources-hispanics-and-death-penalty|title=Hispanics and the Death Penalty|publisher=Death Penalty Information Center|access-date=February 22, 2016}}</ref>

===Among sexes===
As of October 1, 2016, the Death Penalty Information Center reports that there are 54 women on death row. This constitutes 1.86% of the total death row population. 16 women have been executed since 1976,<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/women-and-death-penalty|title=Women and the Death Penalty {{!}} Death Penalty Information Center|website=deathpenaltyinfo.org|language=en|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> compared to 1,426 men during the same time period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf|title=Facts About the Death Penalty}}</ref> meaning women comprised only 1.1% of executions in the first 40 years following [[Gregg v.

Since 1608, 15,391 lawful executions are confirmed to have been carried out in jurisdictions of, or now of, the United States, of these, 575, or 3.6%, were women. Women account for {{frac|1|50|}} death sentences, {{frac|1|67|}} people on death row, and {{frac|1|100|}} people whose executions are actually carried out. While always comparatively rare, women are significantly less likely to be executed in the modern era than in the past. All 8 Federal executions carried out since 1976 have been of men. Of the [[List of women executed in the United States since 1976|16 women executed on the state level]], most took place in either Texas (6), Oklahoma (3) or Florida (2) and were demographically, 25% (4) African-American, with the rest (12) being white of any ethnicity. Historically, the states that have executed the most women are California, Texas and Florida; though unlike Texas and Florida, California has not executed a woman in the post-[[Furman v. Georgia|Furman]] era. The racial breakdown of women sentenced to death is 61% white, 21% black, 13% Latina, 3% Asian, and 2% American Indian.<ref name=":0" />

All 28 states with the death penalty for murder provide [[lethal injection]] as the primary method of execution. Vermont's remaining death penalty statute for treason provides [[electrocution]] as the method of execution.<ref name="Vermont Laws"/>

Some states allow other methods than lethal injection, but only as secondary methods to be used merely at the request of the prisoner or if lethal injection is unavailable.<ref name="Reference11">{{cite web |title= Methods of Execution |url= http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/methods.htm |publisher= clarkprosecutor.org | access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Reference22">{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution|title=Methods of Execution|publisher=deathpenaltyinfo.org|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref>

===Offender-selected methods===
In the following states, death row inmates with an execution warrant may choose to be executed by:<ref name="Reference22"/>
* [[Electric chair|Electrocution]] in Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
* [[Gas chamber#United States|Lethal gas]] in Arizona and California.
* [[Execution by firing squad|Firing squad]] in Utah, Mississippi and Oklahoma.

In four states (Arizona, Kentucky, Tennessee and Utah), the alternative method is offered only to inmates sentenced to death for crimes committed prior to a specified date (usually when the state switched from the earlier method to lethal injection).

When an offender chooses to be executed by a means different from the state default method, which is always lethal injection, he/she loses the right to challenge its constitutionality in court. See ''Stewart v. LaGrand'', 526 U.S. 115 (1999).

The last executions by methods other than injection are as follows (all chosen by the inmate):

===Backup methods===
Depending on the state, the following alternative methods are statutorily provided in the event that lethal injection is either found unconstitutional by a court or unavailable for practical reasons:<ref name="Reference11"/><ref name="Reference22"/><ref>South Carolina Code of Laws: {{cite web |title= Section 24-3-530. Death by electrocution or lethal injection. |url= http://law.justia.com/codes/south-carolina/2015/title-24/chapter-3/section-24-3-530/ |publisher= law.justia.com |access-date= June 4, 2016}}</ref>

* Lethal gas in Alabama, California, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wyoming.
* Firing squad in Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah.

Three states (Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah) have added back-up methods recently in 2014 or 2015 (or have expanded their application fields) in reaction to the shortage of lethal injection drugs.<ref>{{cite web |title= How to kill: America's death penalty dilemma |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/24/us/state-of-death-penalty-in-graphs-and-charts/ |publisher= cnn.com |access-date= March 28, 2016}}</ref>

Oklahoma and Mississippi are the only states allowing more than two methods of execution in their statutes, providing lethal injection, [[nitrogen hypoxia]], electrocution and firing squad to be used in that order in the event that all earlier methods are unavailable. The nitrogen option was added by the Oklahoma Legislature in 2015 and has never been used in a judicial execution.<ref name="nitrogen">{{cite web |title= The Dawn of a New Form of Capital Punishment |url= http://time.com/3749879/nitrogen-gas-execution-oklahoma-lethal-injection/ |publisher= Time |date= April 17, 2015}}</ref> After struggling for years to design a nitrogen execution protocol and to obtain a proper device for it, Oklahoma announced in February 2020 it abandoned the project after finding a new reliable source of lethal injection drugs.<ref>{{cite web |title= Oklahoma Attorney general says state will resume executions |url= https://nypost.com/2020/02/13/oklahoma-attorney-general-says-state-will-resume-executions/ |publisher= nypost.com |access-date= March 22, 2020}}</ref>

Some states such as Florida have a larger provision dealing with execution methods unavailability, requiring their state departments of corrections to use "any constitutional method" if both lethal injection and electrocution are found unconstitutional. This was designed to make unnecessary any further legislative intervention in that event, but the provision applies only to legal (not practical) infeasibility.<ref>{{cite web |title= 922.105 – Execution of death sentence |url= http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0900-0999/0922/Sections/0922.105.html |publisher= leg.state.fl.us |access-date= March 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= 40-23-114 – Death by lethal injection Election of electrocution. |url= http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-40/chapter-23/40-23-114/ |publisher= law.justia.com |access-date= March 30, 2016}}</ref>

===Federal executions===
The method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]] is that of the state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death penalty, the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution.

The federal government has a facility (at [[U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute]]) and regulations only for executions by lethal injection, but the [[United States Code]] allows [[U.S. Marshals]] to use state facilities and employees for federal executions.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/26.3 |title= § 26.3 Date, time, place, and method of execution. |publisher= law.cornell.edu |access-date= March 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3597 |title= 18 U.S. Code § 3597 – Use of State facilities |publisher= law.cornell.edu |access-date= March 15, 2017}}</ref>

==Execution attendance==
[[File:TimothyMcVeighPerryOKApr2195.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The over 200 witnesses to the execution of Timothy McVeigh were mostly survivors and victims' relatives of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]].]]

The last public execution in the U.S. was that of [[Rainey Bethea]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]], on August 14, 1936.

It was the last execution in the nation at which the general public was permitted to attend without any legally imposed restrictions. "Public execution" is a legal phrase, defined by the laws of various states, and carried out pursuant to a court order. Similar to "[[public records|public record]]" or "public meeting", it means that anyone who wants to attend the execution may do so.

Around 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a "wall" or "enclosure", or to "exclude public view". Most state laws currently use such explicit wording to prohibit public executions, while others do so only implicitly by enumerating the only authorized witnesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/26-4-other-execution-procedures-19676580|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118085043/http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/26-4-other-execution-procedures-19676580|url-status=dead|title=Federal regulations 28 CFR 26.4|archivedate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

All states allow news reporters to be execution witnesses for information of the general public, except Wyoming which allows only witnesses authorized by the condemned.<ref>{{cite web|title = Texas Execution Information – Texas Execution Primer|url = http://www.txexecutions.org/primer.asp|website = www.txexecutions.org|access-date = August 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = States go hunting for execution witnesses |url = http://orig.jacksonsun.com/fe/exec/witnesses.shtml|website = jacksonsun.com |access-date = July 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Wyoming Code § 7-13-908 |url =http://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/2016/title-7/chapter-13/article-9/section-7-13-908/ |website = law.justia.com |access-date = July 15, 2017}}</ref>
Several states also allow victims' families and relatives selected by the prisoner to watch executions. An hour or two before the execution, the condemned is offered religious services and to choose his or her [[last meal]] (except in Texas which abolished it in 2011).

The execution of [[Timothy McVeigh]] on June 11, 2001, was witnessed by over 200 people, most by closed-circuit television.

==Public opinion==
{{Essay-like|section|date=July 2019}}
[[Gallup, Inc.]] has monitored support for the death penalty in the United States since 1937 by asking "Are you in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder?" Gallup surveys documented a sharp increase in support for capital punishment between 1966 and 1994.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx |title=Death Penalty |website=Gallup |access-date=July 24, 2019}}</ref><!-- Removed speculative statement not substantiated in the cited source. --> However, perhaps as the result of DNA exonerations of death row inmates reported in the national media in the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner.

Moreover, approval varies substantially depending on the characteristics of the target and the alternatives posed, with much lower support for putting juveniles and the mentally ill to death (26% and 19%, respectively, in 2002).<ref name=":1" /> Given the fact that attitudes toward capital punishment are often responsive to events, to characteristics of the target and to alternatives, many believe that the conventional wisdom—that death penalty attitudes are impervious to change—is flawed. Accordingly, any analysis of death penalty attitudes must account for the responsiveness of such attitudes, as well as their reputed resistance to change.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Persuasion and Resistance: Race and the Death Penalty in America|first1=Mark|last1=Peffley|first2=Jon|last2=Hurwitz|date=October 1, 2007|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=51|issue=4|pages = 996–1012|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00293.x}}</ref>

[[Pew Research Center|Pew Research]] polls have demonstrated declining American support for the death penalty: 80% in 1974, 78% in 1996, 55% in 2014, and 49% in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/29/support-for-death-penalty-lowest-in-more-than-four-decades/|title=Support for death penalty lowest in more than four decades|last=Oliphant|first=Baxter|date=September 29, 2016|website=Dactank; News in Numbers|publisher=Pew Research Centre|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Shrinking Majority of Americans Support Death Penalty|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2014/03/28/shrinking-majority-of-americans-support-death-penalty/|access-date=January 31, 2018|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=March 28, 2014}}</ref> The 2014 poll showed significant differences by race: 63% of whites, 40% of Hispanics and 36% of blacks, respectively, supported the death penalty in that year. However, in 2018, Pew's polls showed public support for the death penalty had increased to 54% from 49%. Since 2016, opinions among Republicans and Democrats have changed little, but the share of independents favoring the death penalty has increased by eight percentage points (from 44% to 52%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/06/11/us-support-for-death-penalty-ticks-up-2018/|title=Public support for the death penalty ticks up|date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>

A 2010 poll by Lake Research Partners found that 61% of voters would choose a penalty other than the death sentence for murder.<ref name="DPIC2015" /> When persons surveyed are given a choice between the death penalty and [[life imprisonment|life without parole]] for persons convicted of capital crimes, support for execution has traditionally been significantly lower than in polling that asks only if a person does or does not support the death penalty. In Gallup's 2019 survey, support for the sentence of life without parole surpassed that for the death penalty by a margin of 60% to 36%.<ref name=":1" />

A 2014 study found that the belief that the death penalty helps victims' families to heal may be wrong; more often than finding closure, victims' families felt anger and wanted revenge, with potential side effects of depression, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and a decreased satisfaction with life. Furthermore, the researchers found that a sense of compassion or remorse expressed from the perpetrator to the victim's family had a statistically significant positive effect on the family's ability to find closure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=Judy|last2=Christensen|first2=Tony|date=June 23, 2014|title=Closure and its myths|journal=International Review of Victimology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=327–343|doi=10.1177/0269758014537148|s2cid=143577831|issn=0269-7580}}</ref>

In November 2009, another Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans believed that the mastermind of the [[9/11|September 11 attacks]], [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], should receive the death penalty if convicted, 12 points higher than the rate of general support for the death penalty upon Gallup's most recent poll at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Americans at Odds With Recent Terror Trial Decisions |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124493/Americans-Odds-Recent-Terror-Trial-Decisions.aspx|publisher= gallup.com |access-date=April 10, 2016}}</ref> A similar result was found in 2001 when respondents were polled about the execution of [[Timothy McVeigh]] for the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] that killed 168 people.<ref>{{cite web |title= Foes of death penalty say McVeigh is an exception |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001-05-03-mcveigh-cappunish.htm |publisher= usatoday.com |access-date=April 10, 2016}}</ref>

==Debate==
Capital punishment is a controversial issue, with many prominent organizations and individuals participating in the debate. [[Amnesty International]] and other groups oppose capital punishment on moral grounds.

Some law enforcement organizations, and some victims' rights groups support capital punishment.

The United States is one of the four [[Developed country|developed countries]] that still practice capital punishment, along with [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]], [[Capital punishment in Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]].

Religious groups are widely split on the issue of capital punishment.<ref name="Religious Tolerance">{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/execut7.htm |title=ReligiousTolerance |publisher=ReligiousTolerance |access-date=December 1, 2011}}</ref> The [[Fiqh Council of North America]], a group of highly influential Muslim scholars in the United States, has issued a [[fatwa]] calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States until various preconditions in the legal system are met.<ref>[http://www.fiqhcouncil.org/Articles/GeneralFiqhIssues/tabid/170/ctl/Detail/mid/569/xmid/4/xmfid/1/Default.aspx]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref>

[[Reform Judaism]] has formally opposed the death penalty since 1959, when the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]) resolved "that in the light of modern scientific knowledge and concepts of humanity, the resort to or continuation of capital punishment either by a state or by the national government is no longer morally justifiable." The resolution goes on to say that the death penalty "lies as a stain upon civilization and our religious conscience." In 1979, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], the professional arm of the Reform rabbinate, resolved that, "both in concept and in practice, Jewish tradition found capital punishment repugnant" and there is no persuasive evidence "that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to crime." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://reformjudaism.org/social-justice-advocacy/jewish-views/civil-rights/why-reform-judaism-opposes-death-penalty |title=Why Reform Judaism Opposes the Death Penalty |work=ReformJudaism.org |access-date=March 3, 2019}}</ref>

In October 2009, the [[American Law Institute]] voted to disavow the framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962, as part of the [[Model Penal Code]], "in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment". A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled.<ref>{{Cite news|work=The New York Times |author=Adam Lipak |date= January 4, 2010 |title=Group Gives Up Death Penalty Work |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/us/05bar.html}}</ref> {{As of|2017}}, 159 prisoners have been exonerated due to evidence of their innocence.<ref name="Dwyer-Moss, 760"/><ref name=DPIC2015>{{cite web|title=Facts about the Death Penalty|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf|publisher=Death Penalty Information Center|access-date=December 23, 2015|date=December 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row|title=Innocence: List of Those Freed From Death Row|date=October 28, 2010|access-date=March 11, 2011|publisher=[[Death Penalty Information Center]]}}</ref>

The murder rate is highest in the South (6.5 per 100,000 in 2016), where 80% of executions are carried out, and lowest in the Northeast (3.5 per 100,000), with less than 1% of executions. A report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] in 2012 stated that studies claiming a deterrent effect are "fundamentally flawed" and should not be used for policy decisions.<ref name=DPIC2015/> According to a survey of the former and present presidents of the country's top academic criminological societies, 88% of these experts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder.<ref name=DPIC2015/>

Data shows that the application of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias.<ref name=DPIC2015/> Furthermore, some opponents argue that it is applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that has been shown to be biased through the systemic influence of socio-economic, geographic, and gender factors.<ref>Londono, O.

Various commentators predicted that the death penalty would likely have disappeared in the United States if Hillary Clinton had been elected U.S. president during the [[2016 US Presidential Election|2016 presidential race]] and thus allowed to appoint a left leaning Supreme Court Justice to replace the late [[Antonin Scalia]]. On the contrary, there was a surge in public support for capital punishment, as citizens in three states voted the same day for ballot measures supporting it.

=== Botched executions ===
{{Further|Capital punishment#Movements towards non-painful execution}}
One of the main arguments against the use of capital punishment in the United States is that there has been a long history of botched executions. University of Colorado Boulder Professor [[Michael L. Radelet]] described a "botched execution" as an [[Cruel and unusual punishment|execution that causes the prisoner to suffer for a long period of time]] before they die.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/us0406/8.htm|title=So Long as They Die: Lethal Injections in the United States: VI. Botched Executions|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref> This has led to the argument that capital punishment is [[wikt:per se|per se]] cruel and unusual punishment. The following is a short list of examples of botched executions that have occurred in the United States.
* [[William Kemmler]] was the first person executed in the [[electric chair]], in 1890. After being pronounced dead after 17 seconds, he was found to be still alive. The current was applied a second time, for two minutes, to complete the death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/Botched_Executions_in_American_History|title=Botched Executions in American History {{!}} Death Penalty Information Center|website=deathpenaltyinfo.org|language=en|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

* In Alabama, the execution of [[Doyle Hamm]] was called off after prison medical staff spent nearly three hours attempting to insert an IV that could be used to administer the lethal injection drugs. In the process, the execution team punctured Hamm's bladder and femoral artery, causing significant bleeding.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/gory-botched-alabamas-aborted-execution-of-inmate-was-bloody-says-lawyer|title='Gory, botched': Alabama's aborted execution of inmate was bloody, says lawyer|agency=Reuters|date=February 26, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/03/03/doyle-hamm-alabama-execution-lethal-injection/|title=Another Failed Execution: the Torture of Doyle Lee Hamm|last=Segura|first=Liliana|date=March 3, 2018|website=The Intercept|language=en-US|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

* [[Wallace Wilkerson]] died after 27 minutes in pain after the [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] failed to shoot him in the heart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Acker|first1=James A.|last2=Champagne|first2=Ryan|date=May 2, 2018|title=The Execution of Wallace Wilkerson: Precedent and Portent|journal=Criminal Justice Review|volume=42|pages=349–367|doi=10.1177/0734016817702193|s2cid=148715242}}</ref> Because of this, the constitutionality of the use of the firing squad was questioned. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] affirmed that the firing squad did not violate the Eighth Amendment in the case [[Wilkerson v. Utah|''Wilkerson v. Utah'' (1879)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/99/130|title=WILKERSON v. UTAH.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>
* In New Mexico, [[Tom Ketchum|Thomas Ketchum]] was decapitated when his body fell through the trap door during his hanging.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/thomas-e-ketchum|title=Thomas E.

* In Mississippi, [[Jimmy Lee Gray]] died after being in the gas chamber for nine minutes. During the procedure, Gray thrashed and banged his head against the metal pole behind his head while struggling to breathe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/Gray.pdf |title=Capital punishment UK |website=www.capitalpunishmentuk.org }}</ref>

[[Austin Sarat]], a professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, in his book ''Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America's Death Penalty'', found that from 1890 to 2010, 276 executions were botched out of a total of 8,776, or 3.15%, with lethal injections having the highest rate. Sarat writes that between 1980 and 2010 the rate of botched executions was higher than ever: 8.53 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions |title=Botched Executions {{pipe}} Death Penalty Information Center |work=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |access-date=March 3, 2019}}</ref>

==Clemency and commutations==
The largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in [[Illinois]] when outgoing [[Governor]] [[George Ryan]], who had already imposed a moratorium on executions, pardoned four death-row inmates and commuted the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the possibility of parole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/677 |title=Illinois Death Row Inmates Granted Commutation by Governor George Ryan on January 12, 2003 |publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |access-date=December 1, 2011}}</ref> When Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] signed legislation abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011, he commuted the sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to [[life imprisonment]].<ref name="QuinnSignsAbolition">{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2011/03/quinn-signs-death-penalty-ban-commutes-15-death-row-sentences-to-life.html|title=Quinn signs death penalty ban, commutes 15 death row sentences to life|date=March 9, 2011|access-date=March 9, 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>

Previous post-''Furman'' mass clemencies took place in 1986 in [[New Mexico]], when Governor [[Toney Anaya]] commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing [[Ohio]] Governor [[Dick Celeste]] commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among them all four women on the state's death row. And during his two terms (1979–1987) as [[Florida]]'s Governor, [[Bob Graham]], although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-''Furman'' involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of doubts about guilt or disproportionality.

==Moratorium on executions==
[[File:Death penalty in the United States with hiatuses.svg|thumb|250px|{{legend|#4daf4a|Capital punishment repealed or struck down as unconstitutional}}{{legend|#377eb8|Capital punishment in statute, but executions formally suspended}}{{legend|#ffff33|Capital punishment in statute, but no recent executions}}{{legend|#984ea3|Capital punishment in statute, other unique circumstances apply}}{{legend|#e41a1c|Executions recently carried out}}]]
All executions were suspended through the country between September 2007 and April 2008. At that time, the U.S. Supreme Court was examining the constitutionality of lethal injection in ''[[Baze v. Rees]]''. This was the longest period with no executions in the United States since 1982. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld this method in a 7–2 ruling.

In addition to the states that have no valid death penalty statute, the following 13 states and 2 jurisdictions are noted that have an official [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]], or have had no executions for more than ten years, as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}:

Since 1976, four states have executed only condemned prisoners who voluntarily waived further appeals: Pennsylvania has executed three inmates, Oregon two, Connecticut one, and New Mexico one. In the latter state, Governor [[Toney Anaya]] commuted the sentences of all five condemned prisoners on death row in late 1986.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/11/27/5-death-sentences-commuted/1a7c7cf6-215a-40aa-9d29-8db8f5b40c12/ 5 Death Sentences Commuted], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 27, 1986.

On February 13, 2015, Pennsylvania Governor [[Tom Wolf (politician)|Tom Wolf]] announced a moratorium on the death penalty.

On July 25, 2019, U.S. Attorney General [[William Barr]] announced that the federal government would resume executions using pentobarbital, rather than the three-drug cocktail previously used.
