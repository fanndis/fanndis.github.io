'''Affirmative action''' refers to a set of policies and practices within a government or organization seeking to increase the representation of particular groups based on their gender, race, creed or nationality in areas in which they were excluded in the past such as education and employment.<ref>{{cite web|title=positive discrimination|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/positive-discrimination?q=positive+discrimination|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=affirmative action|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/affirmative-action?q=affirmative+action|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="The Federal Register">{{cite web

The nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region and exists on a spectrum from a hard quota to merely targeting encouragement for increased participation. Some countries use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group; an example of this is the [[Reservation in India|reservation system in India]].

In some other regions where quotas are not used, minoritized group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes. In the United States, affirmative action in employment and education has been the subject of legal and political controversy. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]],'' held that the [[University of Michigan Law School]] could consider race as a plus-factor when evaluating applicants holistically and maintained the prohibition on the use of quotas.<ref name="Supct.law.cornell.edu">{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/03highlts.html#2 |title=Highlights of the 2002–2003 Supreme Court Term |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref><ref>Melvin I Urofsky,   ''The Affirmative Action Puzzle: A Living History From Reconstruction to Today'' (2020)</ref>

In the United Kingdom, hiring someone simply because of their protected group status, without regard to their performance, is illegal.<ref name="cre" /><ref name="govuk">{{cite web|title=Types of discrimination'|url=https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination|work=Discrimination: your rights|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=7 April 2013|author=GOV.UK|authorlink=Gov.uk|date=4 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="personneltoday.com">Personneltoday.com [http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2006/01/17/33430/is-there-a-case-for-positive-discrimination.html "Is there a case for positive discrimination?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105095039/http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2006/01/17/33430/is-there-a-case-for-positive-discrimination.html|date=5 January 2008}}</ref> However, the law in the United Kingdom does allow for membership in a protected and disadvantaged group to be considered in hiring and promotion when the group is under-represented in a given area and if the candidates are of equal merit. The controlling logic is that the person must not be chosen simply because of their group membership, but rather that the relevant authorities are allowed to use disadvantaged group status as a "tie-breaker" between two candidates of otherwise equal merit.<ref name="xperthr.co.uk">https://www.xperthr.co.uk/faq/what-positive-action-is-permitted-under-discrimination-legislation/103008/</ref> This is functionally the same as the practice known as [[affirmative action in the United States]].

An alternative approach common in the United Kingdom is described as "[[positive action]]", however. Under this approach, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is often described as being "color blind", although the social viability of that concept is heavily contested in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |title=Racism Without Racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in the United States |last=Bonilla-Silva |first=Eduardo |date=2014 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-44-222055-3 |edition=4th |pages=101–102 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gallagher, Charles A.|date=2003|title=Color-Blind Privilege: The Social and Political Functions of Erasing the Color Line in Post Race America|journal=Race, Gender & Class|volume=10|issue=4|pages=22–37|jstor=41675099}}</ref>

==Origins==
The term "affirmative action" was first used in the United States in "[[Executive Order 10925|Executive Order No. 10925]]",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://shfg.org/resources/Documents/FH%202%20(2010)%20MacLaury.pdf | title=President Kennedy's E.O.10925: Seedbed of Affirmative Action | publisher=Society for History in the Federal Government | accessdate=20 August 2020}}</ref> signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] on 6 March 1961, which included a provision that [[government contractor]]s "take ''affirmative action'' to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated [fairly] during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin".<ref name="oeod.uci.edu">[http://www.oeod.uci.edu/aa.html A Brief History of Affirmative Action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512084109/http://www.oeod.uci.edu/aa.html|date=12 May 2015}}, University of California, Irvine (access date 16 May 2015)</ref> It was used to promote actions that achieve non-discrimination. In 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] issued [[Executive Order 11246]] which required government employers to "hire without regard to race, religion and national origin" and "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin."<ref>Executive Order 11246</ref>

In 1968, gender was added to the anti-discrimination list.{{Clarify|reason=sex is in the Johnson list for affirmative action|date=May 2020}}<ref name="clinton2.nara.gov">{{cite web|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/aa/aa02.html|title=Affirmative Action: History and Rationale|date=19 July 1995|publisher=Clinton Administration's Affirmative Action Review: Report to the President|access-date=6 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527065435/http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/aa/aa02.html|archive-date=27 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Affirmative action is intended to promote the opportunities of defined minority groups within a society to give them equal access to that of the majority population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Affirmative Action |url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/sharamkohan1/affirmative-action/ |website=Harvard Blogs |publisher=Harvard Law School |accessdate=30 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518061955/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/sharamkohan1/affirmative-action/ |archivedate=18 May 2015  }}</ref>

It is often instituted for government and educational settings to ensure that certain designated groups within a society are able to participate in all provided opportunities including promotional, educational, and training opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action Policy Statement|url=http://www.chatham.edu/about/legal_nondiscrimination.cfm|website=chatham.edu|accessdate=30 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501102235/http://www.chatham.edu/about/legal_nondiscrimination.cfm|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The stated justification for affirmative action by its proponents is to help compensate for past discrimination, persecution or [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] by the ruling class of a culture,<ref>Sowell, Thomas (2004). Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-10199-6}}</ref> and to address existing discrimination.<ref name="Affirmative Action">{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/|title=Affirmative Action|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=1 April 2009}}</ref>

==Women==
{{See also|Women in government#Quotas|label 1=Women in government (quotas)}}
Several different studies investigated the effect of affirmative action on women. Kurtulus (2012) in her review of affirmative action and the occupational advancement of minorities and women during 1973–2003 showed that the effect of affirmative action on advancing black, Hispanic, and white women into management, professional, and technical occupations occurred primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, contractors grew their shares of these groups more rapidly than non-contractors because of the implementation of affirmative action. But the positive effect of affirmative action vanished entirely in the late 1980s, which Kurtulus says may be due to the slowdown into advanced occupation for women and minorities because of the political shift of affirmative action that started by President Reagan. Becoming a federal contractor increased white women's share of professional occupations by 0.183 percentage points, or 9.3 percent, on average during these three decades, and increased black women's share by 0.052 percentage points (or by 3.9 percent). Becoming a federal contractor also increased Hispanic women's and black men's share of technical occupations on average by 0.058 percent and 0.109 percentage points respectively (or by 7.7 and 4.2 percent). These represent a substantial contribution of affirmative action to overall trends in the occupational advancement of women and minorities over the three decades under the study.<ref>Fidan Ana Kurtulus, "Affirmative Action and the Occupational Advancement of Minorities and Women During 1973–2003," ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society'' (2012) 51#2 pp 213–246.

Kim and Kim (2014) found that, "Affirmative action both corrects existing unfair treatment and gives women equal opportunity in the future."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Sunhee|last2=Kim|first2=Seoyong|date=March 2014|title=Exploring the effect of four factors on affirmative action programs for women|url=http://itlboard.ewha.ac.kr/ys_board/view.htm?oid=26&mcode=56&page=2&serial=96605|url-status=dead|journal=[[Asian Journal of Women's Studies]]|volume=20|issue=1|pages=30–69|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050901/http://itlboard.ewha.ac.kr/ys_board/view.htm?oid=26&mcode=56&page=2&serial=96605|archive-date=4 September 2015|ref=harv}} [http://ajou.ac.kr/~seoyong/paper/2014-Exploring%20the%20Effect%20of%20Four%20Factors Pdf.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624065556/http://ajou.ac.kr/~seoyong/paper/2014-Exploring%20the%20Effect%20of%20Four%20Factors|date=24 June 2015}}</ref>

==Quotas==
Law regarding quotas and affirmative action varies widely from nation to nation.

Caste-based and other group-based quotas are used in the [[reservation in India|reservation system]].

In 2012, the [[European Union]] Commission approved a plan for women to constitute 40% of non-executive board directorships in large listed companies in Europe by 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EU's Boardroom Quota Battle Is Over, But Women Cannot Yet Rest |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insead/2012/11/19/the-eus-boardroom-quota-battle-is-over-but-women-cannot-yet-rest/ |magazine=Forbes.com}}</ref>

In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that "affirmative action" ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful.  It said that the requirements for the intake should be the same for all.  The justice minister said that the decision left no room for uncertainty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20061221/5871 |title=Uppsala discriminated against Swedes |website= The Local |date= 21 December 2006}}</ref>

==National approaches==
{{See also|Reserved political positions}}

In some countries that have laws on racial equality, affirmative action is rendered illegal because it does not treat all races equally. This approach of equal treatment is sometimes described as being "[[Color blindness (race)|color blind]]", in hopes that it is effective against discrimination without engaging in [[reverse discrimination]].

In such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is sometimes called [[positive action]].

=====Apartheid=====
The [[apartheid]] government, as a matter of state policy, favoured white-owned, especially [[Afrikaner]]-owned companies. The aforementioned policies achieved the desired results, but in the process, they marginalised and excluded black people. Skilled jobs were also reserved for white people, and blacks were largely used as unskilled labour, enforced by legislation including the [[Mines and Works Act]], the [[Job Reservations Act]], the [[Native Building Workers Act]], the [[Apprenticeship Act]] and the [[Bantu Education Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southendmuseum.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=19&Itemid=20 |title=Job Reservations Act |publisher=South End Museum |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> creating and extending the "colour bar" in South African labour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/luli-35 |title=White Workers and the Colour Bar |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |accessdate=31 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319002102/http://www.sahistory.org.za/luli-35 |archivedate=19 March 2014 |date=3 April 2011 }}</ref> Then the whites successfully persuaded the government to enact laws that highly restricted the blacks' employment opportunities.

Since the 1960s the apartheid laws had been weakened. Consequently, from 1975 to 1990 the real wages of black manufacturing workers rose by 50%, while those of whites rose by 1%.<ref name="africa">[http://www.economist.com/node/244570 Race, law and poverty in the new South Africa], The Economist, 30 September 1999</ref>

The variation in skills and productivity between groups of people ultimately caused disparities in employment, occupation and income within labour markets, which provided advantages to certain groups and characteristics of people. This in due course was the motivation to introduce affirmative action in South Africa, following the end of apartheid.<ref name=prob>{{cite web |last=Stokes|first= G. |date=15 March 2010 |title=The problem with affirmative action |url=http://www.fanews.co.za/article.asp?Front_Page_Features~25,Stokes_Stage~1145,The_problem_with_affirmative_action~7618 |publisher=Fanews.co.za}}</ref>

=====Post-apartheid – the Employment Equity Act=====
Following the transition to democracy in 1994, the [[African National Congress]]-led government chose to implement affirmative action legislation to correct previous imbalances (a policy known as employment equity). As such, all employers were compelled by law to employ previously disenfranchised groups (blacks, [[Indian South Africans|Indians]], and [[Coloureds]]). A related, but distinct concept is [[Black Economic Empowerment]].<ref>[http://www.ecsecc.org/files/publications/120307130010.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318215653/http://www.ecsecc.org/files/publications/120307130010.pdf|date=18 March 2014}}</ref>

The [[Employment Equity Act]] and the [[Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment]] Act aim to promote and achieve equality in the workplace (in South Africa termed "equity"), by advancing people from designated groups. The designated groups who are to be advanced include all people of colour, women (including white women) and [[people with disabilities]] (including white people). Employment Equity legislation requires companies employing more than 50 people to design and implement plans to improve the representativity of workforce demographics, and report them to the [[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/employmentequity.htm |title=Employment Equity FAQ |publisher=Southafrica.info |accessdate=11 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401103321/http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/employmentequity.htm |archivedate=1 April 2012  }}</ref>

Employment Equity also forms part of a company's [[Black Economic Empowerment]] scorecard: in a relatively complex scoring system, which allows for some flexibility in the manner in which each company meets its legal commitments, each company is required to meet minimum requirements in terms of representation by previously disadvantaged groups. The matters covered include equity ownership, representation at employee and management level (up to the board of director level), procurement from black-owned businesses and social investment programs, amongst others.

The policies of Employment Equity and, particularly, Black Economic empowerment have been criticised both by those who view them as discriminatory against white people, and by those who view them as ineffectual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-02-03-bees-glass-slipper |title=BEE's Glass Slipper |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page292679?oid=346519&sn=2009+Detail+no+image&pid=295799 |title=BEE: A man made disaster |publisher=Moneyweb.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="fin24.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-24_2564628 |title='SAB deal to enrich black elite': Fin24: Companies |publisher=Fin24 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003093857/http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-24_2564628 |archivedate=3 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5340048 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516113211/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5340048 |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2016 |title=Business Report – Home – Motlanthe warns BEE council has failed |publisher=Busrep.co.za |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-11-20-manyi-vows-to-get-tough-over-bee |title=Manyi vows to get tough over BEE – Mail & Guardian Online: The smart news source |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref>

These laws cause disproportionally high costs for small companies and reduce economic growth and employment.<ref name=africa/> The laws may give the black middle-class some advantage but can make the worse-off blacks even poorer.<ref name=africa/> Moreover, the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] has ruled that in principle blacks may be favored, but in practice this should not lead to unfair discrimination against the others.<ref name=africa/>

=====Affirmative action purpose=====
Affirmative action was introduced through the Employment Equality Act, 55 in 1998, 4 years after the end of apartheid. This act was passed to promote the constitutional right of equality and exercise true democracy. This idea was to eliminate unfair discrimination in employment, to ensure the implementation of employment equity to redress the effects of discrimination, to achieve a diverse workforce broadly representative of our people, to promote economic development and efficiency in the workforce and to give effects to the obligations of the Republic as a member of the International Labour Organisation.<ref name=prob/><ref name=aff>{{cite journal |last=Bergmann |first=B. |year=1999 |title=The continuing need for affirmative action |journal=The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=757–768 |doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(99)00027-7 }}</ref>

Many embraced the act; however some concluded that the act contradicted itself.  The act eliminates unfair discrimination in certain sectors of the national labour market by imposing similar constraints on another.<ref name=prob/>

With the introduction of Affirmative Action, [[black economic empowerment]] (BEE) rose further in South Africa.  The BEE was not a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past but to promote growth and strategies that aim to realize a country's full potential.  The idea was targeting the weakest link in economics, which was inequality and which would help develop the economy.  This is evident in the statement by the Department of Trade and Industry, "As such, this strategy stresses a BEE process that is associated with growth, development and enterprise development, and not merely the redistribution of existing wealth".<ref name=info>{{cite web |title=Black economic empowerment.

BEE focuses more on employment equality rather than taking wealth away from the skilled white labourers.<ref name=info/>

The main goal of affirmative action is for the country to reach its full potential.  This would result in a completely diverse workforce in economic and social sectors, thus broadening the economic base and stimulating economic growth.<ref name=dem>{{cite web|last=Edigheji |first=O. |year=2006 |title=Affirmative action and state capacity in a democratic South Africa.

=====Outcomes=====
{{debate|section|date=May 2018}}
Once applied within the country, many different outcomes arose, some positive and some negative. This depended on the approach to and the view of The Employment Equality Act and affirmative action.

'''Positive:'''
Pre-Democracy, the apartheid governments discriminated against non-white races, so with affirmative action, the country started to redress past discriminations. Affirmative action also focused on combating structural racism and racial inequality, hoping to maximize diversity in all levels of society and sectors.<ref name=culture>Goga, F. (n.d.). ''A critique of affirmative action: The concept''. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622114513/http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php |archivedate=22 June 2012  }}</ref> Achieving this would elevate the status of the perpetual underclass and to restore equal access to the benefits of society.<ref name=prob/>

'''Negative:'''
As with all policies, there have also been negative outcomes. A quota system was implemented, which aimed to achieve targets of diversity in a workforce. This target affected the hiring and level of skills in the workforce, ultimately impacting the free market.<ref name=dem/><ref name=culture/> Affirmative action created marginalization for coloured and Indian races in South Africa, as well as developing and aiding the middle and elite classes, leaving the lower class behind. This created a bigger gap between the lower and middle class, which led to class struggles and a greater segregation.<ref name=aff/><ref name=culture/> Entitlement began to arise with the growth of the middle and elite classes, as well as race entitlement. Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} assert that affirmative action is discrimination in reverse. Negative consequences of affirmative action, specifically the quota system, drove skilled labour away, resulting in bad economic growth. This is due to very few international companies wanting to invest in South Africa.<ref name=culture/> As a result of the outcomes of affirmative action, the concept is continually evolving.<ref name="culture" />

South African jurist [[Martin van Staden]] argues that the way affirmative action and transformation policies have been implemented in South Africa has eroded state institutions, grown [[Corruption in South Africa|corruption]], and undermined the [[rule of law]] in the country.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-opinion/columnists/a-government-unhinged-2/|title=A government unhinged|last=Ryan|first=Ciaran|date=16 September 2019|website=Moneyweb|access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://ruleoflaw.org.za/the-constitution-and-the-rule-of-law/|title=The Constitution and the Rule of Law: An Introduction|last=van Staden|first=Martin|date=8 February 2019|website=Rule of Law Project|language=en-US|isbn=978-0-9921788-6-4|access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref>

====Israel====
A class-based affirmative action policy was incorporated into the admission practices of the four most selective universities in [[Israel]] during the early to mid-2000s. In evaluating the eligibility of applicants, neither their financial status nor their national or ethnic origins are considered. The emphasis, rather, is on structural disadvantages, especially neighborhood socioeconomic status and high school rigor, although several individual hardships are also weighed.

In her study of gender politics in Israel, Dafna Izraeli showed that the paradox of affirmative action for women directors is that the legitimation for legislating their inclusion on boards also resulted in the exclusion of women's interested as a legitimate issue on the boards' agendas. "The new culture of the men's club is seductive token women are under the pressure to become "social males" and prove that their competence as directors, meaning that they are not significantly different from men. In the negotiation for status as worthy peers, emphasizing gender signals that a woman is an "imposter", someone who does not rightfully belong in the position she is claiming to fill." And once affirmative action for women is fulfilled, and then affirmative action shares the element, as Izraeli put it, the "group equality discourse," making it easier for other groups to claim for a fairer distribution of resources. This suggests that affirmative action can have applications for different groups in Israel.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dafna |last=Izraeli |title=Gender Politics in Israel: The Case of Affirmative Action for Women Directors |journal=Women's Studies International Forum |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=109–128 |date=March–April 2003 |doi=10.1016/S0277-5395(03)00043-8 }}</ref>

==== Malaysia ====
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu}}

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of ethical affirmative action. Malaysia provides affirmative action to the majority to those that are deemed "Bumiputera", which includes the Malay population/Orang Asli as well as to the indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak. However, the indigenous people of Malaysia (Orang Asli) do not have the same special rights of the rest of the Bumiputera as granted under Article 153, as the Orang Asli are not referenced within the article 153 itself.
<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.usm.my/km/KM%2021,2003/21-i.pdf}}</ref>

The historical/common argument is that the Malays have lower incomes than the Chinese and Indians, who have traditionally been involved in businesses and industries, who were also general migrant workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecineq.org/ecineq_paris19/papers_EcineqPSE/paper_406.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Malaysia-POVERTY-AND-WEALTH.html |title=Encyclopedia of the Nations, "Malaysia Poverty and Wealth" |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> Malaysia is a multi-ethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority of close to 52% of the population. About 23% of the population is [[Chinese Malaysian|of Chinese descent]], while [[Indian Malaysian|those of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP) has been dubbed a failure as of recent years, as evidence has pointed to the ever-growing wealth disparity among Malays, that have widened the gap between the rich and poor Malays, while the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] has been shown to benefit the existing rich Malays instead of achieving its intention of helping poor Malays.

==== Sri Lanka ====
In 1981 the [[Policy of standardisation|Standardization policy]] of [[Sri Lanka]]n universities was introduced as an affirmative action program for students from areas which had lower rates of education than other areas due to missionary activity in the north and east, which essentially were the Tamil areas. Successive governments cultivated a historical myth after the colonial powers had left that the British had practised [[communal]] favouritism towards Christians and the minority [[Tamil people|Tamil community]] for the entire 200 years they had controlled [[Sri Lanka]]. However, the Sinhalese in fact benefitted from trade and plantation cultivations over the rest of the other groups and their language and culture as well as the religion of Buddhism was fostered and made into mediums for schools over the Tamil language, which did not have the same treatment and Tamils learned English instead as there was no medium for Tamil until near independence. Tamils' knowledge of English and education came from the very American missionary activity by overseas Christians that the British were concerned will anger the Sinhalese and destroy their trading relationships, so they sent them to the Tamil areas instead to teach, thinking it would have no consequences and due to their small numbers. The British sending the missionaries to the north and east was for the protection of the Sinhalese and in fact, showed favouritism to the majority group instead of the minorities to maintain trading relationships and benefits from them. The Tamils, out of this random benefit from learning English and basic education excelled and flourished and were able to take many civil service jobs to the chagrin of the Sinhalese. The myth of Divide and Rule is untrue. The 'policy of standardisation' was typical of affirmative action policies, in that it required drastically lower standards for Sinhalese students than for the more academic Tamils who had to get about ten more marks to enter into universities. The policy in fact is an example of discrimination against the Tamil ethnic group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sangam.org/british-divide-rule-ceylon/ |title=Did the British Divide & Rule Ceylon? &#124; Ilankai Tamil Sangam |publisher=Sangam.org |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>

The French Ministry of Defence tried in 1990 to make it easier for young French soldiers of North-African descent to be promoted in rank and obtain driving licenses. After a strong protest by a young French lieutenant<ref>Jean-Pierre Steinhofer, "Beur ou ordinaire", ''Armée d'ajourd'hui'', 1991.</ref> in the Ministry of Defence newspaper (''Armées d'aujourd'hui''), the driving license and rank plan was cancelled. After the Sarkozy election, a new attempt in favour of Arab-French students was made, but Sarkozy did not gain enough political support to change the French constitution. However, some French schools do implement affirmative action in that they are obligated to take a certain number of students from impoverished families.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/12/17/le-plan-sarkozy-pour-favoriser-l-egalite-reelle-des-chances_1132074_823448.html#ens_id=1128487° |title=Le Plan Sarkozy |work=Le Monde  |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=11 April 2012|last1=Eeckhout |first1=Laetitia Van }}</ref>

==== Germany ====
Article 3 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] provides for equal rights of all people regardless of sex, race or social background. There are programs stating that if men and women have equal qualifications, women have to be preferred for a job; moreover, the disabled should be preferred to non-disabled people. This is typical for all positions in state and university service {{as of|2007|lc=y}}, typically using the phrase "We try to increase diversity in this line of work". In recent years, there has been a long public debate about whether to issue programs that would grant women a privileged access to jobs in order to fight discrimination. Germany's ''[[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]]'' brought up the discussion about affirmative action in [[Education in Germany|Germany's school system]]. According to [[Stefan Zillich]], quotas should be "a possibility" to help working class children who did not do well in school gain access to a ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' (University-preparatory school).<ref>Susanne Vieth-Entus (29.

Seierstad & Opsahl in their study of the effects of affirmative action on presence, prominence, and social capital of women directors in Norway found that there are few boards chaired by a woman, from the beginning of the implementation of the affirmative action policy period to August 2009, the proportion of boards led by a woman has increased from 3.4% to 4.3%. This suggests that the law has had a marginal effect on the sex of the chair and the boards remain internally segregated. Although at the beginning of our observation period, only 7 of 91 prominent directors were women. The gender balance among prominent directors has changed considerably throughout the period, and at the end of the period, 107 women and 117 men were prominent directors. By applying more restrictive definitions of prominence, the proportion of directors who are women generally increases. If only considering directors with at least three directorships, 61.4% of them are women. When considering directors with seven or more directorships, all of them are women. Thus, affirmative action increases the female population in the director position.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seierstad |first1=Cathrine |last2=Opsahl |first2=Tore |title=For the few not the many?

Quotas for access to university education, offices in the Soviet system and the Communist Party existed: for example, the position of First Secretary of a Soviet Republic's (or Autonomous Republic's) Party Committee was always filled by a representative of this republic's "[[titular ethnicity]]".

Modern Russia retains this system partially.

The equality section of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] explicitly permits affirmative action type legislation, although the Charter does not ''require'' legislation that gives preferential treatment. Subsection 2 of [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] states that the equality provisions do "not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability".

The Canadian ''[[Employment Equity Act]]'' requires employers in federally-regulated industries to give preferential treatment to four designated groups: Women, persons with disabilities, aboriginal peoples, and [[visible minorities]]. Less than one-third of Canadian Universities offer alternative admission requirements for students of aboriginal descent. Some provinces and territories also have affirmative action-type policies. For example, in the [[Northwest Territories]] in the Canadian north, aboriginal people are given preference for jobs and education and are considered to have P1 status. Non-aboriginal people who were born in the NWT or have resided half of their life there are considered a P2, as well as women and people with disabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hr.gov.nt.ca/employment/affirmativeaction/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120803122042/http://www.hr.gov.nt.ca/employment/affirmativeaction/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |title=GNWT – Human Resources – Affirmative Action |publisher=Hr.gov.nt.ca |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|Affirmative action in the United States}}
The policy of affirmative action dates to the [[Reconstruction Era]] in the United States, 1863–1877.<ref>Melvin I. Urofsky,  ''The Affirmative Action Puzzle: A Living History From Reconstruction to Today'' (2020).</ref>  Current policy was introduced in the early 1960s in the United States, as a way to combat [[racial discrimination]] in the hiring process, with the concept later expanded to address gender discrimination.<ref name="clinton2.nara.gov" /> Affirmative action was first created from [[Executive Order 10925]], which was signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] on 6 March 1961 and required that government employers "not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin" and "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shfg.org/shfg/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/4-MacLaury-design4-new_Layout-1.pdf|title=President Kennedy's E.O.10925: Seedbed of Affirmative Action|publisher=Society for History in the Federal Government|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

On 24 September 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed [[Executive Order 11246]], thereby replacing [[Executive Order 10925]] and affirming Federal Government's commitment "to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a positive, continuing program in each executive department and agency".<ref name="The Federal Register"/> Affirmative action was extended to women by [[Executive Order 11375]] which amended Executive Order 11246 on 13 October 1967, by adding "sex" to the list of protected categories. In the U.S. affirmative action's original purpose was to pressure institutions into compliance with the nondiscrimination mandate of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name="Affirmative Action"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/blog/index.php/2012/09/24/executive-order-11246-and-affirmative-action/|title=Executive Order 11246 and Affirmative Action « Publishing the Long Civil Rights Movement|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019155311/https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/blog/index.php/2012/09/24/executive-order-11246-and-affirmative-action/|archivedate=19 October 2014}}</ref> The Civil Rights Acts do not cover veterans, people with disabilities, or people over 40.

In 2003, a Supreme Court decision regarding affirmative action in higher education (''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', 539 US 244 – Supreme Court 2003) permitted educational institutions to consider race as a factor when admitting students.<ref name="Supct.law.cornell.edu"/> Alternatively, some colleges use financial criteria to attract racial groups that have typically been under-represented and typically have lower living conditions. Some states such as California ([[California Civil Rights Initiative]]), Michigan ([[Michigan Civil Rights Initiative]]), and Washington ([[Initiative 200]]) have passed constitutional amendments banning public institutions, including public schools, from practicing affirmative action within their respective states. Conservative activists have alleged that colleges quietly use illegal quotas to discriminate against people of Asian, Jewish, and Caucasian backgrounds and have launched numerous lawsuits to stop them.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven M.

== International organizations ==

=== United Nations ===
The International [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] stipulates (in Article 2.2) that affirmative action programs may be required of countries that ratified the convention, in order to rectify systematic discrimination. It states, however, that such programs "shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved".<ref name="unhchr.ch">United Nations Committee on Human Rights, [http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3888b0541f8501c9c12563ed004b8d0e?Opendocument General Comment 18 on Non-discrimination, Paragraph 10]</ref>

The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] states that "the principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by the Covenant. For example, in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination, in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant."<ref name="unhchr.ch"/>

==Support==
The principle of affirmative action is to promote societal equality through the preferential treatment of socioeconomically disadvantaged people. Often, these people are disadvantaged for historical reasons, such as oppression or slavery.<ref name="Christophe Jaffrelot pg. 321">Christophe Jaffrelot, India's Silent Revolution: The rise of lower castes in northern India, p. 321. 2003</ref>
Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws.

A 2017 study of temporary federal affirmative action regulation in the United States estimated that the regulation "increases the black share of employees over time: in 5 years after an establishment is first regulated, the black share of employees increases by an average of 0.8 percentage points. Strikingly, the black share continues to grow at a similar pace even after an establishment is deregulated. [The author] argue[s] that this persistence is driven in part by affirmative action inducing employers to improve their methods for screening potential hires."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Persistent Effect of Temporary Affirmative Action|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|volume=9|issue=3|pages=152–190|doi=10.1257/app.20160121|year=2017|last1=Miller|first1=Conrad|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
{{see also|Affirmative action in the United States#Arguments against affirmative action|Resistance to diversity efforts in organizations}}
Critics of affirmative action offer a variety of arguments as to why it is counterproductive or should be discontinued. For example, critics may argue that affirmative action hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages individuals to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are not. It may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within [[minority group]]s at the expense of the least fortunate within majority groups.<ref name="Cultural Whiplash 2006">''Cultural Whiplash: Unforeseen Consequences of America's Crusade Against Racial Discrimination'' / Patrick Garry (2006) {{ISBN|1-58182-569-2}}</ref>

Some opponents of affirmative action argue that it is a form of [[reverse discrimination]], that any effort to cure discrimination through affirmative action is wrong because it, in turn, is another form of discrimination.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Fish |first1=Stanley |title=Reverse Racism, or How the Pot Got to Call the Kettle Black |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/politics/race/fish.htm |accessdate=2 March 2019 |magazine=The Atlantic |date=November 1993}}</ref> Some critics claim that court cases such as ''[[Fisher v. University of Texas (2016)|Fisher v. University of Texas]]'', which held that colleges have some discretion to consider race when making admissions decisions, demonstrate how discrimination occurs in the name of affirmative action.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Newkirk |first1=Vann R. |title=The Myth of Reverse Racism: The idea of white victimhood is increasingly central to the debate over affirmative action |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/08/myth-of-reverse-racism/535689/ |accessdate=2 March 2019 |magazine=The Atlantic |date=5 August 2017}}</ref>

Some critics of affirmative action argue that affirmative action devalues the actual accomplishments of people who are chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications, thus rendering affirmative action counterproductive.<ref name="Sher, George 1983, p.40">Sher, George, "Preferential Hiring", in Tom Regan (ed.), Just Business: New Introductory Essays in Business Ethics, Philadelphia, Temple University Press, 1983, p. 40.</ref><ref name=sowell>{{cite book |last1=Sowell |first1=Thomas |title=Affirmative Action Around the World |date=2004 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300107753|title-link=Affirmative Action Around the World }}</ref>

Some argue that affirmative action policies create an opportunity for fraud, by encouraging non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups (that is, members of groups that benefit from affirmative action) in order to take advantage of group preference policies.<ref name=sowell/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Tseming |title=Choice and Fraud in Racial Identification: The Dilemma of Policing Race in Affirmative Action, the Census, and a Color-Blind Society |journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law |date=2006 |volume=11 |pages=367 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1718&context=facpubs |accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>

Critics of affirmative action suggest that programs may benefit the members of the targeted group that least need the benefit, that is those who have the greatest social, economic and educational advantages within the targeted group.<ref name=sowell/> Other beneficiaries may be described as wholly unqualified for the opportunity made available through affirmative action.<ref name=murray>{{cite web |title=Charles Murray |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/charles-murray |website=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> They may argue that at the same time the people who lose the most to affirmative action are the least fortunate members of non-preferred groups.<ref name=sowell/>

Another criticism of affirmative action is that it may reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best. Beneficiaries of affirmative action may conclude that it is unnecessary to work as hard, and those who do not benefit may perceive hard work as futile.<ref name=sowell/>

=== Mismatching ===
Mismatching is the term given to the supposed negative effect that affirmative action has when it places a student into a college that is too difficult for them. For example, in the absence of affirmative action, a student will be admitted to a college that matches his or her academic ability and has a good chance of graduating. However, according to the mismatching hypothesis, affirmative action often places a student into a college that is too difficult, and this increases the student's chance of dropping out of the college or of their desired major.  Thus, affirmative action hurts its intended beneficiaries, because it increases their dropout rates.<ref name="latimes.com">[https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-sander26sep26,0,3998908.story?coll=la-opinion-center Does affirmative action hurt minorities?], ''Los Angeles Times'', 26 September 2007</ref><ref name="Quotas on trial">[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell010803.asp Quotas on trial], by Thomas Sowell, 8 January 2003</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heriot |first1=Gail L. |authorlink1=Gail Heriot |title=Want to Be a Doctor?

Evidence in support of the mismatching theory was presented by [[Gail Heriot]], a professor of law at the [[University of San Diego]] and a member of the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]], in a 24 August 2007 article published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. [[Richard Sander]] concluded that there were 7.9% fewer black attorneys than there would have been if there had been no affirmative action.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heriot |first1=Gail |title=Affirmative Action Backfires |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792252575507571 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=24 August 2007 }}</ref> The article also states that because of mismatching, blacks are more likely to drop out of law school and fail bar exams.<ref name=Sander>{{cite journal |last1=Sander |first1=Richard H. |title=A Systemic Analysis of Affirmative Action in American Law Schools |journal=Stanford Law Review |date=2004 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=367–483 |url=https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/01/Sander.pdf |jstor=40040209 }}</ref>

Sander's paper on mismatching has been criticized by several law professors, including [[Ian Ayres]] and Richard Brooks from Yale who argue that eliminating affirmative action would actually reduce the number of black lawyers by 12.7%.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisman |first=Ray |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2005/04/sanding_down_sander.html |title=Slate.com |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=11 April 2012|date=29 April 2005 }}</ref> A 2008 study by [[Jesse Rothstein]] and Albert H. Yoon confirmed Sander's mismatch findings, but also found that eliminating affirmative action would "lead to a 63 percent decline in black matriculants at all law schools and a 90 percent decline at elite law schools".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/09/03/affirm | title=Attacking the 'Mismatch' Critique of Affirmative Action | work=Inside Higher Education | date=3 September 2008 | accessdate=27 January 2016 | author=Jaschik, Scott}}</ref> These high numbers predictions were doubted in a review of previous studies by Peter Arcidiacono and Michael Lovenheim. Their 2016 article found a strong indication that affirmative action results in a mismatch effect. They argued that the attendance by some African-American students to less-selective schools would significantly improve the low first attempt rate at passing the [[State bar association|state bar]], but they cautioned that such improvements could be outweighed by decreases in law school attendance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arcidiacono |first1=Peter |last2=Lovenheim |first2=Michael |title=Affirmative Action and the Quality–Fit Trade-off |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |date=1 March 2016 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=3–51 |doi=10.1257/jel.54.1.3 |s2cid=1876963 }}</ref>

A 2011 study proposed that mismatch can only occur when a selective school possesses private information that, had this information been disclosed, would have changed the student's choice of school. The study found that this is in fact the case for [[Duke University]], and that this information predicts the student's academic performance after beginning college.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arcidiacono |first1=Peter |last2=Aucejo |first2=Esteban M. |last3=Fang |first3=Hanming |last4=Spenner |first4=Kenneth I. |title=Does affirmative action lead to mismatch?
