==Criticism and controversy==
Carroll was personally attacked while at [[Anglo American PLC|Anglo American]] for her responsibility in the conglomerate's labour rights record<ref name="Anglo American: The Alternative Report">[http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/corporations-and-conflict/mining-conflict-and-abuse/inform/14777-anglo-american-the-alternative-report Anglo American: The Alternative Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213001156/http://waronwant.org/campaigns/corporations-and-conflict/mining-conflict-and-abuse/inform/14777-anglo-american-the-alternative-report |date=2009-02-13 }}</ref> as well as her role in several environmentally controversial projects piloted by the company.<ref>{{cite news

Carroll’s strategy for Anglo American has attracted criticism. Some shareholders{{Who|date=May 2013}} see her modernization plans as too radical for a company that has historically had such an important role in the South African economy, while others complain that the company has been undermanaged, and that she has not yet delivered on her proposals. And Anglo American’s recent decision to suspend its dividend has drawn criticism.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The ''Grist'' magazine nickname was later discussed in a ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' magazine article that profiled Carroll’s initiatives surrounding the [[Pebble Mine]] project.<ref name="fastcompany.com" />  In 2007, Carroll issued a series of social, environmental and economic commitments on behalf of the Pebble Partnership to address concerns from the local community.<ref>Magee, Sean [http://www.pebblepartnership.com/related_media/ceo.pdf "Cynthia Carroll pledges Pebble will go beyond compliance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720174726/http://www.pebblepartnership.com/related_media/ceo.pdf |date=2008-07-20 }}, "The Pebble Partnership", October 23, 2007.</ref>
