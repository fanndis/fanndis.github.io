'''Bavaria''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|v|ɛər|i|ə}}; [[German language|German]] and [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]]: ''Bayern'' {{IPA-de|ˈbaɪɐn|}}), officially the '''Free State of Bavaria''' (German and Bavarian: ''Freistaat Bayern'' {{IPA-de|ˈfʁaɪʃtaːt ˈbaɪɐn|}}), is a landlocked [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Federal Republic of Germany|Germany]], occupying its southeastern corner. With an area of {{convert|70550.19|km2|mi2}} Bavaria is the [[List of German states by area|largest German state by land area]] comprising roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany. With 13&nbsp;million inhabitants, it is Germany's [[List of German states by population|second-most-populous state]] after [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], with Bavaria's main cities being [[Munich]] (its capital and largest city and also the third [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest city in Germany]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bavaria – Lonely Planet|url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/bavaria|website = Lonely Planet|accessdate = 2015-08-31|first = Lonely|last = Planet}}</ref>), [[Nuremberg]], and [[Augsburg]].

The [[history of Bavaria]] includes its earliest settlement by [[Iron Age]] [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, followed by the conquests of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century BC, when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]]. It became a [[Duchy of Bavaria|stem duchy]] in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. It was later incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], became an independent kingdom, joined the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom, and finally became a [[States of Germany|state]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Unknown|first1=Unknown|title=Bavaria|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Bavaria|website=Britannica|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

Bavaria has a unique culture, largely because of the state's large [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] plurality and conservative traditions.<ref name="EKD2016">{{cite web| title = Kirchenmitgliederzahlen Stand 31.12 2016| publisher = ekd.de| accessdate = 2018-04-25| url = https://archiv.ekd.de/download/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2016.pdf}}</ref> [[Bavarian people|Bavarians]] have traditionally been proud of their culture, which includes a [[Bavarian language|language]], [[Bavarian cuisine|cuisine]], architecture, festivals such as [[Oktoberfest]] and elements of [[The Alps|Alpine]] symbolism.<ref>{{cite web|title = Bavaria – The Local|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20100204/25043|website = The Local|accessdate = 2015-08-31|first = The|last = Local}}</ref> The state also has the second largest economy among the [[List of German states by GDP|German states by GDP figures]], giving it a status as a rather wealthy German region.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Eric|title=Germany – A Bavarian Fairy Tale|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2012/s3430858.htm|website=ABC|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

===Antiquity===
The Bavarians emerged in a region north of the [[Alps]], previously inhabited by [[Celts]], which had been part of the Roman provinces of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]]. The Bavarians spoke a Germanic dialect which developed into [[Old High German]] during the early Middle Ages, but, unlike other [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups, they probably did not migrate from elsewhere. Rather, they seem to have coalesced out of other groups left behind by the Roman withdrawal late in the 5th century. These peoples may have included the Celtic [[Boii]], some remaining [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Allemanni]], [[Quadi]], [[Thuringians]], [[Goths]], [[Scirians]], [[Rugians]], [[Heruli]]. The name "Bavarian" ("[[Baiuvarii]]") means "Men of Baia" which may indicate Bohemia, the homeland of the Celtic [[Boii]] and later of the Marcomanni. They first appear in written sources circa 520. A 17th century Jewish chronicler [[David Gans|David Solomon Ganz]], citing [[Cyriacus Spangenberg]], claimed that the diocese was named after an ancient Bohemian king, Boiia, in the 14th century BC.<ref name=ganz>Dovid Solomon Ganz, Tzemach Dovid (3rd edition), part 2, Warsaw 1878, pp. 71, 85 ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&st=&pgnum=72&hilite= available online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071027/http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&st=&pgnum=72&hilite= |date=14 April 2016 }} )</ref>

===Middle Ages===
{{Further|Duchy of Bavaria}}
From about 554 to 788, the house of [[Agilolfing]] ruled the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], ending with [[Tassilo III]] who was deposed by [[Charlemagne]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Warren|title=Unjust Seizure|date=2001|isbn=9780801437908|page=63 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Gxcm3kbgQAC&pg=PA63 |accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

Three early dukes are named in [[Franks|Frankish]] sources: [[Garibald I]] may have been appointed to the office by the [[Merovingian]] kings and married the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] princess Walderada when the church forbade her to King [[Chlothar I]] in 555. Their daughter, [[Theodelinde]], became Queen of the Lombards in northern Italy and Garibald was forced to flee to her when he fell out with his Frankish overlords. Garibald's successor, [[Tassilo I of Bavaria|Tassilo I]], tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] around 600. Tassilo's son [[Garibald II of Bavaria|Garibald II]] seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Unknown|first1=Unknown|title=History of Bavaria|url=http://www.guide-to-bavaria.com/en/Bavaria-History.html|website=Guide to Bavaria|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

After Garibald II, little is known of the Bavarians until [[Theodo of Bavaria#Ordinals|Duke Theodo I]], whose reign may have begun as early as 680. From 696 onward, he invited churchmen from the west to organize churches and strengthen Christianity in his duchy. (It is unclear what Bavarian religious life consisted of before this time.) His son, [[Theodbert of Bavaria|Theudebert]], led a decisive Bavarian campaign to intervene in a succession dispute in the [[Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] in 714, and married his sister Guntrud to the Lombard [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|King Liutprand]]. At Theodo's death the duchy was divided among his sons, but reunited under his grandson [[Hugbert of Bavaria|Hugbert]].

[[File:Baiern unter den Carolingern im Jahre 900.jpg|thumb|left|The Kingdom of Bavaria in 900]]
[[File:Karte Herzogtum Bayern im 10. Jahrhundert.png|thumb|Bavaria in the 10th century]]
At Hugbert's death (735) the duchy passed to a distant relative named [[Odilo of Bavaria|Odilo]], from neighboring [[Alemannia]] (modern southwest Germany and northern Switzerland). Odilo issued a [[Lex Baiuvariorum|law code for Bavaria]], completed the process of church organization in partnership with [[Saint Boniface|St. Boniface]] (739), and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Grifo]]. He was defeated near [[Augsburg]] in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frassetto|first1=Michael|title=The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne [2 Volumes]|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598849967|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6feKDfRM9sYC&pg=PA145 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Early Medieval Europe, 300–1000|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1137014283|page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZukcBQAAQBAJ }}</ref> [[Saint Boniface]] completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early 8th century.

[[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo III]] (b. 741 – d. after 796) succeeded his father at the age of eight after an unsuccessful attempt by Grifo to rule Bavaria. He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onward. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the [[Danube]] and colonizing these lands. After 781, however, his cousin Charlemagne began to pressure Tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. The deposition was not entirely legitimate. Dissenters attempted a coup against Charlemagne at Tassilo's old capital of [[Regensburg]] in 792, led by his own son [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pépin the Hunchback]]. The king had to drag Tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the Assembly of Frankfurt in 794. This is the last appearance of Tassilo in the sources, and he probably died a monk. As all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the Agilolfing dynasty.

[[File:Bayern nach der Teilung 1392.png|thumb|The Bavarian duchies after the partition of 1392]]
For the next 400 years numerous families held the duchy, rarely for more than three generations. With the revolt of duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]] in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and south east. The territory of ''[[Name of Austria|Ostarrichi]]'' was elevated to a duchy in its own right and given to the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberger family]]. This event marks the founding of [[Austria]].

The last, and one of the most important, of the dukes of Bavaria was [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[house of Welf]], founder of Munich, and ''de facto'' the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of [[Saxony]] and Bavaria by his cousin, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (a.k.a. "Barbarossa" for his red beard), Bavaria was awarded as [[fief]] to the [[Wittelsbach]] family, counts palatinate of Schyren ("Scheyern" in modern German). They ruled for 738 years, from 1180 to 1918. The [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] by Rhine (''Kurpfalz'' in German) was also acquired by the [[House of Wittelsbach]] in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=Joel F.|title=Reordering Marriage and Society in Reformation Germany|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521464833|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFeGzFxsBzMC&pg=PA17 }}</ref>

The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] in 1268, [[Swabia]]n territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes. [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis the Bavarian]] acquired [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] for his House but released the [[Upper Palatinate]] for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies existed after the division of 1392: [[Bavaria-Straubing]], [[Bavaria-Landshut]], [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt]] and [[Bavaria-Munich]].  In 1506 with the [[Landshut War of Succession]], the other parts of Bavaria were reunited, and Munich became the sole capital. The country became one of the Jesuit-supported counter-reformation centers.

===Electorate of Bavaria===
{{Further|Electorate of Bavaria}}
In 1623 the Bavarian duke replaced his relative of the Palatinate branch, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in the early days of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and acquired the powerful [[prince-elector]]al dignity in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empire's laws.

During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria ([[War of the Spanish Succession]], [[War of the Austrian Succession]] with the election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburg). From 1777 onward, and after the younger Bavarian branch of the family had died out with elector [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Max III Joseph]], Bavaria and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] were governed once again in [[personal union]], now by the Palatinian lines. The new state also comprised the [[Duchy of Jülich|Duchies of Jülich]] and [[Berg (state)|Berg]] as these on their part were in personal union with the Palatinate.

===Kingdom of Bavaria===
{{Main|Kingdom of Bavaria}}
[[File:Bayern von 1800 bis heute.png|thumb|Bavaria in the 19th century and beyond]]
When [[Napoleon]] abolished the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria became a [[Kingdom of Bavaria|kingdom]] in 1806 due, in part, to the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=Paul R.|title=Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0810878921|edition=2|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio0ed2hans|url-access=registration|quote=bavaria kingdom 1806 napoleon.}}</ref> Its area doubled after the Duchy of Jülich was ceded to France, as the Electoral Palatinate was divided between France and the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. The Duchy of Berg was given to [[Jerome Bonaparte]]. [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] were temporarily reunited with Bavaria but finally ceded to Austria by the [[Congress of Vienna]].  In return Bavaria was allowed to annex the modern-day region of [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] to the west of the [[Rhine]] and [[Franconia]] in 1815.  Between 1799 and 1817, the leading minister, Count [[Maximilian Joseph von Montgelas|Montgelas]], followed a strict policy of modernisation; he laid the foundations of administrative structures that survived the monarchy and retain core validity in the 21st century. In May 1808 a first constitution was passed by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheehan|first1=James J.|title=German History, 1770–1866|date=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0198204329|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAEj4vtFR3AC&pg=PA265 }}</ref> being modernized in 1818. This second version established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords (''Kammer der Reichsräte'') and a House of Commons (''Kammer der Abgeordneten''). That constitution was followed until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of [[World War I]].

After the rise of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] to power in the early 18th century, Bavaria preserved its independence by playing off the rivalry of Prussia and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Allied to Austria, it was defeated along with Austria in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] and was not incorporated into the [[North German Federation|North German Confederation]] of 1867, but the question of German unity was still alive. When [[Franco-Prussian War|France declared war on Prussia in 1870]], all the south German states aside from Austria (Baden, Württemberg, Hessen-Darmstadt and Bavaria) joined the Prussian forces and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed [[German Empire|''Deutsches Reich'' (German Empire)]] in 1871. Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and it had some special rights within the federation (such as an army, railways, postal service and a diplomatic body of its own) but the diplomatic body postal service railways were later undone by Wilhelm II who declared them illegal and got rid of the diplomatic service first.

===Part of the German Empire===
[[File:Map-DR-Bavaria (blau).svg|thumb|left|upright|Bavaria within the [[German Empire]]]]
When Bavaria became part of the newly formed German Empire, this action was considered controversial by [[Bavarian nationalism|Bavarian nationalists]] who had wanted to retain independence from the rest of Germany, as Austria had. As Bavaria had a majority-Catholic population, many people resented being ruled by the mostly [[Protestantism in Germany|Protestant]] northerners of [[Prussia]]. As a direct result of the Bavarian-Prussian feud, political parties formed to encourage Bavaria to break away and regain its independence.<ref name="Minahan2000">{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC&pg=PA106|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30984-7|pages=106–}}</ref> Although the idea of Bavarian separatism was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, apart from a small minority such as the [[Bavaria Party]], most Bavarians accepted that Bavaria is part of Germany. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the early 20th century, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and other artists were drawn to Bavaria, especially to the [[Schwabing]] district of Munich, a center of international artistic activity. This area was devastated by bombing and invasion during [[World War II]].

===Free State of Bavaria===
[[File:Kriegerdenkmal Dietelskirchen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A memorial to soldiers who died in the two World Wars in Dietelskirchen ([[Kröning]]), Bavaria]]
''Free State'' has been an adopted designation after the abolition of monarchy in the aftermath of World War I in several German states.
On 12 November 1918, [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]] signed a document, the [[Anif declaration]], releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths; the [[People's State of Bavaria|newly formed republican government]], or "People's State" of Socialist premier [[Kurt Eisner]],<ref>William L. Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany'', New York, NY, Simon & Schuster, 2011, p. 33</ref> interpreted this as an abdication. To date, however, no member of the House of Wittelsbach has ever formally declared renunciation of the throne.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Karacs|first1=Imre|title=Bavaria buries the royal dream Funeral of Prince Albrechty|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/bavaria-buries-the-royal-dream-funeral-of-prince-albrechty-1328457.html|website=The Independent|date=13 July 1996}}</ref> On the other hand, none has ever since officially called upon their Bavarian or Stuart claims. Family members are active in cultural and social life, including the head of the house, [[Franz, Duke of Bavaria]]. They step back from any announcements on public affairs, showing approval or disapproval solely by Franz's presence or absence.

Eisner was assassinated in February 1919, ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the [[Freikorps]], the Bavarian Soviet Republic fell in May 1919. The [[Constitution of Bavaria|Bamberg Constitution]] (''{{lang|de|Bamberger Verfassung}}'') was enacted on 12 or 14 August 1919 and came into force on 15 September 1919 creating the Free State of Bavaria within the [[Weimar Republic]]. Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] led by the [[NSDAP|National Socialists]], and Munich and Nuremberg became seen as [[Nazism|Nazi]] strongholds under the [[Third Reich]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]. However, in the crucial [[German federal election, March 1933]], the Nazis received less than 50% of the votes cast in Bavaria.

As a manufacturing centre, Munich was heavily bombed during [[World War II]] and was occupied by U.S. troops, becoming a major part of the American Zone of [[Allied-occupied Germany]] (1945–47) and then of [[Bizone|"Bizonia"]].

The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. During the [[Cold War]], Bavaria was part of [[West Germany]]. In 1949, the Free State of Bavaria chose not to sign the Founding Treaty (''Gründungsvertrag'') for the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany, opposing the division of Germany into two states, after [[World War II]]. The [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian Parliament]] did not sign the [[Basic Law of Germany]], mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual ''Länder'', but at the same time decided that it would still come into force in Bavaria if two-thirds of the other ''Länder'' ratified it. All of the other ''Länder'' ratified it, and so it became law.<ref>[http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/EN:Free_State_of_Bavaria_(Freistaat_Bayern) Johannes Merz, Free State of Bavaria (Freistaat Bayern), published 03 July 2006, english version published 17 February 2020; in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]</ref>

Bavarians have often emphasized a separate national identity and considered themselves as "Bavarians" first, "Germans" second.<ref>[http://www.european-vacation-planner.com/bavaria-guide.html Bavaria Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204020156/http://www.european-vacation-planner.com/bavaria-guide.html |date=4 February 2013 }}. European-vacation-planner.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.</ref> This feeling started to come about more strongly among Bavarians when the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] joined the Protestant Prussian-dominated [[German Empire]] while the [[Bavarian nationalism|Bavarian nationalists]] wanted to keep Bavaria as Catholic and an independent state. Nowadays, aside from the minority [[Bavaria Party]], most Bavarians accept that Bavaria is part of Germany.<ref>Lunau, Kate. (25 June 2009) [http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/06/25/no-more-bavarian-separatism/ "No more Bavarian separatism – World"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210005405/http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/06/25/no-more-bavarian-separatism/ |date=10 February 2013 }}, Macleans.ca, 25 June 2009, Retrieved on 2013-07-16.</ref> Another consideration is that Bavarians foster different cultural identities: [[Franconia]] in the north, speaking [[East Franconian German]]; Bavarian Swabia in the south west, speaking [[Swabian German]]; and [[Altbayern]] (so-called "Old Bavaria", the regions forming the "historic", pentagon-shaped Bavaria before the acquisitions through the Vienna Congress, at present the districts of the Upper Palatinate, Lower and Upper Bavaria) speaking [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]]. In Munich, the Old Bavarian dialect was widely spread, but nowadays [[High German languages|High German]] is predominantly spoken there. Moreover, by the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of German speakers from Eastern Europe]], Bavaria has received a large population that was not traditionally Bavarian. In particular, the [[Sudeten Germans]], expelled from neighboring [[Czechoslovakia]], have been deemed to have become the "fourth tribe" of Bavarians.

==Flags and coat of arms==
{{Main|Flag of Bavaria|Coat of arms of Bavaria}}

===Flags===
Uniquely among German states, Bavaria has two official flags of equal status, one with a white and blue stripe, the other with white and blue [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenges]]. Either may be used by civilians and government offices, who are free to choose between them.<ref name="fotw 54">{{cite web|title=Flag Legislation (Bavaria, Germany), Executive Order on Flags of 1954|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/de-by_lx.html#1954|work=[[Flags of the World (website)|Flags of the World]]|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> Unofficial versions of the flag, especially a lozenge style with coat of arms, are sometimes used by civilians.

===Coat of arms===
The modern coat of arms of Bavaria was designed by Eduard Ege in 1946, following heraldic traditions.
* The Golden Lion: At the dexter chief, sable, a [[lion (heraldry)|lion]] rampant Or, armed and langued gules. This represents the administrative region of Upper Palatinate.
* The "[[Franconian Rake]]": At the sinister chief, per [[fess]] dancetty, gules, and argent. This represents the administrative regions of Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia.
* The Blue "Pantier" (mythical creature from [[French heraldry]], sporting a flame instead of a tongue): At the dexter base, argent, a Pantier rampant azure, armed Or and langued gules. This represents the regions of Lower and Upper Bavaria.
* The Three Lions: At the sinister base, Or, three lions passant guardant sable, armed and langued gules. This represents Swabia.
* The White-And-Blue inescutcheon: The [[escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] of white and blue fusils askance was originally the coat of arms of the Counts of Bogen, adopted in 1247 by the House of Wittelsbach. The white-and-blue fusils are indisputably the emblem of Bavaria and these arms today symbolize Bavaria as a whole. Along with the People's Crown, it is officially used as the Minor Coat of Arms.
* The People's Crown (''Volkskrone''): The coat of arms is surmounted by a [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]] with a golden band inset with precious stones and decorated with five ornamental leaves. This crown first appeared in the coat of arms to symbolize sovereignty of [[common people|the people]] after the royal crown was eschewed in 1923.

==Geography==
[[File:Über dem Spitzsteinhaus (3650068382).jpg|thumb|left|View of the Bavarian Alps]]
Bavaria shares international borders with [[Austria]] ([[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Upper Austria]] and [[Vorarlberg]]) and [[Czechia]] ([[Karlovy Vary Region|Karlovy Vary]], [[Plzeň Region|Plzeň]] and [[South Bohemian Region]]s), as well as with [[Switzerland]] (across [[Lake Constance]] to the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]). Because all of these countries are part of the [[Schengen Area]], the border is completely open. Neighboring states within Germany are [[Baden-Württemberg]], Hesse, [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]]. Two major rivers flow through the state: the [[Danube]] (''Donau'') and the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The [[Bavarian Alps]] define the border with Austria (including the Austrian federal-states of Vorarlberg, Tyrol and Salzburg), and within the range is the highest peak in Germany: the [[Zugspitze]]. The [[Bavarian Forest]] and the [[Bohemian Forest]] form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czechia and Bohemia.

The major cities in Bavaria are [[Munich]] (''München''), [[Nuremberg]] (''Nürnberg''), [[Augsburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Würzburg]], [[Ingolstadt]], [[Fürth]], and [[Erlangen]].

The [[Geographical midpoint of Europe#Geographic center of the European Union|geographic center of the European Union]] is located in the northwestern corner of Bavaria.

=== Climate change and its effects ===
The summer months have been getting hotter in recent years.<ref name="suedd-4539824">https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/bayern-klimawandel-umwelt-vorhersagen-1.4539824</ref> For example, June 2019 was the warmest June in Bavaria since weather observations have been recorded<ref name="suedd-4539824" /> and the winter 2019/2020 was 3 degrees Celsius warmer than the average temperature for many years all over Bavaria. On 20 December 2019 a record temperature of {{convert|20.2|°C}} was recorded in [[Piding]].<ref>{{citation|surname1=Bayerischer Rundfunk|title=Klimawandel in Bayern: Längst bei uns angekommen|date=2020-03-03|language=German|url=https://www.br.de/klimawandel/klimawandel-bayern-folgen-erwaermung-100.html|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In general winter months are seeing more precipitation which is taking the form of rain more often than that of snow compared to the past.<ref name="suedd-4539824" /> [[Extreme weather]] like the [[2013 European floods]] or the [[2019 European heavy snowfalls]] is occurring more and more often. One effect of the continuing warming is the melting of almost all Bavarian [[Alpine glaciers]]: Of the five glaciers of Bavaria only the [[Höllentalferner]] is predicted to exist over a longer time perspective. The [[Schneeferner#Südlicher Schneeferner|Südliche Schneeferner]] has almost vanished since the 1980s.<ref name="suedd-4539824" />

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:WV-Bavaria regions.svg|thumb|Administrative districts (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'') of Bavaria]]
Bavaria is divided into seven administrative districts called ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' (singular ''{{lang|de|[[Regierungsbezirk]]}}'').

===Administrative districts===
*'''[[Altbayern]]''':
# [[Upper Palatinate]] (''{{lang-de|Oberpfalz}}'')
# [[Upper Bavaria]] (''{{lang|de|Oberbayern}}'')
# [[Lower Bavaria]] (''{{lang|de|Niederbayern}}'')
*'''[[Franconia]]''':
# [[Upper Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Oberfranken}}'')
# [[Middle Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Mittelfranken}}'')
# [[Lower Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Unterfranken}}'')
*'''[[Swabia]]''':
# [[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia]] (''{{lang|de|Schwaben}}'')

===Districts===
''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'' (districts) are the third communal layer in Bavaria; the others are the ''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'' and the ''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Städte}}''. The ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'' in Bavaria are territorially identical with the ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'', but they are self-governing regional corporation, having their own parliaments. In the other larger states of Germany, there are ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' which are only administrative divisions and not self-governing entities as the ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'' in Bavaria.

===Counties===
The second communal layer is made up of 71 rural districts (called ''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Landkreis}}'') that are comparable to counties, as well as the 25 independent cities (''{{lang|de|Kreisfreie Städte}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Kreisfreie Stadt}}''), both of which share the same administrative responsibilities .

===Municipalities===
The 71 administrative districts are on the lowest level divided into 2,031 regular municipalities (called ''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Gemeinde}}''). Together with the 25 independent cities (''{{lang|de|kreisfreie Städte}}'', which are in effect municipalities independent of ''{{lang|de|Landkreis}}'' administrations), there are a total of 2,056 municipalities in Bavaria.

In 44 of the 71 administrative districts, there are a total of 215 [[unincorporated area]]s (as of 1 January 2005, called ''{{lang|de|gemeindefreie Gebiete}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|gemeindefreies Gebiet}}''), not belonging to any municipality, all uninhabited, mostly forested areas, but also four lakes ({{lang|de|[[Chiemsee]]}}-without islands, {{lang|de|[[Starnberger See]]}}-without island {{lang|de|Roseninsel}}, {{lang|de|[[Ammersee]]}}, which are the three largest lakes of Bavaria, and {{lang|de|[[Waginger See]]}}).

==Politics==

[[File:Gobierno Estatal de Baviera, Múnich, Alemania, 2017-07-07, DD 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|Bavarian State Chancellery]]]]

{{Main|Politics of Bavaria}}
Bavaria has a multiparty system dominated by the conservative [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), which has won every election since 1945, The Greens, which became the second biggest political party in the 2018 parliament elections and the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD), which dominates in [[Munich]]. Thus far [[Wilhelm Hoegner]] has been the only SPD candidate to ever become Minister-President; notable successors in office include multi-term Federal Minister [[Franz Josef Strauss]], a key figure among [[West German]] conservatives during the [[Cold War]] years, and [[Edmund Stoiber]], who both failed with their bids for [[Federal Chancellor of Germany|Chancellorship]]. The German [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] and the center-right [[Free Voters of Bavaria|Free Voters]] have been represented in the state parliament since 1986 and 2008 respectively.

In the [[Bavaria state election, 2003|2003 elections]] the CSU won a [[Supermajority|⅔ supermajority]] – something no party had ever achieved in postwar Germany. However, in the subsequent [[Bavaria state election, 2008|2008 elections]] the CSU lost the absolute majority for the first time in 46 years.<ref>[http://www.n-tv.de/Koalitionspartner_noetig_Fiasko_fuer_die_CSU/280920085818/1030029.html n-tv:Fiasko für die CSU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929151317/http://www.n-tv.de/Koalitionspartner_noetig_Fiasko_fuer_die_CSU/280920085818/1030029.html |date=29 September 2008 }}</ref> The losses were partly attributed by some to the CSU's stance for an anti-smoking bill.{{elucidate|date=July 2018}} (A first anti-smoking law had been proposed by the CSU and passed but was watered down after the election, after which a referendum enforced a strict antismoking bill with a large majority).

===Current Landtag <!--update "current"-->===
[[File:Bavarian Landtag 2018.svg|thumb|Current composition of the Landtag:{{legend|#EB001F|SPD: 22 seats}}{{legend|#64A12D|The Greens: 38 seats}}{{legend|#FFED00|FDP: 11 seats}}{{legend|#007E82|Free Voters: 27 seats}}{{legend|{{Christian Social Union of Bavaria/meta/color}}|CSU: 85 seats}}{{legend|#009EE0|AfD: 22 seats}}]]

The [[Bavarian state election, 2018|last state elections]] were held on 14 October 2018 in which the CSU lost its absolute majority in the state parliament in part due to the party's stances as part of the federal government, winning 37.2% of the vote; the party's second worst election outcome in its history. The Greens who had surged in the polls leading up to the election have replaced the social-democratic SPD as the second biggest force in the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]] with 17.5% of the vote. The SPD lost over half of its previous share compared to 2013 with a mere 9.7% in 2018. The liberals of the FDP were again able to reach the five-percent-threshold in order to receive mandates in parliament after they were not part of the ''Landtag'' after the 2013 elections. Also entering the new parliament will be the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 10.2% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2018-10-14-LT-DE-BY/index.shtml|title=tagesschau.de|last=tagesschau.de|website=wahl.tagesschau.de|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref> The center-right Free Voters party gained 11.6% of the vote and formed a government coalition with the CSU which led to the subsequent reelection of Markus Söder as [[Minister-President of Bavaria]].

===Government===
*[[Cabinet Söder II|Bavaria Cabinet since 12 November 2018]]
The [[Constitution of Bavaria]] of the Free State of Bavaria was enacted on 8 December 1946. The new Bavarian Constitution became the basis for the Bavarian State after the Second World War.

Bavaria has a [[unicameral]] ''{{lang|de|[[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]]}}'' (English: State Parliament), elected by universal suffrage. Until December 1999, there was also a ''{{lang|de|Senat}}'', or [[Bavarian Senate|Senate]], whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished.

The Bavarian State Government consists of the [[Minister-President of Bavaria]], eleven Ministers and six Secretaries of State. The Minister-President is elected for a period of five years by the State Parliament and is head of state. With the approval of the State Parliament he appoints the members of the State Government. The State Government is composed of the:

* Ministry of the Interior, Building and Transport (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium des Innern, für Bau und Verkehr}}'')
* Ministry of Education and Culture, Science and Art (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst}}'')
* Ministry of Finance, for Rural Development and Homeland (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Finanzen, für Landesentwicklung und Heimat}}'')
* Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft und Medien, Energie und Technologie}}'')
* Ministry of Environment and Consumer Protection (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz}}'')
* Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Family and Integration (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Arbeit und Soziales, Familie und Integration}}'')
* Ministry of Justice (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Justiz}}'')
* Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten}}'')
* Ministry of Public Health and Care Services (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Gesundheit und Pflege}}'')

Political processes also take place in the seven regions (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'') in Bavaria, in the 71 administrative districts (''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'') and the 25 towns and cities forming their own districts (''{{lang|de|kreisfreie Städte}}''), and in the 2,031 local authorities (''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'').

In 1995 Bavaria introduced [[direct democracy]] on the local level in a [[referendum]]. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called ''Mehr Demokratie'' (English: More Democracy). This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court tightened the regulations considerably (including by introducing a turn-out quorum). Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens' participation in communal and municipal affairs—835 referenda took place from 1995 through 2005.

===Designation as a "free state"===
Unlike most German states (''Länder''), which simply designate themselves as "State of" (''Land [...]''), Bavaria uses the style of "Free State of Bavaria" (''Freistaat Bayern''). The difference from other states is purely terminological, as German constitutional law does not draw a distinction between "States" and "Free States". The situation is thus analogous to the United States, where [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|some states]] use the style "Commonwealth" rather than "State". The choice of "Free State", a creation of the 19th century and intended to be a German alternative to (or translation of) the Latin-derived ''republic'', has historical reasons, Bavaria having been styled that way even before the current 1946 Constitution was enacted (in 1918 after the ''de facto'' abdication of Ludwig III). Two other states, [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]], also use the style "Free State"; unlike Bavaria, however, these were not part of the original states when the [[Grundgesetz]] was enacted but joined the federation later on, in 1990, as a result of [[German reunification]]. Saxony had used the designation as "Free State" from 1918 to 1952.

=== Arbitrary arrest and human rights ===
In July 2017, Bavaria's parliament enacted a new revision of the "Gefährdergesetz", allowing the authorities to imprison a person for a three months term, renewable indefinitely, when s/he hasn't committed a crime but it is assumed that s/he might commit a crime "in the near future".<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/bayern-gefaehrder-gesetz-verschaerft-1.3595274 Gefährder-Gesetz verschärft], [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], 19 July 2017</ref> Critics like the prominent journalist [[Heribert Prantl]] have called the law "shameful" and compared it to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]],<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/gefaehrder-gesetz-bayern-fuehrt-die-unendlichkeitshaft-ein-1.3594307 Bayern führt Unendlichkeitshaft ein], Heribert Prantl, 20 July 2017</ref> assessed it to be in violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]],<ref>[https://www.lawblog.de/index.php/archives/2017/07/20/bayern-endloshaft-fuer-nicht-straftaeter/ Reisewarnung für Bayern], Udo Vetter, 20 July 2017</ref> and also compared it to the legal situation in Russia, where a similar law allows for imprisonment for a maximum term of two years (i.e., not indefinitely)<ref>[https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a78e46ba Erinnert ihr euch noch daran, als Bayern als Rechtsstaat galt?], [[Felix von Leitner]], 20 July 2017</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:Pop density of Germany.png|thumb|Bavaria is one of Germany's least densely populated states.]]
Bavaria has a population of approximately 12.9&nbsp;million inhabitants (2016). 8 of the [[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants|80 largest cities in Germany]] are located within Bavaria with Munich being the largest (1,450,381 inhabitants, approximately 5.7&nbsp;million when including the broader metropolitan area), followed by [[Nuremberg]] (509,975 inhabitants, approximately 3.6&nbsp;million when including the broader metropolitan area) and [[Augsburg]] (286,374 inhabitants). All other cities in Bavaria had less than 150,000 inhabitants each in 2015. Population density in Bavaria was {{convert|182|PD/sqkm}}, below the national average of {{convert|227|PD/sqkm}}. Foreign nationals resident in Bavaria (both [[immigrants]] and [[refugees]]/[[asylum seekers]]) were principally from other EU countries and Turkey.

==Culture==
Some features of the Bavarian culture and mentality are remarkably distinct from the rest of Germany. Noteworthy differences (especially in rural areas, less significant in the major cities) can be found with respect to religion, traditions, and language.

[[File:Baroque Church of Saint-Coloman - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A Catholic church near [[Füssen]] with the Alps in the background]]
Bavarian culture (''[[Altbayern]]'') has a long and predominant tradition of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith. Pope emeritus [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI (Joseph Alois Ratzinger)]] was born in [[Marktl am Inn]] in [[Upper Bavaria]] and was [[Archbishop of Munich and Freising|Cardinal-Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. Otherwise, the culturally [[Franconia]]n and [[Swabia]]n regions of the modern State of Bavaria are historically more diverse in religiosity, with both Catholic and [[Protestant]] traditions. In 1925, 70.0% of the Bavarian population was [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], 28.8% was [[Protestant]], 0.7% was [[Jewish]], and 0.5% was placed in other religious categories.<ref>Grundriss der Statistik. II. Gesellschaftsstatistik by Wilhelm Winkler, p. 36</ref>

{{As of|2018}} 48.8% of Bavarians adhered to Catholicism (a decline from 70.4% in 1970).<ref name=BR>{{cite web |url=http://www.br.de/themen/religion/kirchenaustritte-katholisch-zahlen-100.html |title=Massive Kirchenaustritte: Das Ende der Kirche wie wir sie kennen – Religion – Themen – BR.de |author=Bayerischer Rundfunk |work=br.de |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722010151/http://www.br.de/themen/religion/kirchenaustritte-katholisch-zahlen-100.html |archivedate=22 July 2015 }}</ref><ref name="EKD2018">{{cite web| title = Kirchenmitgliederzahlen Stand 31.12.2018| publisher = ekd.de| accessdate = 2020-02-19| url = https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2018.pdf}}</ref> 17.9% of the population adheres to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria]], which has also declined since 1970.<ref name=BR /><ref name="EKD2018"/> 3% was [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Muslim]]s make up 4.0% of the population of Bavaria. 28.1% of Bavarians are irreligious or adhere to other religions.

===Traditions===
Bavarians commonly emphasize pride in their traditions. Traditional costumes collectively known as [[Tracht]] are worn on special occasions and include in [[Altbayern]] [[Lederhosen]] for males and [[Dirndl]] for females. Centuries-old [[folk music]] is performed. The [[Maypole tradition in Bavaria|Maibaum]], or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's business directory, as figures on the pole represented the trades of the village), and the bagpipes of the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the [[Paganism in the Eastern Alps|ancient Celtic and Germanic]] remnants of cultural heritage of the region. There are many traditional Bavarian sports disciplines, e.g. the [[Aperschnalzen]], competitive [[whipcracking]].

Whether actually in Bavaria, overseas or with citizens from other nations Bavarians continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their heritage alive. In New York City the German American Cultural Society is a larger umbrella group for others which represent a specific part of Germany, including the Bavarian organizations. They present a German parade called [[Steuben Parade]] each year. Various affiliated events take place amongst its groups, one of which is the Bavarian Dancers.

===Food and drink===
{{Main|Bavarian cuisine}}
Bavarians tend to place a great value on [[Bavarian cuisine|food and drink]]. In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example {{lang|de|[[Weißwurst]]}} ("white sausage") or in some instances a variety of entrails. At folk festivals and in many [[beer garden]]s, beer is traditionally served by the litre (in a {{lang|de|[[Maß]]}}). Bavarians are particularly proud{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} of the traditional {{lang|de|[[Reinheitsgebot]]}}, or beer purity law, initially established by the [[Duke of Bavaria]] for the City of Munich (i.e. the court) in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water, [[barley]], and [[hops]]. In 1906 the {{lang|de|Reinheitsgebot}} made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the EU partly struck it down in 1987 as incompatible with the European common market.<ref>{{cite web |title=30.04.2005 – EU-Recht |url=http://dokumentation.htu.tugraz.at/eu-recht/?dok=eugh0003&rub=eugh-e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430024608/http://dokumentation.htu.tugraz.at/eu-recht/?dok=eugh0003&rub=eugh-e |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 April 2005 |date=30 April 2005}}</ref> German breweries, however, cling to the principle, and Bavarian breweries still comply with it in order to distinguish their beer brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html|title=To Bier or not to Bier? vom 22.10.2015: Das Reinheitsgebot und seine Tücken – BR Mediathek VIDEO|author=Bayerischer Rundfunk|work=br.de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027012032/http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html|archivedate=27 October 2015}}</ref> Bavarians are also known as some of the world's most beer-loving people with an average annual consumption of 170 liters per person, although figures have been declining in recent years.

Bavaria is also home to the [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia wine region]], which is situated along the river [[Main (river)|Main]] in Franconia. The region has produced wine (''Frankenwein'') for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the [[Bocksbeutel]] wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.

[[File:WIKITONGUES- Carolin speaking Bavarian.webm|thumb|left|A native [[Bavarian language]] speaker, recorded in Germany.]]
[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Upper German and the southern counterpart to Central German both form the High German languages, while the [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are in blue]]

Three German dialects are most commonly spoken in Bavaria: [[Austro-Bavarian]] in Old Bavaria (Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate), [[Swabian German]] (an [[Alemannic German]] dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (south west) and [[East Franconian German]] in Franconia (North). In the small town [[Ludwigsstadt]] in the north, district Kronach in Upper Franconia, [[Thuringian dialect]] is spoken. During the 20th century an increasing part of the population began to speak [[Standard German]] (Hochdeutsch), mainly in the cities.

===Ethnography===
Bavarians consider themselves to be [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and informal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bavaria |url=http://travel-to-germany.info/states/bavaria/ |website=Travel to Germany |publisher=Travel to Germany |accessdate=29 September 2020}}</ref> Their sociability can be experienced at the annual [[Oktoberfest]], the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous [[beer garden]]s. In traditional Bavarian beer gardens, patrons may bring their own food but buy beer only from the brewery that runs the beer garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hirschgarten.de/biergarten-muenchen-koeniglicher-hirschgarten-der-groesste-der-biergaerten-in-muenchen.html|title=Ein paar Worte zu unserem Biergarten in München ...

In the United States, particularly among [[German Americans]], Bavarian culture is viewed somewhat nostalgically, and several "Bavarian villages" have been founded, most notably [[Frankenmuth, Michigan]]; [[Helen, Georgia]]; and [[Leavenworth, Washington]]. Since 1962, the latter has been styled with a Bavarian theme and is home to an Oktoberfest celebration it claims is among the most attended in the world outside of Munich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leavenworth.org/|title=Leavenworth Washington Hotels, Lodging, Festivals & Events|work=Visit Leavenworth Washington, USA|access-date=29 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905180813/http://leavenworth.org/|archive-date=5 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>
