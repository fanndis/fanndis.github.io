The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]],<ref>https://prospect.org/article/where-republican-party-began</ref> which allowed for the potential expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] into the western territories.

There have been 19 Republican presidents (including incumbent president [[Donald Trump]], who was [[2016 United States presidential election|elected in 2016]]), the most from any one political party. As of 2020, the GOP controls the presidency, a majority in the [[U.S. Senate]], a majority of state governorships, a majority (29) of state legislatures, and 21 state [[government trifecta]]s (governorship and both legislative chambers). Six of the nine sitting [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices were nominated by Republican presidents.

The Republican Party emerged from the great political realignment of the mid-1850s. [[William Gienapp]] argues that the great realignment of the 1850s began before the Whig party collapse, and was caused not by politicians but by voters at the local level. The central forces were ethno-cultural, involving tensions between pietistic Protestants versus liturgical Catholics, Lutherans and Episcopalians regarding Catholicism, prohibition, and nativism. Anti-slavery did play a role but it was less important at first. The Know-Nothing party embodied the social forces at work, but its weak leadership was unable to solidify its organization, and the Republicans picked it apart. Nativism was so powerful that the Republicans could not avoid it, but they did minimize it and turn voter wrath against the threat that slave owners would buy up the good farm lands wherever slavery was allowed. The realignment was a powerful because it forced voters to switch parties, as typified by the rise and fall of the Know-Nothings, the rise of the Republican Party, and the splits in the Democratic Party.<ref>William Gienapp, ''The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852–1856'' (Oxford UP, 1987)</ref><ref>William Gienapp,  "Nativism and the Creation of a Republican Majority in the North before the Civil War." ''Journal of American History'' 72.3 (1985): 529–59 [http://faculty.winthrop.edu/huffmons/RelAndPolReadings/Gienapp_KnowNothingsAndCreationOfRepublicanParty.pdf online]</ref>

The Republican Party was founded in the Northern states in 1854 by forces opposed to the expansion of slavery, ex-[[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], and ex-[[Free Soil]]ers. The Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the briefly popular [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing Party]]. The party grew out of opposition to the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]] and opened [[Kansas Territory]] and [[Nebraska Territory]] to slavery and future admission as slave states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Kansas_Nebraska_Act.htm|title=U.S. Senate: The Kansas-Nebraska Act|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=March 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329002617/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Kansas_Nebraska_Act.htm|archive-date=March 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/wealthy-activist-who-helped-turn-bleeding-kansas-free-180964494/|title=The Wealthy Activist Who Helped Turn "Bleeding Kansas" Free|website=Smithsonian|access-date=March 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327195015/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/wealthy-activist-who-helped-turn-bleeding-kansas-free-180964494/|archive-date=March 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Republicans called for economic and social [[modernization]].

The party's success created factionalism within the party in the 1870s. Those who believed that Reconstruction had been accomplished, and was continued mostly to promote the large-scale corruption tolerated by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], ran [[Horace Greeley]] for the presidency in 1872 on the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] line. The [[Stalwarts (politics)|Stalwart]] faction defended Grant and the [[spoils system]], whereas the [[Half-Breed (politics)|Half-Breeds]] pushed for reform of the [[civil service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/20/12233454/christie-trump-purge-federal-employees|title=Donald Trump and Chris Christie are reportedly planning to purge the civil service|first=Dylan|last=Matthews|date=July 20, 2016|website=Vox|access-date=March 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322175810/https://www.vox.com/2016/7/20/12233454/christie-trump-purge-federal-employees|archive-date=March 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] was passed in 1883;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politi.co/2mFyvhy|title=Pendleton Act inaugurates U.S. civil service system, Jan. 16, 1883|last=Andrew Glass|website=Politico}}</ref> the bill was signed into law by Republican President [[Chester A.

The Republican Party supported hard money (i.e. the [[gold standard]]), [[Tariffs in American history|high tariffs to promote economic growth, high wages and high profits]], generous pensions for Union veterans, and (after 1893) the annexation of [[Hawaii]]. The Republicans had strong support from [[Pietism|pietistic]] Protestants, but they resisted demands for [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. As the Northern postwar economy boomed with heavy and light industry, railroads, mines, fast-growing cities, and prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The GOP was usually dominant over the Democrats during the Third Party System (1850s–1890s). However, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself. The Democrats elected [[Grover Cleveland]] in 1884 and 1892. The election of [[William McKinley]] in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] was marked by a resurgence of Republican dominance that lasted (except for 1912 and 1916) until 1932. McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the [[Panic of 1893]] and that Republicans would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit.<ref>Walter Dean Burnham, "Periodization schemes and 'party systems': the 'system of 1896' as a case in point."

The Republican Civil War era program included free homestead farms, a federally subsidized transcontinental railroad, a national banking system, a large national debt, land grants for higher education, a new national banking system, a wartime income tax and permanent high tariffs to promote industrial growth and high wages.

The 1896 realignment cemented the Republicans as the party of big businesses while [[Theodore Roosevelt]] added more small business support by his embrace of [[trust busting]]. He handpicked his successor [[William Howard Taft]] in 1908, but they became enemies as the party split down the middle. Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 nomination and Roosevelt ran on the ticket of his new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party]]. He called for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|social reforms]], many of which were later championed by [[New Deal Coalition|New Deal Democrats]] in the 1930s. He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP they found they did not agree with the new [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative economic thinking]], leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894529_1894528_1894519,00.html|title=The Ol' Switcheroo.

[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower, official photo portrait, May 29, 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dwight Eisenhower]], 34th President of the United States (1953–1961)]]

The [[New Deal coalition]] of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excluding the two-term presidency of Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933. However, long-term unemployment remained a drag until 1940. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities.<ref>Lewis Gould, ''Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans '' (2003) pp. 271–308.</ref>

The Republican Party factionalized into a majority "Old Right" (based in the Midwest) and a liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New Deal. The Old Right sharply attacked the "Second New Deal" and said it represented [[class warfare]] and [[Socialism in the United States|socialism]]. Roosevelt was re-elected in a landslide in 1936; however, as his second term began, the economy declined, strikes soared, and he failed to take control of the Supreme Court or to purge the Southern conservatives from the Democratic Party. Republicans made a major comeback in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1938|1938 elections]] and had new rising stars such as [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio on the right and [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York on the left.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469618968/the-roots-of-modern-conservatism|title=The Roots of Modern Conservatism {{!}} Michael Bowen|website=University of North Carolina Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522220118/https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469618968/the-roots-of-modern-conservatism/|archive-date=May 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Southern conservatives joined with most Republicans to form the [[conservative coalition]], which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964. Both parties split on foreign policy issues, with the anti-war isolationists dominant in the Republican Party and the interventionists who wanted to stop [[Adolf Hitler]] dominant in the Democratic Party. Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and 1944, respectively. Conservatives abolished most of the New Deal during the war, but they did not attempt to reverse Social Security or the agencies that regulated business.<ref>Gould, pp. 271–308.</ref>

Historian [[George H. Nash]] argues: <blockquote>Unlike the "moderate", internationalist, largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted (or at least acquiesced in) some of the "Roosevelt Revolution" and the essential premises of President Truman's foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary. Anti-collectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and "me-too" Republicans from within.<ref>Quote on p. 261 {{cite journal |jstor = 2702450|title = The Republican Right from Taft to Reagan|last1 = Nash|first1 = George H.|last2 = Reinhard|first2 = David W.|journal = Reviews in American History|volume = 12|issue = 2|pages = 261–65|year = 1984|doi = 10.2307/2702450}} Nash references David W. Reinhard, ''The Republican Right since 1945'', (University Press of Kentucky, 1983).</ref></blockquote>

After 1945, the internationalist wing of the GOP cooperated with Harry S. Truman's [[Cold War]] foreign policy, funded the [[Marshall Plan]] and supported NATO, despite the continued isolationism of the Old Right.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/The%20Betrayal%20of%20the%20American%20Right_2.pdf | title=The Betrayal of the American Right | publisher=Mises Institute | author=Murray Rothbard | year=2007 | pages=85}}</ref>
[[File:Richard Nixon presidential portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Richard Nixon]], 37th President of the United States (1969–1974)]]

The second half of the 20th century saw the election or succession of Republican presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. Eisenhower had defeated conservative leader Senator Robert A. Taft for the 1952 nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration. Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position. Since 1976, liberalism has virtually faded out of the Republican Party, apart from a few Northeastern holdouts.<ref name="Nicol C. Rae 1989">Nicol C.

A defining moment in Reagan's term of office was his speech in then-[[West Berlin]] where he demanded Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[Tear down this wall!|[t]ear down this wall]]", referring to the [[Berlin Wall]] constructed to separate West and [[East Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2019/11/06/reagans-mr-gorbachev-tear-down-this-wall-was-almost-left-unsaid/|title=Reagan's 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall' was almost left unsaid, recalls former speechwriter, now Hoover fellow|first=Melissa|last=de Witte|website=Stanford.edu|date=November 6, 2019|access-date=June 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/reagan-challenges-gorbachev-to-tear-down-berlin-wall-june-12-1987-239376|title=Reagan challenges Gorbachev to 'tear down' Berlin Wall, June 12, 1987|first=Andrew|last=Glass|website=Politico|date=June 11, 2017|access-date=June 17, 2020}}</ref>

In the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994, the party—led by House Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]], who campaigned on the "[[Contract with America]]"—won majorities in both Houses of Congress. However, as House Speaker, Gingrich was unable to deliver on many of its promises, including a balanced-budget amendment and term limits for members of Congress. During the [[impeachment and acquittal of President Bill Clinton]], Republicans suffered surprise losses in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1998|1998 midterm elections]].

For most of the post-World War II era, Republicans had little presence at the state legislative level. This trend began to reverse in the late 1990s, with Republicans increasing their state legislative presence and taking control of state legislatures in the South. From 2004 to 2014, the [[Republican State Leadership Committee]] (RSLC) raised over $140&nbsp;million targeted to state legislature races, while the [[Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee]] (DLSC) raised less than half that during that time period. Following the 2014 midterm elections, Republicans controlled 68 of 98 partisan state legislative houses (the most in the party's history) and controlled both the executive and legislative branches of government in 24 states (Democrats had control of only seven).<ref name=legislatures>{{cite news|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/11/11/the_other_gop_wave_state_legislatures__124626.html|title=The Other GOP Wave: State Legislatures|publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]]|accessdate=April 29, 2015|date=November 11, 2014|first=David|last=Byler|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406030710/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/11/11/the_other_gop_wave_state_legislatures__124626.html|archive-date=April 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to NBC News, "Trump’s power famously came from his 'silent majority'—working-class white voters who felt mocked and ignored by an establishment loosely defined by special interests in Washington, news outlets in New York and tastemakers in Hollywood. He built trust within that base by abandoning Republican establishment orthodoxy on issues like trade and government spending in favor of a broader nationalist message".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/donald-trump-republican-party/presidency|title=How Trump won and proved everyone wrong with his populist message|website=NBC News Specials}}</ref>

The term "Grand Old Party" is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party and the abbreviation "GOP" is a commonly used designation. The term originated in 1875 in the ''Congressional Record'', referring to the party associated with the successful military defense of the Union as "this gallant old party." The following year in an article in the ''[[Cincinnati Commercial Tribune|Cincinnati Commercial]]'', the term was modified to "grand old party." The first use of the abbreviation is dated 1884.<ref>"Grand Old Party", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.</ref>

The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant.

Republicans believe that [[free market]]s and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity. Republicans frequently advocate in favor of [[fiscal conservatism]] during Democratic administrations; however, they have shown themselves willing to increase federal debt when they are in charge of the government (the implementation of the Bush tax cuts, Medicare Part D and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are examples of this willingness).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/tax-cuts-deficit-debt.html|title=Debt Concerns, Once a Core Republican Tenet, Take a Back Seat to Tax Cuts|last=Appelbaum|first=Binyamin|date=December 1, 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 2, 2017|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202005246/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/tax-cuts-deficit-debt.html|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/republicans-fought-budget-debt-now-embrace-51528700|title=Why Republicans who once fought budget debt now embrace it|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=December 2, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202203156/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/republicans-fought-budget-debt-now-embrace-51528700|archive-date=December 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/is-there-a-fiscal-crisis-in-the-united-states/|title=Is There a Fiscal Crisis in the United States?|last=Johnson|first=Simon|work=Economix Blog|accessdate=December 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621221245/https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/is-there-a-fiscal-crisis-in-the-united-states/|archive-date=June 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite pledges to roll back government spending, Republican administrations have, since the late 1960s, sustained or increased previous levels of government spending.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Milkis|first1=Sidney M.|last2=King|first2=Desmond|last3=Jacobs|first3=Nicholas F.|date=2019|title=Building a Conservative State: Partisan Polarization and the Redeployment of Administrative Power|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=453–69|doi=10.1017/S1537592718003511|issn=1537-5927|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-11-12|title=The Rise in Per Capita Federal Spending|url=https://www.mercatus.org/publications/government-spending/rise-capita-federal-spending|access-date=2020-08-30|website=Mercatus Center|language=en}}</ref>

Republicans believe individuals should take responsibility for their own circumstances. They also believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor through [[Charity (practice)|charity]] than the government is through welfare programs and that social assistance programs often cause government dependency.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Republicans believe corporations should be able to establish their own employment practices, including benefits and wages, with the free market deciding the price of work. Since the 1920s, Republicans have generally been opposed by [[Trade union|labor union]] organizations and members. At the national level, Republicans supported the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947, which gives workers the right not to participate in unions. Modern Republicans at the state level generally support various [[right-to-work laws]], which prohibit [[union security agreement]]s requiring all workers in a unionized workplace to pay dues or a fair-share fee, regardless of if they are members of the union or not.<ref>{{cite web|title=Employer/Union Rights and Obligations|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/employerunion-rights-and-obligations|website=National Labor Relations Board|accessdate=July 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711175358/https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/employerunion-rights-and-obligations|archive-date=July 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Most Republicans oppose increases in the [[minimum wage]], believing that such increases hurt businesses by forcing them to cut and outsource jobs while passing on costs to consumers.<ref>{{cite web |title=House Passes Bill to Raise Minimum Wage to $15, a Victory for Liberals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/minimum-wage.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>

The party opposes a [[single-payer health care]] system, describing it as [[socialized medicine]]. The Republican Party has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], Medicare and Medicaid programs.<ref>Krugman, Paul.

In the decades following the Civil War, the Republican Party grew more supportive of immigration, as it represented manufacturers in the Northeast (who wanted additional labor) whereas the Democratic Party came to be seen as the party of labor (which wanted fewer laborers to compete with). Starting in the 1970s, the parties switched places again, as the Democrats grew more supportive of immigration than Republicans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11040.html|title=Trading Barriers|last=Peters|first=Margaret|date=2017|website=Princeton University Press|pages=154–55|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303043905/https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11040.html|archive-date=March 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Republicans are divided on how to confront [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]] between a platform that allows for migrant workers and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (supported by establishment types), versus a position focused on securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants (supported by populists). In 2006, the White House supported and Republican-led Senate passed [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006|comprehensive immigration reform]] that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but the House (also led by Republicans) did not advance the bill.<ref name="Blanton">{{cite news|last=Blanton|first=Dana|title=National Exit Poll: Midterms Come Down to Iraq, Bush|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=November 8, 2006|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,228104,00.html|accessdate=January 6, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306050851/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,228104,00.html|archive-date=March 6, 2007}}</ref> After the defeat in the 2012 presidential election, particularly among Latinos, several Republicans advocated a friendlier approach to immigrants.

Some{{who|date=February 2017}} in the Republican Party support [[unilateralism]] on issues of national security, believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and [[international relations]] is heavily influenced by the theories of [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] and [[Political realism|realism]], characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of an international structure as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's [[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]] stance on the [[Soviet Union]] and George W. Bush's [[Axis of evil]] stance.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], many{{who|date=June 2016}} in the party have supported [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] policies with regard to the War on Terror, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 war in Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

==== Voting rights ====
Virtually all restrictions on voting have in recent years been implemented by Republicans. Republicans, mainly at the state level, argue that the restrictions (such as purging voter rolls, limiting voting locations, and prosecuting double voting) are vital to prevent [[voter fraud]], claiming that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections. However, research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon, as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party's favor. Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court, with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of establishing them with partisan purpose.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/politics/voting-suppression-elections.html|title='They Don't Really Want Us to Vote': How Republicans Made it Harder|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104152125/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/politics/voting-suppression-elections.html|archive-date=November 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://theweek.com/articles/803156/big-conservative-lie-voter-fraud|title=The big conservative lie on 'voter fraud'|date=23 October 2018|magazine=The Week|accessdate=27 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228130912/https://theweek.com/articles/803156/big-conservative-lie-voter-fraud|archive-date=December 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

They argue that Gingrich instilled a "combative" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned. Gingrich frequently questioned the [[patriotism]] of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States.

==== Religious beliefs ====
Religion has always played a major role for both parties, but in the course of a century, the parties' religious compositions have changed. Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], with Catholics, Jews, and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 1980s that undercut the New Deal coalition.<ref>To some extent the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' caused American Christians to blur their historical division along the line between Catholics and Protestants and instead to realign as conservatives or liberals, irrespective of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Era]] distinction.</ref> Voters who attend church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] and those who attend occasionally gave him only 47% while those who never attend gave him 36%. Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of Catholics (even though [[John Kerry]] was Catholic). Since 1980, a large majority of [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] have voted Republican; 70–80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004 and 70% for Republican House candidates in [[United States general elections, 2006|2006]]. Jews continue to vote 70–80% Democratic. Democrats have close links with the African American churches, especially the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptists]], while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54–46 in the 2010 midterms.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1791/2010-midterm-elections-exit-poll-religion-vote|title=Religion in the 2010 Elections|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=November 3, 2010|accessdate=January 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206111210/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1791/2010-midterm-elections-exit-poll-religion-vote|archive-date=February 6, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The mainline traditional Protestants (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Disciples) have dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968).
