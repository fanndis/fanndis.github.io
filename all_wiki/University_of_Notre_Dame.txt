Notre Dame's profile grew in the early 20th century, aided by the success of its football team under coach [[Knute Rockne]]. Major improvements to the university occurred during the administration of [[Theodore Hesburgh]] between 1952 and 1987, as his administration greatly increased the university's resources, academic programs, and reputation. The university first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972. Since then, the university has seen steady growth, and under the leadership of the next two presidents, [[Edward Malloy]] and [[John I. Jenkins]], many infrastructure and research expansions have been completed. Notre Dame's growth has continued in the 21st century; its $13.8&nbsp;billion [[Financial endowment|endowment]] is one of the largest of any U.S. university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://annualreport2019.nd.edu/investment-review-from-the-chief-investment-officer/|title=Investment Review from the Chief Investment Officer|date=June 30, 2019|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref>

===Foundations===
[[File:Rev Edward Sorin.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|[[Edward Sorin]], founder of the university, photographed in 1890]]
In 1842, the Bishop of Vincennes, [[Célestin Guynemer de la Hailandière]], offered land to [[Edward Sorin]] of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] ({{lang-la|Congregatio a Sancta Cruce}}, abbreviated [[postnominal]]s: "CSC"), on the condition that he build a college in two years.<ref>"Founding Information". University of Notre Dame. Archived from the original on October 31, 2007. Retrieved December 31, 2007.</ref> Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using [[Stephen Badin]]'s old [[Log Chapel, University of Notre Dame|log chapel]]. After enrolling two students, they soon erected more buildings, including the [[Old College, University of Notre Dame|Old College]], the first church, and the first main building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.nd.edu/wack/wack02.htm |title=Foundations|publisher=Notre Dame University |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref>

Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school; in 1844 it received its official college charter from the [[Indiana General Assembly]].<ref name="Hope, C.S.C. 1979">a b Hope, C.S.C., Arthur J.

Under [[William Corby]]'s first administration, enrollment at Notre Dame increased to more than 500 students. In 1869, he opened the [[Notre Dame Law School|law school]], which offered a two-year course of study, and in 1871, he began construction of Sacred Heart Church, today the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame)|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]]. Two years later, [[Auguste Lemonnier]] started a library in the Main Building; by 1879, it had reached 10,000 volumes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.nd.edu/moore/moore08.htm |title=VIII:University Library and Archives |publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>

This Main Building and the library collection were destroyed by a fire in April 1879; the school closed immediately and students were sent home.<ref>"The Story of Notre Dame: Main Building". University of Notre Dame Archives. Retrieved December 31, 2007.</ref> The university founder, Sorin, and the president at the time, [[William Corby]], immediately planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the entire university. Construction was started on May 17, and by the incredible zeal of administrators and workers, the building was completed before the fall semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed in the new Main Building for years afterward.<ref>"The Story of Notre Dame: Lemmonier Library". University of Notre Dame Archives. Retrieved December 31, 2007.</ref>

O'Connell, Edward Sorin (2001)</ref> [[John Augustine Zahm|John Zahm]] became the Holy Cross Provincial for the United States, with overall supervision of the university. He sought to modernize and expand Notre Dame by erecting buildings and adding to the campus art gallery and library, amassing what became a famous Dante collection, and pushing Notre Dame towards becoming a research university dedicated to scholarship. The congregation did not renew his term because of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the order into serious debt.<ref name="Marvin R. O'Connell 2001"/>

The movement towards a research university was subsequently championed by [[John W. Cavanaugh]], who modernized educational standards and attracted many scholars to campus. In 1917, Notre Dame awarded its first degree to a woman, and its first bachelor's, in 1922. However, female undergraduates did not become common until 1972.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In 1919 [[James A. Burns]] became president of Notre Dame; following in the footsteps of Cavanaugh, in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1405842|title = Notre Dame 1919–1922: The Burns Revolution|journal = The Review of Politics|volume = 25|issue = 4|pages = 431–450|last1 = McAvoy|first1 = Thomas T.|year = 1963|doi = 10.1017/S0034670500006392}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Anne Hendershott|title=Status Envy: The Politics of Catholic Higher Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqAfVeHqn0AC&pg=PA205|year=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=204–6|isbn=9781412813648 }}</ref> By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School.<ref>Kathleen A.

The success of Notre Dame reflected the rising status of [[Irish American]]s and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied around the team and listened to the games on the radio, especially when it defeated teams from schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army.<ref name="ncronline.org"/>

Its role as a high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of [[anti-Catholicism]]. The most remarkable episode of violence was a clash between Notre Dame students and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), a [[white supremacist]] and [[anti-Catholic]] movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on May 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. Two days later thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president [[Matthew J. Walsh|Matthew Walsh]] prevented any further clashes. The next day, Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey Walsh and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students contributed to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://irishecho.com/2011/02/78-years-ago-notre-dame-battles-the-kkk-3/ |title=78 years ago: Notre Dame battles the KKK |newspaper=[[Irish Echo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.nd.edu/hope/hope26.htm |title=Notre Dame – 100 Years: Chapter XXVI |publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>

===Expansion in the 1930s and 1940s===
[[File:South Quad, University of Notre Dame.JPG|thumb|left|South Quad, built in the 1920s–1940s, houses many residential halls]]
[[Charles L. O'Donnell]] (1928–1934) and [[John Francis O'Hara]] (1934–1939) fueled both material and academic expansion. During their tenures at Notre Dame, they brought numerous refugees and intellectuals to campus; such as [[W.&nbsp;B. Yeats]], [[Frank H. Spearman]], [[Jeremiah D.&nbsp;M. Ford]], [[Irvin Abell]], and Josephine Brownson for the [[Laetare Medal]], instituted in 1883. O'Hara also concentrated on expanding the graduate school.<ref>{{cite web |title=John Cardinal O'Hara // de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture // University of Notre Dame |url=https://ethicscenter.nd.edu/about/inspire/great-figures/john-cardinal-ohara-1888-1960/ |website=ethicscenter.nd.edu |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>

New construction included [[Notre Dame Stadium]], the [[Notre Dame Law School|law school building]], Rockne Memorial, numerous residential halls, Cushing Hall of Engineering and a new heating plant. This rapid expansion, which cost the university more than $2.8&nbsp;million was made possible in large part through football revenues. O'Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an effective means to "acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate" Notre Dame. He wrote, "Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St. Paul said: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for the glory of God,' he included football."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sperber |first1=Murray |title=Shake down the thunder : the creation of Notre Dame football |date=2002 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253215680 |page=400 }}</ref>

[[John J. Cavanaugh]] served as president from 1946 to 1952. He devoted his efforts to raising academic standards and reshaping the university administration to better serve its enlarged educational mission and an expanded student body.

===Hesburgh era: 1952–1987===
[[File:Touchdown Jesus at Notre Dame.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Hesburgh Library]], decorated by the ''Word of Life'' mural.]]
[[Theodore Hesburgh]] served as president for 35 years (1952–1987) and under his presidency Notre Dame underwent huge growth and transformation from a school mostly known for its football to a top-tier university, academic powerhouse, and preeminent Catholic university.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DePalma |first1=Anthony |title=Rev.

Hesburgh also made Notre Dame coeducational. Women had graduated every year since 1917, but it was mostly religious sisters in graduate programs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Archives of the University of Notre Dame :: Presidents of the University of Notre Dame |url=http://archives.nd.edu/research/facts/women.htm |publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref> In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales. "In American college education," explained [[Charles E. Sheedy]], Notre Dame's dean of Arts and Letters, "certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place.&nbsp;... In this environment of diversity, the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism." Thomas Blantz, Notre Dame's vice president of Student Affairs, added that coeducation "opened up a whole other pool of very bright students."<ref>Susan L. Poulson and Loretta P.

===Graduate and professional schools===
[[File:University of Notre Dame Law School.JPG|thumb|The Law School in winter]]
The university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include [[Master of Laws]] (LLM) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth, before a formal graduate school education was developed with a [[Dissertation|thesis]] not required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924, with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering [[doctorate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Moore, Philip S. |url=http://archives.nd.edu/moore/moore06.htm|title=The Story of Notre Dame: Academic Development of Notre Dame: Chapter 6: The Graduate School|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 15, 2007}}</ref>
* Each of the five colleges offers graduate education in the form of master's and doctoral programs. Most of the departments from the College of Arts and Letters offer PhDs, while a professional [[Master of Divinity]] (M.Div.) program also exists. All of the departments in the College of Science offer PhDs, except for the Department of Pre-Professional Studies. The School of Architecture offers a [[Master of Architecture]], while each of the departments of the College of Engineering offer PhDs. The College of Business offers multiple professional programs including MBA and [[Master of Accountancy|Master of Science in Accountancy]] programs. It also operates facilities in Chicago and [[Cincinnati]] for its executive MBA program.<ref name="Grad Degrees">{{cite web|url=https://www.nd.edu/academics/graduate-programs/|title=Graduate and Professional Programs|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 15, 2007}}</ref> Additionally, the Alliance for Catholic Education program<ref>{{cite web|title=Alliance for Catholic Education|publisher=University of Notre Dame|url=http://ace.nd.edu}}</ref> offers a [[Master of Education]] program, where students study at the university during the summer and teach in Catholic elementary schools, [[middle school]]s, and high schools across the [[Southern United States|South]] for two school years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ace.nd.edu/teach/|title=Teacher Formation Program|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 15, 2007}}</ref> The Joan B.

==Research==

===Science===
Joseph Carrier, director of the Science Museum and the library, was a professor of chemistry and physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the [[Catholic Church]]. One of Carrier's students, [[John Augustine Zahm]], was made professor and co-director of the science department at 23; by 1900 he was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. He was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book ''Evolution and Dogma'' (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.<ref>Ralph Edward Weber, ''Notre Dame's John Zahm: American Catholic Apologist and Educator'' (1961)</ref>

In 1882, [[Albert Francis Zahm|Albert Zahm]], John's brother, built an early [[wind tunnel]] to compare lift to drag of aeronautical models. Around 1899, professor Jerome Green became the first American to send a wireless message.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Apparatus for Wireless Telegraphy (1899) |url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/1899nd.htm |work=earlyradiohistory.us}}</ref> In 1931, [[Julius Nieuwland]] performed early work on basic reactions that was used to create [[neoprene]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://graduateschool.nd.edu/html/research/history.html|title=History of Research at Notre Dame|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107071047/http://graduateschool.nd.edu/html/research/history.html|archivedate=November 7, 2007}}</ref> The study of [[nuclear physics]] at the university began with the building of a [[Particle accelerator|nuclear accelerator]] in 1936,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://isnap.nd.edu/assets/186662/|title=70 Years of Nuclear Physics at Notre Dame|publisher=University of Notre Dame|format=PDF|accessdate=December 13, 2007}}</ref> and continues now partly through a partnership in the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jinaweb.org/html/institutes.html |title=JINACEE Institutions |publisher=Jinaweb.org|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref>

===Humanities===
[[File:University of Notre Dame Hallway.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Hallway within Hurley Hall]]
[[Richard T. Sullivan]] taught English from 1936 to 1974 and published six novels, dozens of short stories, and various other efforts. He was known as a regional writer and a Catholic spokesman.<ref>Una M. Cadegan, "How Realistic Can a Catholic Writer Be? Richard Sullivan and American Catholic Literature," ''Religion & American Culture'' 1996 6(1): 35–61</ref>

Frank O'Malley was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s. Influenced by philosophers [[Jacques Maritain]], John U. Nef, and others, O'Malley developed a concept of Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. Through his course "Modern Catholic Writers", O'Malley introduced generations of undergraduates to [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Sigrid Undset]], [[Paul Claudel]], and [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]].<ref>Arnold Sparr, "The Catholic Laity, the Intellectual Apostolate and the Pre-Vatican II Church: Frank O'Malley of Notre Dame." ''U.S. Catholic Historian'' 1990 9(3): 305–320. 0735–8318</ref>

''The Review of Politics'', modeled after German Catholic journals, was founded in 1939 by [[Waldemar Gurian]]. It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival, offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the ''Review'' was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Maritain, O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a Catholic and scholastic tradition.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1406757|title = After Forty Years: Notre Dame and the Review of Politcis|journal = The Review of Politics|volume = 40|issue = 4|pages = 437–446|last1 = Stritch|first1 = Thomas|year = 1978|doi = 10.1017/S0034670500046118}}</ref>

[[Kenneth M. Sayre|Kenneth Sayre]] has explored the history of the Philosophy department. He stresses the abandonment of official [[Thomism]] to the philosophical pluralism of the 1970s, with attention to the issue of being Catholic. He pays special attention to the charismatic personalities of Ernan McMullin and Ralph McInerny, key leaders of the department in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Adventures in Philosophy at Notre Dame'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 2014) 382 pp.</ref>

===Student-run media===
Notre Dame students run nine media outlets: three newspapers, a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. The ''[[Scholastic (Notre Dame publication)|Scholastic]]'' magazine, begun as a one-page journal in 1876,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hope, C.S.C.|first=Arthur J.|title=Notre Dame: One Hundred Years |origyear=1948|edition=2|year=1979 |publisher=University Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=0-89651-501-X|chapter=X}}</ref> is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, ''The Juggler'', is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork.<ref name="Publications"/> The ''Dome'' yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with ''The Observer'' published daily and mainly reporting university and other news,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.nd.edu/content.cfm?topicid=158|title=Publications: Overview|publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=December 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215163550/http://newsinfo.nd.edu/content.cfm?topicid=158 |archivedate=December 15, 2007}}</ref> staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College.

In 1987, when some students believed that ''The Observer'' began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, ''Common Sense'' was published; it has since folded. In 2003, when other students believed that the paper had a liberal bias, they started the ''Irish Rover''. It is published twice a month and features regular columns from alumni and faculty in addition to coverage of campus matters. ''The Observer'' and the ''Irish Rover'' are distributed to all students.<ref name="Publications">{{cite web |author=Cohen, Ed|year=2005|title=The Student Media Frenzy|work=Notre Dame Magazine |url=http://www.nd.edu/~ndmag/sp2005/media.html |accessdate=December 17, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015122510/http://nd.edu/~ndmag/sp2005/media.html |archivedate=October 15, 2007}}</ref> In Spring 2008, ''Beyond Politics'', an undergraduate journal for political science research, made its debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beyondpolitics.nd.edu/index.htm |title=Beyond Politics: An Undergraduate Review of Politics |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610075617/http://beyondpolitics.nd.edu/index.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2010}}</ref>

====Football gameday traditions====

During home games, activities occur all over campus and dorms decorate their halls with a traditional item (e.g., [[Zahm Hall (University of Notre Dame)|Zahm Hall]]'s two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at midnight with the Drummers' Circle, involving the [[Band of the Fighting Irish]]'s drumline and beginning the other festivities that will continue the rest of the gameday Saturday. Later that day, the trumpet section will play the [[Notre Dame Victory March]] and the Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert at the steps of Bond Hall, then march into the stadium, leading fans and students alike across campus to the game.<ref name="ND Gamedayl">{{cite web|url=http://gameday.nd.edu/experience/notre-dame-spirit/band-of-the-fighting-irish/ |title=Band of the Fighting Irish |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003043202/http://gameday.nd.edu/experience/notre-dame-spirit/band-of-the-fighting-irish/ |archivedate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>

The Victory March was written by two brothers. Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F. Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, "Cheer cheer for old Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high, shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small, old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward to victory!"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Michael |title=The Notre Dame Victory March: A Touchstone |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/435546-the-notre-dame-victory-march-a-touchstone |website=Bleacher Report |accessdate=29 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

In the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]'' as [[Knute Rockne]] (played by [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]) delivers the famous "Win one for the Gipper" speech, the background music swells with the "Notre Dame Victory March". [[George Gipp]] was played by [[Ronald Reagan]], whose nickname "The Gipper" was derived from this role. This scene was parodied in the movie ''[[Airplane!]]'' with the same background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's former comrades. The song also was prominent in the movie ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]'', with [[Sean Astin]] as [[Rudy Ruettiger|Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger]], who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI{{!}}Catalog |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/59648 |website=catalog.afi.com |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>
