Tucson was founded as a military fort by the Spanish when [[Hugo Oconór|Hugo O'Conor]] authorized the construction of [[Presidio San Augustin del Tucson|Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón]] in 1775. It was included in the state of [[Sonora]] after [[Mexico]] gained independence from the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821.

The Spanish name of the city, ''Tucsón'' {{IPA-es|tukˈson|}}, is derived from the [[O'odham language|O'odham]] ''Cuk Ṣon'' {{IPA-azc|tʃʊk ʂɔːn|}}, meaning "(at the) base of the black [hill]", a reference to a basalt-covered hill now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|Sentinel Peak]]. Tucson is sometimes referred to as "The Old [[Pueblo]]".

The Tucson area was probably first visited by [[Paleo-Indians]], who were known to have been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological excavations near the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] found a village site dating from 2100 BC.<ref name="thiel">{{cite news|last1=Thiel|first1=J.

These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn, beans, and other crops, while also gathering wild plants and nuts, and hunting.<ref name="thiel"/>

The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the [[Hohokam]] lived in the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hohokam|url=http://arizonamuseumofnaturalhistory.org/plan-a-visit/mesa-grande/the-hohokam|website=Arizona Museum of Natural History|accessdate=3 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003225824/http://arizonamuseumofnaturalhistory.org/plan-a-visit/mesa-grande/the-hohokam|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mabry|first1=Jonathan B.|last2=Thiel|first2=J.

The Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]] first visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692. He founded the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in 1700, about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|"A" mountain]]. [[Hugo Oconór|Hugo O'Conor]], the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, ''[[Presidio San Augustin del Tucson|Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón]],'' on August 20, 1775 (the present downtown [[Pima County Courthouse]] was built near this site). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually the town came to be called ''Tucsón,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area. It was included in the state of [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] after [[Mexico]] gained independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

During the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846–1848, Tucsón was [[capture of Tucson (1846)|captured]] by [[Philip St. George Cooke]] with the [[Mormon Battalion]], but it soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke proceeded to the west, establishing [[Cooke's Wagon Road]] to California. Tucsón was not included in the [[Mexican Cession]] to the United States following the war. Cooke's road through Tucsón became one of the important routes into California during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The US acquired Arizona, south of the [[Gila River]], via treaty from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on June 8, 1854. Under this treaty and purchase, Tucsón became a part of the United States of America. The American military did not formally take over control until March 1856. In time, the name of the town became standardized in English in its current form, where the stress is on the first syllable, the "u" is long, and the "c" is silent.

In 1857, Tucson was established as a stage station on the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]]. In 1858 it became 3rd division headquarters of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] and operated until the line was shut down in March 1861. The [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line|Overland Mail Corporation]] attempted to continue running; however, following the [[Bascom Affair]], devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches ended operations in August 1861.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Tucson was incorporated in 1877, making it the oldest incorporated city in Arizona.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

From 1877 to 1878, the area suffered a rash of [[stagecoach]] robberies. Most notable were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent [[William Brazelton|William Whitney Brazelton]].<ref name="brazelton">{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Erik J.|title="Yes, Here I am Again!

[[John Clum]], of [[Tombstone, Arizona]] fame, was one of the passengers. Pima County Sheriff [[Charles A. Shibell]] and his citizen posse killed Brazelton on August 19, 1878, in a [[mesquite]] [[bosque]] along the Santa Cruz River {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} south of Tucson. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery in the Tucson area, the [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] region, and the [[Silver City, New Mexico]] area. Because of the crimes and threats to his business, [[John J. Valentine, Sr.]] of [[Wells, Fargo & Co.]] had sent [[Robert H. Paul|Bob Paul]], a special agent and a future Pima County sheriff, to investigate.<ref name="brazelton" /> The US Army established Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, to help protect settlers and travelers from Apache attacks.

In 1882, [[Morgan Earp]] was fatally shot, in what was later referred to in the press as "the Earp-Clanton Tragedy".<ref name="stilwellmurder"/> Marietta Spence, wife of [[Pete Spence]], one of the [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cochise County Cowboys]], testified at the coroner's inquest on Earp's killing and implicated [[Frank Stilwell]] in the murder.

=== Jim Leavy ambushed===

[[Jim Levy (gunfighter)|Jim Leavy]] had built a reputation of having fought in at least 16 gunfights. On June 5, 1882, Leavy had an argument with [[faro (card game)|faro]] dealer John Murphy in Tucson. The two agreed to have a duel on the Mexican border, but after hearing of Leavy's exploits as a gunfighter, Murphy decided to ambush Leavy instead. Together with two of his friends, Murphy ambushed Leavy as he was leaving the Palace Hotel, killing him. According to Wright, the three co-defendants in Leavy's murder later escaped from the Pima County Jail, but were later recaptured. Murphy and Gibson were found in Fenner, California living under assumed names and retried for the murder before being found not guilty. Moyer was captured in Denver and sentenced to life in Yuma Territorial Prison, but was pardoned in 1888.<ref name="LoW">[https://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-jimlevy/ Jim Levy – The Jewish Gunfighter]</ref><ref name=rosa>Rosa, Joseph G.

As other settlers tried to overcome violent frontier society, in 1885 the territorial legislature founded the [[University of Arizona]] as a [[Land-grant university|land-grant college]] on what was over-grazed ranch land between Tucson and Fort Lowell.

In 1890, Asians made up 4.2% of the city's population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |accessdate=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref> They were predominately Chinese men who had been recruited as workers on the railroads.

By 1900, 7,531 people lived in Tucson. By 1910, the population increased to 13,913. At about this time, the U.S. [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] had begun construction of the present Veterans Hospital. The city's clean, dry air made it a destination for the  many veterans who had been [[chemical weapons|gassed]] in World War I and needed [[respiratory therapy]]. In addition, these dry and high altitude conditions were thought to be ideal for the treatment of tuberculosis, for which there were no known cures before antibiotics were developed against it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Frank B.|title=The rise and decline of the altitude therapy of tuberculosis|date=1969|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=43|issue=1|pages=1–16|jstor=44447350|pmid=4887472}}</ref>

The city continued to grow, with the population increasing to 20,292 in 1920 and 36,818 in 1940. In 2006, the population of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]], in which Tucson is located, passed one million, while the City of Tucson's population was 535,000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In 1912, Arizona was admitted as a state. This increased the number of flags that had been flown over Tucson to five: Spanish, Mexican, United States, Confederate, and the State of Arizona.

During the territorial and early statehood periods, Tucson was Arizona's largest city and commercial center, while Phoenix was the seat of state government (beginning in 1889) and agriculture. The development of [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base|Tucson Municipal Airport]] increased the city's prominence. But between 1910 and 1920, Phoenix surpassed Tucson in population, and has continued to outpace Tucson in growth. In recent years, both Tucson and Phoenix have had some of the highest growth rates of any jurisdiction in the United States.

A major city in the Arizona Sun Corridor, Tucson is the largest city in southern Arizona, and the second largest in the state after Phoenix. It is also the largest city in the area of the historic [[Gadsden Purchase]]. As of 2015, The Greater Tucson Metro area has exceeded a population of 1 million.

The city is built along the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]], formerly a perennial river. Now a dry river bed for much of the year, it regularly floods during significant seasonal rains.

[[Interstate 10 (Arizona)|Interstate 10]] runs northwest through town, connecting Tucson to Phoenix in the northwest (on the way to its western terminus in [[Santa Monica, California]]), and to [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] and [[El Paso, Texas]] in the southeast. (Its eastern terminus is in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]).

[[Interstate 19 (Arizona)|I-19]] runs south from Tucson toward [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] and the [[U.S.-Mexico border]]. I-19 is the only Interstate highway that uses "kilometer posts" instead of "[[milepost]]s." Speed limits are marked in miles per hour and kilometers per hour.

Similar to many other cities in the [[Western U.S.]], Tucson was developed by European Americans on a [[grid plan]] starting in the late 19th century, with the city center at Stone Avenue and Broadway Boulevard. While this intersection was initially near the [[Centroid|geographic center]] of Tucson, that center has shifted as the city has expanded far to the east. Development to the west was effectively blocked by the Tucson Mountains. Covering a large geographic area, Tucson has many distinct neighborhoods.

Tucson's earliest neighborhoods, some of which were redeveloped and covered by the [[Tucson Convention Center]] (TCC), include:

As one of the oldest parts of town, Central Tucson is anchored by the Broadway Village shopping center, designed by local architect [[Josias Joesler]] and located at the intersection of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club Road. The 4th Avenue Shopping District between downtown, the university, and the Lost Barrio just east of downtown, also has many unique and popular stores. Local retail business in Central Tucson is densely concentrated along Fourth Avenue and the Main Gate Square on University Boulevard near the UA campus. The [[El Con Mall]] is also in the eastern part of midtown.

The top of Sentinel Peak, which is accessible by road, offers an outstanding view of the city looking eastward. A parking lot near the summit of Sentinel Peak has been a popular place to watch sunsets or view the city lights at night.

At the beginning of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003, [http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/squirmin-on-the-mount/Content?oid=1072015 anti-war activists] painted the "A" black. Competition ensued, with various sides repainting the "A" in different colors until the city council intervened. It is now painted red, white and blue, after the US flag. Another color may be decided by a biennial election. With the tri-color scheme, some observers complain that the shape of the A is hard to distinguish from the background of the peak.

====Northern Tucson====
North Tucson includes the urban neighborhoods of Amphitheater and [[Flowing Wells, Arizona|Flowing Wells]]. Usually considered the area north of Fort Lowell Road, North Tucson includes some of Tucson's primary commercial zones ([[Tucson Mall]] and the Oracle Road Corridor). Many of the city's most upscale [[boutiques]], restaurants, and art galleries are also on the north side, including St. Philip's Plaza. The Plaza is directly adjacent to the historic [[St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church]] (built in 1936).

Also on the north side is the suburban community of [[Catalina Foothills, Arizona|Catalina Foothills]], located in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains just north of the city limits. This community includes among the area's most expensive homes, sometimes multimillion-dollar estates. The Foothills area is generally defined as north of River Road, east of Oracle Road<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-how-oracle-road-came-to-be-named-for/article_f3bf19c2-e2b0-5192-92c6-f7dabe3204a0.html|title=Street Smarts: How Oracle Road came to be named for a fast ship with a teetotaling crew|author=David Leighton|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707230849/https://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-how-oracle-road-came-to-be-named-for/article_f3bf19c2-e2b0-5192-92c6-f7dabe3204a0.html|archive-date=July 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and west of [[Sabino Canyon|Sabino Creek]].

[[File:Northwest Metro Tucson from the Santa Catalina Mountains.jpg|thumb|right|Northwestern suburbs viewed from the Santa Catalina Mountains]]

The expansive area northwest of the city limits is diverse, ranging from the [[rural]] communities of [[Catalina, Arizona|Catalina]] and parts of the town of [[Marana, Arizona|Marana]], the small suburb of [[Picture Rocks, Arizona|Picture Rocks]], the [[affluent]] town of [[Oro Valley, Arizona|Oro Valley]] in the western foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains, and residential areas in the northeastern foothills of the [[Tucson Mountains]]. Continental Ranch (Marana), Dove Mountain (Marana), and Rancho Vistoso (Oro Valley), and [http://www.sbhoa2.org/web/pages/home Saddlebrooke] (N. Oro Valley) are all masterplanned communities in the Northwest that have thousands of residents.

The community of [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]] is also on the Northwest Side, with the distinction of being Tucson's first suburb, established in the late 1940s. Casas Adobes is centered on the historic [[Casas Adobes Plaza]] (built in 1948). Casas Adobes is also home to [[Tohono Chul Park]], which is now within the town of Oro Valley, (a nature preserve) near the intersection of North Oracle Road and West Ina Road. The [[2011 Tucson shooting|attempted assassination]] of [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Gabrielle Giffords]], and the murders of chief judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|U.S. District Court for Arizona]], [[John Roll]] and five other people on January 8, 2011, occurred at the La Toscana Village in Casas Adobes.

Near the intersection of Craycroft and Ft. Lowell Roads are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In [https://web.archive.org/web/20150416070007/http://oldfortlowellneighborhood.org/chronology.htm 1891], the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In [https://web.archive.org/web/20150416070007/http://oldfortlowellneighborhood.org/chronology.htm 1900], three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to [https://web.archive.org/web/20150416070007/http://oldfortlowellneighborhood.org/chronology.htm Harvey Adkins] in 1928. The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and [[Charles Bolsius]] purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort – transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their [https://web.archive.org/web/20150416075041/http://carliercompany.net/east-tucson-land Dutch heritage] and New Mexican experience.

==Economy==
[[File:Tucson shab1.JPG|thumb|right|Downtown Tucson with the University of Arizona in the background]]
Much of Tucson's economic development has been centered on the development of the [[University of Arizona]], which is currently the largest employer in the city. [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], on the city's southeastern edge, also provides many jobs for Tucson residents. Its presence, as well as the presence of the US Army Intelligence Center ([[Fort Huachuca]], the largest employer in the region in nearby Sierra Vista), has led to the development of many high-tech industries, including government contractors, in the area. The city of Tucson is also a major hub for the Union Pacific Railroad's Sunset Route that links the Los Angeles ports with the South/Southeast regions of the country.

Tourism is another major industry in Tucson, bringing in $2 billion per year and over 3.5 million visitors annually due to Tucson's numerous resorts, hotels, and attractions.<ref>Long, Levy J.

One of the major annual attractions is the [[Tucson Gem and Mineral Show]], and its associated shows, all held generally in the first two weeks of February. These associated shows (such as gems, jewelry, beads, fossils) are held throughout the city, with 43 different shows in 2010. This makes Tucson's the largest such exposition in the world. Its yearly economic impact in 2015 was evaluated at $120 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biztucson.com/2015/01/16/worlds-biggest-gem-show-120-million-economic-impact/|title=BizTUCSON {{!}} World's Biggest Gem Show – $120 Million Economic Impact|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>

In addition to vacationers, a significant number of winter residents, or "[[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]]", are attracted to Tucson's mild winters and live here on a seasonal basis. They also contribute to the local economy. Snowbirds often purchase [[Vacation property|second homes]] in Tucson and nearby areas, contributing significantly to the property tax base.

For the past 33 years, the Tucson Folk Festival has taken place the first Saturday and Sunday of May in downtown Tucson's El Presidio Park. In addition to nationally known headline acts each evening, the Festival highlights over 100 local and regional musicians on five stages and is one of the largest free festivals in the country. All stages are within easy walking distance. Organized by the Tucson Kitchen Musicians' Association,<ref>[http://www.tkma.org The Tucson Folk Festival homepage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506020553/http://tkma.org/ |date=May 6, 2018 }}.

Musicians typically play 30-minute sets, supported by professional audio staff volunteers. A variety of food and crafts are available at the festival, as well as local micro-brews. All proceeds from sales go to fund future festivals.

====Fourth Avenue Street Fair====

There are two Fourth Avenue Street Fairs, in December and late March/early April, staged between 9th Street and University Boulevard, that feature arts and crafts booths, food vendors and street performers. The fairs began in 1970 when Fourth Avenue, which at the time had half a dozen thrift shops, several New Age bookshops and the Food Conspiracy Co-Op, was a gathering place for [[hippies]], and a few merchants put tables in front of their stores to attract customers before the holidays.

These days, the street fair has grown into a large corporate event, with most tables owned by outside merchants. It hosts mostly traveling craftsmen selling various arts such as pottery, paintings, wood working, metal decorations, candles, and many others.

====Tucson Rodeo (Fiesta de los Vaqueros)====

The exception to this is Presidio High (a non-public charter school), which doesn't get either. Western wear is seen throughout the city as corporate dress codes are cast aside during the Fiesta. The Fiesta de los Vaqueros marks the beginning of the rodeo season in the United States.

===Nicknames===
Tucson is commonly known as "The Old Pueblo". While the exact origin of this nickname is uncertain, it is commonly traced back to Mayor [[Robert N. Leatherwood|R. N. "Bob" Leatherwood]]. When [[railroad|rail service]] was established to the city on March 20, 1880, Leatherwood celebrated the fact by sending telegrams to various leaders, including the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Pope]], announcing that the "ancient and honorable pueblo" of Tucson was now connected by rail to the outside world. The term became popular with newspaper writers who often abbreviated it as "A. and H. Pueblo". This in turn transformed into the current form of "The Old Pueblo".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/history-and-culture/life-in-the-old-pueblo-here-s-how-tucson-came/article_8bf4391f-1499-5e71-bdd8-178e3c52b96d.html|title=Life in the Old Pueblo: Here's how Tucson came to own its charming nickname|author=Jim Turner|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707201830/https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/history-and-culture/life-in-the-old-pueblo-here-s-how-tucson-came/article_8bf4391f-1499-5e71-bdd8-178e3c52b96d.html|archive-date=July 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Parks and recreation===
The city has more than 120 parks, from small and local to larger parks with ballfields, natural areas, lakes, 5 public golf courses, and [[Reid Park Zoo]]. "The Loop" is a popular system of walking/running/bicycling/horseback trails encircling the city primarily along washes, and it is usually well separated from traffic. Several scenic parks and points of interest are also nearby, including the [[Tucson Botanical Gardens]], [[Tohono Chul Park]], [[Saguaro National Park]], [[Sabino Canyon]], and [[Biosphere 2]] (just north of the city, near the town of [[Oracle, Arizona|Oracle]]).

[[Tumamoc Hill]] is an active research site maintained by the [[University of Arizona]] and [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] that doubles as a popular walking/running trail. The paved trail on Tumamoc Hill is 1.5 miles up hill (3 miles full trip), divided into two parts. The lower half is a much gradual slope compared to the steep upper half reaching a final elevation of 2,340&nbsp;ft where it over looks most of the city of Tucson. The trail attracts around 1500 visits a day from various demographics of the Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Walk the Hill {{!}} Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill|url=https://tumamoc.arizona.edu/walk-hill|access-date=2020-08-20|website=tumamoc.arizona.edu}}</ref>

In general, Tucson and Pima County support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], as opposed the state's largest metropolitan area, Phoenix, which usually supports the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Congressional redistricting in 2013, following the publication of the 2010 Census, divided the Tucson area into three Federal Congressional districts (the first, second and third of Arizona). The city center is in the 3rd District, represented by [[Raul Grijalva]], a Democrat, since 2003, while the more affluent residential areas to the south and east are in the 2nd District, represented by Democrat [[Ann Kirkpatrick]] since 2019, and the exurbs north and west between Tucson and Phoenix in the 1st District are represented by Democrat [[Tom O'Halleran]] since 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Feds give OK to new Ariz. congressional maps|url=http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/feds-give-ok-to-new-ariz-congressional-maps/article_47106c7c-84df-11e1-8c06-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=2013-02-02|newspaper=Inside Tucson Business|date=2012-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305035301/http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/feds-give-ok-to-new-ariz-congressional-maps/article_47106c7c-84df-11e1-8c06-001a4bcf887a.html|archive-date=March 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
The [[United States Postal Service]] operates post offices in Tucson. The Tucson Main Post Office is at 1501 South Cherrybell [[Stravenue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/tucson-1501-s-cherrybell-stra-rm-205-tucson-az-1439539|title=TUCSON Post Office™ Location|date=March 9, 2010|publisher=United States Postal Service|accessdate=July 7, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309221357/http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/tucson-1501-s-cherrybell-stra-rm-205-tucson-az-1439539|archive-date=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

===City government===
{{see also|List of mayors of Tucson, Arizona}}
Tucson follows the "weak mayor" model of the [[council–manager government|council-manager]] form of local government. The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Both the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).

Tucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33¢ for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64¢ per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.

Mayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E. Walkup]] (R), who took office in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/mayor|title=Mayor Bob Walkup - City of Tucson Web|date=February 13, 2010|website=tucsonaz.gov|accessdate=July 7, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213101425/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/mayor|archive-date=February 13, 2010}}</ref> Walkup was preceded by [[George Miller (Arizona politician)|George Miller]] (D), 1991–1999; [[Tom Volgy]] (D), 1987–1991; [[Lew Murphy]] (R), 1971–1987; and [[Jim Corbett (politician)|Jim Corbett]] (D), 1967–1971.

==Infrastructure==
===Energy===
Tucson's primary electrical power source is a natural gas power plant managed by Tucson Electric Power that is situated within the city limits on the southwestern boundary of Davis-Monthan Air-force base adjacent to Interstate 10. The air pollution generated has raised some concerns as the Sundt operating station has been online since 1962 and is exempt from many pollution standards and controls due to its age.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vanderpool|first=Tim|title=Polluting the Poor:TEP's southside coal plant keeps on pumping out noxious gases|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/polluting-the-poor/Content?oid=3596947|publisher=Tucson Weekly|accessdate=December 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228013941/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/polluting-the-poor/Content?oid=3596947|archive-date=December 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Solar has been gaining ground in Tucson with its ideal over 300 days of sunshine climate. Federal, state, and even local utility credits and incentives have also enticed residents to equip homes with solar systems. 
Davis-Monthan AFB has a 3.3 [[Megawatt]] (MW) ground-mounted [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) array and a 2.7 MW rooftop-mounted PV array, both of which are in the Base Housing area. The base will soon have the largest solar-generating capacity in the [[United States Department of Defense]] after awarding a contract on September 10, 2010, to [[SunEdison]] to construct a 14.5 MW PV field on the northwestern side of the base.<ref>{{cite web |author=050910 |url=http://www.dm.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123222163 |title=D-M awards solar photovoltaic utility contract to SunEdison |publisher=Dm.af.mil |accessdate=2011-10-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929230631/http://www.dm.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123222163 |archive-date=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

====Sustainability====
[[File:Snowy Catalinas.jpg|thumb|right|The nearby Santa Catalina Mountains, covered in snow]]
The biggest sustainability problem in Tucson, with its high-desert climate, is a potable water supply. The state manages all water in Arizona through its Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). The primary consumer of water is Agriculture (including golf courses), which consumes about 69% of all water. Municipal (which includes residential use) accounts for about 25% of use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona's Water: Uses and Sources|url=http://arizonaexperience.org/people/arizonas-water-uses-and-sources|publisher=Arizona Experience|access-date=December 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227204841/http://arizonaexperience.org/people/arizonas-water-uses-and-sources|archive-date=December 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Energy consumption and availability is another sustainability issue. However, with over 300 days of full sun annually, Tucson has demonstrated its potential to be an ideal solar energy producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

====Light pollution====

===Water===
Less than 100 years ago, the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] flowed nearly year-round through Tucson. This supply of water has slowly disappeared, causing Tucson to seek alternative sources.

In 1881, water was pumped from a well on the banks of the Santa Cruz River and flowed by gravity through pipes into the distribution system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.tucsonaz.gov/water/about-us|title=About Tucson Water|website=M.tucsonaz.gov|accessdate=December 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329083415/http://m.tucsonaz.gov/water/about-us|archive-date=March 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Tucson currently draws water from two main sources: [[Central Arizona Project]] (CAP) water and [[groundwater]]. In 1992, Tucson Water delivered CAP water to some customers that was referred to as being unacceptable due to discoloration, bad odor and flavor, as well as problems it caused with some customers' plumbing and appliances. Tucson's city water currently consists of CAP water mixed with groundwater.

In an effort to conserve water, Tucson is recharging groundwater supplies by running part of its share of CAP water into various open portions of local rivers to seep into their aquifer.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060703194522/http://www.ci.tucson.az.us/water/heritage.htm]</ref> Additional study is scheduled to determine how much water is lost through evaporation from the open areas, especially during the summer. The City of Tucson provides [[reclaimed water]] to its inhabitants, but it is only used for "applications such as irrigation, dust control, and industrial uses."<ref name="Reclaimed Water">{{cite web | title = Reclaimed Water | publisher = City of Tucson | year = 2012 | url = http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/reclaimed | accessdate = March 22, 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120505110418/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/reclaimed | archive-date = May 5, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> These resources have been in place for more than 27 years, and deliver to over 900 locations.<ref name="Reclaimed Water"/>

To prevent further loss of groundwater, Tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts, shifting away from its reliance on a series of Tucson area wells in favor of conservation, consumption-based pricing for residential and commercial water use, and new wells in the more sustainable Avra Valley aquifer, northwest of the city. An allocation from the [[Central Arizona Project Aqueduct]] (CAP), which passes more than {{convert|300|mi|-1|abbr=on}} across the desert from the [[Colorado River]], has been incorporated into the city's water supply, annually providing over 20 million gallons of "recharged" water which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/clearwater_faqs |title=Clearwater Frequently Asked Questions &#124; The Official Website for the City of Tucson, Arizona |publisher=Cms3.tucsonaz.gov |accessdate=2011-10-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105141442/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/clearwater_faqs |archive-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref> Since 2001, CAP water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/files/water/docs/coloradoriver.pdf |title=Tucson Water's Long Range Water Resource Planning |publisher=City of Tucson |accessdate=2012-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516095331/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/files/water/docs/coloradoriver.pdf |archive-date=May 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Water Harvesting ====
The city of Tucson, Arizona, in an attempt to combat ''climate change'', is providing financial incentives for residents to harvest their rainwater. Tucson’s water supply, like many Western cities, is drawn from two main sources: ''surface water'' that is pumped more than 300 miles from the Colorado River and ''groundwater''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Malloy|first=Chris|date=November 23, 2020|title=A Desert City Tries to Save Itself With Rain|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/harvesting-rainwater-in-a-desert-city|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> The pump expends a significant amount of energy and the Colorado River is currently diminishing as a result of climate change and overuse. In 2012, the city began a program that rebates residents as much as $2,000 for the purchase of water harvesting systems. “''Water harvesting''” refers to both ''rainwater'', gathered from building surfaces, and ''stormwater'' harvesting which collects non-potable storm runoff from streets and earth. The program is financed by a water bill fee of 10 cents per 748 gallons of city water used. In the first few years, the rebate program was not conserving water as efficiently as they anticipated. But in fiscal year 2018 to 2019, the rebate program saved 52.1 million gallons of water.<ref name=":0" /> That is enough water to meet the annual usage of 160 households.<ref name=":0" /> The city has been trying to grow the approximately 250 people who obtain active rebates each year by introducing a loan program to bring rebates within reach of lower-income residents. Along with water scarcity, Tucson is having to reckon with the urban heat island effect which has trapped heat in the city and brought incredibly high temperatures into the night.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Davis|first=Tony|title=Future Tucson will likely deal with more days of extreme heat|url=https://tucson.com/news/local/environment/future-tucson-will-likely-deal-with-more-days-of-extreme-heat/article_73897cf4-69a6-5451-9370-7cdef6e3ca01.html|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Arizona Daily Star|language=en}}</ref> The city government has an ambitious goal to be carbon neutral by 2030 and is integrating changes that will help change local resident’s conventional thinking and practices. On May 1, 2020, Tucson began charging residents and businesses within city limits a monthly Green Stormwater Infrastructure fee (13 cents per 748 gallons of city water used), which is projected to raise some $3 million a year for public stormwater capture installations and other projects.<ref name=":0" /> But this comes at a time when unemployment is rising and the number of low income residents facing unaffordable bills between 2010 to 2018 doubled to 46% as the average bill increased by 119% in Tucson.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lakhani|first=Nina|date=2020-06-23|title=Revealed: millions of Americans can't afford water as bills rise 80% in a decade|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/millions-of-americans-cant-afford-water-bills-rise|access-date=2020-12-01|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Additionally, as part of the citywide climate resiliency effort, Mayor Regina Romero recently announced the planting of a million trees over the next decade.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sayers|first=Justin|title=For Mayor Romero, 1 million planted trees in city admittedly a 'big effort'|url=https://tucson.com/news/local/for-mayor-romero-1-million-planted-trees-in-city-admittedly-a-big-effort/article_81c4c718-ef9c-5b65-aae2-d6bf979f3c1d.html|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Arizona Daily Star|language=en}}</ref> Water harvesting will be a critical aspect of that plan and the broader effort by city officials to cool down one of the country’s fastest-warming cities.
