=== Origins ===

UNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced back to a [[League of Nations]] resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a Commission to study feasibility.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = League of Nations | series = Records of the Second Assembly | title = Plenary Meetings | date = 5 September – 5 October 1921 | place = Geneva}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | quote = The [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] (ICIC) was created on 4 January 1922, as a consultative organ composed of individuals elected based on their personal qualifications. | title = A Chronology of UNESCO: 1945–1987 | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000790/079049eb.pdf | place = Paris | date = December 1987 | id = LAD.85/WS/4 Rev | series = UNESDOC database | ref = {{Harvid | UNESCO |1987}} | access-date = 13 December 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110202095140/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000790/079049eb.pdf | archive-date = 2 February 2011 | url-status = live }}.</ref> This new body, the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] (ICIC) was created in 1922<ref>{{cite book |last=Grandjean |first=Martin |date=2018 |title=Les réseaux de la coopération intellectuelle.

=== Creation ===

[[File:Flag of UNESCO.svg|thumb|[[Flag of UNESCO]]]]

After the signing of the [[Atlantic Charter]] and the [[Declaration of the United Nations]], the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945. On 30 October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and the USSR. This was followed by the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] proposals of 9 October 1944. Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] (UNCIO), held in San Francisco in April–June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London 1–16 November 1945 with 44 governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed by [[Rab Butler]], the [[Minister of Education]] for the United Kingdom, who had a great deal of influence in its development.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1949/jan/26/the-work-of-unesco The work of U.N.E.S.C.O.

In 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, a problem that continues to be addressed in the field of [[sustainable development]]. The main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000677/067785eo.pdf |title="Use and conservation of the biosphere: Proceedings of the intergovernmental conference of experts on the scientific basis for rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere.

In the field of communication, the "free flow of ideas by word and image" has been in UNESCO's constitution from its beginnings, following the experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in indoctrinating populations for aggression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002269/226924e.pdf#page=6|title=Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170713010444/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002269/226924e.pdf#page=6|archive-date=13 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In the years immediately following World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world.

In a nutshell, recognition by any UN body of the Palestinians' right to statehood or their achievement of statehood status would trigger a suspension of US funding to the "offending" UN body under these laws. (I'll just note in passing that it was Sen. Kasten who was to be a major recipient of campaign funds that [[AIPAC]]'s President [[David Steiner (AIPAC)|David Steiner]] was soliciting from one Haim Katz.

The [http://opendata.unesco.org UNESCO transparency portal] has been designed to enable public [[access to information]] regarding Organization's activities, such as its aggregate budget for a biennium, as well as links to relevant programmatic and financial documents. These two distinct sets of information are published on the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative|IATI]] registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI Organization Standard.

There have been proposals to establish two new UNESCO lists. The first proposed list will focus on movable cultural heritage such as artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list may include cultural objects, such as the [[Jōmon Venus]] of [[Japan]], the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' of France, the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] of [[Egypt]], ''[[The Ninth Wave]]'' of Russia, the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] of Turkey, the [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'' (Michelangelo)]] of Italy, the [[Mathura Herakles]] of India, the [[Manunggul Jar]] of the Philippines, the [[Crown of Baekje]] of South Korea, ''[[The Hay Wain]]'' of the United Kingdom and the [[Benin Bronzes]] of Nigeria. The second proposed list will focus on the world's living species, such as the [[komodo dragon]] of Indonesia, the [[panda]] of China, the [[bald eagle]] of North American countries, the [[aye-aye]] of Madagascar, the [[Asiatic lion]] of India, the [[kakapo]] of New Zealand, and the [[mountain tapir]] of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/cairo/culture/tangible-cultural-heritage/|title=Tangible Cultural Heritage – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319084612/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/cairo/culture/tangible-cultural-heritage/|archive-date=19 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/114908|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre – Document – Discovered artifacts under preservation, Archaeological Site, 18 Hoang Dieu street|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|access-date=26 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103001256/https://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/114908/|archive-date=3 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Media ==

UNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.

''The UNESCO Courier'' magazine states its mission to "promote UNESCO's ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate". Since March 2006 it is available online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO. There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/courier/archives|title=Archives|website=The UNESCO Courier|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=14 November 2018|date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114224552/https://en.unesco.org/courier/archives|archive-date=14 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review ''Impact of Science on Society'' (also known as ''Impact'') to discuss the influence of science on society. The journal ceased publication in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/education/nfsunesco/brochure/E29.PDF |title = Science and Technology Education |publisher = UNESCO |date = 1998 |access-date = 23 June 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160813140445/http://www.unesco.org/education/nfsunesco/brochure/E29.PDF |archive-date = 13 August 2016 |url-status = live }}</ref> UNESCO also published Museum International Quarterly from the year 1948.

== Official UNESCO NGOs ==

UNESCO has official relations with 322 [[international non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |title=Quoted on UNESCO official site |publisher=Ngo-db.unesco.org |accessdate=1 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625221827/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |archive-date=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Most of these are what UNESCO calls "operational"; a select few are "formal".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35293&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Full list of NGOs that have official relations with UNESCO |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623000619/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D35293%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archive-date=23 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

There has been no elected UNESCO Director-General from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America since inception.

The Directors-General of UNESCO came from West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1). Out of the 11 Directors-General since inception, women have held the position only twice. [[Qatar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Iran]] are proposing for a Director-General bid by 2021 or 2025. There have never been a Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian UNESCO Director-General since inception. The [[ASEAN]] bloc and some Pacific and Latin American nations support the possible bid of the Philippines, which is culturally Asian, Oceanic, and Latin. Qatar and Iran, on the other hand, have fragmented support in the Middle East. [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], and [[Madagascar]] are also vying for the position but have yet to express a direct or indirect proposal. Both Qatar and Egypt lost in the 2017 bid against France.

The list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:<ref>UNESCO official site: [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ Directors-General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718234457/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ |date=18 July 2018 }}</ref>

== Offices and headquarters ==

== Controversies ==

=== New World Information and Communication Order ===

UNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its relationships with the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Singapore]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a "[[New World Information and Communication Order]]" and its [[MacBride report]] calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb [[freedom of the press]]. UNESCO was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Grahm |first=S.

In 2010, Israel designated the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]], [[Hebron]] and [[Rachel's Tomb]], [[Bethlehem]] as [[List of National Heritage Sites of Israel|National Heritage Sites]] and announced restoration work, prompting criticism from the Obama administration and protests from Palestinians.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hebron clashes over Israel's West Bank heritage list|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8538948.stm|date=26 February 2010|publisher=BBC News|access-date=1 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803141138/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8538948.stm|archive-date=3 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In October 2010, UNESCO's Executive Board voted to declare the sites as "al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs" and "Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb" and stated that they were "an integral part of the [[occupied Palestinian Territories]]" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of [[international law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/executive_board_adopts_five_decisions_concerning_unescos_work_in_the_occupied_palestinian_and_arab_territories/|title=Executive Board adopts five decisions concerning UNESCO's work in the occupied Palestinian and Arab Territories|date=21 October 2010|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=3 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083723/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/executive_board_adopts_five_decisions_concerning_unescos_work_in_the_occupied_palestinian_and_arab_territories/|archive-date=11 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>
UNESCO described the sites as significant to "people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions", and accused Israel of highlighting only the Jewish character of the sites.<ref>{{cite news|title=THE TWO PALESTINIAN SITES OF AL-HARAM AL-IBRAHIMI/TOMB OF THE PATRIARCHS IN AL-KHALIL/HEBRON AND THE BILAL BIN RABAH MOSQUE/RACHEL'S TOMB IN BETHLEHEM|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001873/187356e.pdf|access-date=1 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127175323/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001873/187356e.pdf|archive-date=27 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at [[Jordan]]'s insistence, censured{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the [[Mughrabi-Bridge|Mughrabi Gate]] Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement, saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to address the UNESCO committee over objections from [[Egypt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088221,00.html |title=UNESCO censures Israel over Mughrabi Bridge – Israel News, Ynetnews |work=Ynetnews |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807130812/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088221,00.html |archive-date=7 August 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]], "indefinitely postponed" and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] entitled "The People, The Book, The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the [[History of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel|Jewish people and the Land of Israel]]". The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at UNESCO argued that its display would "harm the [[Arab-Israeli peace process|peace process]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Berman|first=Lazar|title=UNESCO cancels event on Jewish ties to Land of Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-cancels-event-on-jewish-ties-to-land-of-israel/|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=17 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120120047/http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-cancels-event-on-jewish-ties-to-land-of-israel/|archive-date=20 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The author of the exhibition, Professor [[Robert Wistrich]] of the [[Hebrew University]]'s [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism]], called the cancellation an "appalling act", and characterized Bokova's decision as "an arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people and its history". UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|title=Author of UNESCO's nixed Israel exhibit decries 'appalling betrayal'|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/author-of-unescos-nixed-israel-exhibit-decries-appalling-betrayal|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=21 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122053858/http://www.timesofisrael.com/author-of-unescos-nixed-israel-exhibit-decries-appalling-betrayal/|archive-date=22 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Occupied Palestine Resolution ====
{{Main|Occupied Palestine Resolution}}

On 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that condemned Israel for "aggressions" by Israeli police and soldiers and "illegal measures" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|title=UNESCO adopts anti-Israel resolution on al-Aqsa Mosque|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-adopts-anti-israel-resolution-al-aqsa-mosque-161018120610946.html|work=aljazeera.com|access-date=21 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132706/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-adopts-anti-israel-resolution-al-aqsa-mosque-161018120610946.html|archive-date=21 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> While the text acknowledged the "importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name "Al-Haram al-Sharif", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary.

In October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] confirmed that Japan's 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4&nbsp;billion had been suspended although denied any direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Japan halts Unesco funding following Nanjing massacre row|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/japan-halts-unesco-funding-nanjing-massacre-row|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030144739/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/japan-halts-unesco-funding-nanjing-massacre-row|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== US withdrawals ===

The United States withdrew from UNESCO in 1984, citing the "highly politicized" nature of the organisation, its ostensible "hostility toward the basic institutions of a free society, especially a free market and a free press", as well as its "unrestrained budgetary expansion", and poor management under then Director General Amadou-Mahter M'Bow of Senegal.<ref name="withdrawal">{{cite web|url=https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL30985.html|title=UNESCO Membership: Issues for Congress|date=20 November 2003|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service reports]]|access-date=28 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328082545/https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL30985.html|archive-date=28 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 19 September 1989, former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Leach]] stated before a Congressional subcommittee:<ref name="cspan" />

{{Quote |The reasons for the withdrawal of the United States from UNESCO in 1984 are well-known; my view is that we overreacted to the calls of some who wanted to radicalize UNESCO, and the calls of others who wanted the United States to lead in emasculating the UN system. The fact is UNESCO is one of the least dangerous international institutions ever created. While some member countries within UNESCO attempted to push journalistic views antithetical to the values of the west, and engage in Israel bashing, UNESCO itself never adopted such radical postures. The U.S. opted for empty-chair diplomacy, after winning, not losing, the battles we engaged in… It was nuts to get out, and would be nuttier not to rejoin.}}

Leach concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the impetus behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before departing from UNESCO, a withdrawal from the [[IAEA]] had been pushed on him.<ref name="cspan">{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?9189-1/united-states-unesco-part-1|title=United States & UNESCO, Part 1|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|work=Starting from 05:08|access-date=3 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328104007/https://www.c-span.org/video/?9189-1%2Funited-states-unesco-part-1|archive-date=28 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On 1 October 2003, the U.S. rejoined UNESCO.<ref name="withdrawal" />

On 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO that it will again withdraw from the organization on 31 December 2018 and will seek to establish a permanent observer mission beginning in 2019. The [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] cited "mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO".<ref name="stategov">{{Cite news |url= https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408053146/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm |archive-date=2019-04-08 |url-status=dead |title=The United States Withdraws From UNESCO| publisher =[[U.S. Department of State]] |access-date= 12 October 2017}}</ref> Israel praised the withdrawal decision as "brave" and "moral".<ref name="withdrawal" />

=== Turkish–Kurdish conflict ===

On May 25, 2016, the noted Turkish poet and human rights activist [[O. Z. Livaneli|Zülfü Livaneli]] resigned as [[Turkey]]'s only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights situation in Turkey]] and destruction of historical [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]] district of [[Diyarbakır|Diyarbakir]], the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|fighting]] between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons for his resignation. Livaneli said: "To pontificate on peace while remaining silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of UNESCO."<ref>"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-rights-un/turkish-writer-quits-unesco-to-protest-damage-to-heritage-rights-abuse-idUSKCN0YH1KA Turkish writer quits UNESCO to protest damage to heritage, rights abuse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509012658/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-rights-un/turkish-writer-quits-unesco-to-protest-damage-to-heritage-rights-abuse-idUSKCN0YH1KA |date=9 May 2018 }}". Reuters. May 26, 2016.</ref>

=== Atatürk ===

In 1981, UNESCO passed a motion approving of Turkey's [[Atatürk Centennial]], claiming that he was an "exceptional reformer in all the fields coming within UNESCO's competence".<ref>[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114032e.pdf], ''Records of the General Conference Twentieth Session Paris, 24 October to 28 November 1978 Volume I Resolutions'' (Paris: United Nations, 1979), p. 69.</ref>

=== Campaigns against illicit art trading ===

UNESCO has drawn criticism for aspects of its 2020 celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 1970 convention against the illicit trade of cultural property.

In 2020 UNESCO stated that the size of the illicit trade in cultural property amounted to 10&nbsp;billion dollars a year. The figure has been described as "bogus", and "false data", and UNESCO has been accused of exaggerating the scale of the problem. A report that same year by the Rand Organisation suggested the actual market is "not likely to be larger than a few hundred million dollars each year". An expert cited by UNESCO as attributing the 10&nbsp;billion figure denied it and said he had "no idea" where the figure came from. Art dealers were particularly critical of the UNESCO figure because it amounted to 15% of the total world art market. <ref>Vincent Noice, "Unesco, stop citing 'bogus' $10bn figure, art trade pleads", The Art Newspaper, 12 November 2020 [https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/unesco-bogus-figure].</ref>

In November 2020 part of a UNESCO advertising campaign intended to highlight international trafficking in looted artefacts had to be withdrawn after it falsely presented a series of museum-held artworks with known provenances as recently looted objects held in private collections. The adverts claimed that a head of Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum's collection since 1930 had been looted from Kabul Museum in 2001 and then smuggled into the US art market; that a funerary monument from Palmyra that the MET had acquired in 1901 had been recently looted from the Palmyra Museum by Islamic State Militants and then smuggled into the European antiquities market; and that an Ivory Coast mask with a provenance that indicates it was in the US by 1954 was looted during armed clashes in 2010–2011. After complaints from the MET, the adverts were withdrawn.<ref>Nancy Kenney, "Unesco under fire for using Met objects in anti-trafficking campaign", The Art Newspaper, 13 November 2020 [https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/facing-complaint-unesco-pulls-misleading-images-from-advertisements-about-illicit-art-trafficking]</ref>

=== Information processing tools ===

UNESCO develops, maintains and disseminates, free of charge, two interrelated software packages for database management (CDS/ISIS [not to be confused with UK police software package ISIS]) and data mining/statistical analysis (IDAMS).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=1542&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150108023105/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php%2DURL_ID%3D1542%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 2015-01-08 |title= Information Processing Tools |publisher= Unesco }}</ref>

* CDS/ISIS – a generalised information storage and retrieval system. The Windows version may run on a single computer or in a local area network. The JavaISIS client/server components allow remote database management over the Internet and are available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh. Furthermore, GenISIS allows the user to produce HTML Web forms for CDS/ISIS database searching. The ISIS_DLL provides an API for developing CDS/ISIS based applications.
* OpenIDAMS – a software package for processing and analysing numerical data developed, maintained and disseminated by UNESCO. The original package was proprietary but UNESCO has initiated a project to provide it as open-source.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15653&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150113175706/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php%2DURL_ID%3D15653%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 2015-01-13 |title= OpenIDAMS |publisher= Unesco }}</ref>
