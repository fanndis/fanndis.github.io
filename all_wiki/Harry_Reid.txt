'''Harry Mason Reid''' ({{IPAc-en|r|iː|d}}; born December 2, 1939) is an American retired attorney and politician who served as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Nevada]] from 1987 to 2017. He led the Senate's [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Democratic Conference]] from 2005 to 2017 and was the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] from 2007 to 2015.

Reid began his public career as the city attorney for [[Henderson, Nevada]] before winning election to the [[Nevada Assembly]] in 1968. Reid's former boxing coach, [[Mike O'Callaghan]], chose Reid as his running mate in the 1970 Nevada gubernatorial election, and Reid served as [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nevada|Lieutenant Governor of Nevada]] from 1971 to 1975. After being defeated in races for the United States Senate and the position of [[List of mayors of Las Vegas|mayor of Las Vegas]], Reid served as chairman of the [[Nevada Gaming Commission]] from 1977 to 1981. From 1983 to 1987, Reid represented [[Nevada's 1st congressional district|Nevada's 1st district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]].

Reid won election to the United States Senate in 1986 and served in the Senate from 1987 to 2017. He served as the Senate Democratic Whip from 1999 to 2005 before succeeding [[Tom Daschle]] as Senate Minority Leader. The Democrats won control of the Senate after the [[2006 United States Senate elections]], and Reid became the Senate Majority Leader in 2007. He held that position for the last two years of [[George W. Bush]]'s presidency and the first six years of [[Barack Obama]]'s presidency. As Majority Leader, Reid helped pass major legislation such as the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd–Frank Act]], and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Republicans took control of the Senate following the [[2014 United States Senate elections]], and Reid served as Senate Minority Leader from 2015 to his retirement in 2017.

Reid was succeeded as the Senate Democratic leader by [[Chuck Schumer]], whose leadership bid had been endorsed by Reid. Along with [[Alben W. Barkley]] and [[Mike Mansfield]], Reid is one of only three senators to serve at least eight years as majority leader.

==Early life and early career==
Reid was born in [[Searchlight, Nevada]], the third of four sons of Harry Vincent Reid, a rock miner, and Inez Orena (Jaynes) Reid, a laundress.

==Early political career==
{{Further|Electoral history of Harry Reid}}

===State politics===
Reid returned to Nevada after law school and served as Henderson [[city attorney]] before being elected to the [[Nevada Assembly]] for the multi-member fourth district of [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] in 1968. In 1970, at age 30, Reid was chosen by O'Callaghan as his [[running mate]] for [[Lieutenant Governor of Nevada]]. Reid and O'Callaghan won their respective races, and Reid served as lieutenant governor from 1971 until 1974, when he ran for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by [[Alan Bible]]. He lost by fewer than 700 votes to former governor [[Paul Laxalt]]. In 1975, Reid ran for [[List of mayors of Las Vegas|mayor of Las Vegas]] and lost to [[Bill Briare]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadalabor.com/barbwire/barb99/barb8-29-99.html|title=Dustbusters, sex appeal and Sen. Frankie Sue|access-date=July 14, 2009}}</ref>

Reid served as [[Chair (official)|chairman]] of the [[Nevada Gaming Commission]] from 1977 to 1981. When [[Jack Gordon (entertainment manager)|Jack Gordon]], [[La Toya Jackson]]'s future agent and husband, offered Reid a $12,000 bribe to get approval of new games for casinos, Reid brought in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to tape Gordon's bribery attempt and arrest him. After FBI agents interrupted the transaction, as prearranged, Reid lost his temper and attempted to choke Gordon, saying "You son of a bitch, you tried to bribe me!" before agents stopped him. Gordon was convicted in 1979 and sentenced to six months in prison. In 1981, Reid's wife found a [[Car bomb|bomb]] attached to the family station wagon;<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/harry-reid-life-story-2012-11|title=The Fabulous Life Of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid|last=Hickey|first=Walt|date=21 November 2019|website=Business Insider|access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/news-columns/jane-ann-morrison/mystery-remains-over-reid-car-bomb/|title=Mystery remains over Reid car bomb|last=Morrison|first=Jane Ann|date=30 October 2009|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/oct/28/reid-lowden-spar-over-car-bomb-story-gibbons-joins/|title=Reid, Lowden spar over car bomb story, Gibbons joins mix|last=Mascaro|first=Lisa|date=28 October 2019|website=Las Vegas Sun|access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref> Reid suspected it was placed by Gordon, although this has never been proven in a court of law.<ref name="walsh-newyorker" />

===U.S. Representative===
Prior to the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]], Nevada had only a single at-large member in the [[United States House of Representatives]], but population growth in the 1970s resulted in the state picking up a second district. Reid won the Democratic nomination for the [[Nevada's 1st congressional district|1st district]], based in Las Vegas, in 1982, and easily won the general election. He served two terms in the House, from 1983 to 1987, being reelected in [[1984 United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada|1984]].

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===
In [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1986|1986]], Reid won the Democratic nomination for the seat of retiring two-term incumbent Republican Senator [[Paul Laxalt]]. Reid defeated former at-large Congressman [[Jim Santini]], a Democrat who had turned Republican, in the November election. Reid ran for reelection in [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1992|1992]] which he won by a double-digit margin.  In [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1998|1998]] he narrowly defeated 1st District Congressman [[John Ensign]] in the midst of a statewide Republican sweep. In [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2004|2004]], Reid won reelection with 61 percent of the vote, defeating [[Richard Ziser]].

Ensign was elected to Nevada's other Senate seat in 2000. Ensign and Reid had a very good relationship despite their bitter contest in 1998. The two frequently worked together on Nevada issues until Ensign was forced to resign from his Senate seat, due to an ethics scandal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reid.senate.gov/about/index.cfm |title=Biography |publisher=Reid.senate.gov |date=February 13, 2009 |access-date=August 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316051233/http://reid.senate.gov/about/index.cfm |archivedate=March 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Reid won the Democratic nomination with 75% of the vote in the June 8 primary. He faced a very competitive general election for the [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|Senate in Nevada in 2010]]. Reid engaged in a $1 million media campaign to "reintroduce himself" to the state's voters.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/26898.html The Nevada plan: Reintroduce Reid – Manu Raju]. Politico.Com. Retrieved August 16, 2013.</ref> He defeated Republican challenger [[Sharron Angle]] in the November election, 50.3% to 44.6%, despite losing 14 of Nevada's 17 counties.

In January 2015, Reid suffered severe injuries in an exercise accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/harry-reid-nevada-races-213837|title=Harry Reid's Last Power Play|publisher=}}</ref> On March 27, 2015, Reid uploaded a video to his [[YouTube]] account announcing that he would not seek re-election in November 2016. Reid endorsed New York Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] (D) to succeed him as Minority Leader.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Harry Reid endorses Chuck Schumer to succeed him as Senate Democratic leader|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/27/harry-reid-endorses-chuck-schumer-to-succeed-him-as-senate-minority-leader/|newspaper = The Washington Post |date=March 27, 2015|access-date =December 13, 2015|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Paul|last = Kane}}</ref> He was succeeded by former Nevada Attorney General and fellow Democrat [[Catherine Cortez Masto]].

On January 1, 2017, two days before the end of his term, Reid surpassed [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[John P. Jones]] to become the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|longest-serving Senator]] from [[List of United States Senators from Nevada|Nevada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/chronlist.pdf|title=Senators|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Leadership===
From 1999 to 2005, Reid served as [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Democratic Whip]], as minority whip from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2003 to 2005. Reid was majority whip from 2001 to 2003, except for a brief period from January to May 2001. From 2001 to 2003, he served as chairman of the [[Senate Ethics Committee]]. Reid succeeded [[Tom Daschle]] as [[Minority Leader of the United States Senate|minority leader]] in 2005, and became [[Majority Leader of the United States Senate|majority leader]] after the 2006 election until 2015.  And was again Minority Leader until his retirement in 2017.

Reid spearheaded several initiatives while in Congress. In 2006, Reid co-sponsored the "Prevention First Amendment" with [[Hillary Clinton]], which would fund abortion prevention efforts such as giving women broader access to contraception.

Regarding [[same-sex marriage]], Reid initially believed that "marriage should be between a man and a woman", but abandoned that position in favor of same-sex marriage in 2012.

In regard to local issues, Reid firmly opposed construction of the proposed [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]] federal nuclear waste repository in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reid.senate.gov/issues/yucca.cfm|title=Yucca Mountain|publisher=Reid.senate.gov|access-date=August 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815031959/http://reid.senate.gov/issues/yucca.cfm|archivedate=August 15, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Reid opposed legalization of [[online poker]], but has recently changed his position, a move that some have argued was influenced by "the hundreds of thousands of dollars [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casinos contributed to his [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|re-election campaign]]".<ref>Beam, Christopher (December 10, 2010) [http://www.slate.com/id/2277305 "Don't Hate the Player—or the Game"], ''[[Slate.com]]''</ref>

Reid called immigration reform one of his priorities at the 110th Congress. He supports the [[DREAM Act]] (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act), which would give certain high school graduates who had arrived in the U.S. illegally, conditional legal status so they could attend college or enlist in the military. They could then obtain permanent legal residency after completing two years of military service or two years of college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reid.senate.gov/issues/immigration.cfm|title=Immigration|access-date=February 14, 2009|publisher=Reid Senate site|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220122027/http://reid.senate.gov/issues/immigration.cfm|archivedate=February 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In June 2009, Reid announced his intention to enact a new guest worker program as part of a comprehensive immigration reform bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/node/49907|title=Senate Democratic Leader Wants New Guest Worker Program Despite Recession and High Unemployment Rate|date=June 22, 2009|first=Terence P.|last=Jeffrey|publisher=[[Cybercast News Service]]|access-date=August 5, 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2019}}
In the late 2000s, liberal critics argued that Reid did not do enough to end the [[Multinational force in Iraq#List of nations in the coalition|American military presence in Iraq]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/09/04/congress_returns_ready_for_confrontation|title=Congress Returns Ready for Confrontation|work=The Boston Globe|date=September 4, 2007|access-date=December 10, 2010|first=Marcella|last=Bombardieri}}</ref> and that he allowed Senate Republicans to create a 60-vote bar for passage of bills without a Democratic filibuster.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/09/06/347918.aspx|title=Democratic retreat on Iraq?|publisher=msnbc.com|date=September 6, 2007|access-date=December 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505180124/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/09/06/347918.aspx|archivedate=May 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/08/05/house-approves-terror-surveillance-bill|publisher=CNN|title=House approves terror surveillance bill|access-date=May 4, 2010|date=August 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/01/23/reid/index.html|work=Salon.com|title=Your Harry Reid-led Senate in action |first=Glenn|last=Greenwald|date=January 23, 2008}}</ref> Conservatives criticized Reid for his extensive use of the procedural tactic known as "[[Filling the tree]]" to prevent amendments on important bills.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/06/tyranny-in-the-united-states-senate|title=Tyranny in the United States|publisher=heritage.org|date=June 4, 2012|access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref>

Reid was also criticized for several potentially self-enriching tactics. In 2005, Reid earmarked a spending bill to provide for building a bridge between Nevada and Arizona that would make land he owned more valuable. Reid called funding for construction of a bridge over the Colorado River, among other projects, "incredibly good news for Nevada" in a news release after passage of the 2006 transportation bill. He owned {{convert|160|acre}} of land several miles from the proposed bridge site in Arizona. The bridge could add value to his real estate investment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-earmarks13nov13,0,6626376,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title=Will the Pork stop here?|first=Chuck|last=Neubauer|first2=Tom|last2=Hamburger|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 13, 2006|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> A year later it was reported that Reid had used campaign donations to pay for $3,300 in Christmas gifts to the staff at the condominium where he resides;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-10-17-reid-christmas-bonuses_x.htm?csp=34|title=Reid Christmas Bonuses|work=USA Today|date=October 17, 2006|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> federal election law prohibits candidates from using political donations for personal use.

In 2006, the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] attempted to associate Reid with the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] by pointing out he had "received more than $50,000 from four tribes with gaming interests between 2001 and 2004 after they hired [[Jack Abramoff|Abramoff]]".

Reid apologized on January 9, 2010, for racially tinged comments he had made when Obama was campaigning for president. In private conversations, Reid had remarked that Obama could win the presidency because the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama&nbsp;— to whom he referred as being "light-skinned" and "with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one". These comments had been recently revealed by journalists [[Mark Halperin]] and [[John Heilemann]] in ''[[Game Change]]'', their book about the [[2008 United States presidential election]]. In addition to his public apology, Reid called Obama to apologize; Obama accepted his apology, stating that as far as he was concerned, the book was closed on the incident.<ref>[[Chris Cillizza|Cillizza, Chris]] (January 9, 2010).

On January 1, 2015, Reid was injured while exercising in his home—he said a piece of equipment he was using broke (later "slipped"), causing him to fall.
