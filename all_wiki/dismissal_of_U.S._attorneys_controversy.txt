==Issues in brief==
By tradition, all U.S. Attorneys are asked to resign at the start of a new administration. The new President may elect to keep or remove any U.S. Attorney. They are traditionally replaced collectively only at the start of a new White House administration.  U.S. Attorneys hold a political office, in which the President nominates candidates to office and the Senate confirms, and consequently, they serve at the pleasure of the President. When a new President is from a different political party, typically almost all of the resignations are eventually accepted<ref name=doj20010314>

and the positions are then filled by newly confirmed appointees, typically from the new President's party.<ref name="WP-Discuss-Gerson-2007-03-14">

Some U.S. Senators were concerned about a provision in the 2006 re-authorization of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] that eliminated the 120-day term limit on interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys made by the [[United States Attorney General]] to fill vacancies. The revised USA PATRIOT ACT permitted the Attorney General to appoint interim U.S. Attorneys without a term limit in office, and avoid a confirming vote by the Senate. The change in the law undermined the confirmation authority of the Senate and gave the Attorney General greater appointment powers than the President, since the President's U.S. Attorney appointees are required to be confirmed by the Senate and those of the Attorney General did not require confirmation.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Marisa Taylor |author2=Greg Gordon |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/greg_gordon/story/15610.html |title=New U.S. attorneys come from Bush's inner circle |publisher=[[McClatchy Newspapers]] |date=2007-01-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001820/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/greg_gordon/story/15610.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

The Senate was concerned that in dismissing the seven U.S. Attorneys which had been confirmed, the administration planned to fill the vacancies with its own choices, bypassing Senate confirmation and the traditional consultation with Senators in the selection process. Congress rescinded this provision on June 14, 2007, and President Bush promptly signed the bill into law.<ref name="Help Wanted">

===Administration rationale unclear===

The reasons for the dismissal of each individual U.S. Attorney were unclear. Two suggested motivations were that the administration wanted to make room for U.S. Attorneys who would be more sympathetic to the administration's political agenda, and the administration wanted to advance the careers of promising conservatives.<ref name=Bowermaster/><ref name=JaneAnnMorrison>{{cite news|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-18-Thu-2007/news/12044953.html |date=2007-01-18 |author=Jane Ann Morrison |title=Bush administration's ouster of U.S. attorneys an insulting injustice |access-date=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225154/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-18-Thu-2007/news/12044953.html |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=Taylor-Gordon20070126>{{cite news|date=2007-01-26 |title=Gonzales appoints political loyalists into vacant U.S. attorneys slots |author=Marisa Taylor |author2=Greg Gordon |publisher=McClatchy Newspapers |url=http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/news/nation/16555903.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325194003/http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/news/nation/16555903.htm |archive-date=March 25, 2007 }}</ref>
Critics said that the attorneys were fired for failing to prosecute [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]ic politicians, for failing to prosecute claims of election fraud that would hamper Democratic voter registration, as retribution for prosecuting [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians, or for failing to pursue adult obscenity prosecutions.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/2007/04/19/doj_obscenity/ | date=2007-04-19 | author=Mark Follman | title=The U.S. attorneys scandal gets dirty | work=Salon.com | access-date=2009-07-03}}</ref>

===Politicization of hiring at the Department of Justice===
Attorney General Gonzales, in a confidential memorandum dated March 1, 2006, delegated authority to senior DOJ staff [[Monica Goodling]] and [[Kyle Sampson]] to hire and dismiss political appointees and some civil service positions.

On May 2, 2007, the Department of Justice announced two separate investigations into hirings conducted by Goodling: one by the department's [[Inspector General]], and a second by the [[Office of Professional Responsibility]].<ref name="NYT-Lipton-2007-05-03"/>
In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, on May 23, 2007, Goodling stated that she had "crossed the line" and broken civil service laws regulating hiring for civil service positions, and had improperly weighed political factors in assessing applicants.<ref name="NYT-Stout-2007-05-23">{{cite news | first=David | last=Stout | title=Ex-Gonzales Aide Testifies, 'I Crossed the Line' | date=2007-05-23 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/washington/23cnd-monica.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin | work =The New York Times | access-date = 2007-05-23 }}</ref>

According to a January 2009 Justice Department report, investigators found that [[Bradley Schlozman]], as interim head of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, "favored applicants with conservative political or ideological affiliations and disfavored applicants with civil rights or human rights experience whom he considered to be overly liberal". The positions under consideration were not political, but career, for which the political and ideological views of candidates are not to be considered, according to federal law and guidelines.<ref>{{cite news | first=Theresa | last=Cook | title=Report Raps Bradley Schlozman, Former Justice Department Official, for Political Bias | date=2009-01-13 | publisher=ABC News | url =https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/DOJ/story?id=6637861 | work =ABC News | access-date = 2009-02-09 }}

===Dismissed attorneys and elections===
{{See also|Pete Domenici|Heather Wilson|Bradley Schlozman}}
The controversy surrounding the U.S. Attorneys dismissals was often linked to elections or voter-fraud issues. Allegations were that some of the U.S. Attorneys were dismissed for failing to instigate investigations damaging to Democratic politicians, or for failing to more aggressively pursue voter-fraud cases.<ref name = "WashingtonPost-20070513"/><ref>{{cite news |title=No evidence of election crime, former U.S. attorney says |first=Richard |last=Roesler|publisher=The Spokesman Review |date=2007-05-20 |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=9951 |access-date=2007-05-26}}</ref> Such allegations were made by some of the dismissed U.S. Attorneys themselves to suggest reasons they may have been dismissed.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/nation/stories/030107dnnatattorney.398bb40.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070530041944/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/nation/stories/030107dnnatattorney.398bb40.html | archive-date = 2007-05-30 |title = Fired U.S. attorney alleges political pressure |date = 2007-02-28 |access-date = 2007-05-26}}</ref>
The background to the allegations is the recent tendency for elections in parts of the United States to be very close; an election outcome can be affected by an announced investigation of a politician. It is explicit policy of the Department of Justice to avoid bringing voter-related cases during an election for this reason.<ref>
{{cite news |title=Justice Department reportedly bent rules on voter fraud charges|first=Richard |last=Serrano |newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=2007-06-06 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/06/nation/na-usattys6 |access-date=2009-01-31}}</ref> In September 2008, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice concluded that some of the dismissals were motivated by the refusal of some of the U.S. Attorneys to prosecute voter fraud cases during the 2006 election cycle.<ref name="USDOJ-IG" />

==Fallout==
By April 2007, there was some speculation that the dismissal of the US attorneys might affect cases of public corruption and voter fraud. According to the ''[[National Law Journal]],''

<blockquote>Just the appearance of political influence in cases related to those firings, combined with the recent, unusual reversal of a federal public corruption conviction in Wisconsin <nowiki>[</nowiki>c.f., [[Georgia Thompson]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, some say, will spur aggressive defense lawyers to question the political motivation of prosecutors in certain cases; make magistrates and judges more skeptical of the evidence before them; and perhaps even chill line prosecutors in their pursuit of some indictments.<ref name="NLJ-Coyle-2007-04-27" /></blockquote>

By mid-September 2007, nine senior staff of the Department of Justice associated with the controversy had resigned.<ref name="WPost-Eggen-2007-09-19"/><ref name="Jordan">{{cite news |title= Official Close to Attorney Firings Quits |first = Lara Jakes |last = Jordan |date=June 15, 2007 |newspaper= Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref name="WP-Eggen-2007-06-23">

On September 29, 2008 the Justice Department's Inspector General (IG) released a report on the matter that found most of the firings were politically motivated and improper. The next day Attorney General [[Michael Mukasey]] appointed a special prosecutor [[Nora Dannehy]] to decide whether criminal charges should be brought against Gonzales and other officials involved in the firings.<ref name="IHT-09-29-2008" /> The IG's report contained "substantial evidence" that party politics drove a number of the firings, and IG [[Glenn Fine]] said in a statement that Gonzales had "abdicated his responsibility to safeguard the integrity and independence of the department."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/v-print/story/53255.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903151234/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/v-print/story/53255.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=Prosecutor to probe role of politics in attorney firings |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |access-date=2011-04-17 }}</ref>
The report itself stopped short of resolving questions about higher White House involvement in the matter, because of what it said were the refusal to cooperate of a number of key players, among them [[Karl Rove]], Senator [[Pete Domenici]] and [[Harriet Miers]] and because the White House refused to hand over its documents related to the firings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0809a/final.pdf |title=An Investigation into the Removal of Nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006|pages=356â€“7 |publisher= DOJ Inspector General |access-date=2011-04-17}}</ref>

On July 21, 2010, Dannehy concluded that "there was insufficient evidence to establish that persons knowingly made material false statements to [the Office of Inspector General] or Congress or corruptly endeavored to obstruct justice"<ref>{{cite news | title=Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich | author=Weich | page=5| url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/conyers.dannehy.ola.resp.pdf}}</ref> and that no criminal charges would be filed against Sampson or Gonzales.

===Initial planning===
On January 6, 2005, Colin Newman, an assistant in the White House counsels office, wrote to David Leitch stating, "[[Karl Rove]] stopped by to ask you (roughly quoting) 'how we planned to proceed regarding U.S. Attorneys, whether we were going to allow all to stay, request resignations from all and accept only some of them or selectively replace them, etc.'". The email was then forwarded to Kyle Sampson, chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.<ref name="Rove2005-2nd">{{cite news|access-date=2007-03-13|author1=David Johnston |author2=Eric Lipton |date=March 16, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/world/americas/16iht-rove.4930290.html?_r=1

In reply, Kyle Sampson, then Department of Justice counsel to Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], wrote that it would be "weird to ask them to leave before completing at least a 4-year term", that they "would like to replace 15â€“20 percent of the current U.S. Attorneys" and that the rest "are doing a great job, are loyal Bushies, etc."<ref name="Rove2005"/>

In March 2005, Sampson ...

<blockquote>came up with a checklist. He rated each of the U.S. Attorneys with criteria that appeared to value political allegiance as much as job performance. He recommended retaining 'strong U.S. Attorneys who have ... exhibited loyalty to the President and Attorney General.' He suggested 'removing weak U.S. Attorneys who have ... chafed against Administration initiatives'.<ref name="LAtimes031407">

Sampson wrote in January 2006 to Miers that he recommended that the Department of Justice and the Office of the Counsel to the President work together to seek the replacement of a limited number of U.S. Attorneys, and that by limiting the number of attorneys "targeted for removal and replacement" it would "mitigat[e] the shock to the system that would result from an across-the-board firing".<ref name="Eggen-Solomon20070313">{{cite news|access-date=2007-03-13|author=Eggen, Dan |author2=John Solomon |date=March 13, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/12/AR2007031201818_pf.html|title=Firings Had Genesis in White House Ex-Counsel Miers First Suggested Dismissing Prosecutors 2 Years Ago, Documents Show |work=The Washington Post|page=Page A01}}</ref>

On February 12, 2006, [[Monica Goodling]] sent a spreadsheet of each U.S. Attorney's political activities and memberships in conservative political groups, in an email to senior Administration officials, with the comment "This is the chart that the AG requested".<ref name="Jordan20070413">{{cite news|access-date=2007-05-21 |author=Jordan, Laura Jakes |date=April 13, 2007 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=3039829 |publisher=ABC News (AP) |title=Agency weighed prosecutors' politics |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616084406/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=3039829 |archive-date=June 16, 2008 }}</ref>

Sampson strongly urged using changes to the law governing U.S. Attorney appointments to bypass Congressional confirmation, writing in a September 17, 2006 memo to [[Harriet Miers]]:

<blockquote>I am only in favor of executing on a plan to push some USAs out if we really are ready and willing to put in the time necessary to select candidates and get them appointed ... It will be counterproductive to DOJ operations if we push USAs out and then don't have replacements ready to roll immediately ... I strongly recommend that as a matter of administration, we utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the AG to make USA appointments ... [By avoiding Senate confirmation] we can give far less deference to home state senators and thereby get 1.) our preferred person appointed and 2.) do it far faster and more efficiently at less political costs to the White House.<ref name="Eggen-Solomon20070313"/></blockquote>

===Implementation: The U.S. Attorney Removal List===
In October 2006, [[George W. Bush]] told Alberto Gonzales that he had received complaints that some of the U.S. Attorneys had not pursued certain voter-fraud investigations. The complaints came from Republican officials, who demanded fraud investigations into a number of Democratic campaigns.<ref name="Eggen-Solomon20070313"/>

According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', "Kyle Sampson, Gonzales's chief of staff, developed the list of eight prosecutors to be fired last Octoberâ€”with input from the White House".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17552880/site/newsweek/page/2/ | title=Fuel to the Firings | magazine=[[Newsweek]] | date=2007-03-19| first=Michael | last=Isikoff | access-date = 2007-03-12 | url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314183909/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17552880/site/newsweek/page/2/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-03-14}}</ref>

On November 27, 2006, Gonzales met with senior advisers to discuss the plan.<ref name="NYtimes0324">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/24/washington/24attorney.html | title=Gonzales Met With Advisors on Ouster Plan| newspaper=The New York Times | date= 2007-03-24 | first=David and Eric Lipton | last= Johnston | access-date = 2007-03-24}}</ref> The Justice Department did not receive White House approval for the firings until early December. As late as December 2, Sampson had written to [[Michael Elston]] that the Justice department was "[s]till waiting for green light from White House" with regards to the firing. Deputy White House counsel [[William K. Kelley]] responded on December 4, 2006, saying, "We're a go for the U.S. Atty plan ... [the White House office of legislative affairs], political, communications have signed off and acknowledged that we have to be committed to following through once the pressure comes."<ref name=LaraJakesJordan>{{cite news|author=Lara Jakes Jordan |agency=Associated Press |title=Gonzales: Prosecutors firings mishandled |date=March 13, 2007}}</ref>

==Reactions and congressional investigation==
{{main|Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy timeline|Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy hearings}}

===Initial reaction===
The initial reaction was from the senators of the affected states. In a letter to Gonzales on January 9, 2007, Senators [[Dianne Feinstein|Feinstein]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], [[California]]) and [[Patrick Leahy|Leahy]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], [[Vermont]]; Chair of the Committee) of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed concern that the confirmation process for U.S. attorneys would be bypassed, and on January 11, they, together with [[Mark Pryor|Senator Pryor]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], [[Arkansas]]), introduced legislation "to prevent circumvention of the Senate's constitutional prerogative to confirm U.S. Attorneys", called Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007, {{USBill|110|S|214}} and {{USBill|110|H|580}}.<ref>

The initial concern was about the USA PATRIOT Act and the confirmation process, rather than the politicization of the U.S. Attorneys.

Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 18. He assured the committee that he did not intend to bypass the confirmation process and denied the firings were politically motivated.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801880.html | date=2007-01-19 | author=Dan Eggen | title=Prosecutor Firings Not Political, Gonzales Says | access-date=2007-04-16}}</ref>

===Further investigation and resignations===

====Battle resignation====
On March 5, 2007 effective March 16, [[Michael A. Battle]] resigned his position of Director of the [[Executive Office for United States Attorneys]] (EOUSA).<ref name=Hartley20070321/><ref>
{{cite news | title=Messenger in Prosecutors' Firings Quits | author=David Johnston | date=2007-03-06 | newspaper=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/washington/06inquire.html?ex=1330837200&en=682ea9a6d2069de0&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss| author-link=David Johnston }}</ref> On March 6, 2007, Gonzales responded to the controversy in an op-ed in ''[[USA Today]]'' in which he wrote:

<blockquote>To be clear, [the firing] was for reasons related to policy, priorities and management&nbsp;â€” what have been referred to broadly as "performance-related" reasons&nbsp;â€” that seven U.S. attorneys were asked to resign last December ... We have never asked a U.S. attorney to resign in an effort to retaliate against him or her or to inappropriately interfere with a public [[Political corruption|corruption]] case (or any other type of case, for that matter). Like me, U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and we all serve at the pleasure of the president. If U.S. attorneys are not executing their responsibilities in a manner that furthers the management and policy goals of departmental leadership, it is appropriate that they be replaced ... While I am grateful for the public service of these seven U.S. attorneys, they simply lost my confidence. I hope that this episode ultimately will be recognized for what it is: an overblown personnel matter.<ref name="Gonzales-03-06-07" /></blockquote>

====Sampson resignation====
On March 12, 2007, Sampson resigned from the Department of Justice.<ref name=LaraJakesJordan />

On March 13, Gonzales stated in a news conference that he accepted responsibility for mistakes made in the dismissal and rejected calls for his resignation that Democratic members of Congress had been making. He also stood by his decision to dismiss the attorneys, saying "I stand by the decision and I think it was the right decision".<ref name=LaraJakesJordan />
Gonzales admitted that "incomplete information was communicated or may have been communicated to Congress" by Justice Department officials,<ref>{{cite press release |date=March 13, 2007 |access-date=2007-03-18 |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2007/ag_speech_070313.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825102401/http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2007/ag_speech_070313.html |archive-date=2007-08-25 |title=Transcript of Media Availability With Attorney General Alberto R.

We never had a discussion about where things stood."

Gonzales lost more support when records subsequently challenged some of these statements. Although the Department of Justice released 3,000 pages of its internal communications related to this issue, none of those documents discussed anything related to a performance review process for these attorneys before they were fired.<ref>{{cite news | date=2007-03-20 | title=E-Mails Show Justice Dept. in Damage-Control Mode | author=Ari Shapiro | publisher=National Public Radio | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9003390}}</ref> Records released on March 23 showed that on his November 27 schedule "he attended an hour-long meeting at which, aides said, he approved a detailed plan for executing the [[purge]]".<ref>{{cite news |date=2007-03-26 |title=White House backs AG as support wanes |author=Lara Jakes Jordan |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/03/26/national/w074341D05.DTL |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624113643/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F03%2F26%2Fnational%2Fw074341D05.DTL |archive-date=June 24, 2008 }}</ref>

====Executive Privilege claims====
[[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] stated that Congress has the authority to [[subpoena]] Justice Department and White House officials including chief political advisor to the president Karl Rove and former White House counsel Harriet Miers.<ref name="WP-20070354">{{cite news | title= Subpoenas target Justice; White House could be next| publisher=CNN | date=2007-03-15 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/15/fired.attorneys/index.html}}</ref> On March 20, President Bush declared in a press conference that his aides would not testify under oath on the matter if [[subpoena]]ed by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]].<ref name="WP-xx">{{cite news|title= Bush Clashes With Congress on Prosecutors|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 20, 2007|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/us/politics/21attorneys.html?ex=1332129600&en=6190f05e97511f82&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|access-date=2007-07-25}}</ref> Bush explained his position saying,

<blockquote>The President relies upon his staff to provide him candid advice. The framers of the Constitution understood this vital role when developing the separate branches of government. And if the staff of a President operated in constant fear of being hauled before various committees to discuss internal deliberations, the President would not receive candid advice, and the American people would be ill-served ... I will oppose any attempts to subpoena White House officials ...

Despite the President's position against aides testifying, on March 21 the House Judiciary Committee authorized the subpoena of five Justice Department officials,<ref name="NYtimes3-21">{{cite news | title=Panel Approves Five Subpoenas on Prosecutors| work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2007-03-21 | author=Hulse, Carl |access-date=2007-03-23 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/washington/22attorneys.html}}</ref> and on March 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee authorized subpoenas as well.<ref>{{cite news|title= Senate Panel Approves Subpoenas for 3 Top Bush Aides|author=Paul Kane|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2007-03-23|access-date=2007-04-17|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032200213.html}}</ref>

====Goodling resignation====
{{main|Monica Goodling}}
Sampson's replacement as the Attorney General's temporary chief of staff was U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, [[Chuck Rosenberg]]. Rosenberg initiated a DOJ inquiry into possibly inappropriate political considerations in Monica Goodling's hiring practices for civil service staff. [[Civil Service#United States|Civil service]] positions are not political appointments and must be made on a nonpartisan basis. In one example, [[Jeffrey A. Taylor]], former interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, tried to hire a new career prosecutor, Seth Adam Meinero, in the fall of 2006. Goodling judged Meinero too "liberal" and declined to approve the hire.<ref name="WPost-Eggen-2007-05-23">{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Eggen |author2=Carol D. Leonnig | title=Officials Describe Interference by Former Gonzales Aide | date=2007-05-23 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201601.html | work =The Washington Post | pages =A04 | access-date = 2007-05-23 }}</ref> Meinero, a Howard University law school graduate who had worked on civil rights cases at the Environmental Protection Agency, was serving as a special assistant prosecutor in Taylor's office. Taylor went around Goodling, and demanded Sampson's approval to make the hire. In another example, Goodling removed an attorney from her job at the Department of Justice because she was rumored to be a lesbian, and, further, blocked the attorney from getting other Justice Department jobs she was qualified for.<ref>{{cite news| first=Ari| last=Shapiro| title=Justice Rehires Attorney Fired Amid Gay Rumor| date=2009-02-02| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100147494| work =National Public Radio| access-date = 2009-02-02}}</ref> Rules concerning hiring at the Justice department forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation.

On March 26, 2007, Goodling, who had helped coordinate the dismissal of the attorneys with the White House, took leave from her job as counsel to the attorney general and as the Justice Department's liaison to the White House.<ref name = "NYTimes Top Aide Resigns">{{cite news|author1=Stout, David  |author2=Johnson, David | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/07/washington/07goodling.html?pagewanted=print| title = A Top Aide to the Attorney General Resigns | date = 2007-04-06 | newspaper = The New York Times | access-date = 2007-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.startribune.com/587/story/1081341.html | title = Gonzales aide will invoke Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify | author1 = Talev, Margaret | author2 = Hutcheson, Ron | author3 = Taylor, Marisa | date = 2007-03-26 | access-date = 2007-04-07 | newspaper = [[Star Tribune]] }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Goodling was set to testify before Congress, but on March 26, 2007, she cancelled her appearance at the Congressional hearing, citing her [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination.<ref>{{cite news | title=Gonzales's Senior Counselor Refuses to Testify | author=Dan Eggen | newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2007-03-26 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/26/AR2007032600935.html }}</ref> On April 6, 2007, Goodling resigned from the Department of Justice.<ref name = "NYTimes Top Aide Resigns"/>

On April 25, 2007, the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] passed a resolution, by a 32â€“6 vote, authorizing lawyers for the House to apply for a court order granting Goodling immunity in exchange for her testimony and authorizing a subpoena for her.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18308547 Gonzales aide gets immunity] </ref> On May 11, 2007, [[U.S. District Court]] Chief Judge Thomas Hogan signed an order granting Goodling [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] in exchange for her truthful testimony in the U.S. Attorney firings investigation, stating that "Goodling may not refuse to testify, and may not refuse to provide other information, when compelled to do so" before the Committee.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Dan Eggen|author2=Paul Kane|title=Judge Gives Immunity to Gonzales Aide|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/11/AR2007051102111.html|access-date=4 December 2015|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

====Gonzales resignation====
A number of members of both houses of Congress publicly said Gonzales should resign, or be fired by Bush. On March 14, 2007, Senator [[John E. Sununu]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[New Hampshire]]) became the first Republican lawmaker to call for Gonzales' resignation. Sununu cited not only the controversial firings but growing concern over the use of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] and misuse of [[national security letters]] by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].<ref name="WP-20070351">{{cite news | title= GOP senator calls for Gonzales' head |author=Suzanne Malveaux |author2=Dana Bash |author3=Ed Henry |author4=Terry Frieden |work=CNN | date=2007-03-14 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/14/fired.attorneys/index.html}}</ref> Calls for his ousting intensified after his testimony on April 19, 2007.

====Testimony of Sara Taylor: Claims of executive privilege====
On July 11, 2007, [[Sara Taylor]], former top aide to Karl Rove, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Throughout Taylor's testimony, she refused to answer many questions, saying "I have a very clear letter from [White House counsel] Mr. [Fred] [[Fred Fielding|Fielding]]. That letter says and has asked me to follow the president's assertion of [[executive privilege]]."<ref name="Kwame Taylor">{{cite news|date=July 11, 2007|title=New Testimony on Fired Federal Prosecutors|publisher=PBS Newshour|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec07/firings_07-11.html|author=Kwame Holman|author-link=Kwame Holman}}</ref> Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) dismissed the claims and warned Taylor she was "in danger of drawing a criminal contempt of Congress citation".<ref name="Kwame Taylor"/> Senator [[Ben Cardin]] (D-MD) took issue with the claim as well, telling Taylor

{{quote|You seem to be selective in the use of the presidential privilege.

Leahy added "I do note your answer that you did not discuss these matters with the president and, to the best of your knowledge, he was not involved is going to make some nervous at the White House because it seriously undercuts his claim of executive privilege if he was not involved."<ref name="Kwame Taylor"/> He also said "It's apparent that this White House is contemptuous of the Congress and feels it does not have to explain itself to anyone, not to the people's representatives in Congress nor to the American people."<ref name="Taylor Excerpts">{{cite news|title=Excerpts from the Sara M.

In summary, Taylor told the Senate that she

<blockquote>"did not talk to or meet with President Bush about removing federal prosecutors before eight of them were fired", she had no knowledge on whether Bush was involved in any way in the firings, her resignation had nothing to do with the controversy, "she did not recall ordering the addition or deletion of names to the list of prosecutors to be fired", and she refuted the testimony of Kyle Sampson, Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]]' chief of staff, that she sought "to avoid submitting a new prosecutor, [[Timothy Griffin|Tim Griffin]], through Senate confirmation."<ref name="Kwame Taylor"/><ref name="Aide">{{cite news|title=Aide: Didn't Talk to Bush About Firings |date=2007-07-11 |author=Laurie Kellman |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6772568,00.html |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025150246/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6772568,00.html |archive-date=October 25, 2007 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Contempt of Congress charges===
On July 11, 2007, as Sara Taylor testified, George Manning, the attorney to former [[White House Counsel]] Harriet Miers, announced that Miers intended to follow the request of the Bush Administration and not appear before the Committee the following day. Manning stated Miers "cannot provide the documents and testimony that the committee seeks."<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush orders Miers to defy house subpoena|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19704513/ns/politics/t/bush-orders-miers-defy-house-subpoena/#.VmHdgePD7RY|access-date=4 December 2015|publisher=NBC News}}</ref>

In response to the announcement, Committee Chairman [[John Conyers]] (D-MI) and Rep. [[Linda SÃ¡nchez]] (D-CA) Chair of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, released a letter saying the decision "could subject Ms. Miers to contempt proceedings." Conyers wrote

<blockquote>I am extremely disappointed in the White House's direction to Ms. Miers that she not even show up to assert the privilege before the Committee. We understand that the White House has asserted privilege over both her testimony and documents, and we are prepared to consider those claims at tomorrow's hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is disappointing that Ms. Miers has chosen to forego this opportunity to give her account of the potential politicization of the justice system.", SÃ¡nchez added "Our investigation has shown&nbsp;â€“ through extensive interviews and review of documents&nbsp;â€“ that Ms. Miers played a central role in the Bush Administration's decision to fire chief federal prosecutors. I am hopeful that Ms. Miers will reconsider the White House's questionable assertion of executive privilege and give her testimony on the firing of U.S. Attorneys."</blockquote>

On July 17, 2007 Sanchez and Conyers notified White House Counsel [[Fred Fielding]] that they were considering the executive privilege claims concerning a "subpoena issued on June 13 to [[Joshua Bolten]], [[White House Chief of Staff]], to produce documents."<ref name="fielding warning">{{cite web|title=Conyers, SÃ¡nchez Respond to RNC on Subpoena, Alerts White House of Potential Ruling on Immunity, Privilege Claims |date=2007-07-17 |author1=Linda SÃ¡nchez |author2=John Conyers, Jr. |url=http://www.lindasanchez.house.gov/news.cfm/article/334 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070725204318/http://www.lindasanchez.house.gov/news.cfm/article/334 |archive-date=July 25, 2007 }}</ref> They warned, "If those objections are overruled, you should be aware that the refusal to produce the documents called for in the subpoena could subject Mr. Bolten to contempt proceedings".<ref name="fielding warning"/> The panel ruled the claims of privilege as invalid on a party-line vote of 7â€“3.<ref name="faces">{{cite news|title=Bush chief of staff faces possible contempt charge|date=2007-07-20|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-28568320070720|work=Reuters}}</ref>

The White House had consistently refused to provide the sought documents but "offered to permit former and current aides to talk with lawmakers behind closed doorsâ€”but without a transcript and not under oath."<ref name="faces"/> This offer had been rejected by the Democratic Leadership in the House as unacceptable.<ref name="faces"/>

On July 25, 2007 the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] voted along party lines 22-17 to issue citations of [[Contempt of Congress]] to White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers.<ref name="NPR-Shapiro-2007-07-25">{{cite news|title=Bush Aides in Contempt; Will They Be Prosecuted?|author=Ari Shapiro|date=2007-07-25|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12234115|work=All Things Considered |publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref> Committee Republicans voted against the measure, calling it "a partisan waste of time", while Democrats said "this is the moment for Congress to rein in the administration."<ref name="NPR-Shapiro-2007-07-25"/>

[[White House Press Secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] said of the action,

<blockquote>For our view, this is pathetic. What you have right now is partisanship on Capitol Hill that quite often boils down to insults, insinuations, inquisitions and investigations rather than pursuing the normal business of trying to pass major pieces of legislation ... now we have a situation where there is an attempt to do something that's never been done in American history, which is to assail the concept of executive privilege, which hails back to the administration of [[George Washington]]".<ref>

Committee Chairman [[John Conyers]] said

<blockquote>Unlike other disputes involving executive privilege, the president has never personally asserted privilege. The committee has never been given a privilege log, and there is no indication the president was ever personally involved in the termination decisions.<ref name="NPR-Shapiro-2007-07-25"/></blockquote>

Having passed the Committee, the motion went to the full House, where it was unlikely to receive a vote until after Congress's August recess.<ref name="NPR-Shapiro-2007-07-25"/> If the measure passed the full House, the case would be given to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. "The administration has said it will direct federal prosecutors not to prosecute contempt charges."<ref name="NPR-Shapiro-2007-07-25"/>

On February 14, 2008, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted 223â€“32 along party lines to pass the contempt resolutions against White House Chief of Staff Bolten and former White House Counsel Miers.<ref>{{cite news|title=House passes contempt resolution against white house officials|author=Paul Kiel|date=2008-02-14|url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/02/house_passes_contempt_votes_ag.php}}</ref><ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFS/PelosiToMukasey080228.pdf Original text of the Letter from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Attorney General Michael Mukasey informing him of the contempt resolution passing the House] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529013513/http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFS/PelosiToMukasey080228.pdf |date=May 29, 2008 }}</ref> Most Republicans staged a walkout during the vote.

==Aftermath==

===Subpoenas and lost emails===
{{see also|Bush White House e-mail controversy}}

White House spokesman Scott Stanzel stated that some of the emails that had involved official correspondence relating to the firing of attorneys may have been lost because they were conducted on Republican party accounts and not stored properly. "Some official e-mails have potentially been lost and that is a mistake the White House is aggressively working to correct." said Stanzel, a White House spokesman. Stonzel said that they could not rule out the possibility that some of the lost emails dealt with the firing of U.S. attorneys.<ref>{{cite news | title= White House: E-mails on firings may have been killed |agency=Reuters |date=2007-04-11}}</ref> For example, [[J. Scott Jennings]], an aide to Karl Rove communicated with [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department officials]] "concerning the appointment of [[Timothy Griffin|Tim Griffin]], a former Rove aide, as U.S. attorney in Little Rock, according to e-mails released in March, 2007. For that exchange, Jennings, although working at the White House, used an e-mail account registered to the [[Republican National Committee]], where Griffin had worked as a political opposition researcher."<ref name=WP-GSA-20070326>{{cite news | title = GSA Chief Is Accused of Playing Politics: Doan Denies 'Improper' Use of Agency for GOP | author= Scott Higham |author2=Robert O'Harrow Jr | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=2007-03-26 |page=A01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032501048.html }}</ref>

CNN reported a larger question concerning the lost e-mails: "Whether White House officials such as political adviser Karl Rove are intentionally conducting sensitive official presidential business via non-governmental accounts to evade a law requiring preservationâ€”and eventual disclosureâ€”of presidential records."<ref>{{cite news | title= Leahy: Aides lying about White House-Justice e-mails|publisher=CNN |date=2007-04-12 }}</ref>

On May 2, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Gonzales compelling the Department of Justice to produce all email from Karl Rove regarding evaluation and dismissal of attorneys that was sent to DOJ staffers, no matter what email account Rove may have used, whether White House, National Republican party, or other accounts, with a deadline of May 15, 2007, for compliance. The subpoena also demanded relevant email previously produced in the [[Valerie Plame]] controversy and investigation for the [[Plame affair|2003 CIA leak scandal]].<ref>

In August 2007, Karl Rove resigned without responding to the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena claiming, "I just think it's time to leave."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293051,00.html |title=Bush Adviser Karl Rove to Resign at End of Month |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2007-08-13 |access-date=2011-04-17}}</ref>

===Appointment of U.S. Attorneys and the 2005 Patriot Act reauthorization===

The [[President of the United States]] has the authority to appoint [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorneys]], with the consent of the [[United States Senate]], and the President may remove U.S. Attorneys from office.<ref>
{{USC|28|541}}</ref> In the event of a vacancy, the [[United States Attorney General]] is authorized to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney. Before March 9, 2006, such interim appointments expired after 120 days, if a Presidential appointment had not been approved by the Senate. Vacancies that persisted beyond 120 days were filled through interim appointments made by the [[Federal District Court]] for the district of the vacant office.<ref name="Title28 Section 546 before Patriot">{{USC|28|546}} (U.S. Code prior to amendments of the USA PATRIOT Act, as of the retrieval date March 15, 2007.)</ref>

The [[USA PATRIOT Act|USA PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005]], signed into law March 9, 2006, amended the law for the interim appointment of U.S. Attorneys by deleting two provisions: (a) the 120-day maximum term for the Attorney General's interim appointees, and (b) the subsequent interim appointment authority of [[United States district courts|Federal District Courts]]. With the revision, an interim appointee can potentially serve indefinitely (though still removable by the President), if the President declines to nominate a U.S. Attorney for a vacancy, or the Senate either fails to act on a Presidential nomination, or rejects a nominee that is different than the interim appointee.

On June 14, 2007, President Bush signed a bill into law that re-instated the 120-day term limit on interim attorneys appointed by the Attorney General.<ref name="Help Wanted"/>
