'''Corruption Eradication Commission''' ({{lang-id|Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi}}), abbreviated as '''KPK''', is a [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] government agency established to fight [[political corruption|corruption]]. Firli Bahuri, an active police general, is the current chairman of KPK<ref name=JP312>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/12/03/house-s-kpk-picks-politically-motivated.html |title=House’s KPK picks 'politically motivated' |date=3 December 2011 |work=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/24/100-days-of-blunders-watchdog-slams-new-kpk-chairmans-performance.html|title=100 days of blunders: Watchdog slams new KPK chairman's performance|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=25 March 2020|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 2013, the agency won the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]].

==History==
===Background===
Anti-corruption efforts began in Indonesia in the 1950s. Following strong criticism of corruption at the beginning of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime in the late 1960s a ''Commission of Four'' was appointed by president [[Soeharto]] in 1970.<ref>J. A. C. Mackie, 'The report of the Commission of Four on corruption', ''Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies'', 6 (3), 1970, pp. 87-101.</ref> The report of the commission noted that corruption was "rampant" but none of the cases it said were in need of urgent action were followed up. Laws were only passed in 1999 giving the [[Indonesian National Police|Police]] and [[Attorney General of Indonesia|prosecution service]] the authority to investigate corruption cases.

===Establishment===
Law No.30/2002 on the Corruption Eradication Commission was passed in 2002 providing a legal basis for the establishment of the KPK.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.icac.org.hk/newsl/issue22eng/button3.htm|title= KPK: The Corruption Eradication Commission of Indonesia|publisher= Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s|last= Schawrz|first= Adam|year= 1994|publisher= Allen & Unwin|location= Australia|isbn= 1-86373-635-2|pages= [https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/137 137–138]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/137}}</ref> Since then, the Commission has engaged in significant work revealing and prosecuting cases of corruption in crucial government bodies reaching as high as the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia|Supreme Court]].<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/02/kpk-resumes-battle-against-judicial-mafia-courts.html KPK resumes battle against judicial mafia in courts], Jakarta Post. 2 July 2016. Accessed 27 November 2016.</ref>

==Duties==
The KPK vision is to free Indonesia from corruption. Its duties include investigating and prosecuting corruption cases and monitoring the governance of the state. It has the authority to request meetings and reports in the course of its investigations. It can also authorize wiretaps, impose travel bans, request financial information about suspects, freeze financial transactions and request the assistance of other law enforcement agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/edito/content.php?id=15|title=Vision and Mission|work=KPK website|accessdate=17 November 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016073222/http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/edito/content.php?id=15|archive-date=16 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/wmpdownloads/files/KPK_Annual_Report_2008.pdf|title=Corruption Eradication Commission 2008 Annual Report|publisher=KPK|accessdate=17 November 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122152020/http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/wmpdownloads/files/KPK_Annual_Report_2008.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  It also has the authority to detain suspects, including well-known figures, and frequently does so.

==Achievements==
[[File:Johan Budi.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Johan Budi, the former spokesman of the Commission]]
The work of the KPK is a source of continuing controversy in Indonesia. The commission is careful, but sometimes quite aggressive, in pursuing high-profile cases.  For example, in reporting on the activities of the KPK, one foreign observer noted that the commission has "confronted head-on the endemic corruption that remains as a legacy of President Suharto’s 32-year-long kleptocracy. Since it started operating in late 2003, the commission has investigated, prosecuted and achieved a 100-percent conviction rate in 86 cases of bribery and graft related to government procurements and budgets."<ref>Norimitsu Onishi, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/world/asia/26indo.html?pagewanted=all Corruption Fighters Rouse Resistance in Indonesia]", ''New York Times'', 25 July 2009.</ref> To display once more its resolve to crack down on graft suspects, the KPK named on 7 December 2012, both brothers of Indonesian [[socialite]] [[Rizal Mallarangeng]], Indonesia's Sports Minister [[:id:Andi Mallarangeng|Andi Mallarangeng]] and [[Fox Indonesia]] consultant Choel Mallarangeng suspects in a multimillion-dollar corruption case, in the latest scandal to hit the President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]'s ruling party ahead of [[2014 Indonesian presidential election|Indonesia's 2014 Presidential election]]. Mallarangeng is the first minister to resign on graft allegations since the KPK began operating in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indonesian Minister Andi Mallarangeng resigns over graft charges|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20638970|accessdate=5 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News Asia|date=7 December 2012|agency=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Indonesia's sports minister resigns amid graft probe|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/indonesias-sports-minister-resigns-amid-graft-probe-20121207|accessdate=5 January 2013|newspaper=Straits Times|date=7 December 2012|agency=AFP}}</ref>

KPK public education division official Budiono Prakoso said in December 2008 that because of its limited manpower and resources, of some 16,200 cases reported to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), only a small number had been dealt with.<ref name="TheJakartaPost">{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/03/kpk-backlog-reaches-more-16000-cases.html |title=KPK backlog reaches more than 16,000 cases |first=Ni Komang |last=Erviani |date=3 December 2008 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post}}</ref> A large number of the solid reports informed the KPK of alleged cases of corruption and misuse of budget funds by government agencies at national and regional levels. "The main problem is the political will of the government at regional and national levels. Political will remains low. Everything is still at a lip-service level," he said.

NGO activists often urge the KPK to be more aggressive in its work.  For example, Bali Corruption Watch (BCW) head Putu Wirata Dwikora asked the KPK to investigate corruption cases in Bali. He lamented the commission's practice of handing over corruption cases in Bali to the local prosecutors office for further investigation. "The KPK should be directly involved in investigations to create a deterrent effect," Putu said.<ref name="TheJakartaPost"/>

On the other hand, the success of the KPK in using controversial tools like warrantless wiretaps, and its focus on high-level targets like "businessmen, bureaucrats, bankers, governors, diplomats, lawmakers, prosecutors, police officials and other previously untouchable members of Indonesian society", has led to something of a backlash. There have been reported attempts to undermine the Commission in [[People's Consultative Assembly|Parliament]].<ref>Onishi, "Corruption Fighters Rouse Resistance in Indonesia."</ref>

==Tensions between the government and KPK==
During its course, KPK often sees a number of controversial efforts by [[People's Representative Council]] and other government institutions to weaken or disrupt the work of KPK. Leaders and prominent of figures of KPK have been repeatedly arrested for a disputable criminal case or receiving personal attacks.

===KPK and the police===
In the view of many Indonesian observers, the "gecko vs crocodile" dispute illustrated the tensions said to exist between the KPK and the [[Indonesian National Police]]. Some high-profile investigations carried out by the KPK have focused on allegations of corruption at senior levels of the police force. This approach is reported to have led to widespread resentment within the police force towards the work of the KPK.<ref>Muradi, 'Police versus KPK: A new chapter of rivalry?', ''The Jakarta Post'', 9 December 2012.</ref> Sharp tensions surfaced in early December 2012 when the KPK took the highly controversial step of detaining Inspector General Djoko Susilo, a senior and active police general, on charges of corruption.<ref>Rabby Pramudatama, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/04/kpk-locks-police-general.html KPK locks up police general'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 4 December 2012.</ref>  A few days later, president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono expressed public concern about the tensions between the KPK and the national police.<ref>Margareth S. Aritonang and Bagus BT Saragih, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/07/sby-concerned-over-unsettled-kpk-police-quandary.html SBY 'concerned' over unsettled KPK-Police quandary'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 7 December 2012.</ref>

==="Gecko vs crocodile" dispute===
[[File:Corruption Eradication Commission rally.jpg|thumb|Rally in support of the KPK. Slogan translates as "Killing the KPK = killing this nation".]]
In April 2009, angry that the KPK had tapped his phone while investigating a corruption case, Indonesian Police chief detective [[Susno Duadji]] compared the KPK to a gecko ({{lang-id|cicak}}) fighting a crocodile ({{lang-id|buaya}}), the [[Indonesian National Police|police]]. Susno's comment, as it turned out, quickly backfired because the image of a ''cicak'' standing up to a ''buaya'' (similar to [[David and Goliath]] imagery) immediately had wide appeal in Indonesia. A noisy popular movement in support of the ''cicak'' quickly emerged.  Students staged pro-''cicak'' demonstrations, many newspapers ran cartoons with ''cicaks'' lining up against an ugly ''buaya'', and numerous TV talk shows took up the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' topic with enthusiasm. As a result, references to ''cicaks'' fighting a ''buaya'' have become a well-known part of the political imagery of Indonesia.<ref>Antagonism between the KPK and the police, with memories of the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' clash, remained deeply embedded in the relationship between the KPK and the police after the clash. See, for example, references to the clash in 2012 in Ina Parlina, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/18/doubts-over-kpk-inquiry-police-bank-accounts.html Doubts over KPK inquiry into police bank accounts'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 May 2012.</ref>

In September two KPK deputy chairmen [[Chandra Hamzah]] and [[Bibit Samad Rianto]], who had been suspended in July, were arrested on charges of extortion and bribery. The two men denied the charges, saying they were being framed to weaken the KPK. There were demonstrations in several cities in support of the men and a support campaign on the [[Facebook]] social networking site gathered one million members. On 2 November 2009 president [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] established a team to look into the allegations. The following day, during a hearing at the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Indonesian Constitutional Court]], dramatic tapes were played of bugged phone conversations apparently revealing a conspiracy to undermine the KPK. The names of businessman Susno Duadji as well as Deputy Attorney General Abdul Hakim Ritonga and a businessman, Anggodo Widjojo, were mentioned in the tapes.  Bibit and Chandra were released later the same day.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14816720|title= The gecko bites back|date= 5 November 2009|work= [[The Economist]]|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/200910/2728708.htm?desktop|title= SBY vows to defends Indonesia's anti-graft agency

The team established by the president, the "Team of Eight", presented its recommendations on 17 November 2009. These included a halt to the prosecution of Bibit and Chandra, punishment for officials guilty of wrongdoing and the establishment of a state commission to implement institutional reforms of law enforcement agencies. The president said he would respond within the week.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/18/team-reports-steamroller-plows.html|title= Team reports, steamroller plows on|author= Erwida Maulia and Dicky Christanto|date= 18 November 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref>

On 23 November 2009 the president made a speech responding to the Team of Eight's findings. He said that it would be better if the Bibit-Chandra case were settled out of court but did not call for the case to be dropped. He also said there was a need for reforms within the Indonesian National Police, the Attorney General's office and the KPK. His speech caused confusion among Team of Eight members and provoked a protest from activists who symbolically threw in their towels as a way of criticising what they judged to be the president's unconvincing response. On 3 December 2009, the president was officially informed that charges against Bibit and Chandra had been dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/24/a-better-solution-don%E2%80%99t-take-case-court-says-sby.html|title= A better solution: Don’t take the case to court, says SBY|author= Erwida Maulia|date= 24 November 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate= 6 December 2009|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091128230907/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/24/a-better-solution-don%E2%80%99t-take-case-court-says-sby.html|archive-date= 28 November 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/yudhoyono-calls-for-reform-of-indonesias-police-and-ago/343393|title= Yudhoyono Calls for Reform of Indonesia's Police and AGO|author= Kinanti Pinta Karana|date= 23 November 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Globe]]|accessdate= 6 December 2009|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091127115953/http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/yudhoyono-calls-for-reform-of-indonesias-police-and-ago/343393|archive-date= 27 November 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/president-ready-to-issue-a-decree-reinstating-chandra-and-bibit-to-kpk/345660|title= President Ready to Issue a Decree Reinstating Chandra and Bibit to KPK|author= Heru Andriyanto & April Aswadi|date= 5 December 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Globe]]|accessdate= 6 December 2009|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717012547/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/president-ready-to-issue-a-decree-reinstating-chandra-and-bibit-to-kpk/345660|archive-date= 17 July 2011|df= dmy-all}}</ref>
===Trial of Antasari Azhar===

===Arrest of Bambang Widjojanto===
The arrest of KPK deputy chairman [[Bambang Widjojanto]] by [[Indonesian Police]] on 23 January 2015 revived the "gecko vs crocodile" dispute. The arrest was made after the commission declared the [[People's Representative Council|parliament]]-approved candidate for the chief of Indonesian Police [[Budi Gunawan]] a suspect in a gratification case on 14 February, just days before his scheduled inauguration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2015/01/23/cicak-versus-buaya-jilid-ii-dimulai-i|title= Cicak vs Buaya Jilid II Dimulai|author= Reza Gunadha|date= 23 January 2015|work= Tribunnews|accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref> The Indonesian public saw the arrest as an attack against KPK, and there was immediate support for the KPK.

===Revision of the KPK Law===
{{Further|September 2019 Indonesian protests and riots}}

On 17 September 2019, the People's Representative Council passed a  bill revising Law No.30/2002, which triggered a backlash by people taking the view that the revised bill would weaken the ability of the KPK to operate and perform investigations into corruption cases.<ref name=revisi2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/09/17/breaking-kpk-bill-passed-into-law.html |title=BREAKING: KPK bill passed into law |work=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=18 September 2019 |first=Ghina |last=Ghaliya |date=17 September 2019}}</ref> The revised bill was deliberated and passed in only 12 days in the House.

==Resources==

Resources provided to the KPK have expanded in recent years.  However, the work of the commission is still restricted by limited budgets and a small number of total staff.
