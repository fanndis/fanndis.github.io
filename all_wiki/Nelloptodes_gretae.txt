==Description==
The beetle is pale yellow and gold, and measures 0.79 millimetres long. It has no eyes or wings, and is distinguishable by a small pit found between where the eyes should go. Usually found in the leaf litter and soil, they feed on fungal hyphae and spores.<ref name=NHM/>

==Distribution==
The newly described species was described from material originally collected in [[Kenya]] sometime between 1964 and 1965 by entomologist William C. Brock, who took samples of soil from around East Africa which were stored in the Museum's collections. This species is one of nine within the newly erected genus ''Nelloptodes'' from these samples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2019/october/new-species-named-after-climate-activist-greta-thunberg.html|title=New species named after climate activist Greta Thunberg|last=|first=|date=25 October 2019|website=Natural History Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 October 2019}}</ref>
