Later that same year, he starred in ''[[Prelude to a Kiss (film)|Prelude to a Kiss]]'' with [[Meg Ryan]], which was based on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play. The film received a lukewarm reception by critics and grossed only $22&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1992/0PTAK.php|title=Prelude to a Kiss|publisher=The-numbers.com|accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> He appeared with Basinger again in ''[[The Getaway (1994 film)|The Getaway]]'', a 1994 remake of the 1972 [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] [[The Getaway (1972 film)|film of the same name]].

===Marriages===
====Kim Basinger====

In May 1990, Baldwin met actress [[Kim Basinger]] when they played lovers in the film ''[[The Marrying Man]]''.<ref name="people2001" /> They married on August 19, 1993<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682260/alec-baldwin-engaged-yoga-instructor-hilaria-thomas.jhtml|title=Alec Baldwin Engaged To Yoga Instructor|first=Gil |last=Kaufman|date=April 2, 2012|publisher=MTV|accessdate=April 14, 2012}}</ref> and had a daughter, [[Ireland Baldwin|Ireland]] (born October 23, 1995).<ref name="EWbirth">{{cite news|date=November 3, 1995|title=Monitor|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/article/1995/11/03/monitor-453/}}</ref> They separated on December 5, 2000<ref name="people2001">{{cite news|date=January 29, 2001|title=Too Hot to Handle|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url=https://people.com/archive/too-hot-to-handle-vol-55-no-4/}}</ref> and divorced on September 3, 2002.<ref>https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/baldwin-and-basinger-square-up-for-custody-battle-129277.html</ref>

Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case "opportunists", and has characterized Basinger's psychologists as part of the "divorce industry". He has faulted them more than Basinger, and writes, "In fact, I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired. She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever."<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 215–216.</ref> Baldwin wrote that he spent over a million dollars,<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 202–03.</ref> has had to put time aside from his career,<ref>Baldwin 2008. p. 99, 102.</ref> has had to travel extensively,<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 41, 45, 151–53.</ref> and needed to find a house in California (he lived in New York),<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 44, 47, 117.</ref> so that he could stay in his daughter's life.<ref name="Baldwin 2008"/>

Baldwin contended that after seven years of these issues, he hit a breaking point, and on April 11, 2007, left an angry voicemail message in response to another unanswered arranged call, in which Baldwin called his 11-year-old daughter a "rude, thoughtless little pig".<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 173–184.</ref> He contends that the tape was sold to [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] which released the recording, despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 178–179.</ref> Baldwin admitted that he made a mistake, but asked not to be judged as a parent based on a bad moment.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 101, 151.</ref> He later admitted to ''[[Playboy]]'' in June 2009 that he contemplated suicide over the voicemail that leaked to the public. Of the incident, he said, "I spoke to a lot of professionals, who helped me. If I committed suicide, [Kim Basinger] would have considered that a victory. Destroying me was their avowed goal."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Alec-Baldwin-Suicide-1006923.aspx |title=Alec Baldwin Says He Considered Suicide Over 'Rude Pig' Voicemail |work=TV Guide |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFXhnbN6?url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Alec-Baldwin-Suicide-1006923.aspx |archive-date=November 15, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

===1995 photographer incident===
In October 1995, Baldwin allegedly assaulted a photographer for videotaping his wife, Kim Basinger and their three day old daughter. The couple was returning from the hospital and was confronted by the photographer outside their Los Angeles home. [[Whoopi Goldberg]] praised Baldwin for his actions during her opening monologue while hosting the [[68th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-27/local/me-61811_1_alec-baldwin|title=Alec Baldwin Arrested in Battery on Photographer|date=October 27, 1995 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=March 27, 2014|first=Nicholas|last=Riccardi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/special/l96os054.htm|title=Sassy Whoopi takes charge|date=March 26, 1996 |work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

===Runway incident===
In December 2011, Baldwin was on an [[American Airlines]] flight at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], playing ''[[Words with Friends]]'' on his phone while waiting for takeoff. When instructed to put away the "electronic device" by the flight attendant, he reportedly became belligerent and was eventually removed from the plane. He later publicly apologized to the passengers who were delayed.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/alec_baldwin_thrown_off_flight_at_ikgro0tlAWEveH4IMoa4YK "Alec Baldwin thrown off AA flight at LAX for 'playing game' on phone"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827001837/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/alec_baldwin_thrown_off_flight_at_ikgro0tlAWEveH4IMoa4YK |date=August 27, 2013 }}. ''New York Post''.</ref>

A 2012 commercial for Capital One credit cards, for which Baldwin was a spokesperson, made a humorous reference to the event: a [[Viking]] character from the ad series asks about the phone Baldwin is using, to which Baldwin facetiously replies that it is not to be used on the runway, ending with a chiding "No!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7VAh/capital-one-battle-speech-featuring-alec-baldwin|title=Capital One TV Spot, 'Battle Speech' Featuring Alec Baldwin|publisher=iSpot.tv|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> A [[2012 Super Bowl]] commercial for [[Best Buy]] also humorously referenced the event. In the commercial, ''Words With Friends'' co-creators [[Paul Bettner]] and David Bettner are on a plane, and are interrupted by a flight attendant who loudly clears her throat to indicate to them to put their phones away.<ref>[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-buy-super-bowl-commercial-tech-inventors_n_1255351 "Best Buy Super Bowl Commercial: Ad Stars Tech Inventors (VIDEO)"].

Baldwin also spoofed the incident during a cameo appearance on ''Saturday Night Live''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "[[Weekend Update]]" segment, in which he played himself impersonating the captain of the plane from which he was removed, who publicly "apologized" to Baldwin for the incident.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dillon|first1=Nancy|last2=Mikelberg|first2=Amanda|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/alec-baldwin-surprise-appearance-saturday-night-live-spoof-american-airlines-tantrum-article-1.989943|title=Alec Baldwin makes surprise appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' to spoof American Airlines tantrum |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=December 11, 2011|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNH2tOuuZvA "Alec Baldwin Mocks American Airline Incident on 'Saturday Night Live'"].

===Victim of stalking===
On April 8, 2012, a 40-year-old Canadian actress, Genevieve Sabourin, was arrested outside Baldwin and his wife's [[Greenwich Village]] apartment house and charged with aggravated harassment and stalking. She was released without bail and told not to contact Baldwin. Prosecutors said she and Baldwin had met on a film set more than ten years earlier, and that, beginning in 2011, she began sending him multiple unwanted emails and texts.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-canadian-actress-genevieve-sabourin-stalked-alec-baldwin-article-1.1058561 |title=Alec Baldwin stalked by Canadian actress Genevieve Sabourin in New York City, Hamptons: cops | first1= Rocco |last1= Parascandola | first2=Christina | last2=Boyle| first3=Tracy|last3=Connor |location=New York|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date= April 9, 2012 | accessdate= May 13, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2009, Baldwin spoke out to encourage state leaders to renew New York's [[Movie production incentives in the United States|tax break for the film and television industry]], stating that if the "tax breaks are not reinstated into the budget, film production in this town is going to collapse and television production is going to collapse and it's all going to go to California".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/archives/nyc/all-boroughs/2009/02/26/alec-baldwin-calls-on-governor-to-extend-tax-credit-NYC_94633.old.html|title=Alec Baldwin Calls on Governor To Extend Tax Credit|publisher=[[NY1]]|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117222539/http://www.ny1.com/archives/nyc/all-boroughs/2009/02/26/alec-baldwin-calls-on-governor-to-extend-tax-credit-NYC_94633.old.html|archive-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

During the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]], Baldwin was slated to appear in a taped skit. However, the producers of the show cut a portion of the skit containing a reference to [[Rupert Murdoch]] and the [[News International phone hacking scandal]]. Baldwin subsequently boycotted the [[Emmy Award]]s and requested that his entire appearance be removed from the broadcast. Producers complied and he was replaced with [[Leonard Nimoy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Baldwin out of Emmys after hacking joke nixed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/sep/19/alec-baldwin-emmys-phone-hacking|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=UK|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}</ref>

Despite demonstrating strong political beliefs throughout his career, in October 2013, Baldwin announced that he would not donate money to political candidates while hosting his talk show ''[[Up Late with Alec Baldwin]]'' on [[MSNBC]], in accordance with the company's policy.<ref>{{cite news | last = Mirkinson | first = Jack | title = Alec Baldwin Will Not Donate To Political Candidates While at MSNBC | work = HuffPost | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/25/alec-baldwin-donations-msnbc_n_4163346.html | date = October 25, 2013 | accessdate = November 2, 2013}}</ref>
