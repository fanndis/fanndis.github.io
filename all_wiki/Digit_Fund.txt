The '''Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International''' (originally the '''Digit Fund''') is a charity for the protection of endangered [[mountain gorillas]]. The Digit Fund was created by [[Dian Fossey|Dr. Dian Fossey]] in 1978 for the sole purpose of financing her anti-poaching patrols and preventing further [[poaching]] of the mountain gorillas. Fossey studied at her [[Karisoke Research Center]] in the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] of [[Rwanda]]. The non-profit fund was named in memory of Fossey's favourite [[gorilla]], Digit, who was decapitated by poachers for the offer of [[US$]]20 by a [[Hutu]] merchant who specialized in selling gorilla heads as trophies and gorilla hands as [[ashtray]]s to tourists.<ref name="Mowat165">{{cite book |title= [[Woman In the Mists]]|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= 165|pages= |url= }}</ref>

==Background==
Sometime during the day on [[New Year's Eve]] 1977, Fossey's favourite gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking [[antelope]] traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defense and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/5|title=Dian Fossey text - P5|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for an ashtray, for the price of $20. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant Ian Redmond, Fossey's group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/6|title=Dian Fossey text - P6|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref>

Fossey subsequently created the Digit Fund to raise money for anti-poaching patrols.<ref name="fossey">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref> It was renamed as the "Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International" in 1992.<ref name="Mowat187">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= [https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/187 187]|pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref>

Fossey mostly opposed the efforts of the international organizations, which she felt inefficiently directed their funds towards more equipment for Rwandan park officials, some of whom were alleged to have ordered some of the gorilla poachings in the first place.<ref name="Mowat187"/> Digit's death had a profound effect on her approach to conservationism, and she commented that "I have tried not to allow myself to think of Digit's anguish, pain and the total comprehension he must have suffered in knowing what humans were doing to him. From that moment on, I came to live within an insulated part of myself."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigwavetv.com/programs/dian_fossey.html |title=The Real Dian Fossey |publisher=Big Wave TV |accessdate=2009-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422163838/http://www.bigwavetv.com/programs/dian_fossey.html |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}</ref>

==Financing==
Busy with her research in Africa, Fossey enlisted the help of her friends, primatologist [[Richard Wrangham]] and TV presenter [[David Attenborough]], who approached conservation organizations located in the UK including the Fauna Preservation Society (FPS) and the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], which declined Fossey's request in favor of supporting an approach emphasizing tourism to Rwanda.<ref name="Mowat173">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/172 172–3] |url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref> At Wrangham's request, FPS launched an appeal in response to Digit's death, which the group subsequently named the Mountain Gorilla Fund for better name recognition; FPS chose to direct the funds to Rwandan park officials rather than Fossey's on-the-ground efforts.<ref name="Mowat173"/> Fossey became frustrated as many international donors contributed funds in memory of Digit that were directed by international conservation organizations towards the construction of roads or the purchase of new vehicles for park conservation officials, who in many cases were bribed by poachers to look the other way from illegal activities and, according to Fossey, rarely ventured into the park at all.<ref name="Mowat173"/> When payments for Fossey's articles on Digit's death were accidentally directed to the FPS Mountain Gorilla Fund rather than to her, FPS declined to redirect the money towards Fossey or her initiative.<ref name="Mowat173"/> To coordinate donations to Rwandan authorities, FPS enlisted Fossey's former student and apprentice and one of her chief detractors, Sandy Harcourt.<ref name="Mowat174">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/174 174] |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref>

On her first trip to the United States after the poachings of Group 4, Fossey enlisted the aid of the [[National Geographic Society]], which pledged $5,000, as did the [[World Wildlife Fund]], over the objections of some of its members who had heard rumors of Fossey's anti-poaching patrols and other tactics she used against poaching.<ref name="Mowat200">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= |pages= [https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/200 200–1]|url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref> Fossey asked her friend [[Robinson McIlvaine]], the head of the nonprofit [[African Wildlife Leadership Foundation]], to serve as secretary-treasurer of the Digit Fund until she could find a salaried executive director to assume control over the operations. McIlvaine partnered with the [[International Primate Protection League]], the Digit Fund, and his own African Wildlife Leadership Foundation asking for funds, to be made out to the AWLF.<ref name="Mowat202">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/202 202–3] |url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref> The Digit Fund received none of the money, and McIlvaine suggested to Fossey that the Digit Fund could be folded into AWLF, which Fossey declined; McIlvaine resigned as secretary-treasurer of the Digit Fund.<ref name="Mowat202"/>

Dr. Shirley McGreal, head of the IPPL, had allowed IPPL's co-sponsorship of the letter only to help the Digit Fund and blames the misunderstanding on Fossey being taken advantage of in the wake of her gorillas' deaths and never viewing the gorillas' deaths as a way for her to personally profit.<ref name="Mowat202"/> McGreal volunteered to serve as secretary-treasurer in the wake of McIlvaine's resignation from the post.<ref name="Mowat251">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/251 251] |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref> Through the seeming partnership of AWLF/Digit Fund, funds contributed to the Digit Fund by philanthropist Gordon Hanes and by students under the supervision of primatologist Geza Teleki came under the auspices of AWLF, not the Digit Fund.<ref name="Mowat212">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= |pages= [https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/211 211–213]|url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref> The US ambassador to Rwanda submitted a proposal in 1980 for Karisoke Research Center to be removed from Fossey's control and placed under a mountain gorilla consortium led by AWLF while Fossey was in America finishing her book.<ref name="Mowat212"/>

While she had lost control of funds raised in Britain after Digit's death to the Fauna Preservation Society, Fossey managed to keep the control of the Digit Fund in the United States until her death. After Fossey was murdered, the Digit Fund in the USA was renamed "The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International", and the Digit Fund in the UK was renamed the "Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund Europe" and later "[http://www.gorillas.org The Gorilla Organization]".

==Activities==
Through the Digit Fund, Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps among the mountains of Virunga. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name="Mowat223">{{cite book |title= Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= [https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa/page/223 223]|pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/womaninmists00mowa|url-access= registration}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not catch any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name="Mowat223"/>

The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International continues to operate the Karisoke Research Center, which Fossey founded in 1967, with daily gorilla monitoring and patrols.
