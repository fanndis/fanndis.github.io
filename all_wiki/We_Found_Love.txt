The lyrical content of the song is sparse and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting the song's [[Hook (music)|hook]] line,<ref name="about"/> "We found love in a hopeless place".<ref name="Gamboa1">{{cite news|last=Gamboa|first=Glen|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/backstage-pass-1.811987/hear-rihanna-s-new-single-we-found-love-1.3191996|title=Hear Rihanna's new single 'We Found Love'|work=[[Newsday]]|publisher=Terry Jimenez|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007185850/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/backstage-pass-1.811987/hear-rihanna-s-new-single-we-found-love-1.3191996|archive-date=2011-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref> Jody Rosen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "half-baked romantic".<ref name="rollingstone"/>  Rihanna starts the song in a falsetto airy voice as she sings, "Yellow diamonds in the light / And we’re standing side by side / As your shadow crosses mine / What it takes to come alive."<ref name="rapp"/><ref name="GlobalGrind1"/> Michael Cragg commented that the first chorus is almost being sidelined in favor of a large chunk of Harris's riff, before they join on the second chorus.<ref name="Cragg1"/> The hook repeatedly rings throughout the song.<ref name="GlobalGrind1"/>

==Critical reception==
The song received polarizing reviews from music critics. Amanda Dobbins of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine praised the composition of the song, writing "Harris's electro fingerprints are all over this one — it plays like a straight house track, with some dreamy Rihanna vocals added in over the beat."<ref name="Dobbins1">{{cite news|last=Dobbins|first=Amanda|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/09/rihanna_we_found_love.html|title=Rihanna Found Love at a Disappointing Rave|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media, LLC|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924194413/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/09/rihanna_we_found_love.html|archive-date=2011-09-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Robbie Daw of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] commented on the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line "We found love in a hopeless place", writing that it is possibly the best lyric in pop music so far in 2011.<ref name="Daw1">{{cite web|last=Daw|first=Robbie|url=http://idolator.com/6022082/rihanna-calvin-harris-we-found-love-review-revue|title=Rihanna & Calvin Harris "We Found Love": Review Revue|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312050352/http://www.idolator.com/6022082/rihanna-calvin-harris-we-found-love-review-revue|archive-date=2016-03-12|url-status=live}}</ref> A reviewer for ''[[Instinct (magazine)|Instinct]]'' magazine praised the song, writing that "We Found Love" does not mark a departure from the dance-floor oriented material Rihanna debuted on ''Loud'', but it certainly boasts "a higher-energy, peak-hour vibe".<ref name="Instinct1">{{cite news|url=http://instinctmagazine.com/blogs/blog/heart-it-or-hate-it-listen-to-new-rihanna-we-found-love-with-calvin-harris?directory=100011|title=Heart It Or Hate It: Listen To New Rihanna – "We Found Love" (With Calvin Harris)|work=[[Instinct (magazine)|Instinct]]|publisher=JR Pratts|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928222034/http://instinctmagazine.com/blogs/blog/heart-it-or-hate-it-listen-to-new-rihanna-we-found-love-with-calvin-harris?directory=100011|archive-date=2011-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> Similarly, Michael Cragg of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the song takes the dance direction Rihanna hinted at on "Only Girl (In the World)" and continues releasing similar songs, making reference to "We Found Love".<ref name="Cragg1"/> Cragg also likened the song to [[Leona Lewis]]'s recent single, "[[Collide (Leona Lewis song)|Collide]]", but criticized the song's structure, writing "[it] is slightly odd".<ref name="Cragg1"/> He ended his review writing, "Either way, she could have recited [[Nick Clegg]]'s conference speech from Wednesday over the sound of Harris cracking his knuckles and it would be a hit."<ref name="Cragg1"/>

Priya Elan of ''NME'' commented, "By now it's pretty customary to have a jaw-on-the-floor reaction to the first single from a Rihanna album. 'Pon De Replay', 'SOS', 'Umbrella', 'Russian Roulette', 'Only Girl In The World'."<ref name="Priya Elan"/> Despite complimenting Rihanna for sounding extremely relaxed and calling her vocal as "luxurious calling to mind the atmosphere", Elan concluded that the over-all effect is underwhelming.<ref name="Priya Elan"/> She continued by writing that instead of re-inventing the pop wheel, "We Found Love" has "a whiff of treading-water about it" and that "if there is a 'goosebump' moment to be had it comes after many multiple plays and, dare we say it, a glass of something strong."<ref name="Priya Elan">{{cite news|last=Elan|first=Priya|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/12332|title=Rihanna, 'We Found Love' – Review|work=[[NME]]|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926050227/http://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/12332|archive-date=2011-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref> Awarding "We Found Love" two stars out of five, Jody Rosen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was critical, writing that it "is much ado about very little indeed" and that is "an insipid tune".

A reviewer for GlobalGrind commented on the song's lyrics, suggesting that there is perhaps an underlying message in the song for ex-boyfriend [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]], in the line "We found love in a hopeless place".<ref name="GlobalGrind1">{{cite web|url=http://globalgrind.com/music/rihanna-calvin-harris-we-found-love-new-music|title=Rihanna & Calvin Harris "We Found Love" (New Music)|publisher=GlobalGrind|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321041910/http://globalgrind.com/music/rihanna-calvin-harris-we-found-love-new-music|archive-date=2012-03-21|url-status=live}}</ref> This further raised suspicion when Brown re-tweeted one of Rihanna's posts on [[Twitter]], which read "Sometimes it feels like we find love in the most hopeless place".<ref name="GlobalGrind1"/><ref name="MTVUK1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/chris-brown/333311-chris-brown-rihanna-twitter-we-found-love|title=Chris Brown Retweets Rihanna 'Love' Lyric|publisher=MTV|date=2011-09-24|accessdate=2011-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013075139/http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/chris-brown/333311-chris-brown-rihanna-twitter-we-found-love|archive-date=2013-10-13|url-status=live}}</ref> Jessica Herndon of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine praised the song, saying that "'We Found Love' had an amazing influence on people all across the world in 2012, becoming one of the most popular and most successful songs".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jessica|first=Herndon|date=February 14, 2011|title=Rihanna's 'We Found Love': The influence of the song in 2011/2012|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=123|issue=2|page=45|id=15|issn=0093-7673|oclc=5454756}}</ref>

[[Pitchfork Media]] commented, "Over a frantic, Calvin Harris-produced, [[David Guetta|Guetta]]-meets-'[[Sandstorm (Darude composition)|Sandstorm]]' beat on her sixth record's lead-off single, Rihanna repeats these words almost 20 times. 'We Found Love' ranks among Ri's best singles because it recognizes that there's not much more that needs to be said: in three and a half minutes, the line moves from being a great pop lyric to a triumphant mantra to something suggestive of a whole spectrum of unspoken emotion. The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this secret."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16072-rihanna-talk-that-talk/ |title=Rihanna: Talk That Talk &#124; Album Reviews |work=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2013-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112173718/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16072-rihanna-talk-that-talk/ |archive-date=2013-11-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Allmusic]] chose the song as a highlight on ''Talk That Talk'', and wrote about the "singer's ecstatic vocal than Calvin Harris' shrill, plinky production".<ref name="am">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/talk-that-talk-r2318208/review|title=Talk That Talk&nbsp;– Rihanna|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

===Recognition and awards===
MTV chose "We Found Love" as the third best song of 2011, and "Video of the Year" at the MTV Video Music Awards 2012. The writers of the website further commented, "The leadoff single from ''Talk That Talk'' is where Rihanna fully embraced EDM. Produced by Calvin Harris, 'We Found Love' is a swirling party track about love and loss, the rare song that manages to be sad and joyous all at once. And it is a pinnacle of the pop/dance crossover, a throwback to '90s raves that could make even the most stoic lover of pop want to break out a glow stick and just dance.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Jason |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1676017/rihanna-we-found-love-best-songs-2011.jhtml |title=Rihanna's 'We Found Love' Is MTV's #3 Song Of 2011 - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=2011-12-14 |accessdate=2013-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419182325/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1676017/rihanna-we-found-love-best-songs-2011.jhtml |archive-date=2013-04-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' put "We Found Love" at number eleven on his list of Top 25 Songs of 2011 commenting, "While her other hits tried to camouflage her spindly voice, here it just strains for that spindly melody."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/pop-life/the-top-25-songs-of-2011-20111221|title=The Top 25 Songs of 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=2011-12-21|accessdate=2012-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016175021/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/pop-life/the-top-25-songs-of-2011-20111221|archive-date=2012-10-16|url-status=live}}</ref> It was named the third biggest love song of all time by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/1538839/top-50-love-songs-of-all-time?list_page=4 |title=Top 50 'Love' Songs of All Time |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=2013-02-13 |accessdate=2013-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928050717/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/1538839/top-50-love-songs-of-all-time?list_page=4 |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The two are shown as completely enamored with each other while engaging in fun activities together, including enjoying their time at an indoor skating centre and eating in fast food restaurants. During the chorus, the video shows the romance to be somewhat warped, as images of [[Illegal drug trade|drugs]], various pills and dilated pupils are shown, while brief scenes of Rihanna and her boyfriend preparing to engage in sexual intercourse and their various stages of undress are shown. The chorus continues and the video abruptly cuts to Rihanna and other people at an outdoor [[rave]], dancing to music. Calvin Harris features as the [[Disc jockey|DJ]] during this scene.

From the second verse, Rihanna and her boyfriend are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing each other in a shopping cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a [[Pontiac Trans Am]] outside with her boyfriend who begins to [[doughnut (driving)|recklessly drive in circles]], resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is [[Domestic violence|domestically violent]] towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.<ref name="CoSReview">{{cite magazine|last=Coplan|first=Chris|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/10/video-rihanna-feat-calvin-harris-we-found-love/|title=Video: Rihanna feat.

In November 2011, [[R3hab]] released a remix of "We Found Love" with a "Halloween" sound. He explained "I made two versions ... one version is more melodic and euphoric. This [first] one is more dark because the lyrics [to] 'We Found Love' can also be seen as something dark. 'We are at the end of the world/ And I still found love.' So from there came the more darker chord progression and the more darker atmosphere, like Dracula is coming to get you.
