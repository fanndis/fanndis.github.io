On this period of his life, J Balvin notes, "When I would go to the barrio, people saw me as a rich person, but when I’m around rich people they see me as someone from the ghetto.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===

Critics have contrasted J Balvin's musical style from the first internationally popular wave of reggaeton led by Daddy Yankee. Marlon Bishop of ''The Fader'' described his vocal delivery as a "gentle drawl", differing greatly from the rapid-fire, aggressive delivery of earlier reggaeton acts.<ref name=fader/> He generally sings over his beats as opposed to rapping, and favors a more melodic, pop-influenced style.<ref name=hotagain>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/11/23/j-balvin-reggaeton-interview |title=How J Balvin Made Reggaeton Hot Again |last=Bishop |first=Marlon |work=The Fader |date=November 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 30, 2018}}</ref> Describing his music's production, Bishop writes, "Instead of the hard-edged, maximalist beats of the first wave, Balvin’s tracks are moody and spaced out".<ref name=fader/>  He frequently works with Medellin-based writer/producers Alejandro "Sky" Ramirez and Carlo Alejandro "Mosty" Patiño, whom he often name-drops in his songs.<ref name=medellinexports>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7693380/medellin-latin-stars-maluma-j-balvin |title=Medellin's Musical Exports: Maluma, J Balvin & More Stars the Colombian City Spawned |last=Cobo |first=Leila |date=February 16, 2017 |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref> He has been credited with popularizing a new style of reggaeton based in Medellin, along with [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] and Puerto Ricans who have relocated to the city to become involved in the reggaeton scene, such as Nicky Jam and Farruko.<ref name=hotagain/>

Though he cites Daddy Yankee as his biggest musical inspiration, J Balvin's earliest influences were rock bands such as Metallica and Nirvana, as well as salsa legend [[Hector Lavoe]].<ref name=nirvana/> He has covered Nirvana's hit "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" in live performances.<ref name=nirvana/> As a teenager, he listened to hip-hop artists such as [[2Pac]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], and [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]].<ref name="pharrell"/> He also cites albums by Canadian R&B singer [[The Weeknd]] and Puerto Rican reggae band [[Cultura Profética]] as his "desert island albums."<ref name=10things>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/latin-awards/6546022/j-balvin-10-things-you-didnt-know-billboard-en-vivo-interview |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About J Balvin |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=April 30, 2015 |accessdate=March 30, 2018 |author=Billboard Staff}}</ref> Pop singer [[Camila Cabello]] has cited J Balvin as a musical influence.<ref name=cabellobill>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8093913/camila-cabello-new-york-times-interview-album-havana-tour-fifth-harmony |title=5 Things We Learned From Camila Cabello's 'New York Times' Interview |work=Billboard |last=Braca |first=Nina |date=January 11, 2018 |accessdate=March 30, 2018 |publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref>

===Public image and lyrics===
His public image was described by Bishop by saying, "J Balvin’s not a bad boy, he’s a good guy with a well-tended naughty side."<ref name=fader/> He often interacts with fans on social media sites such as [[Snapchat]] and [[Instagram]], and cites these platforms as essential for his success.<ref name=fader/> His musical partner Mazo explained, "We wanted to make music that was clean enough for your grandma to like, but sensual enough that the streets would like it too."<ref name=fader/> His lyrics have been described as more vulnerable than typical reggaeton lyrics, discussing interpersonal relationships, exemplified by the single "Ay Vamos". For this reason, he has been compared to Canadian artist [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], a comparison with which J Balvin agrees.<ref name="mission"/>

On the issue of [[misogyny]] in reggaeton, J Balvin notes, "[I] have mothers, sisters, relatives. Part of what we did is change that misconception that reggaetón is machista and misogynist. On the contrary, women are our biggest fans, and they inspire us."<ref name=Nickyandbalvin>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7767650/j-balvin-nicky-jam-reggaeton-cover-story |title=Reggaeton Superstars J Balvin and Nicky Jam on Conquering the Globe In the Trump Era |last=Cobo |first=Leila |date=April 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 27, 2018 |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref>  He also refrains from singing about his country's [[history of Colombia|violent past]], saying that doing that exacerbates stereotypes about Colombians and that the country has made vast improvements since the days of [[Pablo Escobar]].<ref name=hotagain/> Instead, he discusses everyday life in his songs.<ref name=hotagain/> Luis Estrada of Universal Music Latino and Capitol Latin says of Balvin, "He breaks every rule of what people think reggaeton is, and they love him for that...He doesn’t take himself too seriously."<ref name=hotagain/> J Balvin is unique also in that his dance crew on his videos and concerts are all male.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/j-balvins-latin-pop-crusade-201922/ |title=J Balvin's Latin Pop Crusade |first=Suzy |last=Exposito |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=May 7, 2018 |accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref>

Despite being fluent in English and frequently collaborating with English-speaking artists, J Balvin plans to only sing in Spanish. His goal is to make reggaeton a globally popular genre without having to sing in English to attain crossover success.<ref name="mission"/> He explains, "I want to keep making history in Spanish. I want to invite the mainstream into my world, and to my sound, and to what I’m doing. And I want mainstream artists to respect me, and accept Latino artists as equals, without us having to sing in English. I want them to know that I can compete globally with whomever, in Spanish."<ref name=fader/> American artist [[Pharrell]] instead sings the hook in Spanish on "Safari", and J Balvin described having more American musicians singing in Spanish as one of his "biggest dreams".<ref name=nirvana/> However, he recorded his first all-English song with Pitbull and Camila Cabello for the 2017 soundtrack to ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'', and explained that he is open to the idea of singing in English if the opportunity presents itself.<ref name=nirvana/>
