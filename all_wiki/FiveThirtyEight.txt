'''''FiveThirtyEight''''', sometimes rendered as '''''538''''', is a website that focuses on [[opinion poll]] analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging. The website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the [[United States Electoral College|United States electoral college]],<ref group=538 name="faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/03/frequently-asked-questions-last-revised.html|title= Frequently Asked Questions|last=Silver|first=Nate|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=April 26, 2015|date=August 7, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227173932/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/03/frequently-asked-questions-last-revised.html|archive-date=February 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was founded on March 7, 2008, as a [[Poll aggregator|polling aggregation website]] with a blog created by analyst [[Nate Silver]]. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of ''[[The New York Times]]'' online and renamed '''''FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus'''''.

In July 2013, [[ESPN]] acquired ''FiveThirtyEight'', hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ''[[ESPN.com]]''; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/9499752/nate-silver-joins-espn-multifaceted-role|title=Nate Silver joins ESPN in multifaceted role|work=ESPN.com|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130725054022/http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/9499752/nate-silver-joins-espn-multifaceted-role|archive-date=July 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Since then, the ''FiveThirtyEight'' blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property [[ABC News]] (also under parent [[The Walt Disney Company]]).

During the [[United States presidential primary|presidential primaries]] and [[2008 United States presidential election|general election of 2008]] the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in [[sabermetrics]] to "balance out the polls with comparative demographic data".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Andrew |title=Where We Were on June 16, 2004--and What It Means for Nov. 4, 2008 |url=http://www.blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/06/16/the-electoral-map-is-obama-outperforming-kerry-or-is-mccain-outperforming-bush.aspx |website=Stumper |publisher=Newsweek |access-date=June 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617214439/http://www.blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/06/16/the-electoral-map-is-obama-outperforming-kerry-or-is-mccain-outperforming-bush.aspx |archive-date=June 17, 2008 |date=June 16, 2008}}</ref><ref>Andrew Romano (June 16, 2008).

Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles—typically creating or analyzing statistical information—on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for [[Healthcare reform in the United States|health care reform]], [[global warming]] legislation and [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]]; elections around the world; [[Legal history of cannabis in the United States|marijuana legalization]]; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]] in which ''FiveThirtyEight'' correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states. On the eve of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], the site's forecast gave Hillary Clinton a 71% chance of winning and Donald Trump a 29% chance.<ref>[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/ "Who Will Win the Presidency"].

''FiveThirtyEight'' has won numerous awards. These include [[The Weblog Awards (Bloggies)|Bloggie Awards]] for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as [[Webby Award|Webbies]] for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013. While under the ownership of ESPN in 2016, ''FiveThirtyEight'' won the Data Journalism Website of the Year award from the [[Global Editors Network]].

==Genesis and history==
When Silver started ''FiveThirtyEight'' in early March 2008, he published under the name Poblano, the same name that he had used since November 2007 when he began publishing a diary on the [[Blog|political blog]] ''[[Daily Kos]]''.<ref name="Daily Kos-Poblano">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/user/Poblano |title=Poblano's Profile |website=Daily Kos |access-date=April 26, 2015 }}</ref> Writing as Poblano on ''Daily Kos,'' he had gained a following, especially for his primary election forecast on [[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/1/31/75516/0667|title=Mo.

Based on this result, ''New York Times'' [[op-ed]] columnist [[Bill Kristol|William Kristol]] wrote: "And an interesting regression analysis at the Daily Kos Web site (poblano.dailykos.com) of the determinants of the Democratic vote so far, applied to the demographics of the Ohio electorate, suggests that Obama has a better chance than is generally realized in Ohio".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/opinion/11kristol.html|title=Obama's Path to Victory|date=February 11, 2008|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229070940/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/opinion/11kristol.html|archive-date=December 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''FiveThirtyEight'' gained further national attention for beating out most pollsters' projections in the [[2008 North Carolina Democratic primary|North Carolina]] and [[2008 Indiana Democratic primary|Indiana]] Democratic party primaries on May 6, 2008. As Mark Blumenthal wrote in ''[[National Journal]]'', "Over the last week, an [[Anonymous blog|anonymous blogger]] who writes under the pseudonym Poblano did something bold on his blog, ''FiveThirtyEight.com.'' He posted predictions for the upcoming primaries based not on polling data, but on a statistical model driven mostly by demographic and past vote data.... Critics scoffed. Most of the public polls pointed to a close race in North Carolina.... But a funny thing happened. The model got it right."<ref name="Poblano Model">{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Mark |date=May 8, 2008 |title=The Poblano Model |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/mp_20080507_8254.php |newspaper=[[National Journal]] |access-date=April 26, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414152429/http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/mp_20080507_8254.php |archive-date=April 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Silver relied on demographic data and on the history of voting in ''other'' states during the 2008 Democratic primary elections.<ref name="WSJ">{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/baseball-analyst-draws-fans-by-crunching-election-numbers-347/|title=Baseball Analyst Draws Fans by Crunching Election Numbers|date=June 2, 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=June 19, 2008|first=Carl|last=Bialik|author-link=Carl Bialik|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606201959/https://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/baseball-analyst-draws-fans-by-crunching-election-numbers-347/|archive-date=June 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On May 30, 2008, Silver revealed his true identity for the first time to his ''FiveThirtyEight'' readers.<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/no-im-not-chuck-todd/|title=No, I'm not Chuck Todd|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130131640/http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/no-im-not-chuck-todd/|archive-date=January 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After that date, he published just four more diaries on ''Daily Kos''.<ref name="Daily Kos-Poblano" />

As the primary season was coming to an end, Silver began to build a model for the general election race. This model, too, relied in part on demographic information but mainly involved a complex method of aggregating polling results. In 2008, ''[[Rasmussen Reports]]'' had an apparently short-term partnership with ''FiveThirtyEight'' in order to include this unique methodology for generating poll averages in their "Balance of Power Calculator".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=132x6361757|title=Rasmussen Reports to Partner with FiveThirtyEight.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116024716/http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=132x6361757|archive-date=January 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> At the same time, ''FiveThirtyEight''{{'}}s daily "Today's Polls" column began to be mirrored on "The Plank," a blog published by ''[[The New Republic]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/06/12/today-s-polls-the-bounce-hits-the-badger-state.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614232907/http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/06/12/today-s-polls-the-bounce-hits-the-badger-state.aspx|title=Today's Polls: The Bounce hits the Badger State – The Plank|archive-date=June 14, 2008}}</ref>

By early October 2008, ''FiveThirtyEight'' approached 2.5 million visitors per week, while averaging approximately 400,000 per weekday.<ref group=538>{{cite web|first=Sean|last=Quinn|title=On the Road: St. Louis County, Missouri|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/on-road-st-louis-county-missouri.html|work=FiveThirtyEight|date=October 3, 2008|author-link=Sean Quinn (writer)|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207021530/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/on-road-st-louis-county-missouri.html|archive-date=December 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  During October 2008 the site received 3.63 million unique visitors, 20.57 million site visits, and 32.18 million [[Pageview|page views]].<ref group=538>{{cite web|first=Sean|last=Quinn|title=Site Note|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/site-note.html|work=FiveThirtyEight|date=November 3, 2008|author-link=Sean Quinn (writer)|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143611/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/site-note.html|archive-date=December 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On Election Day, November 4, 2008, the site had nearly 5 million page views.<ref name="NYT-2008/11/10">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10silver.html|title=Finding Fame With a Prescient Call for Obama|last=Clifford|first=Stephanie|date=November 9, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 26, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224063509/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10silver.html|archive-date=February 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In July 2013, it was revealed that Silver and his ''FiveThirtyEight'' blog would depart ''The New York Times'' and join [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/business/media/nate-silver-blogger-for-new-york-times-is-to-join-espn-staff.html|title=Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight Blog Is to Join ESPN Staff|date=July 20, 2013|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415062133/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/business/media/nate-silver-blogger-for-new-york-times-is-to-join-espn-staff.html|archive-date=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In its announcement of its acquisition of ''FiveThirtyEight'', ESPN reported that "Silver will serve as the editor-in-chief of the site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors in the coming months.

According to Silver, the focus of ''FiveThirtyEight'' in its ESPN phase would broaden: "People also think it's going to be a sports site with a little politics thrown in, or it's going to be a politics site with sports thrown in.... But we take our science and economics and lifestyle coverage very seriously.... It's a data journalism site. Politics is one topic that sometimes data journalism is good at covering. It's certainly good with presidential elections. But we don't really see politics as how the site is going to grow".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/nate-silver-interview-fivethirtyeight-espn.html|title=Nate Silver Interview: The New FiveThirtyEight – NYMag|work=Daily Intelligencer|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314115436/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/nate-silver-interview-fivethirtyeight-espn.html|archive-date=March 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''FiveThirtyEight'' launched its ESPN webpage on March 17, 2014. The lead story by Silver explained that "FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism organization.... We've expanded our staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major subject areas&nbsp;– politics, economics, science, life and sports. Our team also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. So in addition to written stories, we'll have interactive graphics and features".<ref group=538 name=fox>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/|title=What the Fox Knows|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317174126/http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/|archive-date=March 17, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In April 2018, it was announced that FiveThirtyEight would be transferred to [[ABC News]] from [[ESPN, Inc.]], majority owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Brian|title=ABC News Takes Over Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/abc-news-ffivethirtyeight-espn-nate-silver-1202755646/|work=Variety|date=17 April 2018}}</ref> ABC News Live streaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Roettgers |first1=Janko  |title=ABC Launches New 24/7 Online News Network 'ABC News Live' Exclusively on Roku Channel |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/abc-news-live-roku-1202783981/ |access-date=January 15, 2020 |work=Variety |date=April 24, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> With the reorganization creating the [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]] segment in March 2018, ABC News Digital and Live Streaming (websites, ABC News Live and FiveThirtyEight) was transferred to the new segment.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Disney Reorganizes Divisions, Creates Dedicated Direct-to-Consumer Streaming Unit|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/disney-reorganizes-direct-to-consumer-streaming-unit-1202726528/|access-date=March 15, 2018|work=Variety|date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>

===Methods===
One unique aspect of the site is Silver's efforts to rank pollsters by accuracy, [[Sampling (statistics)#Survey weights|weight]] their polls accordingly, and then supplement those polls with his own electoral projections based on [[Demography|demographics]] and prior voting patterns. "I did think there was room for a more sophisticated way of handling these things," Silver said.<ref name="WSJ"/><ref name="STATS">{{cite news |last=Felder |first=Adam |date=September 2009 |title=Case study: The FiveThirtyEight.com Predictive Model of the 2008 Presidential Election |url=http://www.causeweb.org/stats/STATS_50.pdf |newspaper=STATS |issn=1053-8607 |issue=50 |pages=3–9 |access-date=April 26, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430100954/http://www.causeweb.org/stats/STATS_50.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

''FiveThirtyEight'' weighs pollsters' historical track records through a complex methodology<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/04/pollster-ratings-v30.html|title=Pollster Ratings v3.0|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719034906/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/04/pollster-ratings-v30.html|archive-date=July 19, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and assigns them values to indicate "Pollster-Introduced Error".

At base Silver's method is similar to other analysts' approaches to taking advantage of the multiple polls that are conducted within each state: he averaged the polling results. But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The "average" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would not reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by ''Pollster.com'': if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or [[Local regression|LOESS]].

However, while adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from "similar" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his [[PECOTA|baseball forecasting]]: using [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor analysis]] he first identified "most similar states" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from "similar states". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.

Furthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2008 Democratic party primary elections]] was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in [[2008 North Carolina Democratic primary|North Carolina]] and [[2008 Indiana Democratic primary|Indiana]], for example.<ref name="Poblano Model" /> Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and "similar states," Silver estimated a "538 [[Regression analysis|regression]]" using historical voting information along with [[demography|demographic]] characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.

In July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and [[demographic analysis]].

In the final update of his presidential forecast model at midday of November 4, 2008, Silver projected a popular vote victory by 6.1 percentage points for [[Barack Obama]] and electoral vote totals of 349 (based on a probabilistic projection) or 353 (based on fixed projections of each state).<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/todays-polls-and-final-election.html|title=Today's Polls and Final Election Projection: Obama 349, McCain 189|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075833/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/todays-polls-and-final-election.html|archive-date=December 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Obama won with 365 electoral college votes. Silver's predictions matched the actual results everywhere except in [[Indiana]] and the [[Nebraska's 2nd congressional district|2nd congressional district]] of [[Nebraska]], which awards an electoral vote separately from the rest of the state. His projected [[2008 United States presidential election|national popular vote differential]] was below the actual figure of 7.2 points.

The forecasts for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] proved to be correct for every race, but the near stalemate in [[Minnesota]] led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In [[Alaska]], after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent [[Ted Stevens]] conceded the seat to Democrat [[Mark Begich]], an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/18/alaska.senate.race/index.html|title=Stevens concedes Alaska Senate race}}</ref> In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican [[Saxby Chambliss]], a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.

==After the 2008 U.S. election==

===Focus===
During the first two months after the election, no major innovations in content were introduced. A substantial percentage of the articles focused on Senatorial races: the runoff in Georgia, won by [[Saxby Chambliss]]; recounts of votes in Alaska (won by [[Mark Begich]]), and Minnesota ([[Al Franken]] vs. [[Norm Coleman]]); and the appointments of Senatorial replacements in Colorado, New York, and Illinois.

After [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|President Obama's inauguration]], [[Sean Quinn (writer)|Sean Quinn]] reported that he was moving to Washington, D.C., to continue political writing from that locale.<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/01/end-of-beginning.html|title=The End of the Beginning|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125073259/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/01/end-of-beginning.html|archive-date=January 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On February 4, 2009, he became the first blogger to join the [[White House press corps]].<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/02/obama-hits-road-to-sell-stimulus-steps.html|title=Obama Hits the Road to Sell Stimulus, Steps Up Pressure on Key Senators|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208180301/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/02/obama-hits-road-to-sell-stimulus-steps.html|archive-date=February 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After that time, however, he contributed only a handful of articles to ''FiveThirtyEight''.

In April 2010, the [[The Guardian|Guardian Newspaper]] published Silver's predictions for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 United Kingdom General Election]].

===Question over transparency in pollster ratings===
On June 6, 2010, ''FiveThirtyEight'' posted pollster rankings that updated and elaborated Silver's efforts from the 2008 election. Silver expanded the database to more than 4,700 election polls and developed a model for rating the polls that was more sophisticated than his original rankings.<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/06/pollster-ratings-v40-results.html|title=Pollster Ratings v4.0: Results|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621012716/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/06/pollster-ratings-v40-results.html|archive-date=June 21, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2010/06/09/wheres_the_transparency_in_pollster_ratings.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612092520/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2010/06/09/wheres_the_transparency_in_pollster_ratings.html|title=Where's the Transparency in Pollster Ratings?|archive-date=June 12, 2010}}</ref>

Silver responded on 538: "Where's the transparency? Well, it's here [citing his June 6 article], in an article that contains 4,807 words and 18 footnotes. Every detail of how the pollster ratings are calculated is explained. It's also here [referring to another article], in the form of Pollster Scorecards, a feature which we'll continue to roll out over the coming weeks for each of the major polling firms, and which will explain in some detail how we arrive at the particular rating that we did for each one".<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/06/on-transparency-hypocrisy-and-research.html|title=On Transparency, Hypocrisy, and Research 2000|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613125641/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/06/on-transparency-hypocrisy-and-research.html|archive-date=June 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

As for why the complete 538 polling database had not been released publicly, Silver responded: "The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again at the end of this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full".

Silver also commented on the fact that the 538 ratings had contributed to [[Markos Moulitsas]]'s decision to end ''[[Daily Kos]]'''s use of [[Research 2000]] as its pollster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2010/6/9/874403/-Polling|title=Polling|work=Daily Kos|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612093042/http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2010/6/9/874403/-Polling|archive-date=June 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Subsequently, on June 11, Mark Blumenthal also commented on the question of transparency in an article in the ''[[National Journal]]'' titled "Transparency In Rating: Nate Silver's Impressive Ranking Of Pollsters' Accuracy Is Less Impressive In Making Clear What Data Is Used".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/po_20100611_6800.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614193729/http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/po_20100611_6800.php|title=Transparency In Rating|archive-date=June 14, 2010|publisher=National Journal Online}}</ref> He noted that in the case of Research 2000 there were some discrepancies between what Silver reported and what the pollster itself reported.

On June 16, 2010, Silver announced on his blog that he is willing to give all pollsters who he had included in his rating a list of their polls that he had in his archive, along with the key information that he used (poll marginals, sample size, dates of administration); and he encouraged the pollsters to examine the lists and the results to compare them with the pollster's own record and make corrections.<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/06/fivethirtyeight-is-pleased-to-let.html|title=FiveThirtyEight Establishes Process for Pollsters to Review its Database of Their Polls|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619063133/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/06/fivethirtyeight-is-pleased-to-let.html|archive-date=June 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Partnership with ''The New York Times'': 2010–2013==
On June 3, 2010, ''The New York Times'' and Silver announced that ''FiveThirtyEight'' had formed a partnership under which the blog would be hosted by the ''Times'' for a period of three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/the-new-york-times-to-host-political-polling-site-fivethirtyeight/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909212618/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/the-new-york-times-to-host-political-polling-site-fivethirtyeight/|title=The Times to Host Political Polling Site FiveThirtyEight|author=Brian Stelter|date=June 3, 2010|archive-date=September 9, 2015|work=Media Decoder Blog}}</ref> In legal terms, ''FiveThirtyEight'' granted a "license" to the ''Times'' to publish the blog.

Silver received bids from several major media entities before selecting the ''Times''.<ref name="niemanlab.org/2010/06" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/06/08/2010-06-08_getting_with_the_times_nate_silvers_hip_fivethirtyeight_blog_joins_the_new_york_.html|title=FiveThirtyEight blog gets with the Times|date=June 8, 2010|work=NY Daily News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613014838/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/06/08/2010-06-08_getting_with_the_times_nate_silvers_hip_fivethirtyeight_blog_joins_the_new_york_.html|archive-date=June 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Under terms of the agreement, Silver would also write monthly articles for the print version of both the newspaper and the [[The New York Times Magazine|Sunday magazine]].<ref group=538 name="FiveThirtyEight-2010/06" /> Silver did not move his blog to the highest bidder, because he was concerned with maintaining his own voice while gaining the exposure and technical support that a larger media company could provide. "There's a bit of a [[Groucho Marx]] quality to it [Silver has said].... You shouldn't want to belong to any media brand that seems desperate to have you as a member, even though they'll probably offer the most cash".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/business/media/news-consumption-tilts-toward-niche-sites.html|title=News Trends Tilt Toward Niche Sites|date=September 12, 2011|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309093326/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/business/media/news-consumption-tilts-toward-niche-sites.html|archive-date=March 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The first column of the renamed ''FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus'' appeared in ''The Times'' on August 25, 2010, with the introduction of U.S. Senate election forecasts. At the same time, Silver published a brief history of the blog.<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/welcome-and-welcome-back/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907235351/http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/welcome-and-welcome-back/|title=Welcome (and Welcome Back) to FiveThirtyEight|author=Nate Silver|date=August 25, 2010|archive-date=September 7, 2015|work=FiveThirtyEight}}</ref> All columns from the original ''FiveThirtyEight'' were also archived for public access.<ref name="About-NYT">{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/about-fivethirtyeight/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318085522/http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/about-fivethirtyeight/|title=About FiveThirtyEight|archive-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>

Shortly after ''FiveThirtyEight'' relocated to ''The New York Times,'' Silver introduced his prediction models for the [[2010 United States elections|2010 elections]] to the [[2010 United States Senate elections|U.S. Senate]], the [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections|U.S. House of Representatives]], and state [[2010 United States gubernatorial elections|Governorships]]. Each of these models relied initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling.  The 538 model had forecast a net pickup of 8 seats by the Republicans in the Senate and 55 seats in the House, close to the actual outcome of a pickup of 6 seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House.<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/38-days-later/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011154100/http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/38-days-later/|title=38 Days Later|author=Micah Cohen|date=December 10, 2010|archive-date=October 11, 2014|work=FiveThirtyEight}}</ref>

===Writers===
When the transition to ''The New York Times'' was announced, Silver listed his staff of writers for the first time.<ref name="About-NYT"/> However, of the seven listed writers, only three of them had published on 538/New York Times by late December 2010: Silver, Renard Sexton and Hale Stewart.

Beginning in 2011, one writer who emerged as a regular contributor was Micah Cohen. Cohen provided a periodic "Reads and Reactions" column in which he summarized Silver's articles for the previous couple of weeks, as well as reactions to them in the media and other blogs, and suggested some additional readings related to the subject of Silver's columns. Silver identified Cohen as "my news assistant".<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/new-hampshires-contrarian-streak/#more-17579|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911003519/http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/new-hampshires-contrarian-streak/#more-17579|title=New Hampshire's Contrarian Streak|author=Nate Silver|date=October 10, 2011|archive-date=September 11, 2015|work=FiveThirtyEight}}</ref> Cohen also contributed additional columns on occasion.<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/a-look-at-politifact-grades-of-candidates/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910022431/http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/a-look-at-politifact-grades-of-candidates/|title=A Look at PolitiFact Grades of Candidates|author=Micah Cohen|date=September 23, 2011|archive-date=September 10, 2015|work=FiveThirtyEight}}</ref>

On September 12, 2011, Silver introduced another writer: "FiveThirtyEight extends a hearty welcome to John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, who will be writing a series of posts for this site over the next month.

===2012 U.S. elections===

''FiveThirtyEight'' rolled out its 2012 general election forecasting model on June 7, 2012. The model forecast both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote, with the latter being central to the exercise and involving a forecast of each state. In the initial forecast, Barack Obama was estimated to have a 61.8% chance of winning the electoral vote.

===2016 U.S. elections===

====Presidential primary elections====
''FiveThirtyEight'' applied two separate models to forecast the 2016 presidential primary elections – ''polls-only'' and ''polls-plus'' models. The ''polls-only'' model relied only on polls from a particular state, while the ''polls-plus'' model was based on state polls, national polls and endorsements. For each contest, ''FiveThirtyEight'' produced probability distributions and average expected vote shares according to both models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-are-forecasting-the-2016-presidential-primary-election/|title=How We're Forecasting The Primaries|date=January 12, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717031302/http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-are-forecasting-the-2016-presidential-primary-election/|archive-date=July 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

As early as June 2015, ''FiveThirtyEight'' argued that [[Donald Trump]] "isn't a real candidate."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-donald-trump-isnt-a-real-candidate-in-one-chart/|title=Why Donald Trump Isn't A Real Candidate, In One Chart|date=June 16, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722184021/http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-donald-trump-isnt-a-real-candidate-in-one-chart/|archive-date=July 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2016, ''New York Times'' media columnist [[Jim Rutenberg]] wrote that "predictions can have consequences" and criticized ''FiveThirtyEight'' for underestimating Trump's chances. He argued that by giving "Mr. Trump a 2 percent chance at the nomination despite strong polls in his favor ... they also arguably sapped the journalistic will to scour his record as aggressively as those of his supposedly more serious rivals".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/media/the-republican-horse-race-is-over-and-journalism-lost.html|title=The Republican Horse Race Is Over, and Journalism Lost|date=May 9, 2016|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222012821/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/media/the-republican-horse-race-is-over-and-journalism-lost.html|archive-date=February 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In a long retrospective, "How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump," published in May 2016 after Trump had become the likely nominee, Silver reviewed how he had erred in evaluating Trump's chances early in the primary campaign. Silver wrote, "The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight – including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned  – our early estimates of Trump's chances weren't based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [call] 'subjective odds' – which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed to some of the same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, we found ourselves rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things".<ref>Nate Silver, "How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump: Trump's Nomination Shows the Need for a More Rigorous Approach," ''FiveThirtyEight'', May 18, 2016. {{cite web |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-i-acted-like-a-pundit-and-screwed-up-on-donald-trump/ |title=How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump |date=May 18, 2016 |access-date=2016-07-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717172928/http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-i-acted-like-a-pundit-and-screwed-up-on-donald-trump/ |archive-date=July 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The Fivey Fox mascot pops up next to most charts with call-outs to more further information."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Five things data storytellers can learn from 2020 US election poll trackers|url=https://www.tableau.com/blog/2020/10/five-things-data-storytellers-can-learn-2020-us-election-poll-trackers|access-date=2020-11-10|website=Tableau|language=en-US}}</ref>

Fivey Fox would also issue reminders to readers of "the potential for extreme outcomes" according to [[Jessica Hullmann|Jessica Hullman]], in a piece written for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]].'' Hullman also said of the design that the introduction of the mascot, in conjunction with the new simplified look of the page, was perhaps "perhaps the strongest indicator that Silver intends to emphasize uncertainty" in his coverage of the 2020 election.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Allott|first=Daniel|date=2020-09-08|title=There's more than meets the eye in 2020 election forecasts|url=https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/515291-theres-more-than-meets-the-eye-in-2020-election-forecasts|access-date=2020-11-10|website=TheHill|language=en}}</ref>

[[Jasmine Mithani]], visual journalist with ''FiveThirtyEight'', said in an interview when asked about the complaints of new mascot said "I think the biggest complaint about Fivey Fox is that some people find it infantilizing, but that wasn’t our intention." and that the motivation for including the character was to help make the forecast more of a "a teaching tool".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jasmine Mithani, visual journalist at FiveThirtyEight, on the Fivey Fox mascot, their interactive swing state map, and more|url=https://www.niemanlab.org/reading/jasmine-mithani-visual-journalist-at-fivethirtyeight-on-the-fivey-fox-mascot-their-interactive-swing-state-map-and-more/|access-date=2020-11-10|website=Nieman Lab}}</ref> In November of 2020, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reported that Fivey Fox had reached over 7,000 on his dedicated [[Twitter]] account.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dickson|first=E.

The forecast correctly predicted 48 states, the District of Columbia, and four of the five congressional districts awarding electoral votes, only missing [[2020 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]], [[2020 United States presidential election in North Carolina|North Carolina]], and [[2020 United States presidential election in Maine|Maine's 2nd congressional district]]. In those three contests the forecast had favored Biden, but they were carried by Trump.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=2020-08-12|title=2020 Election Forecast|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/|access-date=2020-11-13|website=FiveThirtyEight|language=en}}</ref>
