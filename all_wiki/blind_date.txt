A '''blind date''' is a social engagement between two people who have not previously met, usually arranged by a mutual acquaintance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/blind+date|title=blind date|publisher=}}</ref>

== Structure ==
A blind date is arranged for by a mutual acquaintance of both participants. The two people who take part in the blind date may have never met or seen each other, hence the phrase "blind date". Therefore, it is the responsibility of the acquaintance who arranges the date to ensure that they are a good match.
Sometimes one person is more interested in the match than the other, which may make it more difficult on the person arranging the date to judge whether the date will be successful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light My Route of Blind Dating|url=http://ask.metafilter.com/210358/Light-My-Route-of-Blind-Dating|publisher=MetaFilter|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

The date is usually two hours or less, as it is just a first date and is really meant to introduce the two people more than it is meant to create a marriage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Molloy|first=Angela|title=5 Rules for Great Blind Dates|url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/lifestyle/5-rules-great-blind-dates|publisher=TheStreet|accessdate=19 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326035032/http://www.mainstreet.com/article/lifestyle/5-rules-great-blind-dates|archive-date=26 March 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
Furthermore, due to the unfamiliarity of the two people the date is shorter than most because they are in the beginning stages of a relationship. 
The date is also very adventurous in the way that neither party knows what to expect and whether or not they will hit it off. The location of the date is also affected by the spontaneity in that it is often a neutral and public place so that both parties feel comfortable.

Family and friends have been declining in their influence over the dating market for the past 60 years. In the past 15 years, the rise of the Internet has also displaced the neighborhood, the workplace, and the circle of friends as sources of dating partners.<ref name="rosenfeld">{{cite journal|last=Rosenfeld|first=Michael J.|author2=Reuben J.

Online dating services ask questions in the form of a survey in order to get to know the user better and to understand what they are looking for in a relationship.<ref name="curiosity.discovery">{{cite web|last=Discovery Channel|title=How do online dating sites match people up?|url=http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/how-online-dating-match-people|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=19 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114005356/http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/how-online-dating-match-people|archive-date=14 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Using the information given, the matching users would be found based on various [[algorithm]]s.

Parents find their children blind dates in parks. "Spouse-hunting fairs in big city parks by parents eager to see their children tie the knot have made parks in China a haven for relationship hunters and their parents"

This process begins by the parents sitting on a bench with their child’s credentials, such as photos and academic or career information. After information has been exchanged and the parents like what they see, questions are asked about anything ranging from their child’s zodiac sign to their place of residence. If everything runs smoothly during the second step, contact information is exchanged. This process altogether can be very stressful for the parents and the child because they are not always in agreement. This makes it even more difficult for a partner to be found. Li, a middle-aged man who has experienced blind dating says he has met women "who have no intention of finding a boyfriend. Meeting me is merely to indulge their parents".<ref name="beijing" />

South Korean blind dating customs are preferred rather than other dating techniques. There are two kinds of blind dates in South Korea: "mee-ting" and "sogeting".<ref name="travel">{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Violet|title=Korea: The land of freaky, funny love|url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/life/Korea-freaky-funny-love-923390|publisher=CNN|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> Mee-ting blind dates are group dates with no prior expectations of commitment, and are often used by university students. A sogeting date usually includes less alcohol than a mee-ting date. It is also engaged in by people who are "single and looking".<ref name="travel" />
