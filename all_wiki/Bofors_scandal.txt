The '''Bofors scandal''' was a major weapons-contract [[political scandal]] that occurred between [[India]] and [[Sweden]] during the 1980s and 1990s, initiated by [[Indian National Congress]] politicians and implicating the Indian prime minister, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], and several other members of the Indian and Swedish governments who were accused of receiving [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] from [[Bofors|Bofors AB]], a bank principally financed by the [[Wallenberg family]]'s [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]],<ref>{{cite book |author1-last=Whiteside |author1-first=R.

It was the biggest arms deal ever in Sweden, and money marked for development projects was diverted to secure this contract at any cost. The investigations revealed flouting of rules and bypassing of institutions.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Bofors story, 25 years after : Interview with Sten Lindstrom |url= http://thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=5884 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |newspaper=The Hoot |date=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120618134030/http://thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=5884 |archive-date= 18 June 2012 }}</ref>

On 16 April 1987, a Swedish radio station broke out a story based on a [[whistleblower]] in the Swedish police, alleging that the reputed Swedish artillery manufacturer Bofors had paid kickbacks to people in several countries, including Sweden and India, to secure a {{INRConvert|15|b|year=1986|lk=r}} contract. This had been done the previous year for a deal to supply 410 155&nbsp;mm calibre howitzer guns for the Indian army.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Joseph |first1=Josy |title=Arms and the Middlemen |url= http://www.indialegallive.com/viewpoint/arms-and-the-middlemen-14454 |website= www.indialegallive.com |publisher=India Legal |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> However, none of the newspapers in India were aware of this. In May 1987, a broadcast by a Swedish radio station revealed that bribes of {{INRConvert|600|m|year=1986}} had been paid by Bofors to Indian politicians, members of the Congress party and bureaucrats. This was picked up by a young journalist from ''[[The Hindu]]'', [[Chitra Subramaniam]], who happened to be in Sweden at that time, covering another story. The scale of the corruption was far worse than any that Sweden and India had seen before and directly led to the defeat of Gandhi's ruling Indian National Congress party in the November [[1989 Indian general election|1989 general elections]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Joseph |first1=Josy |title=Arms and the middleman |url= https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/arms-and-the-middleman/article8548067.ece |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=The Hindu |date=3 May 2016}}</ref> The Swedish company paid {{INRConvert|640|m}} in kickbacks to top Indian politicians and key defence officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=89&id=39264&option=com_content&task=view&sectionid=4 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120716110017/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=89&id=39264&option=com_content&task=view&sectionid=4 |url-status=dead |archive-date= 2012-07-16 |title=Key players in Bofors scandal : Latest Headlines, News - India Today |publisher='Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>

The case came into light during [[Vishwanath Pratap Singh]]'s tenure as defence minister, and was revealed through investigative journalism tipped off by a [[Reuters]] news revelation on Swedish radio, followed up by a team led by [[N. Ram]] of the newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/sep/23vir.htm |title=Rediff on the NeT: Vir Sanghvi looks back at the Bofors scandal |publisher= Rediff.com |date= 23 September 1999}}</ref> The journalist who secured the over 350 documents that detailed the payoffs was [[Chitra Subramaniam]] reporting for ''The Hindu''.

==Chronology of events and investigation==
On 24 March 1986, a $285 million contract between the [[Government of India]] and Swedish arms company [[Bofors]] was signed for supply of 410 155&nbsp;mm Howitzer field guns.<ref name=bofors>{{cite news |title=25 years of India's 'Watergate': The Bofors scandal |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/25-years-indias-watergate-bofors-scandal-135113721.html;_ylt=Alj5KdzFteYFGnJnR7t2kny6scB_;_ylu=X3oDMTFxbGs3Y3Z1BG1pdANJbmZpbml0ZSBCcm93c2UgVGV4dARwb3MDMQRzZWMDTWVkaWFJbmZpbml0ZUJyb3dzZUxpc3Q-;_ylg=X3oDMTNpbHR1dmhuBGludGwDaW4EbGFuZwNlbi1pbgRwc3RhaWQDODc2ZTBhMWEtMDRhMi0zMGUyLTllYmQtMDNkZjFmZDEyZDQ0BHBzdGNhdANob21lfGdvdmVybm1lbnR2c3RlYW1hbm5hBHB0A3N0b3J5cGFnZQR0ZXN0Aw--;_ylv=3 |newspaper=[[Yahoo!

The middleman associated with the scandal was [[Ottavio Quattrocchi]], an [[Italians|Italian]] businessman who represented the petrochemicals firm [[Snamprogetti]].<ref name=ottavio/> Quattrocchi was reportedly close to the family of Rajiv Gandhi and emerged as a powerful broker in the 1980s between big businesses and the Indian government.<ref name=ottavio/> While the case was being investigated, [[Rajiv Gandhi assassination|Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated]] for unrelated reasons by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]].<ref name=ottavio/> In 1997, the [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss banks]] released some 500 documents after years of legal battle.

In 1999, the Indian government lifted its blacklist on Bofors. The lifting of the ban came during the [[Kargil War]], when the Bofors guns proved to be efficient but were crippled by a shortage of spare parts.<ref name=past/>

On 22 October 1999 (when [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] government led by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] was in power) the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) filed the first [[chargesheet]] against Quattrocchi, Win Chadha, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the defence secretary [[S. K. Bhatnagar]] and a number of others.<ref name="dnaindia.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1082262 |title=Chronology of the Bofors scandal |publisher=[[Daily News and Analysis]] }}</ref> In second half of 2001, Win Chadha and [[S.

On 10 June 2002, [[Delhi High Court]] [[Motion to quash|quashed]] all proceedings in the case so far. However, this was reversed by [[Supreme Court of India]] on 7 July 2003.<ref name="SC court reverses Delhi HC decision to quash all proceeding in Bofors scam">{{cite web | url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/767596/ | title=SC court reverses Delhi HC decision to quash all proceeding in Bofors scam | publisher=indiankanoon.org | accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the central government changed and [[Indian National Congress]] came to power after [[2004 Lok Sabha elections]]. On 5 February 2004 even before Indian National Congress came to power in India, the [[Delhi High Court]] quashed the charges of [[bribery]] against Rajiv Gandhi and others,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3458319.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rajiv Gandhi cleared over bribery | date=4 February 2004}}</ref> On 31 May 2005, the [[Delhi High Court]] dismissed the allegations against the [[British people|British]] business brothers, [[S P Hinduja|Srichand]], [[Gopichand Hinduja|Gopichand]] and [[Prakash Hinduja]], but charges against others remain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2213/stories/20050701004003100.htm |title=Welcome to Frontline : Vol. 30 :: No. 05 |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |access-date=21 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084108/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2213/stories/20050701004003100.htm |archive-date=17 December 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In December 2005, Mr B. Daat, the [[Additional Solicitor General of India]], acting on behalf of the Indian Government and the CBI, requested the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] that two British bank accounts of Quattrocchi be unfrozen on the grounds of insufficient evidence to link these accounts to the Bofors payoff. The two accounts, containing â¬3 million and $1 million, had been frozen. On 16 January, the Indian Supreme Court directed the Indian government to ensure that Ottavio Quattrocchi did not withdraw money from the two bank accounts in London. The CBI, the Indian federal law enforcement agency, on 23 January 2006 admitted that roughly â¹210&nbsp;million, about US$4.6 million, in the two accounts have already been withdrawn by the accused. The British government released the funds later.<ref name="dnaindia.com"/>

However, on 16 January 2006, CBI claimed in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court that they were still pursuing extradition orders for Quattrocchi. The [[Interpol]], at the request of the CBI, has a long-standing red corner notice to arrest Quattrocchi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeenews.com/news527876.html |title=CBI seeks time to mull on Quattrocchi's case |publisher=Zeenews.com |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref> Quattrocchi was detained in [[Argentina]] on 6 February 2007, but the news of his detention was released by the CBI only on 23 February. Quattrocchi was released by Argentinian police. However, his [[passport]] was impounded and he was not allowed to leave the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20070226&fname=bofors&sid=1 |title=The Q Deja Vu, Outlook Feb 26, 2007 |work=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305002132/http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20070226&fname=bofors&sid=1 |archive-date=5 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

As there was no [[extradition]] treaty between India and Argentina, the case was presented in the [[Argentine Supreme Court]]. The government of India lost the extradition case as the government of India did not provide a key court order which was the basis of Quattrocchi's arrest. In the aftermath, the government did not appeal this decision because of delays in securing an official English translation of the court's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2417/stories/20070907506608900.htm |title=Welcome to Frontline : Vol. 30 :: No. 05 |work=[[The Hindu]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417050135/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2417/stories/20070907506608900.htm |archive-date=17 April 2008 }}</ref>

A Delhi court provided temporary relief for Quattrocchi from the case, for lack of sufficient evidence against him, on 4 March 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-05/india/28658179_1_light-of-various-factors-win-chaddha-and-quattrocchi-bofors-case | work=[[The Times of India]] | title=Bofors case: 'Petitioner interested in cheap publicity' | date=5 March 2011}}</ref> However the case is still going on.

On 12 July 2013, Quattrochi died of a [[heart attack]] in [[Milan]].<ref>{{cite web|author=+ val.created_at + |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/bofors-scam-italian-businessman-ottavio-quattrocchi-dies-391837 |title=Bofors scam: Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi dies |publisher=NDTV.com |date=2013-07-13 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>

Despite the controversy, the Bofors gun was used extensively as the primary field artillery during the [[Kargil War]] with [[Pakistan]] and gave India 'an edge' against Pakistan according to battlefield commanders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/jul/08/bofors-gun-helped-india-win-against-pak.htm |title=Bofors gun helped India win against Pak|publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=8 July 2009}}</ref>

In his book, ''Unknown Facets of Rajiv Gandhi, Jyoti Basu and Indrajit Gupta'', released in November 2013, former [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] director Dr A P Mukherjee wrote that Rajiv Gandhi wanted commission paid by defence suppliers to be used exclusively for the purpose of meeting expenses of running the Congress party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rajiv-gandhi-told-me-to-use-arms-deal-payoffs-for-party-funds-excbi-chief/1194313/ |title=Rajiv Gandhi told me to use arms deal payoffs for party funds: Ex-CBI chief |publisher=Indian Express |date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref> Mukherjee said Gandhi explained his position in a meeting on 19 June 1989, during a meeting between the two at the Prime Minister's residence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rajiv Gandhi wanted Bofors money to run Congress: Ex-CBI chief|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rajiv-Gandhi-wanted-Bofors-money-to-run-Congress-Ex-CBI-chief/articleshow/25720914.cms|newspaper=The Times of India|date=14 Nov 2013}}</ref> However, as per Sten Lindstrom, the former head of Swedish police, who led the investigations, they did not find anything to suggest that payments had been received by Rajiv Gandhi. He was, however, guilty of knowing about the kickbacks and not taking action on them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Subramaniam |first=Chitra |title=The bofors story : 25 years after - an interview with Sten Lindstrom |url=http://thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=5884 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |newspaper=The Hoot |date=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304093344/http://thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=5884 |archive-date=4 March 2014 }}</ref>

==Political effects==
The Bofors scandal was a major issue that was highlighted in subsequent elections, which led to the Congress losing power. Though it was widely believed that V.&nbsp;P. Singh resigned from Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet due to the Bofors scandal, Singh clarified that he had resigned due to differences in the cabinet in commissions taken by Indian agents in the [[Shishumar-class submarine|HDW submarine deal (Shishumar class)]]<ref name="vp">{{cite news |last1=Gupta |first1=Shekhar |title=Walk the talk - an interview with V.P.Singh |url=https://www.ndtv.com/video/shows/walk-the-talk/walk-the-talk-with-vp-singh-aired-july-2005-303898 |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=NDTV |date=1 July 2005}}</ref>

==Middlemen in Indian arms deals==
Middlemen were employed in arms deals in India, both during the [[British Raj]] as well as in independent India, and [[A Feast of Vultures|commissions]] were paid to them under various headings and guises.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arms and the Middlemen - 7 September 2016 |url=http://www.indialegallive.com/viewpoint/arms-and-the-middlemen-14454 |website=India Legal |publisher=India legal |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> Some of these were paid as personal bribes while others were paid as contributions to political parties.<ref name="vultures">{{cite book |last1=Joseph |first1=Josy |title=A Feast of Vultures: The Hidden Business of Democracy in India |date=15 July 2016 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-9350297513 |url=https://www.afeastofvultures.com |accessdate=25 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025150142/http://afeastofvultures.com/ |archive-date=25 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This led to high levels of corruption, and payments being made to politicians, bureaucrats and defence personnel to influence decisions. This practice was made illegal by Rajiv Gandhi in 1985 as it led to large kickbacks being paid in defence deals, especially those related to aircraft and ships.<ref>{{cite news |title=India Puts New Arms Deals With Finmeccanica On Hold |url=http://www.defenseworld.net/news/10886/India_Puts_New_Arms_Deals_With_Finmeccanica_On_Hold#.W9F8FIepWUk |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=Defence world net |date=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Joseph |first1=Josy |title=Arms and the middleman |url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/arms-and-the-middleman/article8548067.ece |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=The Hindu |date=3 May 2016}}</ref>

In 2015, the Government of India under the [[Narendra Modi]] government made the use of middlemen in arms deals legal, if they called themselves "company representatives".<ref>{{cite news |title=Modi govt to legalise middlemen in arms deals? |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/defence-news-modi-govt-to-legalise-middlemen-in-arms-deals/20141213.htm |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=Rediff News |date=13 December 2014}}</ref> The then defence minister [[Manohar Parrikar]] announced that in such cases, middlemen would be paid by the government for fixing arms deals under the name of "legal fees".<ref>{{cite news |last1= Doval |first1=Nikita |title=The debate over defence middlemen |url= https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ZZHAX9ICUglFcfCAqsdUMM/The-debate-over-defence-middlemen.html |accessdate= 25 October 2018 |publisher=Live Mint |date=13 January 2015}}</ref>

==Allegations against CBI==
CBI has been criticised by experts, social workers, political parties and people at large for the manner in which it has handled this case. Some points to be noted:
*Delay in lodging an [[First Information Report|FIR]]
*Delay in sending [[letter rogatory|letter rogatories]]
*Not appealing against the judgement of the [[Delhi High Court]] in 2004
*De-freezing of Quattrocchi's bank account in London by saying to the Crown Prosecutor that there is no case against Quattrocchi<ref name="Farewell Gift To The Nation- In-Law">{{cite web |url= http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?240329 |title=Farewell Gift to the Nation- In-Law |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>
