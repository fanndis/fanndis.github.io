Scotland was an independent kingdom through the [[Middle Ages]], having won [[wars of Scottish independence|wars of independence]] against [[kingdom of England|England]]. The two kingdoms were joined in [[personal union]] in 1603 when the Scottish [[King James VI]] became King James I of England, and the two kingdoms united politically in [[1707 Acts of Union|1707]]. Political campaigns for Scottish self-government began in the nineteenth century, initially in the form of demands for [[home rule]] within the United Kingdom. Two referendums on [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] were held in 1979 and 1997, with a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] being established on 1 July 1999.

The pro-independence [[Scottish National Party]] first became the governing party of the devolved parliament in 2007, and it won an outright majority of seats at the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]]. This led to an [[Edinburgh Agreement (2012)|agreement]] between the Scottish and UK governments to hold the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]]. Voters were asked: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotreferendum.com/information/|title=Scotland's Referendum 2014 - Background|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> 44.7 percent of voters answered "Yes" and 55.3 percent answered "No", with a record [[voter turnout]] of 85 percent.<ref name="No" /><ref name="Now">{{cite news|title=Referendum results: Turnout a record high as Scots vote No to independence|url=http://www.scotlandnow.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/referendum-results-turnout-record-high-4286461|accessdate=20 September 2014|work=Scotland Now|date=19 September 2014}}</ref> A [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second referendum on independence]] has been proposed, particularly since the UK voted to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]] in a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|June 2016 referendum]].

==History==
===Kingdom of Scotland===
{{Main|Kingdom of Scotland}}

Scotland emerged as an independent [[polity]] during the Early Middle Ages, with some historians dating its foundation from the reign of [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] in 843.<ref name = "Marr10">{{harv|Marr|2013|p=10}}</ref>{{NoteTag|Writing in 1992, [[Andrew Marr]] dated the formation of the Kingdom of Scotland at 1034, with the reign of [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]].}} The level of independence of the Scottish kingdom was fought over by the Scottish kings and by the [[Normans|Norman]] and [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] rulers of England who petitioned the [[Bishop of Rome|Pope]] and other foreign rulers.<ref name = "Marr10" />

A popular myth in English folklore was that Britain had been founded by [[Brutus of Troy]], who had left England to his eldest son, [[Locrinus]], and Scotland to his youngest son, [[Albanactus]].<ref name = "Marr10"/> Scots disputed this and established their own popular myth, which was that Scotland had been founded earlier, by a Greek prince [[Goídel Glas]] and his wife [[Scota]], daughter of the Pharaoh.<ref name = "Marr10"/> According to legend, Scota carried the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] from Egypt to Scotland.<ref name = "Marr10"/>

A watershed in the Scottish kingdom's history was a succession crisis that erupted in 1290 where [[Edward I of England]] claimed the right of succession to the Scottish throne. The [[Auld Alliance]] of Scotland and France against English interests was first invoked at this time and remained active through to the 1500s. The [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] ended in a renewed kingdom under [[Robert the Bruce]] (crowned 1306), whose grandson [[Robert II of Scotland]] was the first Scottish king of the [[House of Stuart]].

===Union===
[[File:Houghton STC 13011 - Hayward, Treatise.jpg|thumb|''A treatise of union of the two realmes of England and Scotland'' by the English historian [[John Hayward (historian)|Sir John Hayward]], 1604]]

From 1603, Scotland and England shared the same monarch in a [[personal union]] when [[James VI of Scotland]] was declared King of England and Ireland in what was known as the [[Union of the Crowns]]. After [[James II of England|James VII of Scotland (II of England)]] was [[Glorious Revolution|deposed in 1688]] amid Catholic-Protestant disputes, and as the line of Protestant Stuarts showed signs of failing (as indeed occurred in 1714), English fears that Scotland would select a different monarch, potentially causing conflict within Great Britain, and the bankruptcy of many Scottish nobles through the [[Darien scheme]] led to the formal union of the two kingdoms in 1707, with the [[Treaty of Union]] and subsequent [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] resistance to the union, led by descendants of James VII/II including [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], continued until 1746.

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was formed by the [[Acts of Union 1800]], which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. Following the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919&ndash;21) and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] that ended the war, Ireland was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] into two states: [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]], which opted to become independent (and is now known as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]), and [[Northern Ireland]], which chose to remain within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

===Home rule movement===
{{Main|Scottish Assembly}}
The "Home Rule" movement for a Scottish Assembly was first taken up in 1853 by the [[National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights]], a body close to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. A key element in this movement was the comparison with Ireland. The original movement broadened its political appeal and soon began to receive [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] backing.<ref name=bbchistory>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/history.shtml |title=Scottish Referendums |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 June 2007}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2016}} In 1885, the post of [[Secretary for Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Office]] were re-established to promote Scotland's interests and express its concerns to the UK Parliament. In 1886, however, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] introduced the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|Irish Home Rule Bill]]. When many Scots compared what they had to the Irish offer of Home Rule, the status quo was considered inadequate.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It was not regarded as an immediate constitutional priority however, particularly when the Irish Home Rule Bill was defeated in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

Immediately before the [[First World War]], the [[Liberal Government 1905–15|Liberal Government]] led by [[H. H. Asquith]] supported the concept of "Home Rule all round", whereby Scottish home rule would follow the Irish home rule proposed in the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]].<ref name = "Marr1">{{harv|Marr|2013|p=1}}</ref> Asquith believed that there was an iniquity in that the component parts of the United Kingdom could come together to act together in common purposes, but those components could not deal with internal matters that did not require consent across the UK.<ref name = "Marr1"/> This was not a nationalist philosophy, but instead Asquith was acting in the belief that federalism was the "true basis of union" and that centralising power in Westminster was the "worst of all political blunders".<ref name = "Marr2">{{harv|Marr|2013|p=2}}</ref> A Scottish Home Rule bill was first presented to Parliament in 1913, but its progress was soon ended as Parliament focused on emergency measures necessitated by the First World War.<ref name = "Marr2"/>

Unlike Ireland, which rebelled in the [[Easter Rising]] and fought a [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], Scotland did not resist central rule.<ref name = "Marr2"/> There was, however, a persistent demand for Scottish home rule.<ref name = "Marr2"/> The Scottish Office was relocated to [[St Andrew's House]] in [[Edinburgh]] during the 1930s.<ref name=bbchistory /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyminds.net/politics/scottish-politics/scottish-home-rule/ |title=Scottish Home Rule |publisher=Skyminds.net |accessdate=6 April 2009|date=2007-07-06 }}</ref> The [[Scottish Covenant]] was a petition to the UK Government asking for home rule. It was first proposed in 1930 by [[John MacCormick]] and formally written in 1949. The petition "was eventually signed by two million people"<ref name="1999BBC">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/the_scottish_parliament/306850.stm |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |title=Devolution's swings and roundabouts |date=7 April 1999 |accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref> (the population of Scotland was recorded as 5,100,000 in the [[Census in the United Kingdom|1951 UK Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=SRC_P&c_id=3&cpub_id=S1951PRE&show=DB |title=1951 Census: Preliminary Report &#124; |publisher=Vision of Britain |date=8 April 1951 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}</ref>). The covenant was ignored by the main political parties.<ref name="1999BBC" /> Also in 1950, the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] was removed from Westminster Abbey by a group of Scottish nationalist students.

The question of full independence, or the less controversial [[home rule]], did not re-enter the political mainstream until 1960, after the famous [[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]] speech by Conservative Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]]. This speech marked the start of a rapid [[decolonisation]] in Africa and the end of the [[British Empire]]. The UK had already suffered the international humiliation of the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], which showed that it was no longer the superpower it had been before [[World War II]]. For many in Scotland, this served to undermine one of the principal [[wikt:raison d'être|raisons d'être]] for the [[United Kingdom]] and also symbolised the end of popular [[imperialism]] and the Imperial unity that had united the then-prominent [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]]. The Unionist Party subsequently suffered a steady decline in support.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilson |first=Mike |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/come-and-join-great-debate-on-nation-s-past-present-and-future-1-678357 |title=Come and join great debate on nation's past, present and future |work=The Scotsman |date=16 January 2007|accessdate=17 October 2015 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tomorrowproject.net/pub/1__GLIMPSES/Individuals__identity_and_values/-138.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127214434/http://www.tomorrowproject.net/pub/1__GLIMPSES/Individuals__identity_and_values/-138.html|url-status=dead|title=National identities > The story so far|archivedate=27 January 2007}}</ref>

===1979 First devolution referendum===
{{main|1979 Scottish devolution referendum}}

The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) won their second-ever seat in the House of Commons in 1967, when [[Winnie Ewing]] was the unexpected winner of the [[1967 Hamilton by-election]]. The seat was previously a safe Labour Party seat, and this victory brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to [[Edward Heath]]'s 1968 [[Declaration of Perth]] and the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/c20scot.shtml |title=Scottish Referendums |publisher=BBC |date=30 November 1990 |accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> The discovery of [[North Sea oil]] off the east coast of Scotland in 1970 further invigorated the debate over Scottish independence.<ref name=bbchistory2>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/c20scot.shtml |title= The Devolution Debate This Century |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 June 2007}}</ref> The SNP organised a hugely successful campaign entitled "[[It's Scotland's oil]]", emphasising how the discovery of oil could benefit Scotland's struggling [[Deindustrialization|deindustrialising]] economy and its populace.<ref name=McCrone>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/how-black-gold-was-hijacked-north-sea-oil-and-the-betrayal-of-scotland-518697.html |title=How black gold was hijacked: North sea oil and the betrayal of Scotland |work=The Independent |date= 10 June 2007|accessdate=17 October 2015 | location=London | first1=Ben | last1=Russell | first2=Paul | last2=Kelbie}}</ref> At the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], seven SNP MPs were elected. The general election resulted in a hung parliament, so Prime Minister Harold Wilson called a second election for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]], when the SNP performed even better than in February, winning 11 seats and obtaining over 30% of the total vote in Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74b/seats74b.htm |title= Regional distribution of seats and percentage vote |publisher=psr.keele.ac.uk |accessdate=21 June 2007}}</ref>

In January 1974, the Conservative government had commissioned the [[McCrone report]], written by Professor Gavin McCrone, a leading government economist, to report on the viability of an independent Scotland. He concluded that oil would have given an independent Scotland one of the strongest currencies in Europe. The report went on to say that officials advised government ministers on how to take "the wind out of the SNP sails". Handed over to the incoming Labour government and classified as secret because of Labour fears over the surge in Scottish National Party popularity, the document came to light only in 2005, when the SNP obtained the report under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4238744.stm|title=Papers reveal oil fears over SNP|publisher=BBC|date=12 September 2005|accessdate=9 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oilofscotland.org/mccronereport.pdf|title=Scottish Economic Planning Department}}</ref>

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Harold Wilson]], won the October 1974 general election with the very narrow majority of only three seats. Following their election to Parliament, the SNP MPs pressed for the creation of a Scottish Assembly: a viewpoint which was given added credibility by the conclusions of the Kilbrandon Commission. However, opponents demanded that a referendum be held on the issue. Although the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party both officially supported [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]], support was split in both parties. Labour was divided between those who favoured devolution and those who wanted to maintain a full central Westminster government. In the SNP, there was division between those who saw devolution as a stepping stone to independence and those who feared it might detract from that ultimate goal.<ref name=bbchistory2 /> The resignation of Harold Wilson from office in 1976 brought [[James Callaghan]] to power, but his small majority was eroded by several by-election losses, and the government became increasingly unpopular. Deals were made with the SNP and [[Plaid Cymru]] to hold referendums on devolution in exchange for their support, helping to prolong the government's life.

The result of the referendum in Scotland was a narrow majority in favour of devolution (52% to 48%),<ref name=bbchistory2 /> but a condition of the referendum was that 40% of the total electorate should vote in favour in order to make it valid. But the turnout was only 63.6%, so only 32.9% of the electorate voted "Yes". The [[Scotland Act 1978]] was consequently repealed in March 1979 by a vote of 301–206 in Parliament. In the wake of the referendum, the supporters of the bill conducted a protest campaign under the slogan "Scotland said yes". They argued that the 40% rule was undemocratic and that the referendum results justified the establishment of the assembly. Campaigners for a "No" vote countered that voters had been told before the referendum that failing to vote was as good as a "No".<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960426/debtext/60426-18.htm |title=Hansard record of 26 April 1996 : Column 735 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=26 April 1996 |accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> It was therefore incorrect to conclude that the relatively low turnout was entirely due to [[Voter fatigue|voter apathy]].

In protest, the SNP withdrew their support from the government. A [[motion of no confidence]] was then tabled by the Conservatives and supported by the SNP, the Liberals and [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionists]]. It passed by one vote on 28 March 1979, forcing the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|May 1979 general election]], which was won by the Conservatives led by [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Prime Minister Callaghan described the decision of the SNP to bring down the Labour government as "[[turkeys voting for Christmas]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/pastelec/ge79.htm |title=BBC report on 1979 election |publisher=BBC |date=3 May 1979 |accessdate=6 April 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050515202157/http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/pastelec/ge79.htm |archivedate = 15 May 2005}}</ref><ref>''Hansard'', House of Commons, 5th series, vol. 965, col. 471.</ref> The SNP group was reduced from 11 MPs to 2 at the 1979 general election, while devolution was opposed by the Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and [[John Major]].

===1997 Second devolution referendum===
{{main|1997 Scottish devolution referendum}}
[[File:Debating chamber, Scottish Parliament (31-05-2006).jpg|thumb|left|[[Debating]] chamber of the [[Scottish Parliament]]]]

Supporters of Scottish independence continued to hold mixed views on the [[Scottish Assembly|Home Rule]] movement which included many supporters of union who wanted devolution within the framework of the [[United Kingdom]]. Some saw it as a stepping stone to independence, while others wanted to go straight for independence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/snp-should-return-to-the-honest-argument-on-independence-1-662274 |title= SNP should return to the honest argument on independence |work=The Scotsman |date= 23 August 2003|accessdate=17 October 2015 |location=Edinburgh |first=Campbell |last=Martin}}</ref>

In the years of the Conservative government after 1979, the [[Campaign for a Scottish Assembly]] was established, eventually publishing the [[Claim of Right 1989]]. This then led to the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]]. The convention promoted consensus on devolution on a cross-party basis, though the Conservative Party refused to co-operate and the Scottish National Party withdrew from the discussions when it became clear that the convention was unwilling to discuss Scottish independence as a constitutional option.<ref name=bbchistory2 /> Arguments against devolution and the Scottish Parliament, levelled mainly by the Conservative Party, were that the Parliament would create a "slippery slope" to Scottish independence and provide the pro-independence Scottish National Party with a route to government.<ref name="Devolution">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaystory.cfm?story_id=326221 |title=Breaking the Old Place up |work=The Economist|date=4 November 1999 |accessdate=14 October 2006}}</ref> Prime Minister [[John Major]] campaigned during the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] on the slogan "72 hours to save the union".

The Labour Party won the 1997 general election in a landslide, and [[Donald Dewar]] as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] agreed to the proposals for a [[Scottish Parliament]]. A referendum was held in September and 74.3% of those who voted approved the devolution plan (44.87% of the electorate).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/electoral_commission_pdf_file/0015/13272/TheScottishParliament_18312-6142__S__.pdf |title=Scottish Parliament Factsheet 2003 |publisher=The Electoral Commission |accessdate=16 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806181555/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/electoral_commission_pdf_file/0015/13272/TheScottishParliament_18312-6142__S__.pdf |archivedate=6 August 2012}}</ref> The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] subsequently approved the [[Scotland Act 1998]] which created an elected Scottish Parliament with control over most domestic policy.<ref name=bbchistory2 /> In May 1999, Scotland held its [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first election]] for a devolved parliament and in July the Scottish Parliament held session for the first time since the previous parliament had been adjourned in 1707. Donald Dewar of the Labour Party subsequently became the [[First Minister of Scotland]], while the Scottish National Party became the main opposition party. With the approval of all parties, the egalitarian song "[[A Man's A Man for A' That]]", by [[Robert Burns]], was performed at the opening ceremony of the Scottish Parliament.

The Scottish Parliament is a [[unicameral]] [[legislature]] comprising 129 [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|members]], 73 of whom represent individual [[Scottish Parliament constituencies|constituencies]] and are elected on a [[first past the post]] system; 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the [[additional member system (Scottish Parliament)|additional member system]]. Members serve for a four-year term. The monarch appoints one [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]], on the nomination of the Parliament, to be [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] with the convention being that the leader of the party with the largest number of seats is appointed First Minister, although any member who can command the confidence of the chamber could conceivably be appointed First Minister. All other Ministers are appointed and dismissed by the First Minister and together they make up the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] arm of [[government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Ministers|title=About Scottish Ministers|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>

The Scottish Parliament has [[legislative]] authority for all non-[[reserved and excepted matters|reserved matters]] relating to Scotland, and has a limited power to vary income tax, nicknamed the [[Tartan Tax]], a power it did not exercise and which was later replaced by wider tax-varying powers. The Scottish Parliament can refer devolved matters back to Westminster to be considered as part of United Kingdom-wide legislation by passing a [[Legislative Consent Motion]] if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered to be more appropriate for certain issues. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament since 1999 have seen a divergence in the provision of [[public services]] compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. For instance, the costs of a university education, and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places in March 2006.<ref>BBC Scotland News Online "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4845260.stm Scotland begins pub smoking ban]", ''BBC Scotland News'', 2006-03-26.

The BBC website announced the final result of the referendum at 06:24 on 19 September 2014: the "No" vote prevailed with 55% (2,001,926) of the votes from an overall voter turnout of 84.5%. Chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly stated: "It is clear that the majority of people voting have voted No to the referendum question." The "Yes" vote received 45% (1,617,989) support—the winning total needed was 1,852,828. Results were compiled from 32 council areas, with Glasgow backing independence—voting 53.5% "Yes" to 46.5% "No" (turnout in the area was 75%)—and Edinburgh voting against independence by 61% to 39% (turnout in the area was 84%).

===British withdrawal from the European Union===

The legality of any British constituent country attaining ''[[de facto]]'' independence or declaring unilateral independence outside the framework of British constitutional convention is debatable. Under [[international law]], a unilateral declaration might satisfy the principle of the "[[declarative theory of statehood]]", but not the "[[constitutive theory of statehood]]". Some legal opinion following the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]'s [[Reference re Secession of Quebec|decision]] on what steps Quebec would need to take to secede is that Scotland would be unable to unilaterally declare independence under international law if the British government permitted a referendum on an unambiguous question on secession.<ref>''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1096974 The Moder Law Review]'' Vol. 62, No. 3, May 1999.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article1293929.ece |title=Scotland and the thorny road to independence |work=The Times |date=18 January 2007|accessdate=6 April 2009 |location=London |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Adam |last2=Sage}}</ref> The SNP have not argued for a unilateral act, but rather claim that a positive vote for independence in a referendum would have "enormous moral and political force... impossible for a future [Westminster] government to ignore",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/a-national-conversation/Your-Questions-Answered|title=Your Questions Answered|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=12 January 2012|date=2008-08-14}}</ref> and hence would give the Scottish Government a mandate to negotiate for the passage of an act of the UK Parliament providing for Scotland's secession, in which Westminster renounces its sovereignty over Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13326310 |title=Q&A: Scottish independence referendum|publisher=BBC |work=BBC News|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>

Some arguments appeal to [[rule according to higher law]].  For example, the [[United Nations Charter]] enshrines the right of peoples to self-determination, and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] also guarantees peoples' right to change nationality; the UK is a signatory to both documents. Politicians in both the Scottish and British parliaments have endorsed the right of the Scottish people to [[self-determination]], including former UK Prime Ministers [[John Major]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Hazell, Robert.

The [[Edinburgh Agreement (2012)]] between the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament stated that both governments would accept the outcome of the referendum and thereafter would "continue to work together constructively in the light of the outcome, whatever it is, in the best interests of the people of Scotland and of the rest of the United Kingdom".<ref name = "edin ag">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Government/concordats/Referendum-on-independence|title=Agreement between the Scottish Government and the United Kingdom Government on the referendum on independence for Scotland|publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> The agreement gave the Scottish Parliament the legal authority to hold an independence referendum before the end of 2014.<ref name = "edin ag"/>

==Support for independence==
===Political parties===
[[File:Scottish Socialist Party fly poster.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fly poster]] from the Scottish Socialist Party]]

Scottish independence is supported most prominently by the [[Scottish National Party]], but other parties also support independence. Other pro-independence parties which have held representation in the Scottish Parliament include the [[Scottish Green Party]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/47aa8386-5b1a-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b |title=Sturgeon postpones plans for second Scottish independence referendum |first=Mure |last=Dickie |date=27 June 2017 |accessdate=24 September 2017 |work=Financial Times }}</ref> the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] and [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://independentleft.ie/socialists-and-scottish-independence/ |title=Socialists and Scottish Independence |first=Colm |last=Breathnach |date=17 October 2020 |accessdate=19 October 2020 |work=[[Independent Left (Ireland)]]}}</ref> At the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], 69 of the 129 seats available were won by pro-independence parties (63 SNP and 6 Greens). The independence movement consists of many factions with varying political views. The SNP wants Scotland to keep the monarchy (see [[personal union]]) and become an independent [[Commonwealth realm]], similar to Canada, Australia or New Zealand. All of the other aforementioned pro-independence parties want Scotland to become an independent republic. The SSP has led republican protests and authored the [[Declaration of Calton Hill]], calling for an independent republic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1323939,00.html |title= Holyrood survives birth pains |work=The Guardian | date=10 October 2004|accessdate=21 June 2007 | location=London | first=Lorna | last=Martin}}</ref>

===Other organisations===
The [[Scottish Independence Convention|Independence Convention]] was set up in 2005, seeking "Firstly, to create a forum for those of all political persuasions and none who support independence; and secondly, to be a national catalyst for Scottish independence."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2012/jun/22/scottish-independence-campaign-groups |title=The claymore count: the groups fighting for and against Scottish independence |first=Severin |last=Carrell |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate= 29 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishindependenceconvention.com/Introduction.asp |title= Introduction: Aims and Questions |publisher=Scottish Independence Convention |accessdate=4 July 2007}}</ref> The [[Scottish Republican Socialist Movement]] is a Pan-Socialist independence movement that believes that Scotland should be made an independent republic. This movement has a Firebrand socialist ethos, however is not affiliated with the SSP or the Scottish Communist Party. It believes that a failure to become independent should lead to mass emigration elsewhere, or as put as a slogan "Independence or Desertion".

Apart from the official [[Yes Scotland]] campaign for independence in the 2014 referendum, other groups in support of independence were formed at that time. This included the [[National Collective]], an artist-driven movement which describes itself as "an open and non-party political collaboration of talent focused on driving social and political change in Scotland through a variety of the arts".<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://nationalcollective.com/about-us/|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref> It was responsible for organising a mock referendum held at the [[University of Glasgow]] in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish independence: Glasgow University students plan ballot|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21066510|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=13 February 2013|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Join the Debate: Glasgow Launches Independence Referendum|url=http://nationalcollective.com/2013/01/18/join-the-debate-glasgow-launches-independence-referendum/|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref> Another group, the [[Radical Independence Campaign]], described itself as "fighting for an independent Scotland that is for the millions not the millionaires". RIC was formed after the Radical Independence Conference 2012 in Glasgow, which was attended by at least 650 people and has been described as a "[bringing together of] the Scottish Greens, the Scottish Socialists, some of the more militant trade unionists, nuclear-disarmament campaigners and anti-monarchist republicans".<ref>{{cite news|title=Radicals threaten Salmond and Scottish independence campaign |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/radicals-threaten-salmond-and-scottish-independence-campaign-8347545.html|date=24 November 2012|accessdate=13 February 2013|location=London|work=The Independent}}</ref>

During the 2014 referendum campaign, independence attracted little support from newspapers. The ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' was the only publication to endorse a "Yes" vote in the referendum.<ref name = "national"/><ref>[http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2014/news/scottish-newspapers-divide-over-referendum-vote/ "Scottish newspapers divide over referendum vote"].

In October 2014, the lobby group [[All Under One Banner]] (AUOB) was formed. AUOB stages regular public marches in support of Scottish independence throughout Scotland.

* Democracy and national self-determination: Scotland's population would possess full decision-making power in regard to the political affairs of its nation. [[Alex Salmond]] stated in a May 2012 launch that "the people who live in Scotland are best placed to make the decisions that affect Scotland."<ref>{{cite news|title='Scotland's future will be in Scotland's hands'|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/scotlands-future-will-be-in-scotlands-hands.17666615|accessdate=13 June 2014|work=Herald Scotland|date=26 May 2012}}</ref> An example of this is [[Brexit]], which happened because 52% of voters across the UK voted to leave the [[European Union]], but 62% of voters in Scotland had voted against this.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results |title=Results |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 November 2020}}</ref>
* Nuclear disarmament: with control over defence and foreign policy, an independent Scotland could demand the removal of Trident nuclear weapons, which are based in the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Nuclear disarmament is an issue long associated with the campaign for an independent Scotland, as outlined in the House of Commons Defence Committee's white paper "The future of the UK's strategic nuclear deterrent: the White Paper" of 2006–2007.<ref name="Committee2007">{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Defence Committee|title=The future of the UK's strategic nuclear deterrent: the White Paper, ninth report of session 2006-07, Vol. 2: Oral and written evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKMfYAUzOWgC&pg=PA167|date=7 March 2007|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-03280-5|pages=167–}}</ref><ref>"The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power", edited by [[Gerry Hassan]], Edinburgh University Press: Edinburgh, p. 29 and p. 156</ref> The [[Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] supports independence on this basis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scots CND backs Yes campaign|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/scots-cnd-backs-yes-campaign.19448929|accessdate=13 June 2014|work=Herald Scotland|agency=Herald & Times Group|date=19 November 2012}}</ref>

There are strong historical and contemporary ties between Scotland and the rest of the UK from the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Union of Crowns]], to Scottish involvement in the growth and development of the [[British Empire]] and contribution of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]. Contemporary [[popular culture]] is also shared, primarily through the prevalence of the [[English language]]. Almost half of the Scottish population have relatives in England.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/opinion/The-Union-Jocks.3786184.jp|title= The Union Jocks |newspaper=Scotland on Sunday |date= 17 February 2008|accessdate=25 June 2008}}</ref> At the time of the 2011 census, approximately 700,000 adults who were born in Scotland lived in the rest of the UK, while about 470,000 adults who were born elsewhere in the UK had moved to live in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27655496|title=Scottish independence: The Scots in England who want Scotland to go it alone|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=8 September 2014|date=7 August 2014|last1=Eardley|first1=Nick}}</ref> There are also significant economic links with the Scottish [[military-industrial complex]]<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1171132007 |title= Doubts raised over future of shipyards under independence |work=The Scotsman |date= 27 July 2007|accessdate=20 August 2007 |location=Edinburgh |first=Louise |last=Gray}}</ref> as well as close links within the financial sector.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3639114/Scots-and-English-flourish-in-the-Union.html|title=Scots and English flourish in the Union |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 April 2007|accessdate=20 June 2007|location=London}}</ref>

Reasons cited in favour of maintaining the Union include:
* Scotland would be economically stronger as a part of the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|UK economy]] and better able to prosper in a [[Globalization|globalised]] economy with the international influence and stability derived from being part of a larger state.<ref name="gamble">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/evandavis/2007/04/the_scottish_gamble_1.html |title= The Scottish gamble |work=BBC News|date= 30 April 2007|accessdate=20 June 2007}}</ref>
* Scotland's levels of [[Public finance|public spending]] would be difficult to sustain after independence without raising taxes for those in an independent Scotland. For example, David Maddox, writing for ''[[The Scotsman]]'' in 2008, pointed to a future [[Peak oil]] decline in [[North Sea oil]] revenue,<ref name="Maddox">{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Oil-price-fuels-fresh-row.4209389.jp |title= Oil price fuels fresh row on Scots 'deficit'|work=The Scotsman|date= 21 June 2008|accessdate=25 June 2008|location=Edinburgh|first=David|last=Maddox}}</ref> within ten years oil revenue had fallen to 10% of the 2008 peak.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/government-expenditure-revenue-scotland-gers-2019-20/pages/4/ |title=Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) 2019-2020 |publisher=gov.scot |date=26 August 2020}}</ref> Some, such as [[Ruth Davidson]] of the [[Scottish Conservatives]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/26/scottish-tories-call-greater-powers|title=Scottish Tories reverse anti-devolution stance with call for greater powers|date=2013-03-26|accessdate=3 April 2013 |location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Severin|last=Carrell}}</ref> wish to reduce public spending and devolve more fiscal powers to the Scottish Parliament in order to address this issue within the broader framework of the Union.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/study-finds-no-benefit-in-fiscal-autonomy-as-mccrone-calls-time-on-barnett-1-679580 |title=Study finds no benefit in fiscal autonomy as McCrone calls time on Barnett |first=Louise |last=Gray |work=The Scotsman |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4803758.stm|title= 'Billions needed' to boost growth |work=BBC News |date= 14 March 2006|accessdate=18 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/public-private-sectors-in-economy-need-to-be-rebalanced-1-486122|title= Public/private sectors in economy need to be rebalanced |work=The Scotsman |date= 15 March 2006|accessdate=5 January 2016 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref>
* As part of the UK, Scotland has more influence on [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|international affairs]] and diplomacy, both [[Soft power|politically]] and [[Hard power|militarily]], as part of [[NATO]], the [[G8]], and as a permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Opponents of further integration of the European Union claimed that independence, within Europe but outside the ''[[EU three]]'', would mean that Scotland would be more marginalised because, as a relatively small independent country, Scotland would be unable to resist the demands of larger member nations.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.globalpolitician.com/articledes.asp?ID=2725&cid=3&sid=74 |title= Scottish Independence – Reality or Illusion? |magazine=Global Politician |date= 5 January 2007|accessdate=20 June 2007}}</ref>
* What would be the currency of an independent Scotland – the pound, the euro, or an entirely new Scottish currency? Uncertainty could be brought in the immediate aftermath of independence, particularly disagreement as to how Scotland would be treated in relation to the [[European Union]], and the unlikelihood of the remaining UK accepting a [[currency union]] with an independent Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bettertogether.net/blog/entry/the-european-union-and-the-united-kingdom-union |title=The European Union and the United Kingdom Union |publisher=Better Together |accessdate=18 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024091614/http://bettertogether.net/blog/entry/the-european-union-and-the-united-kingdom-union |archivedate=24 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bettertogether.net/blog/entry/nationalist-plans-on-currency-and-tax-are-falling-apart |title=Nationalist plans on currency and tax are falling apart |publisher=Better Together |accessdate=18 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024091617/http://bettertogether.net/blog/entry/nationalist-plans-on-currency-and-tax-are-falling-apart |archivedate=24 October 2013}}</ref> The chairman of [[HSBC]], [[Douglas Flint]], warned in August 2014 of uncertainty if there was an independent Scottish currency, or if Scotland joined the [[Eurozone]], which could result in [[capital flight]].<ref name="ScotlandHSBC">{{cite news|title=Weak Scottish currency will cause capital flight after independence says HSBC boss|url=http://www.scotlandnews.net/index.php/sid/225040621|date=23 August 2014|accessdate=23 August 2014|publisher=Scotland News.Net}}</ref>
