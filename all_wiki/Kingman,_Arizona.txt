==History==

Lt. [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale]], a U.S. Navy officer in the service of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#Corps of Topographical Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]], was ordered by the [[U.S. War Department]] to build a federal wagon road across the 35th Parallel. His secondary orders were to test the feasibility of the use of camels as pack animals in the southwestern desert. Beale traveled through the present day Kingman in 1857 surveying the road and in 1859 to build the road. [[Beale's Wagon Road]] became part of [[U.S. Route 66|Highway 66]] and [[Interstate 40|Interstate Highway 40]]. Remnants of the wagon road can still be seen in White Cliffs Canyon in Kingman.

Kingman, Arizona, was founded in 1882, when Arizona was still [[Arizona Territory]]. Situated in the Hualapai Valley between the [[Cerbat Mountains|Cerbat]] and [[Hualapai Mountains|Hualapai]] mountain ranges, Kingman is known for its very modest beginnings as a simple railroad siding near Beale's Springs in the Middleton Section along the newly constructed route of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]]. The city of Kingman was named for [[Lewis Kingman]], who surveyed along the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad's right-of-way between [[Needles, California|Needles, Calif.]], and [[Albuquerque, NM|Albuquerque, N.M.]] Lewis Kingman supervised the building of the railroad from [[Winslow, AZ|Winslow, Ariz.]] to Beale's Springs, which is near the present location of the town of Kingman.

The Mohave County seat originally was located in [[Mohave City, Arizona|Mohave City]] from 1864 to 1867. The portion of Arizona Territory west of the [[Colorado River]] was transferred to Nevada in 1865 after Nevada's statehood, and became part of [[Lincoln County, Nevada]] later [[Clark County, Nevada]]. The remaining territory of [[Pah-Ute County, Arizona Territory|Pah-Ute County]] became part of Mohave County. Its seat was moved to [[Hardyville, Arizona|Hardyville]] (which is now within [[Bullhead City, Arizona|Bullhead City]]) in 1867. The county seat transferred to the mining town of [[Cerbat, Arizona|Cerbat]] in 1873, then to [[Mineral Park, Arizona|Mineral Park]] near [[Chloride, Arizona|Chloride]] in 1877. In 1887, the county seat was moved to Kingman after some period of time without a permanent county seat, the instruments and records of Mohave County government were taken clandestinely from Chloride and moved to Kingman in the middle of the night during this final transfer of the county seat.

During World War II, Kingman was the site of a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] (USAAF) airfield. The [[Kingman Army Airfield]] was founded at the beginning of WW II as an aerial gunnery training base. It became one of the USAAF's largest, training some 35,000 soldiers and airmen. The airfield and Kingman played a significant role in this important era of America's history. Following the war, the Kingman Airfield served as one of the largest and best-known reclamation sites for obsolete military aircraft.

Postwar, Kingman experienced growth as several major employers moved into the vicinity. In 1953 Kingman was used to detain those men accused of practicing polygamy in the [[Short Creek raid]],<ref>{{citation |last= Zoellner |first= Tom |date= June 28, 1998 |title= Polygamy: Throughout its history, Colorado City has been home for those who believe in virtues of plural marriage |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |page= J1 |id= Archive Article ID: 100F28A4D3D36BEC ([[NewsBank]]) |url= http://www.sltrib.com/1998/jun/06281998/sunday_a/sunday_a.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20000505002302/http://www.sltrib.com/1998/jun/06281998/sunday_a/sunday_a.htm |archivedate= 2000-05-05 }}</ref> which was at the time one of the largest arrests in American history.<ref>C.R. Waters, ''Mohave Miner'', 1953-08-30.</ref> In 1955, Ford Motor Company established a [[Ford Proving Grounds#Arizona Proving Ground (APG) - Yucca, Arizona|proving ground]] (now one of the [[Chrysler Proving Grounds#Arizona Proving Ground (Yucca, Arizona)|Chrysler Proving Grounds]]) in nearby [[Yucca, Arizona]] at the former [[Yucca Army Airfield]]. Several major new neighborhoods in Kingman were developed to house the skilled workers and professionals employed at the proving ground, as Kingman was the only sizable, developed town within a convenient distance. Likewise, the development of the [[Mineral Park mine]] near adjacent [[Chloride, Arizona]], and construction of the [[Mohave Generating Station]] in nearby [[Laughlin, Nevada]], in 1971 contributed to Kingman's population growth. The location of a [[General Cable]] plant at what was to become the Kingman Airport Industrial Park provided a steady employment base as well.

===Kingman Explosion===
{{Main|Kingman Explosion}}
The Kingman Explosion, also known as the Doxol Disaster or Kingman BLEVE, was a catastrophic [[boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion]] (BLEVE) that occurred on July 5, 1973 in Kingman. The explosion occurred during a [[propane]] transfer from a Doxol railroad car to a storage tank on the Getz rail siding near Andy Devine Avenue/Route 66.

Firefighters Memorial Park in Kingman is dedicated to those 11 firefighters who died in the blaze.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|30.0|sqmi|km2}}, all land.

The city is divided into two different agglomerations; the north side, which is home to most businesses and where most of the population lives, and the older south side which contains most government buildings and a minority of the city’s residents. The two halves are separated by a ridge of the [[Cerbat Mountains]].

==Climate==
Kingman sits on the eastern edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], but it is located in a cold [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'') due to its [[plateau]] location. The ''BSk'' climate type receives slightly more precipitation than the ''BWh'' hot [[desert climate]] found to the south and west, and the wintertime low temperatures are significantly colder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=15137&cityname=Kingman,+Arizona,+United+States+of+America|title=Kingman, Arizona Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Kingman's higher elevation and location between the [[Colorado Plateau]] and the [[Lower Colorado River Valley]] keeps summer high temperatures away from the extremes ({{convert|115|F|C}} or more) experienced by Phoenix and the Colorado River Valley. The higher elevation also contributes to winter cold and occasional snowfall. Summer daytime highs reach above {{convert|90|F|C}} frequently, but rarely exceed {{convert|107|F|C}}. Summertime lows usually remain between {{convert|60|to|70|F|C}}. Winter highs are generally mild, ranging from around {{convert|50|to|60|F|C}}, but winter nighttime lows often fall to freezing, with significantly lower temperatures possible. Kingman occasionally receives a dusting of snow in the winter, though it rarely remains on the ground for longer than mid-to-late morning.

The record low temperature in Kingman was set on January 9, 1937 at {{convert|6|F|C}}, and the record high temperature occurred on June 20, 2017, at {{convert|113|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. The wettest year was 1919 with {{convert|21.22|in|mm}} and the driest year was 1947 with {{convert|3.58|in|mm}}. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|9.85|in|mm}} in September 1939. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|6.03|in|mm}} on November 28, 1919. The snowiest year was 1949 with {{convert|18.2|in|m}}. The most snowfall in one month was {{convert|14.0|in|m}} in December 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?az4639 |title=KINGMAN, ARIZONA - Climate Summary |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?az4645 |title=KINGMAN #2, ARIZONA - Climate Summary |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}</ref> On December 31, 2014 and January 1, 2015, Kingman received 6.5 inches of snow. The storm was so significant that it was a contributing factor for closing Interstate 40 at the US 93 Junction for 24 hours.

===Airport===
The [[Kingman Airport (Arizona)|Kingman Airport]] is located nine miles northeast of Kingman on [[Arizona State Route 66]]. The airport was originally built as Kingman Army Air Field during World War II, and was home to the Kingman Aerial Gunnery School. After the war, large numbers of USAAF aircraft were stored and dismantled at Kingman. The airport was turned over to Mohave County for civilian use in 1949. Today, the airport has [[air ambulance]] and [[air charter]] services. The airport continues to be used as a location for long-term aircraft storage due to its suitable large ramp space and a long decommissioned runway. Kingman is a [[non-towered airport]].

===Rail===
Kingman has passenger rail service at its [[Kingman (Amtrak station)|train station]]. It is served by the [[Southwest Chief|Amtrak Southwest Chief]] route, with daily service between [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]]. The small Amtrak station in downtown Kingman is a historically significant building, constructed in [[Mission Revival Style architecture]]; however, prior to the establishment of [[Amtrak]] in 1971, the structure had fallen into disrepair with the decline of passenger rail service in the U.S. A total renovation of the building was completed in 2010.
