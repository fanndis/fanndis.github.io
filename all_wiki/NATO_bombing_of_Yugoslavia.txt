{{Campaignbox Kosovo War}}

The '''NATO bombing of Yugoslavia''' was the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]]'s (NATO) military operation against the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. The air strikes lasted from March 24, 1999 to June 10, 1999. The bombings continued until an agreement was reached that led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav armed forces from Kosovo, and the establishment of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]], a UN [[peacekeeping]] mission in Kosovo. The official NATO operation code name was "Operation Allied Force" whereas the [[United States]] called it "Operation Noble Anvil";<ref name="Towards a common European security and defense policy: the ways and means of making it a reality" /> in Yugoslavia the operation was incorrectly called "Merciful Angel" ({{lang-sr|Милосрдни анђео}} / ''Milosrdni anđeo'') as a result of a misunderstanding or mistranslation.<ref name="RTS-2009">[[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]]: [http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0/52257/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE+%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0+%22%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8+%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%92%D0%B5%D0%BE%22 "Порекло имена 'Милосрдни анђео'" ("On the origin of the name 'Merciful Angel'")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102044701/http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0/52257/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE+%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0+%22%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8+%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%92%D0%B5%D0%BE%22|date=November 2, 2012}}, March 26, 2009 {{in lang|sr}}</ref>

NATO's intervention was prompted by Yugoslavia's bloodshed and ethnic cleansing of Albanians, which drove the Albanians into neighbouring countries and had the potential to destabilize the region. Yugoslavia's actions had already provoked condemnation by international organisations and agencies such as the UN, [[NATO]], and various [[International non-governmental organisation|INGO]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Robert S.|title=International organizations: A comparative approach to the management of cooperation|page=129|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275965495}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Yoshihara|first=Susan Fink|chapter=Kosovo|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flashpointsinwar00reve/page/67 67]–68|editor1-last=Reveron|editor1-first=Derek S.|editor2-last=Murer|editor2-first=Jeffrey Stevenson|title=Flashpoints in the War on Terrorism|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/flashpointsinwar00reve|chapter-url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135449315}}</ref>
NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] for military action, but were opposed by [[China]] and [[Russia]], who indicated that they would [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] such a measure. As a result, NATO launched its campaign without the UN's approval, stating that it was a [[humanitarian intervention]]. [[Charter of the United Nations|The UN Charter]] prohibits the use of force except in the case of a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or self-defence against an armed attack – neither of which were present in this case.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=Mary Ellen|date=2000|title=The UN, NATO, and International Law after Kosovo|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=22|issue=1|pages=57–89|doi=10.1353/hrq.2000.0012|jstor=4489267|s2cid=146137597|issn=0275-0392}}</ref>

The bombing killed about 1,000 members of the Yugoslav security forces in addition to between 489 and 528 civilians. It destroyed or damaged bridges, industrial plants, hospitals, schools, cultural monuments, private businesses as well as barracks and military installations. In the days after the Yugoslav army withdrew, over 164,000 Serbs and 24,000 Roma left Kosovo. Many of the remaining non-Albanian civilians (as well as Albanians perceived as collaborators) were victims of abuse which included beatings, abductions, and murders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kosov2/|title=Abuses against Serbs and Roma in the new Kosovo|date=August 1999|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wkQ3I6GyClEC&pg=PA29|title=After Yugoslavia: Identities and Politics Within the Successor States|date=2012|page=30|isbn=9780230201316|last1=Hudson|first1=Robert|last2=Bowman|first2=Glenn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/3ae6b80f2c.html|title=Kosovo Crisis Update|date=August 4, 1999|publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/21342?download=true|title=Forced Expulsion of Kosovo Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians from OSCE Participated state to Kosovo|date=October 6, 2006|publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]}}</ref><ref name="Siobhán Wills 219">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoqQ7kBrlSAC&pg=PA219|title=Protecting Civilians: The Obligations of Peacekeepers|date=26 February 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-953387-9|page=219|author=Siobhán Wills|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> After Kosovo and other [[Yugoslav Wars]], Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and [[Internally displaced person|IDPs]] (including Kosovo Serbs) in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2011&mm=06&dd=20&nav_id=75016|title=Serbia home to highest number of refugees and IDPs in Europe|date=20 June 2010|publisher=[[B92]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/serbia/24323?download=true|title=Serbia: Europe's largest proctracted refugee situation|date=2008|publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=el-YZHB8hzYC&pg=PP1|title=Shaping South East Europe's Security Community for the Twenty-First Century: Trust, Partnership, Integration|date=7 May 2013|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|page=169|author=S.

The bombing was NATO's second major combat operation, following the [[Operation Deliberate Force|1995 bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was the first time that NATO had used military force without the expressed endorsement of the UN Security Council, which triggered debates over the [[Legitimacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|legitimacy of the intervention]].

==Background==
{{transcluded section|Yugoslav Wars}}
{{#section::Yugoslav Wars|KosovoWar}}

==Goals==
[[NATO]]'s objectives in the [[Kosovo conflict]] were stated at the [[North Atlantic Council]] meeting held at NATO headquarters in [[Brussels]] on April 12, 1999:<ref name="NATO_situation"/>
* An end to all military action and the immediate termination of [[War crimes in the Kosovo War|violence and repressive activities by the Milosevic government]];
* Withdrawal of all military, police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo;
* Stationing of UN peacekeeping presence in Kosovo;
* Unconditional and safe return of all [[refugee]]s and displaced persons;
* Establishment of a political framework agreement for Kosovo based on [[Rambouillet Accords]], in conformity with [[international law]] and the [[Charter of the United Nations]].

==Strategy==
Operation Allied Force predominantly used a large-scale [[aerial warfare|air campaign]] to destroy Yugoslav military infrastructure from high altitudes. After the third day of aerial bombing, NATO had destroyed almost all of its strategic military targets in Yugoslavia. Despite this, the Yugoslav army continued to function and to attack [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) insurgents inside Kosovo, mostly in the regions of Northern and Southwest Kosovo. NATO bombed strategic economic and societal targets, such as bridges, military facilities, official government facilities, and factories, using long-range cruise missiles to hit heavily defended targets, such as strategic installations in [[Belgrade]] and [[Pristina]]. The NATO air forces also targeted infrastructure, such as power plants (using the [[Graphite bomb|BLU-114/B "Soft-Bomb"]]), water-processing plants and the state-owned broadcaster, causing much environmental and economic damage throughout Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The [[Rand Corporation]] examined the issue in a study.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1365/MR1365.ch4.pdf |title=Why Milosevic Decided to Settle the Conflict Over Kosovo When He Did|access-date=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904010418/https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1365/MR1365.ch4.pdf |archive-date=September 4, 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>{{clarify|date=April 2017}} The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] then-foreign minister [[Jozias van Aartsen]] said that the strikes on Yugoslavia should be such as to weaken their military capabilities and prevent further humanitarian atrocities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://international.sp.nl/sites/international.sp.nl/files/the_last_war.pdf |title=The Last War of the 20th century |access-date=March 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830064549/http://international.sp.nl/sites/international.sp.nl/files/the_last_war.pdf |archive-date=August 30, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}

Due to restrictive media laws, media in Yugoslavia carried little coverage of what its forces were doing in Kosovo, or of other countries' attitudes to the humanitarian crisis; so, few members of the public expected bombing, instead thinking that a diplomatic deal would be made.<ref>{{cite book|last= Judah|title= The Serbs|publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 978-0-300-15826-7|page= 327|year= 2009}}</ref>

===Arguments for strategic air power===
According to [[John Keegan]], the capitulation of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War marked a turning point in the history of warfare. It "proved that a war can be won by air power alone". Diplomacy had failed before the war, and the deployment of a large NATO ground force was still weeks away when [[Slobodan Milošević]] agreed to a peace deal.<ref name="telegraph"/>

As for why air power should have been capable of acting alone, it has been argued{{by whom|date=October 2014}} that there are several factors required. These normally come together only rarely, but all occurred during the Kosovo War:<ref name="bombardment"/>

# Bombardment needs to be capable of causing destruction while minimising casualties. This causes pressure within the population to end hostilities rather than to prolong them. The exercise of precision air power in the Kosovo War is said{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have provided this.
# The government must be susceptible to pressure from within the population. As was demonstrated by the overthrow of Milošević a year later, the Yugoslav government was only weakly authoritarian and depended upon support from within the country.
# There must be a disparity of military capabilities such that the opponent is unable to inhibit the exercise of air superiority over its territory. [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Serbia]], a relatively small impoverished [[Balkan]] state, faced a much more powerful [[NATO]] coalition including the United Kingdom and the United States.
# [[Carl von Clausewitz]] once called the "essential mass of the enemy" his "centre of gravity". Should the center of gravity be destroyed, a major factor in Yugoslav will to resist would be broken or removed. In Milošević's case, the centre of gravity was his hold on power. He manipulated hyperinflation, sanctions and restrictions in supply and demand to allow powerful [[business]] interests within Serbia to profit and they responded by maintaining him in power. The damage to the economy, which squeezed it to a point where there was little profit to be made, threatened to undermine their support for Milošević if the air campaign continued, whilst causing costly infrastructure damage.<ref name="history"/>

===Arguments against strategic air power===
# Diplomacy:
## According to British Lieutenant-General Mike Jackson, Russia's decision on June 3, 1999 to back the West and to urge Milošević to surrender was the single event that had "the greatest significance in ending the war".  The Yugoslav capitulation came the same day.<ref name="telegraph2"/> Russia relied on Western economic aid at the time, which made it vulnerable to pressure from NATO to withdraw support for Milošević.<ref name="history3"/>
## Milošević's indictment by the UN as a war criminal (on May 24, 1999), even if it did not influence him personally, made the likelihood of Russia resuming diplomatic support less likely.<ref name="rand"/>
## The [[Rambouillet Agreement]] of March 18, 1999, had Yugoslavia agreed to it, would have given NATO forces the right of transit, [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]], [[Military exercise|manoeuvre]], [[billet]], and utilisation across Serbia. By the time Milošević capitulated, NATO forces were to have access only to Kosovo proper.<ref name="hosmer2001"/>
## The international civil presence in the province was to be under UN control which allowed for a Russian veto should Serb interests be threatened.<ref name="hosmer2001"/>
# Concurrent ground operations – The KLA undertook operations in Kosovo itself and had some successes against Serb forces. The Yugoslav army abandoned a border post opposite Morinë near the Yugoslav army outpost at [[Košare, Gjakova|Košare]] in the north west of the province. The Yugoslav army outpost at Košare had remained in Yugoslav hands throughout the war: this allowed for a supply line to be set up into the province and the subsequent taking of territory in the [[Junik]] area. The KLA also penetrated a few miles into the south-western [[Mount Paštrik]] area. But most of the province remained under Serb control.<ref name="hosmer5"/>
# Potential ground attack – General [[Wesley Clark]], [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]], was "convinced" that planning and preparations for ground intervention "in particular, pushed Milošević to concede".<ref name="general"/> The Yugoslav capitulation occurred on the same day that US President [[Bill Clinton]] held a widely publicised meeting with his four [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|service chiefs]] to discuss options for a ground-force deployment in case the air war failed.<ref name="lambeth"/> However, France and Germany vigorously opposed a ground offensive, and had done so for some weeks, since April 1999. French estimates suggested that an invasion would need an army of 500,000 to achieve success. This left NATO, particularly the United States, with a clear view that a land operation had no support. With this in mind, the US reaffirmed its faith in the air campaign.<ref name="ritchie"/> The reluctance of NATO to use ground forces cast serious doubt on the idea that Milošević capitulated out of fear of a land invasion.<ref name="ritchie6"/>

===NATO operations===
{{see also|Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force}}
The campaign involved 1,000 aircraft operating from air bases in Italy and Germany, and the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} sailing in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. During the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions.

On March 24 at 19:00 UTC NATO started the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.<ref name="The Kosovo Report: Conflict, International Response, Lessons Learned"/><ref name="Press Statement by Dr. Javier Solana, NATO Secretary General following the Commencement of Air Operations"/> [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s of the [[Spanish Air Force]] were the first NATO planes to bomb Belgrade and perform [[SEAD]] operations. [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s were fired from ships and [[submarine]]s in the Adriatic.

In addition to fixed-wing air power, one battalion of [[Apache helicopter]]s from the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[11th Aviation Regiment]] was deployed to help combat missions. The regiment was augmented by pilots from [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]]'s [[82nd Airborne]] Attack Helicopter Battalion. The battalion secured AH-64 Apache attack helicopter refueling sites, and a small team forward deployed to the Albania – Kosovo border to identify targets for NATO air strikes.

[[File:serb-milit-bomb-nato.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yugoslav Ministry of Defence building]] damaged during [[NATO]] bombing]]

The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defences and high-value military targets.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} NATO military operations increasingly attacked Yugoslav units on the ground, as well as continuing the strategic bombardment. Montenegro was bombed several times, and NATO refused to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milošević leader, [[Milo Đukanović]]. "[[Dual-use]]" targets, used by civilians and military, were attacked, including bridges across the [[Danube]], factories, power stations, telecommunications facilities, the headquarters of [[Yugoslav Left]]ists, a political party led by Milošević's wife, and the [[Avala TV Tower]]. Some protested that these actions were violations of [[international law]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]]. NATO argued these facilities were potentially useful to the Yugoslav military and thus their bombing was justified.

[[Radio Television of Serbia|Serbian Television]] claimed that huge columns of [[refugees]] were fleeing Kosovo because of NATO's bombing, not Yugoslav military operations.<ref name="Larsen"/><ref name="Rozen"/> The Yugoslav side and its Western supporters claimed the refugee outflows were caused by a mass panic in the Kosovo Albanian population, and that the exodus was generated principally by fear of NATO bombs.

The United Nations and international [[human rights]] organisations were convinced the crisis resulted from a policy of [[ethnic cleansing]]. Many accounts from both Serbs and Albanians identified Yugoslav security forces and paramilitaries as the culprits, responsible for systematically emptying towns and villages of their Albanian inhabitants by forcing them to flee.<ref name="SENSE Tribunal : ICTY"/>

Atrocities against civilians in Kosovo were the basis of United Nations [[war crimes]] charges against Milošević and other officials responsible for directing the Kosovo conflict.

An important portion of the war involved combat between the [[Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Air Force]] and the opposing air forces from NATO. [[United States Air Force]] [[F-15 Eagle|F-15s]] and [[F-16]]s flying from Italian airforce bases attacked the defending Yugoslav fighters, mainly [[MiG-29]]s, which were in poor condition due to a lack of spare parts and maintenance. Other NATO forces also contributed to the air war.

Air combat incidents:
* During the night of March 24/25, 1999: Yugoslav Air Force scrambled five MiG-29s to counter the initial attacks. Two fighters that took off from [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport|Niš Airport]] were vectored to intercept targets over southern Serbia and Kosovo were dealt with by NATO fighters. The MiG-29 flown by Maj. Dragan Ilić was damaged; he landed with one engine out and the aircraft was later expended as a decoy. The second MiG, flown by Maj. Iljo Arizanov, was shot down by an USAF F-15C piloted by Lt. Col. [[Cesar Rodriguez (pilot)|Cesar Rodriguez]]. A pair from [[Batajnica Air Base]] (Maj. Nebojša Nikolić and Maj. Ljubiša Kulačin) were engaged by USAF Capt. Mike Shower who shot down Nikolić while Kulačin evaded several missiles fired at him, while fighting to bring his malfunctioning systems back to working order. Eventually realising that he could not do anything, and with Batajnica AB under attack, Kulačin diverted to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]], hiding his aircraft under the tail of a parked airliner.<ref name="Belgrade Airport, Serbia – Aircraft Concealment"/> The fifth and last MiG-29 to get airborne that night was flown by Maj. Predrag Milutinović. Immediately after take-off his radar failed and electrical generator malfunctioned. Shortly after, he was warned of being acquired by fire control radar, but he eluded the opponent by several evasive manoeuvres. Attempting to evade further encounters, he approached Niš Airport, intending to land, when he was possibly hit by an [[2K12 Kub]] in a [[friendly fire]] incident, but more probably he was shot down by a [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|KLU]] F-16AM flown by Maj. Peter Tankink and forced to eject.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article607.html |title=How Dutch F-16AMs shot down a Mig-29 |website=F-16.net |date=April 21, 1999 |author=Lieven Dewitte |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104180203/http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article607.html |archive-date=November 4, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article230.html |title=First combat success for F-16MLU |website=F-16.net |date=March 24, 1999 |author=Lieven Dewitte |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026231312/http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article230.html |archive-date=October 26, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>
* In the morning of March 25 Maj. Slobodan Tešanović stalled his MiG-29 while landing on [[Užice-Ponikve Airport|Ponikve Airbase]] after a re-basing flight. He ejected safely.<ref name="ejection-history1"/><ref name="acig.org"/>
* During the war Yugoslav strike aircraft [[J-22 Orao]]s and [[G-4 Super Galeb]]s performed some 20–30 combat missions against the [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] in Kosovo at treetop level<ref name="CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE AIR THREAT; Out of NATO's Reach: Yugoslavia's Treetop War – New York Times"/> causing some casualties. During one of those missions on March 25, 1999, Lt. Colonel Života Ðurić was killed when his J-22 Orao hit a hill in Kosovo. It was never firmly established whether an aircraft malfunction, pilot error or if enemy action (by KLA) was the cause (NATO never claimed they shot it down).<ref name="ejection-history1"/>
* In the afternoon of March 25, 1999 two Yugoslav MiG-29s took off from Batajnica to chase a lone NATO aircraft flying in the direction of the Bosnian border. They crossed the border and were engaged by two US [[F-15 Eagle|F-15s]]. Both MiGs were shot down by Captain Jeff Hwang.<ref name="faqs"/> One MiG pilot, Major Slobodan Perić, having evaded at least one missile before being hit ejected, was later smuggled back to Yugoslavia by the [[Republika Srpska]] police. The other pilot, Captain Zoran Radosavljević, did not eject and was killed.<ref name="Yugoslav"/>
* On March 27, 1999, the 3rd Battalion of the 250th Missile Brigade, under the command of Colonel [[Zoltán Dani]], equipped with the Isayev S-125 'Neva-M' (NATO designation [[SA-3 Goa]]), [[Shooting down of F-117|downed]] an American [[F-117 Nighthawk]].<ref name="Serb discusses 1999 downing of stealth"/><ref name="dictionaryofwar"/> The pilot ejected and was rescued by [[search and rescue]] forces near Belgrade. This was the first and so far only time a [[stealth aircraft]] has been shot down by hostile ground fire in combat.
* Several times between April 5–7, 1999, Yugoslav MiG-29s were scrambled to intercept NATO aircraft, but turned back due to malfunctions.<ref name="acig.org"/>
* On April 7, 1999 four [[IAI RQ-5 Hunter|RQ-5A Hunter UAV]]s were shot down.<ref>[https://www.c4isrnet.com/unmanned/2019/08/23/5-times-in-history-enemies-shot-down-a-us-drone/ 5 times in history enemies shot down a US drone]</ref>

* On May 4, a Yugoslav [[MiG-29]], piloted by Lt. Col. [[Milenko Pavlović]], commander of the 204th Fighter Aviation Wing, was shot down at a low altitude over his hometown Valjevo by two USAF F-16s. The falling aircraft was possibly hit as well by [[Strela 2]] fired by Yugoslav troops. Pavlović was killed.<ref name="Yugoslav"/>
* On May 11 an A-10 was lightly damaged over Kosovo.<ref name="sponauer1"/>
* During the war NATO lost two [[AH-64 Apache]] strike helicopters (one on April 26 and the other on May 4<ref name="AH-64 Apache"/> in Albania near the border with Yugoslavia, in training accidents resulting in death of two US Army crew members.

NATO reported that it lost 21 UAVs to technical failures or enemy action during the conflict, including at least seven German UAVs and five French UAVs. While the commander of the Yugoslav Third Army claimed that 21 NATO UAVs had been shot down by Yugoslav forces, another Yugoslav general claimed that Yugoslav air defences and ground forces had shot down 30 UAVs.{{sfn|Rip|Hasik|2002|p=411}} One of the preferred Yugoslav tactics to destroy hostile UAVs involved the use of transport helicopters in air-to-air combat role. The first [[IAI RQ-5 Hunter]] drone lost by the US Army in the campaign was apparently shot down by a [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8 helicopter]] flying alongside, with the door gunner firing a 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun. The manoeuvre was repeated several times until Allied air supremacy made this practice too dangerous.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Technological fundamentalism?

[[Suppression of Enemy Air Defences]] or SEAD operations for NATO were principally carried out by the US Air Force, with fifty [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16CJ/DJ Block 50D/52D|F-16CJ Block 50 Fighting Falcons]], and the US Navy and Marines, with 30 [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B Prowlers]].  The F-16CJs carried [[AGM-88 HARM]] [[anti-radiation missile]]s which would home in on and destroy any active Yugoslav radar systems, while the Prowlers provided [[Radar jamming and deception|radar jamming]] assistance (though they could carry HARMs as well). Additional support came in the form of Italian and German [[Tornado ECR]]s which also carried HARMs.

USAF [[Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call|Compass Call EC-130s]] were used to intercept and jam Yugoslav communications, while [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135s]] conducted [[bomb damage assessment]].

The standard tactic for F-16CJs was for two pairs to come at a suspected air defence site from opposite directions, ensuring total coverage of the target area, and relaying information to incoming strike craft so they could adjust their flight path accordingly.<ref name=KOSOVO10>Lambeth, Dr. Benjamin S. "Kosovo and the Continuing SEAD Challenge."  [[Air and Space Power Journal]]. Summer 2002. p. 10-11</ref>

Where possible, NATO attempted to proactively destroy air defence sites, using F-16CGs and [[F-15E Strike Eagle]]s carrying conventional munitions including [[cluster bomb]]s, [[AGM-130]] boosted bombs, and [[AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon]] missiles.

Many NATO aircraft made use of new [[w:Category:Towed decoys|towed decoys]] designed to lure away any missiles fired at them. Reportedly, NATO also for the first time employed [[cyberwarfare]] to target Yugoslav air defence computer systems.<ref name=KOSOVO16>Lambeth, p. 16</ref>
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 990331-F-0024F-014.jpg|thumb|An F-16CJ Fighting Falcon of the [[52nd Fighter Wing]] after refueling with a [[KC-135R Stratotanker]].]]

A number of deficiencies in NATO's SEAD operations were revealed during the course of the bombing campaign. The EA-6Bs were noticeably slower than other aircraft, limiting their effectiveness in providing support, and land-based Prowlers flying out of [[Aviano Air Base]] were forced to carry extra fuel tanks instead of HARMs due to the distances involved.<ref name=KOSOVO10/>  The F-16CJ Block 50 could not carry the [[LANTIRN]] targeting pod, making it unable to conduct precision bombing at night.<ref name=KOSOVO14>Lambeth, p. 14</ref> Moreover, the US Air Force had allowed its [[electronic warfare]] branch to atrophy in the years after the [[Gulf War]].  Training exercises were fewer and less rigorous than before, while veterans with electronic warfare experience were allowed to retire with no replacement. The results were less than satisfactory: response times to engaging a SAM threat actually increased from the Gulf War, and electronic warfare [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wings]] could no longer reprogram their own [[jamming pod]]s but had to send them elsewhere for the task.<ref name=KOSOVO17>Lambeth, p.17</ref>

Further difficulties came in the form of airspace restrictions, which forced NATO aircraft into predictable flight paths, and [[rules of engagement]] which prevented NATO from targeting certain sites for fear of [[collateral damage]]. In particular this applied to early-warning radars located in Montenegro, which remained operational during the campaign and gave Yugoslav forces advanced warning of incoming NATO air raids.<ref name=KOSOVO9/><ref name=KOSOVO10/> Kosovo's mountainous terrain also made it difficult for NATO to locate and target Yugoslav air defences, while at the same time the region's poor infrastructure limited where Yugoslav SAM and AAA sites could be placed.<ref name=KOSOVO14/>

Yugoslav air defences were much fewer than what Iraq had deployed during the Gulf War - an estimated 16 [[SA-3]] and 25 [[SA-6]] [[surface-to-air missile]] systems, plus numerous [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (AAA) and man-portable air defence systems ([[MANPADS]]) - but unlike the Iraqis they took steps to preserve their assets.  Prior to the conflict's start Yugoslav SAMs were preemptively dispersed away from their garrisons and practiced [[EMCON|emission control]] to decrease NATO's ability to locate them.<ref name=KOSOVO9>Lambeth, p. 9</ref> The Yugoslav integrated air defence system (IADS) was extensive, including underground command sites and buried landlines, which allowed for information to be shared between systems. Active radar in one area could target NATO aircraft for SAMs and AAA in another area with no active radar, further limiting NATO's ability to target air defence weapons.<ref name=KOSOVO15>Lambeth, p. 15</ref>  
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 990420-O-9999M-004.jpg|thumb|left|Pre- and post-strike images of destroyed [[Pristina]] radar facility.]]

During the course of the campaign, NATO and Yugoslav forces engaged in a "cat-and-mouse" game which made suppressing the air defences difficult. Yugoslav SAM operators would turn their radars on for no longer than 20 seconds, allowing little chance for NATO anti-radiation missions to lock on to their emissions.<ref name=KOSOVO16>Lambeth, p. 16</ref> While most Yugoslav SAMs were fired ballistically (with no radar guidance) at NATO aircraft, as many as a third were guided by radar, forcing the targeted aircraft to jettison fuel tanks and take evasive action.<ref name=KOSOVO11>Lambeth, p. 11</ref> In response, over half of NATO's anti-radiation missiles were pre-emptively fired at suspected air defence sites so that if a radar system did become active the missiles would be able to lock on more quickly.<ref name=KOSOVO14/>

Where possible, Yugoslav air defences attempted to bring NATO aircraft into range of AAA and MANPADS. A common tactic was to target the last aircraft in a departing formation, on the assumption that it received less protection, was flown by a less-experienced pilot, and/or was low on fuel needed to make evasive manoeuvres.<ref name=KOSOVO9/> However, because AAA were limited to deploying close to roads for mobility and became bogged down in difficult terrain, NATO pilots learned to avoid these by staying at least five kilometers away from roads, never flying along them and only crossing them at a perpendicular angle, though this made spotting ground traffic more difficult.<ref name=KOSOVO14/>

By focusing on their operational survival, Yugoslav air defences ceded a certain amount of air superiority to NATO forces. Yet the persistence of their credible SAM threat forced NATO to allocate greater resources to continued SEAD operations rather than conducting other missions, while Yugoslav AAA and MANPADS forced NATO aircraft to fly at {{convert|15000|ft|abbr=on}} or higher. NATO reportedly fired 743 HARMs during the course of the 78-day campaign, but could confirm the destruction of only 3 of the original 25 SA-6 batteries. Over 800 SAMs were fired by Yugoslav forces at NATO aircraft, including 477 SA-6s and 124 confirmed MANPADS, for the downing of only two aircraft and several more damaged.<ref name=KOSOVO16/>

==NATO forces==
While not directly related to the hostilities, on March 12, 1999 the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]] joined NATO by depositing instruments of accession in accordance with Article 10 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] at a ceremony in [[Independence, Missouri]].<ref name="The United States, NATO, and a New Multilateral Relationship"/> These nations did not participate directly in hostilities.

===Aviation===
A large element of the operation was the air forces of NATO, relying heavily on the US Air Force and Navy using the F-16, [[F-15]], [[F-117]], [[F-14]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[EA-6B]], [[B-52]], [[KC-135]], [[KC-10]], [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]], and [[JSTARS]] from bases throughout Europe and from aircraft carriers in the region.

The French Navy and Air Force operated the [[Super Etendard]] and the [[Mirage 2000]]. The [[Aeronautica Militare|Italian Air Force]] operated with 34 [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], 12 [[F-104]], 12 [[AMX International AMX|AMX]], 2 [[B-707]], the [[Marina Militare|Italian Navy]] operated with [[Harrier II]]. The UK's Royal Air Force operated the [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier GR7]] and [[RAF Tornado GR1|Tornado]] ground attack jets as well as an array of support aircraft. [[Belgian Air Force|Belgian]], [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish]], [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Dutch]], [[Royal Norwegian Air Force|Norwegian]] and [[Turkish Air Force|Turkish]] Air Forces operated F-16s. The Spanish Air Force deployed [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|EF-18]]s and [[KC-130]]s. The [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canadian Air Force]] deployed a total of 18 [[CF-18]]s, enabling them to be responsible for 10% of all bombs dropped in the operation.

The fighters were armed with both guided and unguided "dumb" munitions, including the [[Paveway]] series of laser-guided bombs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The bombing campaign marked the first time the German Air Force actively attacking targets since World War II.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Hyde-Price |first= Adrian |year= 2001 |chapter= Germany and the Kosovo War: Still a Civilian Power? |title= ''In Douglas Webber, ed., ''New Europe, New Germany, Old Foreign Policy?: German Foreign Policy Since Unification'', pp. 19–34'' |location= London and Portland, OR |publisher= Frank Cass |isbn= 978-0-714-65172-9 }} See p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0_utD3oQVdIC&pg=PA19 19].</ref>

The US [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber saw its first successful combat role in Operation Allied Force, striking from its home base in the contiguous United States.

Even with this air power, noted a RAND Corporation study, "NATO never fully succeeded in neutralising the enemy's radar-guided SAM threat".<ref>Lambeth, 2001, p.  xvi</ref>

===Space===
Operation Allied Force incorporated the first large-scale use of satellites as a direct method of weapon guidance. The collective bombing was the first combat use of the Joint Direct Attack Munition [[JDAM]] kit, which uses an inertial-guidance and [[GPS]]-guided tail fin to increase the accuracy of conventional gravity munitions up to 95%. The JDAM kits were outfitted on the [[B-2]]s. The [[AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon]] (JSOW) had been previously used in [[Operation Southern Watch]] earlier in 1999.

===Naval===
NATO naval forces operated in the Adriatic Sea. The [[Royal Navy]] sent a substantial task force that included the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}, which operated [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FA2]] fighter jets. The RN also deployed [[destroyer]]s and [[frigate]]s, and the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA) provided support vessels, including the aviation training/primary casualty receiving ship {{ship|RFA|Argus|A135|6}}. It was the first time the RN used cruise missiles in combat, fired from the nuclear fleet submarine {{HMS|Splendid|S106|6}}.

The [[Italian Navy]] provided a naval task force that included the aircraft carrier {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Giuseppe Garibaldi|551|2}}, a frigate ({{ship|Italian frigate|Maestrale|F570|2}}) and a submarine ({{sclass-|Sauro|submarine|4}}).

The [[United States Navy]] provided a naval task force that included the aircraft carrier USS ''Theodore Roosevelt'', {{USS|Vella Gulf|CG-72|6}}, and the amphibious assault ship {{USS|Kearsarge|LHD-3|6}}.

The [[French Navy]] provided the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Foch|R99|2}} and escorts. The [[German Navy]] deployed the frigate [[German frigate Rheinland-Pfalz (F209)|''Rheinland-Pfalz'']] and ''Oker'', an {{sclass-|Oste|fleet service ship|1}}, in the naval operations.

The [[Netherlands]] sent the submarine {{HNLMS|Dolfijn|1990|6}} to upheld trade embargoes off the coast of Yugoslavia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sail.nl/schepen/marineschepen/onderzeeboten|title=Onderzeeboten|website=www.sail.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330012330/https://sail.nl/schepen/marineschepen/onderzeeboten|archive-date=March 30, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Army===

NATO ground forces included a US battalion from the [[505th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], [[82nd Airborne Division]]. The unit was deployed in March 1999 to Albania in support of the bombing campaign where the battalion secured the [[Tirana]] airfield, Apache helicopter refueling sites, established a forward-operating base to prepare for [[Multiple Launch Rocket System]] (MLRS) strikes and offensive ground operations, and deployed a small team with an [[AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar]] system to the Albania/Kosovo border where it acquired targets for NATO air strikes. Immediately after the bombing campaign, the battalion was refitted back at Tirana airfield and issued orders to move into Kosovo as the initial entry force in support of [[Operation Joint Guardian]].
[[Task Force Hawk]] was also deployed.

Task Force Hunter, a US surveillance unit based upon the [[IAI RQ-5 Hunter]] drone "A" Company from a Forces Command (FORSCOM) Corps Military Intelligence Brigade (MI Bde) was deployed to Camp Able Sentry, [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]], in March, to provide real-time intelligence on Yugoslav forces inside Kosovo. They flew a total of 246 sorties,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/camp-able-sentry.htm|title=Camp Able Sentry|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> with five drones lost to enemy fire.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conflict in the Balkans 1991–2000|last=Ripley|first=Tim|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1846037481|pages=88}}</ref> A German Army drone battery based at [[Tetovo]] was tasked with a similar mission.

[[Human Rights Watch]] concluded "that as few as 489 and as many as 528 Yugoslav civilians were killed in the ninety separate incidents in Operation Allied Force". Refugees were among the victims. Between 278 and 317 of the deaths, nearly 60 percent of the total number, were in Kosovo. In Serbia, 201 civilians were killed (five in Vojvodina) and eight died in Montenegro. Almost two-thirds (303 to 352) of the total registered civilian deaths occurred in twelve incidents where ten or more civilian deaths were confirmed.<ref name="hrw"/>
 
According to one Serbian claim, NATO tactics sometimes included second post strikes in populated areas, with the aim of destroying rescue and medical teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:656631-Spasilac-kome-je-NATO-spalio-noge|title=Spasilac kome je NATO spalio noge|website=www.novosti.rs|access-date=March 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324153834/http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:656631-Spasilac-kome-je-NATO-spalio-noge|archive-date=March 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===KFOR===
{{Main|Kosovo Force}}
On June 12, [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] began entering Kosovo. Its mandate among other things was to deter hostilities and establish a secure environment, including public safety and civil order.<ref name="Weitz">{{cite book |last1=Weitz |first1=Richard |title=War and Governance: International Security in a Changing World Order |date=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-31334-735-1 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGf_OkWDAbsC&pg=PA128}}</ref>

KFOR, a NATO force, had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. It was based upon the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]] of the [[British Army]]. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armoured and 5th Airborne Brigades), a [[French Army]] Brigade, a [[German Army]] brigade, which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south, and [[Italian Army]] and US Army brigades.
[[File:German KFOR troops patrol southern Kosovo, summer 1999.jpg|thumb|German [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] soldiers patrol southern Kosovo]]

The US contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the US [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armoured Division]]. Subordinate units included TF 1–35 Armour from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] from [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the US force was the [[Greek Army]]'s 501st Mechanised Infantry Battalion. The initial US forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uroševac, the future [[Camp Bondsteel]], and Gnjilane, at [[Camp Monteith]], and spent four months – the start of a stay which continues to date – establishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.

The first NATO troops to enter Pristina on June 12, 1999 were [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces from the [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] (FSK) and soldiers from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Air Service]] 22 S.A.S, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived first at the airport. The Norwegian soldiers from FSK were the first to come in contact with the Russian troops at the airport. FSK's mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties, and to fine-tune the detailed, local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&catalogId=10051&categoryId=&productId=1085065&errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&urlLangId=-101&langId=-101&top_category=&parent_category_rn=&storeId=10651|title=Krigere og diplomater|website=Norli.no|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307042943/http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/productdisplay?catalogid=10051&categoryid=&errorviewname=productdisplayerrorview&langid=-101&parent_category_rn=&productid=1085065&storeid=10651&top_category=&urllangid=-101&urlrequesttype=base|archive-date=March 7, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all|language=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&catalogId=10051&categoryId=&productId=286391&errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&urlLangId=-101&langId=-101&top_category=&parent_category_rn=&storeId=10651|title=Norges hemmelige krigere|website=norli.no|accessdate=October 26, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051414/http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&catalogId=10051&categoryId=&productId=286391&errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&urlLangId=-101&langId=-101&top_category=&parent_category_rn=&storeId=10651|archive-date=April 21, 2014|language=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/montenegro/britisk-og-norske-soldater-i-pristina/a/3978724|title=Britisk og norske soldater i Pristina – Montenegro – VG|newspaper=Vg.no|date=June 12, 1999|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024223014/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/montenegro/britisk-og-norske-soldater-i-pristina/a/3978724/|archive-date=October 24, 2016|url-status=live|language=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/norske-elitesoldater-skamroses/a/6450899|title=Norske elitesoldater skamroses|newspaper=Vg.no|date=March 3, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024153321/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/norske-elitesoldater-skamroses/a/6450899/|archive-date=October 24, 2016|url-status=live|language=no}}</ref>

During the initial incursion, US soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as US soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Although no resistance was met, three US soldiers from the Initial Entry Force were killed in accidents.<ref name="specialist"/>

Following the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and seized [[Pristina International Airport]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2010 [[James Blunt]] in an interview described how his unit was given the assignment of securing the Pristina in advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the airport before his unit's arrival. As the first officer on the scene, Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the [[Incident at Pristina airport|potentially violent international incident]]. His own account tells of how he refused to follow orders from NATO command to attack the Russians.<ref name="Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'"/>

[[Outpost Gunner]] was established on a high point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian sector. Operating under the support of 2/3 Field Artillery, 1st Armoured Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.<ref name="bbc-airport"/>

==Attitudes towards the campaign==
{{Main|Legitimacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia}}

===In favor of the campaign===
[[File:Kop mine mines.jpg|thumb|Warning sign about NATO [[cluster bombs]] near ski slopes at [[Kopaonik]]]]
Those who were involved in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action. US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Secretary of Defense (United States)|Secretary of Defense]], [[William Cohen]], said, "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide."<ref name="defenselink"/> On CBS' ''Face the Nation'' Cohen claimed, "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered."<ref name="washingtonpost8"/> Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing".<ref name="clintonfoundation"/> Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, "they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr. Milošević ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..."<ref name="autogenerated1999"/> In the same press conference, Clinton also said, "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide."<ref name="autogenerated1999"/> Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to [[the Holocaust]]. CNN reported, "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send US forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort."<ref name="cnn9"/>

President Clinton's [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] also claimed Yugoslav troops had committed genocide. ''The New York Times'' reported, "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević."<ref name="genocide"/> The Department of State also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians. In May 1999, Defence Secretary William Cohen suggested that there might be up to 100,000 Albanian fatalities."<ref name="erlanger"/> Post-war examinations revealed these statements and casualty figures to have been exaggerated.<ref>{{cite web | last=Pilger | first=John | date=September 4, 2000 | url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/151946 | title=US and British officials told us that at least 100,000 were murdered in Kosovo.

The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a [[concurrent resolution|non-binding resolution]] on March 11, 1999 by a vote of 219–191 conditionally approving of President Clinton's plan to commit 4,000 troops to the NATO peacekeeping mission.<ref name="nytimes"/> In late April, the House Appropriations Committee approved $13&nbsp;billion in emergency spending to cover the cost of the air war, but a second non-binding resolution approving of the mission failed in the full House by a vote of 213–213.<ref name="nytimes10"/> The [[United States Senate|Senate]] had passed the second resolution in late March by a vote of 58–41.<ref name="On the Concurrent Resolution (S.Con.Res. 21 )"/>

In an interview with Radio-Television Serbia journalist Danilo Mandić on April 25, 2006, [[Noam Chomsky]] referred to the foreword to John Norris' 2005 book ''Collision Course: NATO, Russia, and Kosovo'', in which [[Strobe Talbott]], the Deputy Secretary of State under President Clinton and the leading U.S. negotiator during the war, had written that "It was Yugoslavia's resistance to the broader trends of political and economic reform—not the plight of Kosovar Albanians—that best explains NATO's war."<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20060425.htm On the NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia, Noam Chomsky interviewed by Danilo Mandic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220200424/http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20060425.htm|date=February 20, 2014}} Chomsky.info, April 25, 2006, Accessed January 13, 2014.<br />For the passage Chomsky was referring to, see pp.xxii–iii of the introduction to Norris's book: "As nations throughout the region sought to reform their economies, mitigate ethnic tensions, and broaden civil society, Belgrade seemed to delight in continually moving in the opposite direction ...

The [[United Nations Charter]] does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The issue was brought before the UNSC by Russia, in a draft resolution which, inter-alia, would affirm "that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter".

Because Yugoslavia filed its complaint only three days after accepting the terms of the court's optional clause, the ICJ ruled that there was no jurisdiction to sue either Britain or Spain, as the two nations had only agreed to submit to ICJ lawsuits if a suing party had filed their complaint a year or more after accepting the terms of the optional clause.<ref name=nojurisdict /> Despite objections that Yugoslavia had legal jurisdiction to sue Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Portugal,<ref name=nojurisdict /> the ICJ majority vote also determined that the NATO bombing was an instance of "humanitarian intervention" and thus did not violate Article 9 of the Genocide Convention.<ref name=nojurisdict />

[[Amnesty International]] released a report which stated that NATO forces had deliberately targeted a civilian object ([[NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters]]), and had bombed targets at which civilians were certain to be killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/no-justice-victims-nato-bombings-20090423|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=April 23, 2009|title=No justice for the victims of NATO bombings|access-date=December 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217051002/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/no-justice-victims-nato-bombings-20090423|archive-date=February 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/world/rights-group-says-nato-bombing-in-yugoslavia-violated-law.html|work=[[New York Times]]|title=Rights Group Says NATO Bombing in Yugoslavia Violated Law|author=Steven Erlanger|date=June 8, 2000|access-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223162203/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/world/rights-group-says-nato-bombing-in-yugoslavia-violated-law.html|archive-date=February 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The report was rejected by NATO as "baseless and ill-founded".
