'''Recorded Music NZ''' (formerly the '''Recording Industry Association of New Zealand''' ('''RIANZ''')) is a non-profit [[trade association]] of [[record producers]], [[record distribution | distributor]]s and [[recording artist]]s who sell [[recorded music]] in [[New Zealand]]. Membership of Recorded Music NZ is open to any owner of recorded [[music rights]] operating in New Zealand, inclusive of major [[record label | label]]s (such as [[Sony Music |Sony]], [[Universal Music Group| Universal]] and [[Warner Music Group]]), [[independent record label | independent label]]s and [[independent music | self-released]] [[recording artist | artist]]s. Recorded Music NZ has over 2000 [[rights holder | rights-holder]]s.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

Prior to June 2013 the association called itself the "Recording Industry Association of New Zealand" (RIANZ). RIANZ and '''PPNZ Music Licensing''' merged and renamed themselves "Recorded Music NZ".<ref>{{cite web|last= Slatherly|first= Dan|title= Music bodies RIANZ and PPNZ  They are super inaccurate and there is no point paying attention to anything they say .merge|url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Music-bodies-RIANZ-and-PPNZ-merge/tabid/418/articleID/301053/Default.aspx|publisher= 3 News|accessdate= 11 June 2013}}</ref>

* member services (the [[New Zealand Music Awards]], the [[Official New Zealand Music Chart]]s, music grants and direct services to artists and labels)
* [[music licensing]] (undertaken independently or, in most cases, via '''OneMusic''', a joint licensing venture between Recorded Music NZ and [[APRA AMCOS | APRA]])
* Pro Music services (regarding [[copyright protection]] and corporate affairs)

Recorded Music NZ also operates as a joint trustee (with APRA) of the '''[[New Zealand Music Hall of Fame]]'''.

==History==

The '''New Zealand Federation of Phonographic Industry''' ('''NZFPI''') was established in 1957 to collectively represent copyright licensing on behalf of rights owners. It later changed its name to '''Phonographic Performances New Zealand (PPNZ)''', and then '''PPNZ Music Licensing'''. In 1972 a new trade body was established called '''Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ)''' which carried out industry advocacy functions (such as Government representation), administration of the NZ Music Awards and, in 1975, production of The Official NZ Music Charts. For better administrational efficiency, the two companies were merged in 2013 and renamed to Recorded Music NZ.<ref name="Te Ara">{{cite web | url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/recording-companies-and-studios/page-4 | title=Recording companies and studios - The digital era, 1990 to 2000s | work=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand | date=22 October 2014 | accessdate=4 September 2017 | author=Derby, Mark}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Music Awards|url=http://rianz.org.nz/awards2008/history.asp|publisher=RIANZ|accessdate=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914072406/http://rianz.org.nz/awards2008/history.asp|archivedate=14 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==New Zealand Music Awards==
{{main|New Zealand Music Awards}}

The New Zealand Music Awards are conferred annually by Recorded Music NZ for outstanding artistic and technical achievements in the recording field. The awards are one of the biggest awards that a group or artist can receive in music in New Zealand. The awards have been presented every year since 1965.

==Official New Zealand Music Chart==

{{main|Official New Zealand Music Chart}}

The Official New Zealand Music Chart is the weekly New Zealand top forty singles and albums charts, issued weekly by Recorded Music NZ (previously known as RIANZ). The chart also includes the top twenty New Zealand singles and albums and top ten compilation albums. All charts are compiled from data of both physical and digital sales from music retailers in New Zealand.<ref name=chartabout>{{cite web|title=ABOUT THE CHART|url=http://nztop40.co.nz/about|publisher=NZ Music Charts|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>

===Heatseekers chart===

An additional "Heatseekers" chart was first published on the chart dated 5 October 2015. The chart consists of the top ten singles outside of (and that have not previously charted inside) the top forty, and has the same rules and criteria as the Top 40 Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nztop40.co.nz/|title=The Official New Zealand Music Chart|website=THE OFFICIAL NZ MUSIC CHART}}</ref> Once a title makes an appearance inside the top forty at any point, it becomes ineligible to appear in the Heatseekers chart.<ref>http://nztop40.co.nz/assets/the-official-new-zealand-music-charts-rules.pdf</ref>

==Piracy==
As RIANZ, Recorded Music NZ was instrumental in attempting to introduce a possible version of [[Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Act 2008|Section 92A Copyright Act]]. The amendment would have required ISPs in New Zealand to disconnect users ''accused'' but not convicted of downloading copyrighted material â€“ the first law of its type in the world.<ref>[http://torrentfreak.com/kiwi-3-strikes-law-081017/ "New Zealand First to Adopt 3-Strikes Law for Pirates"]. Torrent Freak. 17 October 2008.</ref> The amendment and consequently the RIANZ's actions have been widely criticized. ISPs described the law as "a deeply flawed law that undermines the fundamental rights and simply will not work",<ref>[http://internetnz.net.nz/media/archived/2008/jointcopyright "ICT industry moves to address copyright confusion"]. Internet NZ. 19 September 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207043908/http://internetnz.net.nz/media/archived/2008/jointcopyright |date=7 February 2009 }}</ref> while thousands of artists have joined the Campaign for Fair Copyright voicing their "disappointment"<ref>[http://creativefreedom.org.nz/story.html?id=49 "Thousands of Artists Against Guilt Upon Accusation Laws"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201220846/http://creativefreedom.org.nz/story.html?id=49 |date=1 February 2009 }}. Creative Freedom.</ref> at the RIANZ stance. However, the version was ultimately dropped, and Section 92A of the Copyright Act has now been replaced by Section 122A the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act 2011 which came in force from 1 September 2011.
