The '''Slavery Abolition Act 1833''' (3 & 4 Will. IV c. 73) abolished [[slavery]] in parts of the [[British Empire]]. This [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] expanded the jurisdiction of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] and made the purchase or ownership of slaves illegal within the British Empire, with the exception of "the Territories in the Possession of the [[East India Company]]", Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), and [[Saint Helena]]. The Act was repealed in 1997 as a part of wider rationalisation of English statute law; however, later [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery legislation]] remains in force.

==Background==
In May 1772, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]]'s judgment in the ''[[Somerset v Stewart|Somersett's Case]]'' emancipated a slave in [[England]] and thus helped launch the movement to abolish slavery.<ref>

* Blumrosen, Alfred W. and Ruth G., Slave Nation: How Slavery United the Colonies and Sparked the American Revolution, Sourcebooks, 2005</ref> The case ruled that slaves could not be transported out of England against their will, but did not actually abolish slavery in England. However, many campaigners, including [[Granville Sharp]], mistakenly believed that the Somerset case meant that slavery was unsupported by law in England and that no authority could be exercised on slaves entering English or Scottish soil.<ref>[http://www.commonlii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl/int/cases/EngR/1827/725.html?stem=0&synonyms=0&query=The%20Slave,%20Grace (1827) 2 Hag Adm 94].</ref><ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), p. 61.</ref> In 1785, English poet [[William Cowper]] wrote:

<blockquote>We have no slaves at home – Then why abroad?<br />Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs<br />Receive our air, that moment they are free.<br />They touch our country, and their shackles fall.<br />That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud.<br />And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,<br />And let it circulate through every vein.<ref>Rhodes, Nick (2003). ''William Cowper: Selected Poems''. p. 84. Routledge, 2003</ref></blockquote>

==Campaign to abolish the slave trade==

By 1783, an anti-slavery movement to abolish the slave trade throughout the Empire had begun among the British public. Spurred by an incident involving [[Chloe Cooley]], a slave brought to Canada by an [[American Loyalist]], Lieutenant-Governor of [[Upper Canada]] [[John Graves Simcoe]] tabled the [[Act Against Slavery]] in 1793. Passed by the local [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|Legislative Assembly]], it was the first legislation to outlaw the slave trade in a part of the British Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Chloe-Cooley-ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206103609/http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Chloe-Cooley-ENG.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

After France which abolished slavery in 1794,<ref>David B. Gaspar, David P. Geggus, ''A Turbulent time: the French Revolution and the Greater Caribbean'' (1997) p. 60</ref> the British were, by the late eighteenth century, the biggest proponents of the abolition of slavery worldwide, having previously been the world's largest slave dealers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Abina and The Important Men, A Graphic History|last1=Getz|first1=Trevor|last2=Clarke|first2=Liz|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=122}}</ref> [[William Wilberforce]] had written in his diary in 1787 that his great purpose in life was to suppress the slave trade before waging a 20-year fight on the industry.<ref>[https://www.cbn.com/special/amazingGrace/articles/Wilberforce-bio.aspx William Wilberforce: A Man for All Seasons]. CBN</ref>

In 1807, Parliament passed the [[Slave Trade Act of 1807]], which outlawed the international slave trade, but not slavery itself. The legislation was timed to coincide with the expected prohibition from 1808 of international slave trading by the United States, Britain's chief rival in maritime commerce. This legislation imposed fines that did little to deter slave trade participants. Abolitionist [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] realized that trading had continued, and as a new MP successfully introduced the [[Slave Trade Felony Act 1811]] which at last made the overseas slave trade a felony act throughout the empire. The [[Royal Navy]] established the [[West Africa Squadron]] to suppress the [[Atlantic slave trade]] by patrolling the coast of West Africa. It did suppress the slave trade, but did not stop it entirely. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans.<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated/exhibitions/museums/chasing.html  1807 - The Abolition of Slavery The abolition of the slave trade- Chasing Freedom: The Royal Navy and the suppression of the transatlantic slave trade Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth Historic Dockyard] ''history.ac.uk'', accessed 30 August 2019</ref> They resettled many in Jamaica and the Bahamas.<ref name="Naval Museum - Chasing Freedom">{{cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Information Sheet |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |accessdate=2 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |accessdate=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 }}</ref> Britain also used its influence to coerce other countries to agree to [[Abolition of slavery timeline#1800–1849|treaties]] to end their slave trade and allow the Royal Navy to [[Blockade of Africa|seize their slave ships]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falola|first1=Toyin|last2=Warnock|first2=Amanda|title=Encyclopedia of the middle passage|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313334801|pages=xxi, xxxiii–xxxiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&pg=PR21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels by the Royal Navy|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS}}</ref>

==Campaign to abolish slavery==

Between 1807 and 1823, abolitionists showed little interest in abolishing slavery itself. [[Eric Williams]] presented economic data in ''[[Capitalism and Slavery]]'' to show that the slave trade itself generated only small profits compared to the much more lucrative sugar plantations of the Caribbean, and therefore slavery continued to thrive on those estates. However, from 1823 the British Caribbean sugar industry went into terminal decline, and the British parliament no longer felt they needed to protect the economic interests of the West Indian sugar planters.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).</ref>

In 1823, the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded in London. Members included [[Joseph Sturge]], [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[William Wilberforce]], [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]], [[Elizabeth Heyrick]], [[Mary Lloyd (abolitionist)|Mary Lloyd]], [[Jane Smeal]], [[Elizabeth Pease Nichol|Elizabeth Pease]], and [[Anne Knight]].<ref>[http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/shelves/slavery/ Slavery and abolition]. Oxford University Press</ref> Jamaican mixed-race campaigners such as [[Louis Celeste Lecesne]] and [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)|Richard Hill]] were also members of the Anti-Slavery Society.

During the Christmas holiday of 1831, a large-scale slave revolt in Jamaica, known as the [[Baptist War]], broke out. It was organised originally as a peaceful strike by the Baptist minister [[Samuel Sharpe]]. The rebellion was suppressed by the militia of the Jamaican plantocracy and the British garrison ten days later in early 1832. Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries. The results of these inquiries contributed greatly to the abolition of slavery with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.<ref>Craton, ''Testing the Chains'', pp. 319–323.</ref><ref>[https://jis.gov.jm/information/heroes/samuel-sharpe/ Samuel Sharpe] ''jis.gov.jm'', accessed 30 August 2019</ref>

Up until then, sugar planters from rich British islands such as the [[Colony of Jamaica]] and [[Barbados]] were able to buy [[rotten and pocket boroughs]], and they were able to form a body of resistance to moves to abolish slavery itself. This West India Lobby, which later evolved into the [[West India Committee]], purchased enough seats to be able to resist the overtures of abolitionists. However, The [[Reform Act 1832]] swept away their rotten borough seats, clearing the way for a majority of members of the House of Commons to push through a law to abolish slavery itself throughout the British Empire.<ref>Richard Dunn, ''A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labour in Jamaica and Virginia'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2014), p. 343.</ref>

==Act==

The Act had its third reading in the House of Commons on 26 July 1833, three days before [[William Wilberforce]] died.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1833/act/73/enacted/en/print.html |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section XII |date=28 August 1833 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref> It received the [[Royal Assent]] a month later, on 28 August, and came into force the following year, on 1 August 1834. In practical terms, only slaves below the age of six were freed in the colonies. Former slaves over the age of six were redesignated as "[[Apprenticeship#Nineteenth century|apprentices]]", and their servitude was abolished in two stages: the first set of apprenticeships came to an end on 1 August 1838, while the final apprenticeships were scheduled to cease on 1 August 1840. The Act specifically excluded "the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company, or to the Island of Ceylon, or to the Island of Saint Helena." The exceptions were eliminated in 1843.<ref name=SectionLXIV>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section LXIV |date=28 August 1833 |accessdate=3 June 2008}}</ref>

==Payments to slave owners==
{{Main|Slave Compensation Act 1837|London Society of West India Planters and Merchants}}

The Act provided for payments to slave-owners. The amount of money to be spent on the payments was set at "the Sum of Twenty Million Pounds Sterling".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section XXIV|date=28 August 1833|accessdate=3 June 2008}}</ref> Under the terms of the Act, the British government raised £20 million<ref name=Manning>{{Cite news|author=Sanchez Manning|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-colonial-shame-slave-owners-given-huge-payouts-after-abolition-8508358.html|title=Britain's colonial shame: Slave-owners given huge payouts after|date=24 February 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=11 February 2018}}</ref> to pay out for the loss of the slaves as business assets to the registered owners of the freed slaves. In 1833, £20 million amounted to 40% of the Treasury's annual income<ref>[https://www.ukpublicrevenue.co.uk/piechart_1833_UK_total Public Revenue Details for 1833] ''ukpublicrevenue.co.uk'', accessed 30 August 2019</ref> or approximately 5% of British GDP at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/piechart_1833_UK_total|title= UK public spending and GDP in 1833|accessdate=3 January 2017}}</ref> To finance the payments, the British government took on a £15 million loan, finalised on 3 August 1835, with banker [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] and his brother-in-law [[Moses Montefiore]];  £5 million was paid out directly in government stock, worth £1.5 billion in present day.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Britain's Slave Owner Compensation Loan, reparations and tax havenry|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2020/06/09/slavery-compensation-uk-questions/,%20https://www.taxjustice.net/2020/06/09/slavery-compensation-uk-questions/|access-date=2020-06-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> The money was not paid back by the British taxpayers until 2015,<ref>{{cite web |title=FOI response: Slavery Abolition Act 1833 |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/680456/FOI2018-00186_-_Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833_-_pdf_for_disclosure_log__003_.pdf |publisher=UK Government |accessdate=31 Jan 2018}}</ref> when the British Government decided to modernise the gilt portfolio by redeeming all remaining undated gilts.

Half of the money went to slave-owning families in the Caribbean and Africa, while the other half went to absentee owners living in Britain.<ref name=Manning/> The names listed in the returns for slave owner payments show that ownership was spread over many hundreds of British families,<ref>British ''Parliamentary Papers'', session 1837–38 (215), vol. 48.

==Protests against apprenticeships==
On 1 August 1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly people being addressed by the governor at Government House in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]], about the new laws, began chanting: ''"Pas de six ans. Point de six ans"'' ("Not six years. No six years"), drowning out the voice of the governor. Peaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish apprenticeship was passed and ''de facto'' freedom was achieved. Full [[emancipation]] for all was legally granted ahead of schedule on 1 August 1838.<ref>Dryden, John. 1992 "Pas de Six Ans!"

It is believed that after 1833 clandestine slave-trading continued within the British Empire; in 1854 [[Nathaniel Isaacs]], owner of the island of [[Matakong]] off the coast of [[Sierra Leone]] was accused of slave-trading by the governor of Sierra Leone, Sir [[Arthur Kennedy (governor)|Arthur Kennedy]]. Papers relating to the charges were lost when the ''Forerunner'' was wrecked off Madeira in October 1854. In the absence of the papers, the English courts refused to proceed with the prosecution.<ref name=Natalia>{{cite journal
