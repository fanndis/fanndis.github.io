==Education==
{{Main|Jonesboro, Georgia#Education}}

[[Clayton County Public Schools]] is the fifth largest school system in Georgia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clayton.k12.ga.us/aboutccps/districtstatistics.asp |title=District Statistics |publisher=Clayton County Public Schools |accessdate=April 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422235805/http://www.clayton.k12.ga.us/aboutccps/districtstatistics.asp |archivedate=April 22, 2008  }}</ref> On August 28, 2008, the district lost its accreditation, citing a 'dysfunctional' school board.

The district currently{{when|date=November 2011}} has 53,000 students enrolled in its 63 schools. Under the current Superintendent Dr. Morcease J. Beasley, the district has a strategic plan that includes the vision and mission statements. Clayton County has twenty-two elementary and five middle schools that have been deemed by the Georgia Department of Education as Distinguished Schools. This is based on the number of consecutive years of making AYP.
Clayton County is fully accredited, April 2013

===Special schools and programs===
Lovejoy High School hosts the district International Baccalaureate Program (IB). The IB Diploma Program is designed as an academically challenging and balanced program of education with final exams that prepare students for success at the university level and life beyond.

CCPS has two charter schools. Unidos Dual Language, Georgia's first public dual language school is a model of excellence in language education. Unidos serves students in Pre-kindergarten through sixth grades. The second charter school is the Elite Scholars Academy; the school serves grades 6-10 and will be expanding to the twelfth grade by 2014. The school operates on a year-round calendar. Any student in the district may apply to enroll. Selection is based on a random lottery.

Clayton County also has a Math and Science Magnet and 3 fine arts magnet programs at Jackson Elementary, MD Robert's Middle, and Martha Ellen Stilwell. Enrollment is based on application and/or audition.

===2008 de-accreditation===
The 50,000-student [[school system]] was the first in the nation to lose [[accreditation]] since 1969. The [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS) revoked the [[school district]]'s accreditation on August 28, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/08/28/clayton_schools_accreditation.html |first=Megan |last=Matteucci |title=Clayton schools lose accreditation; board members ousted |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=August 28, 2008}}</ref> This makes only the second system in the nation to do so since 1960. A [[grand jury]] investigated and considered possible criminal [[indictment]]s against the Clayton County School Board. At issue was whether the school board committed [[malfeasance]] in ignoring the shortcomings of the school system and violating its own rules concerning the awarding of [[Bidding|bids]] of [[contract]]s.

School Board Chairwoman Ericka Davis announced her resignation on April 2, 2008, amidst the allegations. Clayton County Commission Chairman Eldrin Bell has called for the resignations of all Clayton County School Board Members.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/04/02/claytonschools_0402.html |first=Megan |last=Matteucci |title=Clayton school board chairwoman steps down |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref>
Amid controversy and orders for the police to quiet citizens, the Clayton County School Board hired a new temporary superintendent on April 26, 2008. This was despite the fact that the new superintendent did not meet the qualifications set forth by SACS.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/04/26/claysuper_0427.html |first=Megan |last=Matteucci |title=Clayton signs school chief's contract amid police presence |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=May 1, 2008}}</ref>

The Clayton County Public School System was re-accredited by SACS on May 1, 2009.<ref>[http://gaeducation.blogspot.com/2009/05/clayton-county-public-schools-receive.html Clayton County Public Schools Receive Re-accreditation]. ''Georgia Education News'' May 1, 2009. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>

==Politics==
For most of the time from the 1960s to the 1980s, Clayton County was a swing county. It voted for Governor Carter in 1976 with around 65 percent of the vote, but then voting for President Reagan, even with over seventy percent of the vote in 1984. However, due to extensive black in-migration, starting in 1992 Clayton County has swung heavily Democratic, and is now one of the most Democratic counties in the country. It has given the Democratic presidential candidate over eighty percent of the vote in every election since 2008. In 2016, for instance, it gave [[Hillary Clinton]] 84 percent of the vote, her strongest showing in the state.

==In popular culture==
Parts of Margaret Mitchell's epic 1936 novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and the famous 1939 motion picture ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' were set in Clayton County, including the location of the fictional plantation, [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]]. [[Tara Boulevard]] was named for the plantation, and is the main northâ€“south road through the county, carrying [[U.S. Route 41 in Georgia|U.S. 41]] and lesser-known [[State Route 3 (Georgia)|State Route 3]]. Parts of the novels ''[[Rhett Butler's People]]'' and ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'' and the ''Scarlett'' TV Mini-Series also took place in Clayton County. ''Rhett Butler's People'' is a prequel, sequel, and companion to ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''. ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'' is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and also takes place briefly in Clayton County. The fictional [[Twelve Oaks|Twelve Oaks Plantation]] and others mentioned in these novels are located in and around Clayton County.

The 2012 film ''[[Flight (2012 film)|Flight]]'' features Clayton County throughout the film, with Hall's Flying Ranch in Hampton, Georgia, doubling as Denzel Washington's character's childhood home.

Parts of the film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' were also shot in and around Clayton County, namely in Jonesboro, as evidenced by a sign in the background of one of the scenes. Even though this particular scene was supposed to be set in Arkansas, a "Willow Bend" sign advertising brick homes in Clayton County can be spotted behind Sheriff George Branford. Many back roads and the movie town of Texarkana are actually the roads and the town of Jonesboro.

[[Trinidad James]] filmed his music video for the song "All Gold Everything" in Clayton County

Rap artist [[Waka Flocka Flame]] is also from Clayton County as he resides in [[Riverdale, Georgia]].
