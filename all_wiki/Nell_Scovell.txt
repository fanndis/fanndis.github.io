==Letterman and gender inequality in comedy==

Scovell was the second female writer ever hired for ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the only woman on the Letterman writing staff at the time. She left the show in 1993, after working there for less than a year.

In 2009, after Letterman admitted to having sexual relationships with his female staffers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/david-letterman-admits-sexual-affairs-staffers-details-extortion/story?id=8728424|title='Terrible Things': Letterman Confesses to Sex With Staffers; Target of Extortionist|date=2 October 2009|website=ABC News|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> she published an essay in ''Vanity Fair'' calling his show a "hostile work environment" for women.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2009/10/david-letterman-200910|title=Letterman and Me|first=Nell|last=Scovell|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> She noted that Letterman's shows had hired only seven female writers in 27 years. Male writers had spent a combined total of 378 years on staff, and women had spent 17. Scovell alleged that late-night TV executives excused gender disparities in their writers rooms by claiming that women don't apply for writing jobs. Women did apply in lower numbers than men, she acknowledged, but that was partly because "the shows often rely on current (white male) writers to recommend their funny (white male) friends to be future (white male) writers." She recommended targeted outreach to talented bloggers, improv performers, and stand-ups.<ref name="auto"/>

Spinning off her piece, the ''New York Times'' reported that three of the top late-night television shows — ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' — had no female writers (a fact which Scovell initially mentioned in her essay), in spite of the fact that women make a larger proportion of late-night audiences than men.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/business/media/12women.html|title=Among Late-Night Writers, Few Women in the Room|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=11 November 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> The ''Times'' interviewed comedy writer [[Merrill Markoe]], who mentioned an "odd shift toward more boys' humor in the '90s" that might have kept women from landing late-night jobs.<ref name="auto1"/> Scovell tried to change comedy's gender disparity by encouraging women to apply for jobs and matching them with executives and head writers. When Jimmy Kimmel began his show on ABC, she wrote a letter to ABC Television Group president [[Anne Sweeney]] about the need for more women in late night. She was contacted by [[Molly McNearney]], the head writer for the show, and passed along the names of two writers — [[Bess Kalb]] and [[Joelle Boucai]] — who were hired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/television/nell-scovell-television-comedy-me-too.html|title=Nell Scovell Speaks Truth to the Funny Men in Power|first=Jason|last=Zinoman|date=7 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

In 2019, Scovell wrote a followup article for ''Vanity Fair'' about how she had met with Letterman to discuss the original piece, which he admitted he had not read but that Scovell "assigned" to him for the later meeting "as homework."  Scovell indicates Letterman was contrite, quoting him as saying "I’m sorry I was that way and I was happy to have read the piece because it wasn’t angering. I felt horrible because who wants to be the guy that makes people unhappy to work where they’re working?"  She also indicated that since 2009 "the number of female writers and writers of color in late night has improved, in part because you can’t go lower than zero," citing ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]]'' as the only late night show that had "gender parity" in the writers' room.  She summarizes her discussion with Letterman with the observation "We need more dialogue so men can understand the difference between criticism and condemnation. And we need more dialogue so women can voice discomfort without fear of retaliation."  <ref name="VanityFair2019">{{cite web |last1=Scovell |first1=Nell |title=Ten Years Ago, I Called Out David Letterman.
