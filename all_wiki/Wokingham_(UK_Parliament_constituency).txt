'''Wokingham''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] since [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]] by [[John Redwood]], a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].

== History ==
Originally, Wokingham was part of a larger constituency of [[Berkshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Berkshire]], which returned two Members of Parliament (MPs), increased to three in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]]. In the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885]] Berkshire was divided into three county constituencies, [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern (Abingdon)]], [[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Southern (Newbury)]], and Eastern (Wokingham), and two [[Borough constituency|borough constituencies]], [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] and [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|New Windsor]], each returning one member.   The constituency was abolished under the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] being largely replaced by the new Windsor Division of Berkshire, with Wokingham itself being added to the Newbury Division.

The second version of the seat was created for the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]].  From 1983, its borders have gradually been moved westwards as new constituencies were created in the east of the county.

The constituency has been represented since 1987 by the high-profile Conservative [[John Redwood]].

==Boundaries and boundary changes==
'''1885–1918''': The Sessional Divisions of Maidenhead and Windsor, part of the Sessional Division of Wokingham, and in the Sessional Division of Reading the parishes of East Swallowfield and West Swallowfield.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/publicgeneralac01walegoog|title=The public general acts|last=Great Britain|first=Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales|publisher=Proprietors of the Law Journal Reports, 1884|others=unknown library|language=English}}</ref>

'''1950–1955''': The Borough of Wokingham, and the Rural Districts of Easthampstead and Wokingham.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Boundaries of parliamentary constituencies 1885-1972;|last=S.|first=Craig, Fred W.|date=1972|publisher=Political Reference Publications|isbn=0900178094|location=Chichester|oclc=539011}}</ref>

'''1955–1974''': The Borough of Wokingham, the Rural Districts of Easthampstead and Wokingham, and the East ward of the County Borough of Reading.<ref name=":0" />  From the 1964 general election, the Park ward of Reading replaced the East ward following a revision to the local authority wards.<ref name=":0" />

'''1974–1983''': The Borough of Wokingham, the Rural District of Easthampstead, and in the Rural District of Wokingham the parishes of Remenham, Ruscombe, St Nicholas Hurst, Twyford, Wargrave, and Wokingham Without.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1970/1674/contents/made/data.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1970|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>

The Park ward of the County Borough of Reading was transferred to the re-established County Constituency of [[Reading South (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading South]], along with western parts of the Rural District of Wokingham.

'''1983–1997''': The District of Wokingham wards of Bulmershe, California, Charvil, Coronation, Emmbrook, Evendons, Hurst, Little Hungerford, Loddon, Norreys, Redhatch, Remenham and Wargrave, St Sebastian's, Sonning, South Lake, Twyford and Ruscombe, Wescott, Whitegates, and Winnersh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1983/417/contents/made/data.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1983|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>

The seat regained north-western parts of the abolished County Constituency of Reading South, and eastern areas comprising the District of Bracknell (formerly the Rural District of Easthampstead) formed the bulk of the new County Constituency of [[East Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Berkshire.]]

'''1997–2010''': The District of Wokingham wards of Arborfield, Barkham, Emmbrook, Evendons, Little Hungerford, Norreys, Redhatch, Shinfield, Swallowfield, Wescott, and Winnersh, and the District of Newbury wards of Burghfield and Mortimer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/1626/made/data.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1995|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>

The boundaries moved westwards, gaining parts of [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]] (including Shinfield) and of [[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Newbury]]. The seat lost northern areas to Reading East and the new County Constituency of [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]], as well as the ward of Wokingham Without in the south to the new County Constituency of [[Bracknell (UK Parliament constituency)|Bracknell]].

'''2010–present''': The District of Wokingham wards of Arborfield, Barkham, Emmbrook, Evendons, Hawkedon, Hillside, Maiden Erlegh, Norreys, Shinfield North, Shinfield South, Swallowfield, Wescott, and Winnersh, and the District of West Berkshire wards of Burghfield, Mortimer, and Sulhamstead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1681/made/data.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>

This change saw a further minor gain from [[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Newbury]].

The seat is currently centred on the southern part of [[Wokingham (district)|Wokingham district]], including a small part of the east of [[West Berkshire]]. It is in the [[South East England|South East]] region of England.

The neighbouring constituencies (clockwise from north) are: [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading West]], [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]], [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]], [[Bracknell (UK Parliament constituency)|Bracknell]], [[North East Hampshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Hampshire]], [[Basingstoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Basingstoke]], [[Hampshire North West (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Hampshire]] and [[Newbury (constituency)|Newbury]].
