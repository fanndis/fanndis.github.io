From November 2016 to June 2019, the Liberal Alliance was part of a [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet|three-party coalition government]] with the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] (Venstre) and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]].

== History ==
[[File:Danish Liberal Alliance logo 2016.png|thumb|220px|2008–2019 party logo]]
The party was founded as the New Alliance ({{lang-da|Ny Alliance}}) on 7 May 2007 by [[Naser Khader]] [[Folketinget|MP]], [[Anders Samuelsen]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] from the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] and [[Gitte Seeberg]], a [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] MEP.<ref name="BengtssonHansen2013"/><ref name=cphpost>{{cite news|title=New Alliance could crack government |date=2007-08-05 |publisher=[[The Copenhagen Post]] |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/get/101609.html |accessdate=2007-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925002309/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/101609.html |archive-date=2007-09-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The party supported the government of the  [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] and Conservative People's Party.<ref name="BengtssonHansen2013"/><ref name="Thomas2016"/> To comply with Danish election law and to be able to stand for elections the Liberal Alliance had to gather 19,185 signatures of supporters on special forms, the number being equivalent to one parliamentary seat in the [[Folketing]]. Each completed form had to be certified with the [[civil registry]] offices of municipalities before being collectively handed in to the [[Ministry of Welfare (Denmark)|Ministry of the Interior]]. While the Liberal Alliance did not take any stand on this offer, the minor party [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]] offered to let the Liberal Alliance put forward candidates on their lists in the event of an election being called before the Liberal Alliance had finished its nomination process.<ref>{{cite news | title=CD tilbyder at hjælpe Ny Alliance med underskrifter | date=2007-05-11 | publisher=[[Danmarks Radio]] | url =http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2007/05/11/062339.htm?rss=true | accessdate = 2007-05-25 | language = da}}</ref>

On one occasion on 12 May 2007 in [[Horsens]], the three leading figures of the party managed to collect over 2,000 signatures in one day.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ny Alliance samlede 2.000 underskrifter | date=2007-05-12 | publisher=[[Danmarks Radio]] | url =http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2007/05/12/164354.htm?rss=true | accessdate = 2007-05-25 | language = da}}</ref> On 21 May, the party reported they were half-way, having gathered in 10,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite news | first=Mikkel | last=Gottlieb | title=Ny Alliance halvvejs i mål | date=2007-05-21 | publisher=[[Berlingske Tidende]] | url=http://www.berlingske.dk/indland/artikel:aid=898246 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20110910092832/http://www.berlingske.dk/indland/artikel:aid=898246 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2011-09-10 | accessdate=2007-05-25 | language=da }}</ref> The party finally completed its nomination process on 29 June by being accepted on the Ministry of the Interior's list of parties able to stand for elections to the Folketing after handing in the 21,516 required signatures.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ny Alliance godkendt og vælger bogstav Y| date=2007-06-21 | publisher=[[B.T.

Just one day after the announcement of the party, more than 12,000 had registered on the party website. Three days later, 16,000 had registered and 8,000 of these had paid the membership fee.<ref>{{cite news | first=Lea | last=Wind-Friis | title=Medlemmer gider godt betale til Ny Alliance | date=2007-05-10 | publisher=[[Politiken]] | url =http://politiken.dk/indland/article303237.ece | accessdate = 2007-05-13 | language = da}}</ref>

On 30 August 2007, the party publicly launched a policy programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/politik/article.php/id-8099911.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080113125253/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/politik/article.php/id-8099911.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-01-13|title=Ekspert: Khader var overbevisende|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]]|language=da|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> Some of the points in this programme included longer mandatory school attendance, with free food and homework aid; a European [[Marshall Plan]] to the [[Middle East]]; increasing foreign aid to 1% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]; increased focus on prevention in public health, with lower prices on healthy foods; and an exhaustive reform related to immigration and asylum politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/politik/article.php/id-8100789.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080113125253/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/politik/article.php/id-8100789.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-01-13|title=Det støtter Ny Alliance|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]]|language=da|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> In the [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|2007 general election]] held on 13 November 2007, the party won 2.8% of the vote, winning 5 of 179 seats in the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]].

On 29 January 2008, founding member [[Gitte Seeberg]] left the party in protest against the party's status as a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] party which conflicted with her own desire to form a [[centrism|centrist]] party while rejecting the influence of the [[Danish People's Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article464717.ece |title=Gitte Seeberg forlader Ny Alliance |language=da |publisher=[[Politiken]] |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2008-01-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201090842/http://politiken.dk/politik/article464717.ece |archive-date=2008-02-01 }}</ref> On 5 February 2008, [[Malou Aamund]], another of the party's members of parliament, left the party and joined the governing Liberal Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article467599.ece|title=Malou Aamund forlader Ny Alliance|publisher=[[Politiken]]|language=da|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2008-02-05|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208092519/http://politiken.dk/politik/article467599.ece|archive-date=2008-02-08}}</ref> On 24 June 2008, [[Jørgen Poulsen]] was excluded from the Liberal Alliance's parliamentary group, although not from the party itself.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Politiken]]|language=da|date=2008-06-24|accessdate=2008-06-24|url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article529006.ece|title=NA smider Jørgen Poulsen ud af gruppen|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627140144/http://politiken.dk/politik/article529006.ece|archive-date=2008-06-27}}</ref> Under the new leadership of [[Anders Samuelsen]], the party position moved towards the right, espousing [[economic liberalism]] and [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] policies,<ref name="BengtssonHansen2013"/> with the party changing its name to the Liberal Alliance on 27 August 2008.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=da |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2008-08-28 |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article559064.ece |title=Nu dropper Ny Alliance også navnet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903044251/http://politiken.dk/politik/article559064.ece |archive-date=2008-09-03 }}</ref>

In the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 general election]] held on 18 June 2015, the party won 7.5% of the vote and 13 seats in the Folketing. In its most successful constituency, [[Gentofte Municipality]], a well-off suburb of Copenhagen, it even scored 17.5% while on [[Bornholm]] its share of votes was only 4%. Initially, the party did not participate in [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]]'s [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen II Cabinet|Venstre minority cabinet]], but it did lent its parliamentary support to the government. In late November 2016, it joined a three-party centre-right coalition government alongside Venstre and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] in [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet|Løkke Rasmussen's third cabinet]]. Party leader Anders Samuelsen was appointed [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] while [[Simon Emil Ammitzbøll-Bille]] took the post of Minister of the Economy and Interior.

== Ideology ==
The original New Alliance considered itself a [[centrist]] party, "taking the best values of [[social liberalism]] and [[social conservatism]]".<ref>{{cite news | first=Nikolaj | last=Worm | title=Ny Alliance drager på landsturné | date=2007-05-07 | publisher=[[Jyllands-Posten]] | url =http://jp.dk/indland/article926769.ece | accessdate = 2011-08-26 | language = da}}</ref> By using these two terms, the New Alliance positioned itself equidistant between the former parties of the three founding members. Social liberalism is the official ideology of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] whereas social conservatism is a term sometimes invoked by members of the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] who stress the support of the [[Welfare state|welfare society]] such as Liberal Alliance co-founder Gitte Seeberg. In the earliest days of the party's existence, the party was accused of [[populism]] or [[personalism]], still lacking stances on many topics and based on the popularity of [[Naser Khader]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Økonom: Populistisk skatteforslag fra Ny Alliance | date=2007-05-09 | publisher=Fyens Stiftstidende | url =http://www.fyens.dk/article/797211 | accessdate = 2007-05-13 | language = da }}</ref> After Gitte Seeberg left the party, the "social conservatism" part was dropped and the party name was changed to the Liberal Alliance. However, there were still considerable ideological differences among the two remaining founders and it was not until [[Naser Khader]] was replaced by [[Anders Samuelsen]] that the party took on a more [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] identity.<ref name="Lisi2019"/> The party has proposed extensive [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] reforms, including a [[tax reform]] replacing [[progressive tax|progressive income tax]] with a [[Flat tax|flat-rate]] income tax of 40%, halving rates of [[Corporate tax|corporation tax]], instigating user charges for public healthcare, abolishing  early retirement schemes and reassessing everyone receiving disability benefits.<ref>[http://cphpost.dk/news/against-the-grain.1118.html "Against the grain"], ''The Copenhagen Post'', March 25, 2012</ref>

In 2011, the party opposed the government's entry of Denmark into the [[Euro Plus Pact]].

== Organisation ==
=== Funding ===
The party received donations from the [[investment bank]] [[Saxo Bank]] (500,000 [[Danish krone]]r) and the businessman [[Lars Kolind]] (100,000 kroner).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} As of 22 May 2007, the party had seven paid employees and a number of volunteers.

=== Liberal Alliance Youth ===
On 23 February 2008, a [[youth wing]] to the party was formed by 21 people under the name of Young Alliance ({{lang-da|Ung Alliance}}).<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Politiken]]|language=da|date=2008-02-23|accessdate=2008-02-23|url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article475158.ece|title=21 unge stifter Ung Alliance|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226160814/http://politiken.dk/politik/article475158.ece|archive-date=2008-02-26}}</ref> When the party changed its name to the Liberal Alliance, the youth branch followed suit changing its name to the [[Liberal Alliance Youth]].

=== European parliament affiliations ===
At its formation, two MEPs joined the party. With the defection of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] [[Gitte Seeberg]] and [[Anders Samuelsen]], the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservatives]] and the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] were effectively left without representation in the [[European Parliament]]. The two [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] did stay in their parliamentary groups ([[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP-ED]] and [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|ALDE]], respectively). Both resigned from the European Parliament after being elected to the Danish Parliament in November 2007. The Liberal Alliance announced that it would join the ALDE group after future [[Elections in the European Union|European Parliament elections]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Kenneth |last=Lund |title=Ny Alliance udraderer R og K i EU-parlamentet |date=2007-05-07 |publisher=[[Politiken]] |url=http://politiken.dk/eu/article299658.ece |accessdate=2007-05-13 |language=da |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509033336/http://politiken.dk/eu/article299658.ece |archive-date=2007-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the party failed to achieve representation in the European Parliament in both the 2009 and 2014 European Parliament elections.
