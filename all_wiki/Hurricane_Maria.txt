'''Hurricane Maria''' was a deadly [[Saffir–Simpson scale#Category 5|Category 5]] [[hurricane]] that devastated [[Dominica]], [[St Croix]], and [[Puerto Rico]] in September 2017. It is regarded as the worst natural disaster in recorded history to affect those islands and was also the [[List of deadliest Atlantic hurricanes|deadliest Atlantic hurricane]] since [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]] in [[1998 Atlantic hurricane season|1998]]. The [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|tenth most intense]] [[Atlantic hurricane season|Atlantic hurricane]] on record and the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in [[Tropical cyclones in 2017|2017]], Maria was the thirteenth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], eighth consecutive [[hurricane]], fourth [[major hurricane]], second [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;5 hurricane]], and deadliest storm of the hyperactive [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season]]. At its peak, the hurricane caused catastrophic destruction and numerous fatalities across the northeastern [[Caribbean]], compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the [[Leeward Islands]] already struck by [[Hurricane Irma]]. Total losses from the hurricane are estimated at upwards of $91.61 billion (2017 [[USD]]), mostly in Puerto Rico, ranking it as the [[List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes|third-costliest tropical cyclone on record]].

Originating from a [[tropical wave]], Maria became a tropical storm on September 16, east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Highly favorable [[Tropical cyclone#Factors|environmental conditions]] allowed the storm to undergo [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] as it approached the island arc. The hurricane reached Category&nbsp;5 strength on September 18 just before making landfall on Dominica, becoming the first Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on record to strike the island. After weakening slightly due to crossing Dominica, Maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern Caribbean with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of 908&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.81&nbsp;inHg). On September&nbsp;20, an [[eyewall replacement cycle]] took place, weakening Maria to a high-end Category&nbsp;4 hurricane by the time it struck Puerto Rico. Interaction with land further weakened the hurricane, though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]. Moving slowly to the north, Maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on September 28. Embedded in the [[westerlies]], Maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open Atlantic, becoming [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] on September 30 and dissipating by October 2.

Maria wrought catastrophic devastation to the entirety of Dominica, which suffered an island-wide communication blackout. Much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair, while the island's lush vegetation was practically eradicated. The islands of Guadeloupe and [[Martinique]] endured widespread flooding, damaged roofs, and uprooted trees. Puerto Rico also suffered catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis; most of the island's population suffered from flooding and a lack of resources, compounded by the slow relief process. The storm caused the worst electrical blackout in US history, and in June 2018, thousands of homes and businesses were still without power.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Giusti |first1=Carlos |title=Puerto Rico issues new data on Hurricane Maria deaths |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/puerto-rico-issues-new-data-hurricane-maria-deaths-n882816 |website=NBC News |access-date=August 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618112859/https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/puerto-rico-issues-new-data-hurricane-maria-deaths-n882816 |archive-date=June 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the Leeward Islands in two weeks, after Irma had made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and [[Hurricane Jose (2017)|Hurricane Jose]] passed dangerously close shortly afterward, bringing tropical storm force winds to [[Barbuda]].

===Puerto Rico===

Prior to both Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] (PREPA), already struggling with increasing debt, had seen budget cuts imposed by [[PROMESA]] as well as the loss of 30&nbsp;percent of its work force since 2012. With the median age of PREPA power plants at 44&nbsp;years, an aging infrastructure across the island made the electric grid more susceptible to damage from storms. Inadequate safety mechanisms also plagued Puerto Rico's electric company, and local newspapers frequently reported on its poor maintenance and outdated control systems.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Mufson|agency=The Washington Post|newspaper=The Star|date=September 21, 2017|access-date=September 22, 2017|title=Puerto Rico's electric company was already $9 billion in debt before hurricanes hit|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/09/21/puerto-ricos-electric-company-was-already-9-billion-in-debt-before-hurricanes-hit.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921225317/https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/09/21/puerto-ricos-electric-company-was-already-9-billion-in-debt-before-hurricanes-hit.html|archive-date=September 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[NEXRAD]] [[Weather radar|Doppler weather radar]] of Puerto Rico was blown away.

The radar is {{cvt|2,800|ft}} above sea level, and the anemometer at the site measured winds of about {{cvt|145|mph}} before communications broke, which means winds at that height were likely 20 percent higher than what was seen at sea level.

The island's agriculture, a vital source of income for many, was obliterated as most trees were flattened. Meanwhile, the driving force of the economy—tourism—was expected to be scarce in the months that followed Maria. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit characterized the devastation wrought by Irma and Maria as a sign of climate change and the threat it poses to the survival of his country, stating, "To deny climate change ... is to deny a truth we have just lived."<ref name=abcnewsdominica /> Many islanders suffered respiratory problems as a result of excessive dust borne out of the debris.

FEMA was a major supplier of relief in the form of bereavement, food, and other emergency supplies, as well as rebuilding some homes. FEMA's relief efforts in Puerto Rico post-Maria engaged a smaller work force and budget than the agency's efforts in Texas and Florida, in the wake of Hurricanes [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]] and [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], respectively. FEMA does not rebuild homes to which the owner has no title, which has presented a major obstacle for many Puerto Ricans, who may have erected structures on family plots without procuring legal paperwork beforehand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2018/04/25/economy/puerto-rico-no-title-no-lease-and-no-assistance-rebuild|title=No Title, No Lease, No Assistance to Rebuild|last=Balonon-Rosen|first=Peter|date=April 26, 2018|website=Market Place|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519033251/https://www.marketplace.org/2018/04/25/economy/puerto-rico-no-title-no-lease-and-no-assistance-rebuild|archive-date=May 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Compounding the problem in rebuilding the housing infrastructure is the fact that only about 50% of houses in Puerto Rico were covered by insurance policies that protect against wind damage, meaning that homeowners were reliant on their own money, FEMA, or other charities rather than insurance proceeds for rebuilding.<ref name=WSJWind>{{Cite web |first2= Leslie |last2= Scism |first1= Nicole |last1= Friedman |title= Hurricane Maria Exposes a Common Problem for Puerto Rico Homeowners: No Insurance - Only about half of houses on the island are covered by policies that protect against wind damage |publisher= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= September 20, 2017 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-maria-exposes-a-common-problem-for-puerto-rico-homeowners-no-insurance-1505940660 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190419143910/https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-maria-exposes-a-common-problem-for-puerto-rico-homeowners-no-insurance-1505940660 |archive-date= April 19, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref> Although banks require that people with mortgages have homeowner's insurance, Puerto Rico has a low mortgage penetration rate with only 500,000 active mortgages in a population of 3 million as many homes are fully owned by families and passed to the next generation.<ref name=WSJWind /> In addition, 10% of mortgage holders in Puerto Rico were delinquent at the time (compared to 5.8% on the mainland), an indication of the fragile state of the local economy.<ref name=WSJWind />

The deaths of 64 people were initially directly attributed to the hurricane by the government of Puerto Rico.<ref name="HurricaneCounting">{{cite news|publisher=Fox News|author=Nicole Darrah|date=August 28, 2018|access-date=August 28, 2018|title=Puerto Rico governor raises Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to 2,975|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/28/puerto-rico-governor-raises-hurricane-maria-death-toll-from-64-to-2975.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828211640/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/28/puerto-rico-governor-raises-hurricane-maria-death-toll-from-64-to-2975.html|archive-date=August 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the immediate months following Maria, the initial death toll relayed from the Government of Puerto Rico came into question by media outlets, politicians, and investigative journalists. Scores of people who survived the hurricane's initial onslaught later died from complications in its aftermath. Catastrophic damage to infrastructure and communication hampered efforts to accurately document the total loss of life.

Frustrated with the federal government's "slow and inadequate response", relief group [[Oxfam]] announced on October 2 that it planned to get involved in the humanitarian aid effort, sending a team to "assess a targeted and effective response" and support its local partners' on-the-ground efforts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hui|first1=Mary|title=Donald Trump criticised by Oxfam for 'slow and inadequate' Puerto Rico response|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-oxfam-puerto-rico-response-criticism-relief-effort-hurricane-maria-a7982381.html|website=The Independent|access-date=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008145944/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-oxfam-puerto-rico-response-criticism-relief-effort-hurricane-maria-a7982381.html|archive-date=October 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The organization released a statement, saying in part: "While the US government is engaged in relief efforts, it has failed to address the most urgent needs.

After visiting Puerto Rico about two months after the hurricane, [[Refugees International]] issued a report that severely criticized the slow response of the federal authorities, noted poor coordination and logistics, and indicated the island was still in an emergency mode and in need of more help.<ref name=coto/>

''[[Politico]]'' compared the federal response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to that for [[Hurricane Harvey]], which had hit the greater Houston area of Texas a month earlier. Though Maria caused catastrophic damage, the response was slower in quantitative terms.<ref name="politico">{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/27/donald-trump-fema-hurricane-maria-response-480557 |title=How Trump favored Texas over Puerto Rico |author=Danny Vinik |date=27 Mar 2018 |work=[[Politico]] |access-date=April 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404235701/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/27/donald-trump-fema-hurricane-maria-response-480557 |archive-date=April 4, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A [[Harvard Humanitarian Initiative]] analysis of the military deployment in March 2018 said the military mission in Puerto Rico after hurricane was better than critics say but suffered flaws.  It concluded that the U.S. military itself performed as well in Puerto Rico as it does in its international relief missions, and that coordination had been greatly improved since Katrina, but that real shortcomings exist in planning for disasters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://theconversation.com/military-mission-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-was-better-than-critics-say-but-suffered-flaws-91558 | title = Military mission in Puerto Rico after hurricane was better than critics say but suffered flaws | date = March 30, 2018 | access-date = September 22, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180922101607/http://theconversation.com/military-mission-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-was-better-than-critics-say-but-suffered-flaws-91558 | archive-date = September 22, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://wtop.com/national/2018/03/military-mission-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-was-better-than-critics-say-but-suffered-flaws/ | title = WTOP Military mission in Puerto Rico | publisher = AP | access-date = September 22, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180922101725/https://wtop.com/national/2018/03/military-mission-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-was-better-than-critics-say-but-suffered-flaws/ | archive-date = September 22, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

After the official death toll was updated to the estimated 2,975 on August 28, 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] stated that he still believed the federal government did a "fantastic job" in its hurricane response .<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/politics/trump-puerto-rico-fantastic/index.html|title=Trump touts Puerto Rico response as 'fantastic' despite nearly 3,000 dead|author1=Kevin Liptak|author2-link=Jeremy Diamond (journalist)|author2=Jeremy Diamond|work=CNN|access-date=2018-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829214046/https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/politics/trump-puerto-rico-fantastic/index.html|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and less than a month later Trump described the federal response to Hurricane Maria as "an incredible, unsung success ... the best job we did was Puerto Rico [compared to hurricanes in Texas and Florida] but nobody would understand that".

===Whitefish Energy contract===

[[File:Puerto Rico at night before and after Hurricane Maria.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of lights at night in Puerto Rico before ''(top)'' and after ''(bottom)'' Hurricane Maria]]
Soon after the hurricane struck, [[Whitefish Energy]], a small Montana-based company with only two full-time employees, was awarded a $300 million contract by [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority|PREPA, Puerto Rico's state-run power company]], to repair Puerto Rico's power grid, a move considered by many to be highly unusual for several reasons.<ref name="wash_Smal" /> The company contracted more than 300 personnel, most of them subcontractors, and sent them to the island to carry out work. PREPA cited Whitefish's comparatively small upfront cost of $3.7 million for mobilization as one of the main reasons for contracting them over larger companies. PREPA Executive Director Ricardo Ramos stated: "Whitefish was the only company—it was the first that could be mobilized to Puerto Rico. It did not ask us to be paid soon or a guarantee to pay".<ref name="Whitefish_ABC">{{cite news|author1=Erin Dooley|author2=Stephanie Ebbs|author3=Joshua Hoyos|publisher=ABC News|date=October 24, 2017|access-date=October 25, 2017|title=Lawmakers asking why small Montana business landed $300M Puerto Rico power restoration contract|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-small-montana-business-landed-300m-puerto-rico/story?id=50682108|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025010205/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-small-montana-business-landed-300m-puerto-rico/story?id=50682108|archive-date=October 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> No requests for assistance had been made to the [[American Public Power Association]] by October 24.<ref name="Whitefish_ABC"/> The decision to hire such a tiny company was considered highly unusual by many, such as former Energy Department official Susan Tierney, who stated: "The fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out, it is at least odd why [the utility] would go to Whitefish".<ref name="wash_Smal" /> Several representatives, both Democrats and Republicans, also voiced their concern over the choice to contract Whitefish instead of other companies.<ref name="Whitefish_ABC"/> As the company was based in Whitefish, Montana, the hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and one of Zinke's sons had once done a summer internship at Whitefish, Zinke knew Whitefish's CEO personally.

On April 19, 2018 (Thursday), Puerto Rico's power company said that it has restored electricity to all customers affected by an island-wide blackout that was caused by an excavator hitting a transmission line, but tens of thousands of families still remain without normal service seven months after hurricanes Maria and Irma.<ref>{{cite web|date=April 19, 2018|title=Power restored to those hit by Puerto Rico blackout|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2018-04-19/puerto-rico-restores-power-to-over-70-perecnt-of-customers-after-blackout|access-date=April 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501170522/https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2018-04-19/puerto-rico-restores-power-to-over-70-perecnt-of-customers-after-blackout|archive-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said one week before the blackout that about 700,000 Americans in Puerto Rico didn't have power after a line repaired by Montana contracting firm Whitefish Energy had failed.

On April 11, 2018, at the 40th session of the Regional Association Hurricane Committee, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired the name ''Maria'' from its rotating name lists, due to the highly extensive amount of damage and loss of life it caused along its path, especially in Dominica, Saint Croix, and Puerto Rico, and it will never again be used to name an [[Atlantic hurricane]].
