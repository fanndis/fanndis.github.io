'''Manuel''' "'''Manolo'''" '''Blahnik Rodríguez''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBEh}} ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ|l|oʊ|_|ˈ|b|l|ɑː|n|ɪ|k}};<ref>{{IPA-es|manˈwel maˈnolo ˈβlanik roˈðɾiɣeθ}}, {{IPA-cs|ˈblaɦɲiːk|lang}}</ref> born 27 November 1942), is a Spanish fashion designer and founder of the [[wikt:eponymous|eponymous]] high-end shoe brand.

==Biography==
[[File:Manolo Blahnik.jpg|thumb|Display of a Manolo Blahnik shoe]]
Blahnik was born in [[Santa Cruz de la Palma]], in the [[Canary Islands]] (Spain), to a Czech father and Spanish mother. His father left [[Prague]] in the 1930s to avoid rising fascism; his grandparents disappeared in the 1950s after the Communists took charge.<ref name="efe">{{cite news |title=Blahnik se reencuentra con sus raíces checas con una retrospectiva en Praga |url=https://www.efe.com/efe/america/gente/blahnik-se-reencuentra-con-sus-raices-checas-una-retrospectiva-en-praga/20000014-3349140 |accessdate=30 April 2019 |agency=EFE |date=10 August 2017 |language=es}}</ref> His mother's family owned a banana plantation in the [[La Palma|island]] city of Santa Cruz de la Palma, where he grew up alongside his sister, Evangelina.<ref>{{cite news |title=Blahnik, premio nacional de moda: "Los hombres me dicen que he salvado sus matrimonios"|url=https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1662116/0/manolo-blahnik/premio-nacional/zapatos-lujo/ |accessdate=30 April 2019 |work=20minutos.es |date=28 November 2012 |language=es}}</ref> He was homeschooled when he was a child. After he grew up, he attended a Swiss boarding school. Later, his parents wanted him to be a diplomat and enrolled him at the [[University of Geneva]] majoring in Politics and Law. However, Blahnik changed his majors to Literature and Architecture. In 1965, he got his degree and moved to Paris to study art at the École des Beaux-Arts and Stage Set Design at the Louvre Art School, all while working at a vintage clothing shop.<ref>[http://www.designmuseum.org/design/manolo-blahnik Manolo Blahnik] ''Design Museum'' Retrieved 7 August 2008</ref> In 1969, he moved to London to work as a buyer at fashion boutique "Feathers" and wrote for ''[[L’Uomo Vogue]]'', an Italian men's version of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.

In 1969, Blahnik had a chance to meet [[Diana Vreeland]], the editor-in-chief of ''U.S Vogue'', while he was traveling in New York. He then presented his portfolio of fashions and set designs to Vreeland, at which point she looked him straight in the eye and said, "Young man, make things, make accessories, make shoes." She admired his shoe sketches and advised him to concentrate on designing footwear. Blahnik followed her advice and worked on designing shoes.<ref name="Morton, Camilla 2011 p. 101">Morton, Camilla (2011). ''Manolo Blahnik and the Tale of the Elves and the Shoemaker'', p. 101. Harper Entertainment. {{ISBN|0061917303}}.</ref>

In 1971, [[Ossie Clark]] invited him to create shoes for his runway show, he also designed shoes for other London fashion designers, such as [[Jean Muir]] and [[Zandra Rhodes]]. From 1971, Blahnik was selling Manolo Blahnik shoes for Zapata. With a loan of £2,000, Blahnik bought the Zapata Shoe Company from its owner and opened his own boutique. In 1974, Blahnik became the second man ever to be featured on the cover of ''U.K. Vogue'' (after [[Helmut Berger]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/collectible-and-iconic-vogue-covers|title=Vogue's Collectible Covers|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://michellephan.com/5-favorites-iconic-vintage-magazine-covers/|title=5 Favorites: Iconic Vintage Magazine Covers - Michelle Phan|date=10 October 2014}}</ref>

In 1977, Blahnik created his first American collection. These were sold in 1978 through [[Bloomingdales]]. Blahnik opened his first boutique in the US in 1979.

Manolo Blahnik's flagship store remains in [[Old Church Street]] in the [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] district of [[London]].

Blahnik's boutiques are located in London, New York, Geneva, Madrid, Barcelona, Moscow, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, and Taipei. [[Bloomingdales]] (for which he created his first American collection), [[Nordstrom]], [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Barneys]], [[Bergdorf Goodman]] and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] carry his line in the United States and newly opened in [[Dubai Mall]]. The company has signed a long-term deal with the shoewear retailer [[Kurt Geiger]] to operate Manolo Blahnik boutiques.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drapersonline.com/kurt-geiger-signs-long-term-deal-with-manolo-blahnik/5036702.article |title=Kurt Geiger signs long-term deal with Manolo Blahnik|date=14 May 2012|author=Ruth Faulkner|publisher=Drapers Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2012/05/14/manolo-blahnik-branches-out-with-kurt-geiger-deal.htm |title=Manolo Blahnik Collaborates With Kurt Geiger! |publisher=Grazia Daily |date=14 May 2012|author=Caroline Ferry}}</ref>

In 2000, Blahnik, together with [[Neiman Marcus]], launched the first commercial virtual reality online showroom featuring 3D models of his shoes. The entire collection was sold out online within three weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/07/technology/online-shopper-temptation-in-spike-heels-and-a-devilish-price-tag.html|title=ONLINE SHOPPER; Temptation, in Spike Heels And a Devilish Price Tag|last=Slatalla|first=Michelle|date=2000-09-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Blahnik was elevated to the [[International Best Dressed List]] Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2007, Blahnik was appointed as an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for his service to the British fashion industry.

==Early development==
One of Blahnik's greatest inspirations was his mother.<ref name="TALK AISA" >CNN.(17 March 2012). CNN. ''Talk Asia: Interview with Manolo Blahnik'' Retrieved from http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1203/17/ta.01.html</ref> She studied fashion magazines and interpreted the latest fashion trend on her clothing. Blahnik and his family often travelled to Paris and Madrid ordering clothes. His mother was always dissatisfied with the shoes from their hometown, so she made her own.  She learned the rudiments of her craft from a local [[Canary Islands|Canary Island]] [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] and as a boy, Blahnik loved to watch his mother when she made beautiful shoes. He has inherited his mother's love for brocade and satin fabrics and recounted how, as a boy, he found a trunk filled with shoes by the famous Russian, Pierre Yantorny all made from silks, antique lace and brocades trimmed with delicate buckles. All were light, elegant and feminine; attributes Blahnik later brought to his own designs.<ref name="Manolo" >Stylesequel. ''Manolo Blahnik Biography'' Retrieved from http://www.stylesequel.com/designers/manolo-blahnik/biography</ref>

When Blahnik was attending university he lived with his aunt and uncle. Meanwhile, his aunt deeply influenced his fashion sense and style. He refined his tastes and learned to appreciate the beauty of luxury, art, and happiness and beauty.  Blahnik recalled that according to his aunt, "happiness was having the single most elegant handbag ever made, in every color available."<ref>Morton, Camilla (2011). ''Manolo Blahnik and the Tale of the Elves and the Shoemaker'', p. 23. Harper Entertainment. {{ISBN|0061917303}}.</ref>

==Shoes==
Blahnik never studied shoemaking formally.<ref name="TALK AISA"/> He learned the skills by visiting shoe factories and talking to pattern cutters, technicians, and machine operators. At first, he designed men's footwear, but he immediately found that men's shoe design limited his imagination and lacked the element of fashion so he focussed on woman's shoes. When mainstream shoe styles were still dominated by clunky platforms in the 1970s, he revived the sleek stiletto heel, which has since become a classic. Also, he dislikes wedges and believes in the power of heels and the sex appeal they convey.<ref>[http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/manolo-blahnik-biography] Jo Craven. "Manolo Blahnik". Vogue UK, 20 April 2008.</ref>

==Filmography==
Blahnik is the subject of the 2017 [[documentary]] film: ''Manolo: The Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards,'' written and directed by [[Michael Roberts (fashion journalist)|Michael Roberts]]
