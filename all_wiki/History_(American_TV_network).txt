'''History''' (formerly '''The History Channel''' from 1995 to 2008 and stylized as '''HISTORY''') is a [[pay television]] [[television network|network]] and [[flagship channel]] that is owned by [[A&E Networks]], a [[joint venture]] between [[Hearst Communications]] and the [[Disney Media Networks]] division of [[the Walt Disney Company]].

The network was originally focused on [[history]]-based documentaries and historical fiction series though, during the late 2000s, History would [[channel drift|drift]] into [[reality television]] programming. In addition to this change in format, the network is also criticized by many scientists, historians, and skeptics for broadcasting pseudodocumentaries and unsubstantiated, sensational investigative programming.

As of February 2015, around 96,149,000 American households (82.6% of households with television) receive the network's flagship channel, History.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223220414/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2015|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref> International localized versions of History are available, in various forms, in [[India]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]].

[[File:The History Channel logo.png|left|thumb|150px|The History Channel's original logo, used from January 1, 1995 to February 15, 2008. In the station’s early years, the red background was not there, and later it sometimes appeared blue (documentaries), light green (biographies), purple (sitcoms), yellow (reality), or orange (short form) instead of red.]]
The company indicated that plans for a history channel were in the works in 1993, it purchased the Lou Reda Productions documentary library and long-term rights for the Hearst Entertainment documentaries archive. '''The History Channel''' was launched on January 1, 1995 with its UK counterpart following on November 1, 1995 in partnership with [[Sky (company)|British Sky Broadcasting]].<ref name=idc>{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 32 |date=2000 |publisher=St. James Press |via=Funding Universe.com |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/a-e-television-networks-history/ |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |chapter=A & E Television Networks History}}</ref> its original format focused entirely on historical series and [[television special|specials]].

During the 1990s, History was jokingly referred to as "The [[Hitler]] Channel" for its extensive coverage of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schone |first1=Mark |title=Media Circus: All Hitler all the time |url=https://www.salon.com/test/1997/05/08/media_90/ |accessdate=May 27, 2020 |work=Salon |date=May 8, 1997 |language=en}}</ref> Much of its military-themed programming has been shifted to its sister network [[Military History (TV channel)|Military History]].

A&E Networks considered History to be the driver in international expansion due to a lack of international rights to A&E international co-productions. As expected, the History Channel led A&E's overseas expansion in Brazil with TVA (April 1996), the Nordic and Baltic regions with Modern Times Group (1997), and in Canada (1997).<ref name=idc/>

History expanded in 1998 into tours of U.S. landmarks with Mayflower Tours having an affiliated website (historytravel.com), ''History Channel Traveler'', and a planned quarterly magazine. While in October, History and [[MSG Network]] teamed up to produce several short-form sports history programs. A+E spun out in November 1998 [[H2 (TV channel)|History Channel International]] from the History Channel.<ref name=idc/>

On February 16, 2008, a new logo was launched on the U.S. network as part of a rebranding effort. While the trademark "H" was kept, the triangle shape on the left acts as a play button for animation and flyouts during commercials and shows. On March 20, 2008, as part of that same rebranding effort, The History Channel dropped "The" and "Channel" from its name to become simply "History.”<ref>International Herald Tribune [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/20/arts/TV-History-Channel.php Television's The History Channel Drops 'The' and 'Channel' from Its Name, Keeps History] March 20, 2008</ref>

== Programming ==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by History (TV channel)}}
[[File:History HD Logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|In early 2013, use of the HD logo on the HD feed was phased out.]]
Programming on History has covered a wide range of historical [[History by period|periods]] and topics, while similar themed topics are often organized into themed weeks or daily marathons. Subjects include [[warfare]], [[invention]]s, [[aviation]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[civil engineering]], [[technology]], [[science]], [[nature]], [[mythical creatures]], [[monster]]s, [[unidentified flying object]]s, [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]], [[religion|religious beliefs]], [[disaster]] scenarios, [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] "after man" scenarios, [[survivalist|survival]] scenarios, [[alternate history]], [[dinosaurs]], [[End time|doomsday]], [[organized crime]], [[secret societies]], and [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]] superstitions. Programming also includes mainstream [[reality television]]-style shows involving truck drivers, alligator hunters, pawn stores, antique and collectible "pickers,” car restorers, photography, and others. Occasionally, some programs compare contemporary culture and technology with that of the past.<ref name="EdgertonRollins2001">Gary Richard Edgerton; Peter C. Rollins.

==Criticism and evaluation==

The network has also been criticized for having a bias towards [[history of the United States|U.S. history]]. Another former sister network, [[Vice on TV|History International]], more extensively covered history outside the US until 2011, when it was re-branded as [[H2 (American TV channel)|H2]] and started broadcasting more material that had to do with US history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide03/explore1.html|title=Time traveler's guide to the Roman Empire|publisher=Channel4.com|quote=The History Channel: The website of the American cable channel has a bias towards American history, as evidenced by Extreme History with Roger Daltrey|accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref>

The network was also criticized by Stanley Kutner for airing the series ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' in 2003. Kutner was one of three historians commissioned to review the documentary, which the channel disavowed and never aired again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4504.html|title=Why the History Channel Had to Apologize for the Documentary that Blamed LBJ for JFK's Murder|author=Stanley Kutner|publisher=History News Network|date=July 4, 2004|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=The History Channel has made a start in the right direction as it has totally disavowed the program and publicly promised it never will be shown again.}}</ref> Programs such as ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' have been praised for their presentation of detailed information in an entertaining format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=28158|title=Modern Marvels: Technology|author=Scott Weinberg|work=DVD Talk|date=May 29, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=If you're trying to throw your kids a little education, but in a fast-paced and colorful presentation, these "Modern Marvels" series come pretty highly recommended.

Some of the network's series, including ''[[Ice Road Truckers]]'', ''[[Ax Men]]'', and ''[[Pawn Stars]]'', garnered increased viewership ratings in the United States, while receiving criticism over the series' [[Channel drift|nonhistorical nature]]. U.S. Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] is a critic of the channel and its lack of historical or educational programming, showing particular disdain for the latter two programs.<ref>Malone, Noreen (March 20, 2012).

In his book ''2012: It's Not the End of the World'', Peter Lemesurier describes the channel's ''[[Nostradamus]]'' series, in which he was invited to participate, as "largely fiction" and "lurid nonsense.”<ref name="Lemesurier2011">{{citation|author=Peter Lemesurier|title=2012: It's Not the End of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi_QygAACAAJ|date=July 2011|publisher=Derwen Publishing|isbn=978-1-907084-15-7|page=91}}</ref> He also lists numerous suggestions made in its films on the alleged Mayan "end of the world" and the "rare" galactic alignment that was supposed by [[John Major Jenkins]] to accompany it in [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]],<ref name="Lemesurier2011" /> while Jenkins himself has described ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' as "45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane [[sensationalism]].”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alignment2012.com/historychannel.html|title=How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary|date= July 28, 2006|accessdate=22 September 2006}}</ref>

In December 2011, [[Politifact]] gave the History Channel's claim that the [[United States Congress]] stayed open on [[Christmas Day]] for most of its first 67 years of existence a "pants on fire" rating, the lowest of its ratings, noting that its own research showed that both the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House|House]] had only convened once in those 67 years on a Christmas Day and adding that, since there is a one-in-seven chance of Christmas falling on a Sunday (when Congress did not meet in order to attend church), the claim that they would have convened almost every Christmas is "ridiculous.”<ref name="Pf">{{cite web|title=Comic Jon Stewart says Congress met most Christmas Days in its early years|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/09/jon-stewart/comic-jon-stewart-says-early-congress-met-most-chr/|publisher=[[Politifact]]|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=December 11, 2011}}</ref> The claim had first been broadcast on the History Channel program ''Christmas Unwrapped – The History of Christmas'' before being subsequently picked up by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s website on the "Origins of Christmas" and by the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[The Daily Show]]''.<ref name="Pf" /> ''Daily Show'' host [[Jon Stewart]] responded the next day by stating it was their fault for trusting the History Channel and satirized a clip from the History Channel about UFOs and Nazis by stating, "The next thing you know we'll all find out the Nazis did not employ alien technology in their quest for world domination."<ref name="HP">{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart Fires Back At Politifact Over War On Christmas|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/13/jon-stewart-politifact-war-on-christmas_n_1146118.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=December 13, 2011|first=Katherine|last=Fung}}</ref><ref name="Daily">{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Jon|title=War on Christmas - Historical Fact-Checking|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-december-12-2011/war-on-christmas-historical-fact-checking|work=[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=December 12, 2011}}</ref>

The History Channel was also singled out for ridicule by ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine.

===Discredited Amelia Earhart documentary===
{{main|Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence}}
In 2017, a History Channel documentary, ''[[Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence]]'', proposed that a photograph in the National Archives of [[Jaluit Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] was actually a picture of a captured Earhart and Noonan. The picture showed a Caucasian male on a dock who appeared to look like Noonan and a woman sitting on the dock, but facing away from the camera, who was judged to have a physique and haircut resembling Earhart's. The documentary theorizes that the photo was taken after Earhart and Noonan crashed at [[Mili Atoll]]. The documentary also said that physical evidence recovered from Mili matches pieces that could have fallen off an Electra during a crash or subsequent overland move to a barge. ''The Lost Evidence'' proposed that a Japanese ship seen in the photograph was the ''Koshu Maru'', a Japanese military ship.

''The Lost Evidence'' was quickly discredited, however, after Japanese blogger Kota Yamano found the original source of the photograph in the archives in the [[National Diet Library]] Digital Collection.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/amelia-earhart-lost-photograph-discredited-spd/| title=Amelia Earhart 'Lost Photograph' Discredited| last=Greshko| first=Michael| website=nationalgeographic.com| date=July 11, 2017| access-date=August 14, 2018|url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223131301/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/amelia-earhart-lost-photograph-discredited-spd/| archive-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref> The original source of the photo was a Japanese travel guide published in October 1935, implying that the photograph was taken in 1935 or before, thus it would be unrelated to Earhart and Noonan's 1937 disappearance. Additionally, the researcher who discovered the photo also identified the ship in the right of the photo as another ship called ''[[Kōshū (survey ship)|Koshu]]'' seized by [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] Japanese forces in World War I and not the ''Koshu Maru''.<ref name="nprdebunk">{{cite news|last1=Domonoske|first1=Camila|title=Japanese Blogger Points Out Timeline Flaw In Supposed Earhart Photo|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/11/536620463/japanese-blogger-points-out-timeline-flaw-in-supposed-earhart-photo|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=NPR|language=en}}</ref>

Researcher [[Ben Radford]] performed a detailed analysis of the mistakes made by ''The History Channel'' in building their documentary on bad photographic evidence. In his ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' article "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Emmys: An Amelia Earhart Special (Non) Mystery Post-Mortem,” critiquing the network's lack of professionalism, Radford said: "Given that the photograph's provenance was established and thus the key premise of the show discredited in about half an hour of Google searching, it will be interesting to see what world class expertise... the History Channel will bring to their reinvestigation of Earhart's disappearance."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink1=Benjamin Radford|title=A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Emmys: An Amelia Earhart Special (Non)Mystery Post-Mortem|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_amelia_earhart_special_mystery |website=Csicop.org|publisher=CFI|accessdate=9 December 2017|archivedate=9 December 2017|date=18 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209222238/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_amelia_earhart_special_mystery|url-status=live}}</ref> On episode 82 of his ''Squaring the Strange'' podcast, released January 4, 2019, Radford reminded listeners that in excess of 18 months had passed without an apology or explanation from the History Channel as to "how their research went so horribly wrong.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Radford |first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Episode 82 - Grab Bag 2018 |url=http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/8129540/tdest_id/607796 |publisher=Libsyn |accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref><ref name="csicop-robpalmer">{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=Rob |title=Squaring the Skeptic with Celestia Ward (Part 2) |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/squaring_the_skeptic_with_celestia_ward_part_2 |website=Skeptical Inquirer |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref>

{{Main|History (Canadian TV network)}}
History Television launched in 1997 and was not initially related to its then similarly-named American counterpart. During History Television's first several years of operation, despite sharing a similar programming focus, it rarely, if ever, acquired programming from the American channel. The phrase "Not available in Canada" was used heavily during The History Channel's early years in promotional ads on American channels that were imported to Canadian pay television providers, particularly A&E.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lisnews.com/index.pl?issue=20040722&mode=|title=Librarian and Information Science News|publisher=LIS News|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=I always wondered why the History Channel commercials said not available in Canada.}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Beginning in the late 2000s, several History (U.S) shows were acquired for Canadian broadcast on History Television.
