'''Natural gas''' (also called '''fossil gas'''; sometimes just '''gas'''), is a naturally occurring [[hydrocarbon]] [[gas]] mixture consisting primarily of [[methane]], but commonly including varying amounts of other higher [[alkanes]], and sometimes a small percentage of [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], or [[helium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/overview/background |title=Background |publisher=Naturalgas.org |accessdate=2012-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709040340/http://www.naturalgas.org/overview/background |archive-date=2014-07-09}}</ref> It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years.<ref name=eiaex>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/ |title=Natural gas explained |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=2020-09-30}}</ref> The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.<ref name=epa_ng>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/affect/natural-gas.html |title=Electricity from Natural Gas |accessdate=2013-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606215324/http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/affect/natural-gas.html |archive-date=2014-06-06}}</ref> Natural gas is a [[fossil fuel]].

Natural gas is a [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]]<ref name=epa_ng/> [[hydrocarbon]] used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as a [[natural gas vehicle|fuel for vehicles]] and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of [[plastics]] and other commercially important [[organic compound|organic chemicals]].

The mining and consumption of natural gas is a major and growing driver of [[climate change]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-gas-climatebox-explainer-idUSKCN25E1DR |title=Cleaner but not clean - Why scientists say natural gas won't avert climate disaster |publisher=Reuters |author=Valerie Volcovici, Kate Abnett, and Matthew Green |date=2020-08-18}}</ref><ref name="ieaco2">{{Cite web |url=https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=WORLD&fuel=CO2%20emissions&indicator=CO2%20emissions%20by%20energy%20source |title=Data and Statistics: CO2 emissions by energy source, World 1990-2017 |publisher=International Energy Agency (Paris) |access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name="owidebf">{{Cite journal |url=https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-emissions-by-fuel |title=CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: CO₂ Emissions by Fuel |author=Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser |journal=Our World in Data |publisher=Published online at OurWorldInData.org. |year=2020 |access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>  It is a potent [[greenhouse gas]] itself when released into the atmosphere, and creates [[carbon dioxide]] during [[oxidation]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why carbon dioxide isn't the only greenhouse gas we must reduce – Dr Richard Dixon|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-main-greenhouse-gas-cutting-methane-emissions-crucial-too-dr-richard-dixon-2925261|access-date=2020-08-17|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en}}</ref><ref name=AGI>{{cite web |title=Methane Emissions in the Oil and Gas Industry |url=https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/factsheet/pe/methane-emissions-oil-gas-industry |publisher=American Geosciences Institute |accessdate=1 May 2019|date=16 May 2018 }}</ref>  Natural gas can be efficiently burned to generate heat and [[electricity]];  emitting less waste and toxins at the point of use relative to other fossil and [[biomass]] fuels.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/natural-gas-and-the-environment.php |title=Natural gas and the environment |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=2020-09-30}}</ref> However, [[gas venting]] and [[routine flaring|flaring]], along with unintended [[fugitive emissions]] throughout the [[supply chain]], can result in a similar [[carbon footprint]] overall.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Moniz |first1=E.J. |title=The Future of Natural Gas: An Interdisciplinary MIT Study |publisher=MIT Press |date=2011 |url=http://energy.mit.edu/research/future-natural-gas/ |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/howarth/publications/Howarth_2014_ESE_methane_emissions.pdf |title=A bridge to nowhere: methane emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas |author=Howarth, R.W. |journal=Energy Science & Engineering |publisher= Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=47–60 |year=2014 |doi=10.1002/ese3.35}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/MethaneMatters |title=Methane Matters |publisher=NASA Earth Observatory |author=Adam Voiland and Joshua Stevens |accessdate=2020-09-15}}</ref> 

Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in [[coal bed]]s and as [[methane clathrate]]s. [[Petroleum]] is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by [[methanogenic]] organisms in [[marshes]], [[bogs]], [[landfills]], and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=US Geological Survey |url=http://energy.er.usgs.gov/gg/research/petroleum_origins.html |title=Organic Origins of Petroleum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527093933/http://energy.er.usgs.gov/gg/research/petroleum_origins.html |archive-date=27 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=eiaex />

In petroleum production, gas is sometimes burned as [[gas flare|flare gas]]. Before natural gas can be used as a fuel, most, but not all, must be [[natural gas processing|processed]] to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas. The by-products of this processing include [[ethane]], [[propane]], [[butane]]s, [[pentane]]s, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure [[sulfur]]), [[carbon dioxide]], [[water vapor]], and sometimes [[helium]] and [[nitrogen]].

Natural gas is sometimes informally referred to simply as "gas", especially when it is being compared to other energy sources, such as oil or coal. However, it is not to be confused with [[gasoline]], which is often shortened in colloquial usage to "gas", especially in North America.

==History==
[[File:Chuhuo.jpg|thumb|Burning of natural gas coming out of the ground in [[Taiwan]]]]
Natural gas was discovered accidentally in ancient China, as it resulted from the drilling for [[Brine (solution)|brines]]. Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BC (possibly even 1000 BC<ref>{{cite web |authors=Eric & Chun-Chih Hadley-Ives |url=http://www.historylines.net/history/chinese/oil_well.html|title=First Oil Wells |website=www.historylines.net}}</ref>). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil salt water to [[Salt in Chinese history|extract the salt]] in the [[Ziliujing District]] of [[Sichuan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://naturalgas.org/overview/history/ |title=History |publisher=NaturalGas.org |accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Economics of the Gas Supply Industry |last=Abbott |first=Malcolm  |publisher=Routledge  |isbn=978-1-138-99879-7|date=2016 |page=185}}</ref>

The discovery and identification of natural gas in the Americas happened in 1626. In 1821, William Hart successfully dug the first natural gas well at [[Fredonia, New York]], United States, which led to the formation of the Fredonia Gas Light Company. The city of [[Philadelphia]] created the first municipally owned natural gas distribution venture in 1836.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apga.org/apgamainsite/aboutus/facts/history-of-natural-gas|title=A Brief History of Natural Gas - APGA|website=www.apga.org|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> By 2009, 66 000&nbsp;km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000&nbsp;km³ of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas.<ref name="worldenergyoutlook.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2009/WEO2009.pdf |title=World Energy Outlook 2009 |date=2009 |website=International Energy Agency}}</ref> Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400&nbsp;km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates.

===Natural gas===
[[File:BarnettShaleDrilling-9323.jpg|thumb|upright|Natural gas [[drilling rig]] in Texas, USA]]
In the 19th century, natural gas was primarily obtained as a by-product of [[Oil well|producing oil]].  The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide [[effervesce]]s. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields.  The large volumes produced could not be utilized until relatively expensive [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[natural gas storage|storage]] facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.

Until the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or [[Gas flare|burned off]] at oil fields. [[Gas venting]] and [[production flaring]] are still practised in modern times, but efforts are ongoing around the world to retire them, and to replace them with other commercially viable and useful alternatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=1532 |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Zero_Routine_Flaring_by_2030 |title=UN Climate Initiatives Platform - Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref> Unwanted gas (or [[stranded gas reserve|stranded gas]] without a market) is often returned to the reservoir with 'injection' wells while awaiting a possible future market or to re-pressurize the formation, which can enhance oil extraction rates from other wells. In regions with a high natural gas demand (such as the US), [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an [[end consumer]].

In addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as [[LNG|liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via [[gas to liquids]] (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including [[Fischer–Tropsch]] (F–T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and [[syngas to gasoline plus]] (STG+). F–T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas. STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process.<ref name="STG+">{{cite web |url=http://www.primusge.com/press-room/white-papers/ |title=Introduction to STG+ Technology |website=Primus Green Energy |date=February 2013 |access-date=5 March 2013}}</ref> In 2011, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch Shell's]] {{convert|140000|oilbbl|m3|sp=us}} per day F–T plant went into operation in [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2011/first-cargo-pearl.html |title=First cargo of Pearl GTL products ship from Qatar |website=Shell Global |date=13 June 2011 |access-date=19 November 2017}}</ref>

Natural gas can be "associated" (found in [[oil field]]s), or "non-associated" (isolated in [[natural gas field]]s), and is also found in [[coal bed]]s (as [[coalbed methane]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Extraction |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/extraction.asp |publisher=NaturalGas.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708145258/http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/extraction.asp |archive-date=8 July 2013}}</ref> It sometimes contains a significant amount of [[ethane]], [[propane]], [[butane]], and [[pentane]]—heavier hydrocarbons removed for commercial use prior to the [[methane]] being sold as a consumer fuel or chemical plant feedstock.

Natural gas extracted from oil wells is called casinghead gas (whether or not truly produced up the annulus and through a casinghead outlet) or associated gas. The [[natural gas industry]] is extracting an increasing quantity of gas from challenging [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada (natural gas)#Unconventional gas|resource types]]: [[sour gas]], [[tight gas]], [[shale gas]], and [[coalbed methane]].

There is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves. Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US CIA (47 600&nbsp;km³),<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html |title=Natural Gas – Proved Reserves |encyclopedia=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=1 December 2013}}</ref> the US Energy Information Administration (47 800&nbsp;km³),<ref>US Energy Information Administration, International statistics, accessed 1 December 2013.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/|title=U.S. Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Proved Reserves, Year-end 2017|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> and OPEC (48 700&nbsp;km³).<ref>{{cite web |publisher=OPEC |url=http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/XL/T32.HTM |title=Table 3.2 – World Proven Natural Gas Reserves by Country |access-date=1 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227183441/http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/XL/T32.HTM |archive-date=27 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, BP credits Russia with only 32 900&nbsp;km³,<ref>{{cite web |website=BP |url=http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/statistical-review/statistical_review_of_world_energy_2013.pdf |title=BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204120328/http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/statistical-review/statistical_review_of_world_energy_2013.pdf |archive-date=4 December 2013}}</ref> which would place it in second place, slightly behind Iran (33 100 to 33 800&nbsp;km³, depending on the source).

It is estimated that there are about 900 000&nbsp;km³ of "unconventional" gas such as shale gas, of which 180 000&nbsp;km³ may be recoverable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627641.100-wonderfuel-welcome-to-the-age-of-unconventional-gas.html?full=true |title=Wonderfuel: Welcome to the age of unconventional gas |author=Helen Knight |website=[[New Scientist]] |date=12 June 2010 |pages=44–47 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> In turn, many studies from [[MIT]], [[Black & Veatch]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] predict that natural gas will account for a larger portion of electricity generation and heat in the future.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Kanellos |website=Greentech Media |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/with-natural-gas-will-we-swap-oil-imports-for-gas-imports/ |title=In Natural Gas, U.S. Will Move From Abundance to Imports |date=9 June 2011}}</ref>

The world's largest gas field is the offshore [[South Pars / North Dome Gas-Condensate field]], shared between Iran and Qatar. It is estimated to have {{convert|51000|km3|mi3|sp=us}} of natural gas and {{convert|50|e9oilbbl|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of [[Natural-gas condensate|natural gas condensates]].

Because natural gas is not a pure product, as the reservoir pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing—an effect called [[retrograde condensation]]. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method to deal with this problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the [[Natural gas processing|gas plant]] is to collect this condensate. The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and has commercial value.

===Shale gas===
[[File:GasDepositDiagram.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The location of [[shale gas]] compared to other types of gas deposits]]
{{main|Shale gas}}

Shale gas is natural gas produced from [[shale]]. Because shale has matrix permeability too low to allow gas to flow in economical quantities, shale gas wells depend on fractures to allow the gas to flow. Early shale gas wells depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed; almost all shale gas wells today require fractures artificially created by [[hydraulic fracturing]]. Since 2000, shale gas has become a major source of natural gas in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jad |last=Mouawad |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/business/energy-environment/18gas.html |title=Estimate places natural gas reserves 35% higher |website=The New York Times|date=17 June 2009 |access-date=25 October 2009}}</ref> Because of increased shale gas production the United States was in 2014 the number one natural gas producer in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Now World's Leading Natural Gas Producer |website=Desert Sun |url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/money/industries/morrisbeschlosseconomics/2014/09/02/u-s-now-worlds-leading-natural-gas-producer/14976767/ |author=Morris Beschloss |date=2 September 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> The production of shale gas in the United States has been described as a "shale gas revolution" and as "one of the landmark events in the 21st century."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Qiang |last2=Chen |first2=Xi |last3=Jha |first3=Awadhesh N. |last4=Rogers |first4=Howard |title=Natural gas from shale formation – The evolution, evidences and challenges of shale gas revolution in United States |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |date=February 2014 |volume=30 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.065}}</ref>

===Town gas===
{{Main|History of manufactured fuel gases}}
[[Town gas]] is a flammable gaseous fuel made by the destructive distillation of [[coal]]. It contains a variety of calorific gases including [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and other volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s, together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]], and is used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.

Most town "gashouses" located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The [[coal tar]] (or [[asphalt]]) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.

===Biogas===
{{Main|Biogas}}
[[Methanogen]]ic ''Archaea'' are responsible for almost all biological sources of methane, though [[methylphosphonate]]-degrading ''Bacteria'' produce an as-yet not fully quantified fraction of biogenic methane, particularly in the oceans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DM Karl, L Beversdorf, KM Björkman, MJ Church, A Martinez, EF DeLong |year=2008 |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=473–478 |title=Aerobic production of methane in the sea|doi=10.1038/ngeo234 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..473K }}</ref> Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including [[termite]]s, [[ruminant]]s, and cultivated crops. Other sources of [[methane]], the principal component of natural gas, include [[landfill gas]], biogas, and [[methane hydrate]]. When methane-rich gases are produced by the [[anaerobic decay]] of [[organic compound|organic]] matter ([[biomass]]), these are referred to as biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include [[swamp]]s, [[marsh]]es, and [[landfill]]s, as well as [[agricultural waste]] materials such as [[sewage]] [[sludge]] and [[manure]] by way of [[anaerobic digester]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/manure-management-and-air-quality/manure-treatment/docs/anaerobic-digestion-overview.pdf |author=David Schmidt |title=Anaerobic Digestion Overview |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2017-11-19}}</ref> in addition to [[enteric fermentation]], particularly in [[cattle]]. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in [[landfill]] sites. Excluding [[water vapor]], about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is [[carbon dioxide]], with small amounts of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]], and variable trace amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[siloxane]]s. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an [[explosion]] hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, [[gas flare|flared]] or burned to produce [[electricity]] or [[heat]]. Biogas can also be produced by separating [[organic material]]s from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. [[Anaerobic lagoon]]s produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.

Landfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3% {{chem|C|O|2}}, and a few parts per million {{chem|H|2|S}}, because {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2|S}} corrode the pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |title=Interstate Natural Gas—Quality Specifications & Interchangeability |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812145240/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011}}</ref> The presence of {{chem|C|O|2}} will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-natural-gas/|title=Reading: Natural Gas {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyqBDwAAQBAJ&q=The+presence+of+CO2+will+lower+the+energy+level+of+the+gas+below+requirements+for+the+pipeline&pg=PA40|title=Handbook of Natural Gas Analysis|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2018-08-14|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119240280|language=en}}</ref> Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site.  If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, [[siloxanes]] can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet [[emission standard]]s, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations. Co-firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion, which lowers emissions.

Biogas, and especially landfill gas, are already used in some areas, but their use could be greatly expanded. Systems have been established for use in parts of [[Hertfordshire]], UK<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/biogen-opens-45-000-tpa-food-waste-to-biogas-plant-in-hertfordshire-uk|title= Biogen Opens 45,000 TPA Food Waste to Biogas Plant in Hertfordshire, UK}}</ref> and [[Lyon]] in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://energy-cities.eu/best-practice/biogas-co-generation-in-a-greenhouse-complex/|title=Biogas co-generation in a greenhouse complex}}</ref> Using materials that would otherwise generate no income, or even cost money to get rid of, improves the profitability and energy balance of biogas production.

===Crystallized natural gas – hydrates===
Huge quantities of natural gas (primarily methane) exist in the form of [[methane clathrate|hydrates]] under sediment on offshore continental shelves and on land in arctic regions that experience [[permafrost]], such as those in [[Siberia]]. Hydrates require a combination of high pressure and low temperature to form.

In 2010, the cost of extracting natural gas from crystallized natural gas was estimated to be as much as twice the cost of extracting natural gas from conventional sources, and even higher from offshore deposits.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNN Money |author=Steve Hargreaves |url=https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/09/news/economy/nat_gas_crystals/index.htm |title=Natural gas crystals: Energy under the sea |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>

==Depletion==
{{main|Gas depletion}}

As of mid-2020, natural gas production in the US has peaked three times, with current levels exceeding both previous peaks. It reached 24.1&nbsp;trillion cubic feet per year in 1973, followed by a decline, and reached 24.5&nbsp;trillion cubic feet in 2001. After a brief drop, withdrawals increased nearly every year since 2006 (owing to the [[Shale gas in the United States#Barnett and beyond|shale gas boom]]), with 2017 production at 33.4&nbsp;trillion cubic feet and 2019 production at 40.7&nbsp;trillion cubic feet. After the third peak in December 2019, extraction continued to fall from March onward due to decreased demand caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic in the US]].<ref name=EIAThirdPeak>{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9010us2m.htm |title=U.S. Natural Gas Gross Withdrawals |website=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |access-date=September 28, 2020}}</ref>

==Storage and transport==
{{see also|List of natural gas pipelines}}

Because of its low density, it is not easy to store natural gas or to transport it by vehicle. Natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are impractical across oceans, since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed, as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up. Many [[List of natural gas pipelines#North America|existing pipelines in America]] are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages. The large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated, causing significant price differences across countries. In [[Western Europe]], the gas pipeline network is already dense.<ref>{{cite web |website=Energia Mexicana |language=Spanish |url=http://www.gie.eu.com/ |title=Gas Infrastructure Europe |accessdate=18 June 2009}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2017}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}} New pipelines are planned or under construction in [[Eastern Europe]] and between gas fields in [[Russia]], [[Near East]] and [[Northern Africa]] and Western Europe.

Whenever gas is bought or sold at custody transfer points, rules and agreements are made regarding the gas quality. These may include the maximum allowable concentration of [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem|C|O|2}}]], [[Hydrogen sulfide|{{chem|H|2|S}}]] and [[Water vapor|{{chem|H|2|O}}]]. Usually sales quality gas that has been [[Natural-gas processing|treated to remove contamination]] is traded on a "dry gas" basis and is required to be commercially free from objectionable odours, materials, and dust or other solid or liquid matter, waxes, gums and gum forming constituents, which might damage or adversely affect operation of equipment downstream of the custody transfer point.

[[LNG carrier]]s transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) across oceans, while [[tank truck]]s can carry liquefied or compressed natural gas (CNG) over shorter distances.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ulvestad|first1= Marte|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2012|title= Natural gas and CO2 price variation: Impact on the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipelines|journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies|volume=69|issue=3|pages=407–426|doi= 10.1080/00207233.2012.677581|pmid= 24683269|pmc= 3962073}}</ref> Sea transport using [[CNG carrier]] ships that are now under development may be competitive with LNG transport in specific conditions.

Gas is turned into liquid at a [[liquefaction of gases|liquefaction]] plant, and is returned to gas form at [[gasification|regasification]] plant at the [[Liquefied natural gas terminal|terminal]]. Shipborne regasification equipment is also used. LNG is the preferred form for long distance, high volume transportation of natural gas, whereas pipeline is preferred for transport for distances up to {{convert|4000|km|abbr=on}} over land and approximately half that distance offshore.

CNG is transported at high pressure, typically above {{convert|200|bar|kPa psi|lk=in}}. Compressors and decompression equipment are less capital intensive and may be economical in smaller unit sizes than liquefaction/regasification plants. Natural gas trucks and carriers may transport natural gas directly to end-users, or to distribution points such as pipelines.

In the past, the natural gas which was recovered in the course of recovering [[petroleum]] could not be profitably sold, and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as [[gas flare|flaring]]. Flaring is now illegal in many countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hyne |first=Norman J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CQKozxTKG4C |title=Dictionary of Petroleum Exploration, Drilling & Production |publisher=PennWell Books |year=1991 |page=190 |isbn=978-0-87814-352-8}}</ref> Additionally, higher demand in the last 20–30 years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable. As a further option, the gas is now sometimes re-[[wikt:inject|injected]] into the formation for [[enhanced oil recovery]] by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or immiscible flooding. Conservation, re-injection, or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets (pipelines), and regulatory restrictions.

Natural gas can be indirectly exported through the absorption in other physical output. A recent study suggests that the expansion of shale gas production in the US has caused prices to drop relative to other countries. This has caused a boom in energy intensive manufacturing sector exports, whereby the average dollar unit of US manufacturing exports has almost tripled its energy content between 1996 and 2012.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=On the Comparative Advantage of U.S. Manufacturing: Evidence from the Shale Gas Revolution |journal=Journal of International Economics |url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1399.pdf |first1=Rabah |last1=Arezki |first2=Thiemo |last2=Fetzer |date=January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701075547/http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1399.pdf |archive-date=2016-07-01 |publisher=Centre for Economic Performance |issn=2042-2695}}</ref>

Natural gas is used to generate electricity and heat for [[desalination]]. Similarly, some landfills that also discharge methane gases have been set up to capture the methane and generate electricity.

Natural gas is often stored underground inside depleted gas reservoirs from previous gas wells, [[salt domes]], or in tanks as liquefied natural gas.  The gas is injected in a time of low demand and extracted when demand picks up. Storage nearby end users helps to meet volatile demands, but such storage may not always be practicable.

With 15 countries accounting for 84% of the worldwide extraction, access to natural gas has become an important issue in international politics, and countries vie for control of pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imi-online.de/2007/06/19/thecontoursofthe/ |title=The Contours of the New Cold War |publisher=IMI |author=Jürgen Wagner |date=19 June 2007 |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> In the first decade of the 21st century, [[Gazprom]], the state-owned energy company in Russia, engaged in disputes with [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] over the price of natural gas, which have created concerns that gas deliveries to parts of Europe could be cut off for political reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=<!--http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99026745-->https://www.npr.org/series/99026745/gazprom-and-russia-s-foreign-policy |title=Gazprom and Russian Foreign Policy |website=NPR |accessdate=<!--2011-02-06-->24 November 2017}}</ref> The United States is preparing to export natural gas.<ref>{{cite web |website=Seeking Alpha |author=Sumit Roy |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2282733-u-s-natural-gas-export-era-begins-in-2015-fueling-upside-in-prices |title=U.S. Natural Gas Export Era Begins In 2015, Fueling Upside In Prices |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>

===Floating liquefied natural gas===
[[Floating liquefied natural gas]] (FLNG) is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped due to environmental or economic factors which currently make them impractical to develop via a land-based LNG operation. FLNG technology also provides a number of environmental and economic advantages:
* Environmental&nbsp;– Because all processing is done at the gas field, there is no requirement for long pipelines to shore, compression units to pump the gas to shore, dredging and jetty construction, and onshore construction of an LNG processing plant, which significantly reduces the environmental footprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaaoc.com/news-old/shell-receives-green-light-for-prelude-flng|title=SEAAOC – NT Resources Week – Informa – NT Government|work=NTRW|accessdate=11 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325160619/http://www.seaaoc.com/news-old/shell-receives-green-light-for-prelude-flng|archivedate=25 March 2012}}</ref> Avoiding construction also helps preserve marine and coastal environments. In addition, environmental disturbance will be minimised during decommissioning because the facility can easily be disconnected and removed before being refurbished and re-deployed elsewhere.
* Economic&nbsp;– Where pumping gas to shore can be prohibitively expensive, FLNG makes development economically viable. As a result, it will open up new business opportunities for countries to develop offshore gas fields that would otherwise remain stranded, such as those offshore East Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visiongain.com/Report/568/The-Floating-Liquefied-Natural-Gas-(FLNG)-Market-2011-2021 |title=The Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) Market 2011-2021 |website=visiongain |url-access=subscription |id=ENE8974 |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319155339/https://www.visiongain.com/Report/568/The-Floating-Liquefied-Natural-Gas-(FLNG)-Market-2011-2021 |archive-date=19 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Uses==

Natural gas is primarily used in the northern hemisphere. North America and Europe are major consumers.

===Mid-stream natural gas===
Often well head gases require removal of various hydrocarbon molecules contained within the gas. Some of these gases include [[heptane]], [[pentane]], [[propane]] and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above [[methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}). The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted hydrocarbons to produce natural gas with energy content between {{convert|950|-|1050|BTU/cuft|MJ/m3}}. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.

Natural gas flowing in the distribution lines is called mid-stream natural gas and is often used to power engines which rotate compressors. These compressors are required in the transmission line to pressurize and repressurize the mid-stream natural gas as the gas travels. Typically, natural gas powered engines require {{convert|950|-|1050|BTU/cuft|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} natural gas to operate at the rotational name plate specifications.<ref name="american-environmental">{{cite web |title=Natural Gas Fuel Conditioning System – BTU Reduction |url=http://rto.american-environmental.us/BTU_Reduction_and_Gas_Conditioning_System.html |website=American Environmental Fabrication & Supply, LLC |accessdate=23 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207152113/http://rto.american-environmental.us/BTU_Reduction_and_Gas_Conditioning_System.html |archive-date=7 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several methods are used to remove these higher molecular weighted gases for use by the natural gas engine. A few technologies are as follows:
* [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule–Thomson skid]]
* [[Cryogenic]] or [[chiller]] system
* [[Chemical]] [[enzymology]] system<ref name="american-environmental"/>

===Power generation===
Natural gas is a major source of [[electricity generation]] through the use of [[cogeneration]], [[gas turbine]]s and [[steam turbine]]s. Natural gas is also well suited for a combined use in association with [[renewable energy]] sources such as wind or [[solar energy|solar]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/business/energy-environment/new-solar-process-gets-more-out-of-natural-gas.html |title=New Solar Process Gets More Out of Natural Gas |date=10 April 2013 |author=Matthew L. Wald |website=The New York Times}}</ref> and for alimenting [[Load profile|peak-load]] power stations functioning in tandem with [[hydroelectric]] plants. Most grid [[peaking power plant]]s and some off-grid [[engine-generator]]s use natural gas. Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in [[combined cycle]] mode. Natural gas burns more cleanly than other fuels, such as oil and coal. Because burning natural gas produces both water and carbon dioxide, it produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy released than coal, which produces mostly carbon dioxide. Burning natural gas produces only about half the carbon dioxide per [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) that [[coal]] does.<ref name=NGandE/> For transportation, burning natural gas produces about 30% less carbon dioxide than burning [[petroleum]]. The US [[Energy Information Administration]] reports the emissions in million [[Tonne|metric tons]] of carbon dioxide in the world for 2012:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/carbon.html |title=World Carbon Dioxide Emissions from the Use of Fossil Fuels |website=U.S. Energy Information Administration (eia) |accessdate=2016-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523215823/http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/carbon.html |archivedate=23 May 2011}}</ref>{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=date in article:2012, archive date:2011, report for year 2006}}
* Natural gas: 6,799
* Petroleum: 11,695
* Coal: 13,787

Coal-fired electric power generation emits around {{convert|2000|lb|kg|sigfig=1}} of carbon dioxide for every [[megawatt-hour]] (MWh) generated, which is almost double the carbon dioxide released by natural gas-fired generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=73&t=11|title=How much carbon dioxide is produced when different fuels are burned? |website=U.S. Energy Information Administration (eia)}}</ref> Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the fuel mix in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen. Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rachel |last=Nuwer |title=A 20–Year Low in U.S. Carbon Emissions |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/a-20-year-low-in-u-s-carbon-emissions/ |website=The New York Times|date=17 August 2012}}</ref>

Combined cycle power generation using natural gas is currently the cleanest available source of power using hydrocarbon fuels, and this technology is widely and increasingly used as natural gas can be obtained at increasingly reasonable costs. [[Fuel cell]] technology may eventually provide cleaner options for converting natural gas into electricity, but as yet it is not [[Natural gas prices|price-competitive]].

===Domestic use===
Natural gas dispensed in a residential setting can generate temperatures in excess of {{convert|1100|°C|°F|-2}} making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Nature's Curiosity Shop |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Barry E. |last2=Zimmerman |first2=David J. |year=1995 |page=[https://archive.org/details/naturescuriosity00zimm/page/28 28] |publisher=Contemporary books |place=Lincolnwood (Chicago), IL |isbn=978-0-8092-3656-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/naturescuriosity00zimm/page/28 }}</ref> In much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes, where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens, gas-heated [[clothes dryer]]s, [[HVAC|heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]], and [[central heating]].<ref name=AtoZ>{{cite book |last1=Mulvaney |first1=Dustin |title=Green Energy: An A-to-Z Guide |date=2011 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-4129-9677-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_eji4ZzEiQC&pg=PA301 |page=301}}</ref> Heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers, [[furnace]]s, and [[water heating|water heaters]]. Both North America and Europe are major consumers of natural gas.

Domestic appliances, furnaces, and boilers use low pressure, usually 6 to 7 [[inch of water|inches of water]] (6" to 7" WC), which is about 0.25 psig. The pressures in the supply lines vary, either utilization pressure (UP, the aforementioned 6" to 7" WC) or elevated pressure (EP), which may be anywhere from 1 psig to 120 psig. Systems using EP have a [[pressure regulator|regulator]] at the service entrance to step down the pressure to UP.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In Australia, natural gas is transported from gas processing facilities to regulator stations via Transmission pipelines. Gas is then regulated down to distributed pressures and the gas is distributed around a gas network via gas mains. Small branches from the network, called services, connect individual domestic dwellings, or multi-dwelling buildings to the network. The networks typically range in pressures from 7kPa (low pressure) to 515kPa (high pressure). Gas is then regulated down to 1.1kPa or 2.75kPa, before being metered and passed to the consumer for domestic use.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gas Distribution System Code {{!}} Essential Services Commission|url=https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/electricity-and-gas/codes-guidelines-and-policies/gas-distribution-system-code|access-date=2020-09-22|website=www.esc.vic.gov.au}}</ref> Natural Gas mains are made from a variety of materials; historically cast iron, more modern mains are made from steel, or polyethylene.

In the US [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) is available in some [[rural]] areas as an alternative to less expensive and more abundant LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]), the dominant source of rural gas.  It is used in homes lacking direct connections to [[public utility]] provided gas, or to fuel portable [[Grill (cooking)|grills]].  Natural gas is also supplied by independent natural gas suppliers through [[Natural Gas Choice]] programs{{clarify|date=May 2019}} throughout the United States.

===Transportation===
CNG is a cleaner and also cheaper alternative to other [[automobile]] fuels such as [[gasoline]] (petrol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/natural_gas_emissions.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Natural Gas Vehicle Emissions|website=afdc.energy.gov|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref> By the end of 2014 there were over 20&nbsp;million [[natural gas vehicles]] worldwide, led by [[Iran]] (3.5&nbsp;million), [[China]] (3.3&nbsp;million), [[Pakistan]] (2.8&nbsp;million), [[Argentina]] (2.5&nbsp;million), [[India]] (1.8&nbsp;million), and [[Brazil]] (1.8&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngvjournal.com/worldwide-ngv-statistics/ |title=Worldwide NGV statistics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206153839/http://www.ngvjournal.com/worldwide-ngv-statistics/ |archive-date=2015-02-06 |website=NGV journal |access-date=2017-11-19}}</ref> The energy efficiency is generally equal to that of gasoline engines, but lower compared with modern diesel engines. Gasoline/petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low [[compression ratio]] of their engines, resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas (10–15%). CNG-specific engines, however, use a higher compression ratio due to this fuel's higher [[octane number]] of 120–130.<ref>{{cite web |website=ETH Zurich |url=http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_Guzzella/Automotive_Applications/CNG_Engines/Archives/Clean_Engine_Vehicle |title=Clean Engine Vehicle |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=2015-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124010702/http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_Guzzella/Automotive_Applications/CNG_Engines/Archives/Clean_Engine_Vehicle |archive-date=2015-01-24}}</ref>

Besides use in road vehicles, CNG can also be used in aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://wellsaidcabot.com/cng-vehicles-airplanes/ |title=Take a look at some natural gas-powered airplanes |date=6 November 2014 |website=Well Said}}</ref> Compressed natural gas has been used in some aircraft like the [[Aviat Aircraft]] Husky 200 CNG<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/cng-airplane/ |title=American Firm Debuts First Airplane to Run on Natural Gas |author=Jason Paur |date=31 July 2013 |journal=Wired}}</ref> and the Chromarat VX-1 KittyHawk<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngvglobal.com/blog/chomarat-present-c-ply-kittyhawk-with-cng-potential-0219 |title=Chomarat Present C-Ply KittyHawk with CNG Potential |date=19 February 2014 |author=Le Cheylard France |website=NGV Global News}}</ref>

LNG is also being used in aircraft. [[Russia]]n aircraft manufacturer [[Tupolev]] for instance is running a development program to produce LNG- and [[hydrogen]]-powered aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tupolev.ru/English/Show.asp?SectionID=82&Page=1 |title=Development of Cryogenic Fuel Aircraft |publisher=Tupolev |accessdate=2011-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209165256/http://www.tupolev.ru/English/Show.asp?SectionID=82&Page=1 |archivedate=9 December 2010}}</ref> The program has been running since the mid-1970s, and seeks to develop LNG and hydrogen variants of the [[Tupolev Tu-204|Tu-204]] and [[Tupolev Tu-334|Tu-334]] passenger aircraft, and also the [[Tupolev Tu-330|Tu-330]] cargo aircraft. Depending on the current market price for jet fuel and LNG, fuel for an LNG-powered aircraft could cost 5,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (US$100) less per tonne, roughly 60%, with considerable reductions to [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrocarbon]] and [[nitrogen oxide]] emissions.

The advantages of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel are that it has more specific energy than the standard [[kerosene]] mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater volumetric efficiency, in effect replacing an [[intercooler]]. Alternatively, it can be used to lower the temperature of the exhaust.

[[Amine gas treating]], an industrial scale process which removes [[acidic]] [[gas]]eous components, is often used to remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas.<ref name="Processing Natural Gas">{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing_ng.asp |title=Processing Natural Gas |publisher=NaturalGas.org |accessdate=2011-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101053431/http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing_ng.asp |archivedate=1 January 2011}}</ref>

Extraction of natural gas (or oil) leads to decrease in pressure in the [[oil reservoir|reservoir]]. Such decrease in pressure in turn may result in [[subsidence]], sinking of the ground above. Subsidence may affect ecosystems, waterways, sewer and water supply systems, foundations, and so on.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Environmental Science |last=Chiras |first=Daniel |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4496-1486-7 |page=283 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALKCupwW_RoC&q=subsidence |quote=However, natural gas extraction can cause subsidence in the vicinity of the well. One notable example is in the Los Angeles–Long Beach harbor area, where extensive oil and gas extraction began in 1928 and has caused the ground to drop 9 meters (30 feet) in some areas. |via=Google Books}}</ref>

===Fracking===
{{Main|Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing}}
Releasing natural gas from subsurface porous rock formations may be accomplished by a process called [[hydraulic fracturing]] or "fracking". It is estimated that hydraulic fracturing will eventually account for nearly 70% of natural gas development in North America.<ref>{{cite report |author=National Petroleum Council |title=Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America's Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources |date=September 2011 |url=http://www.npc.org/reports/rd.html#nardinfo |lay-url=http://www.npc.org/reports/NARD-ExecSummVol.pdf |access-date=24 November 2017}}</ref> Since the first commercial hydraulic fracturing operation in 1949, approximately one million wells have been hydraulically fractured in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/opinion/global/the-facts-on-fracking.html |title=The Facts on Fracking |first1=Susan L. |last1=Brantley |first2=Anna |last2=Meyendorff |date=13 March 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> The production of natural gas from hydraulically fractured wells has utilized the technological developments of directional and horizontal drilling, which improved access to natural gas in tight rock formations.<ref>Fitzgerald, Timothy.

In hydraulic fracturing, well operators force water mixed with a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the rock. The high pressure water breaks up or "fracks" the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the "frack," oil or gas is extracted and 30–70% of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells. This [[produced water]] often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yeboah | first1 = N.N.N. | last2 = Burns | first2 = S.E. | year = 2011 | title = Geological Disposal of Energy-Related Waste | journal = KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 701–702 | doi = 10.1007/s12205-011-0010-x | s2cid = 109840417 }}</ref>

The volume of water used to hydraulically fracture wells varies according to the hydraulic fracturing technique.  In the United States, the average volume of water used per hydraulic fracture has been reported as nearly 7,375 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells prior to 1953, nearly 197,000 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells between 2000 and 2010, and nearly 3&nbsp;million gallons for horizontal gas wells between 2000 and 2010.<ref>{{cite report |last1=Gallegos |first1=Tanya J. |first2=Brian A. |last2=Varela |title=Trends in Hydraulic Fracturing Distributions and Treatment Fluids, Additives, Proppants, and Water Volumes Applied to Wells Drilled in the United States through 1947 through 2010—Data Analysis and Comparison to the Literature |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |docket=Scientific Investigations Report 2014.5131 |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=Web. 2 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5131/pdf/sir2014-5131.pdf#}}</ref>

Determining which fracking technique is appropriate for well productivity depends largely on the properties of the reservoir rock from which to extract oil or gas.  If the rock is characterized by low-permeability – which refers to its ability to let substances, i.e. gas, pass through it, then the rock may be considered a source of [[tight gas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.total.com/en/energies-expertise/oil-gas/exploration-production/strategic-sectors/unconventional-gas/presentation/three-main-sources-unconventional-gas|title=Our responsibility: Limit the impact of our industrial operations |website=Total.com |publisher=Total}}</ref> Fracking for shale gas, which is currently also known as a source of [[unconventional gas]], involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation, at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/shale-gas-unconventional-sources-natural-gas.html |title=Shale Gas and Other Unconventional Sources of Natural Gas |website=Union of Concerned Scientists}}</ref> In contrast, conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability, which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of tight gas has required.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/how_is_shale_gas_produced.pdf |title=How is Shale Gas Produced? |website=Energy.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=E_ERTWG_XWDD_NUS_FW&f=A |title=U.S. Average Depth of Natural Gas Developmental Wells Drilled |website=U.S. Energy Information Administration (eia)}}</ref> The decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and [[unconventional oil]] and gas production has not only improved access to natural gas in low-permeability reservoir rocks, but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health.<ref>{{cite web |date=30 October 2012 |url=http://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/10/02/15/37/hydraulic-fracturing |title=The Environmental and Occupational Health Impacts of High-Volume Hydraulic Fracturing of Unconventional Gas Reserves |website=APHA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=6 October 2014 |publisher=Center for Biological Diversity |url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2014/fracking-10-06-2014.html |title=Documents Reveal Billions of Gallons of Oil Industry Wastewater Illegally Injected into Central California Aquifers}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Sharp increase in central Oklahoma seismicity since 2008 induced by massive wastewater injection |first1=K.M.|last1=Keranen |first2=M.|last2=Weingarten |first3=G.A.|last3=Abers |first4=B.A.|last4=Bekins |first5=S.|last5=Ge |date=25 July 2014 |journal=Science |volume=345 |issue=6195 |pages=448–451 |doi=10.1126/science.1255802 |pmid=24993347|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..448K|s2cid=206558853}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Methane contamination of drinking water accompanying gas-well drilling and hydraulic fracturing |first1=Stephen G. |last1=Osborn |first2=Avner |last2=Vengosh |first3=Nathaniel R. |last3=Warner |first4=Robert B. |last4=Jackson |date=17 May 2011 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=108 |issue=20 |pages=8172–8176 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1100682108 |pmid=21555547 |pmc=3100993|bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.8172O}}</ref>

===Added odor===
Natural gas in its native state is colorless and almost odorless.  In order to assist consumers in detecting [[leak]]s, an [[odorizer]] with a scent similar to rotten eggs, [[tert-Butylthiol]] (t-butyl mercaptan), is added. Sometimes a related compound, [[tetrahydrothiophene|thiophane]], may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry.  This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Quraishi | first2 = Ali | last3 = Bruno | first3 = Thomas J. | year = 2011| title = Findings and Recommendations From the Joint NIST—AGA Workshop on Odor Masking | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | volume = 116 | issue = 6| pages = 839–848 | doi=10.6028/jres.116.026| pmid = 26989604 | pmc = 4551224 }}</ref>

===Risk of explosion===
[[File:Fire engines in Kiev, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in [[Kyiv]], [[Ukraine]]]]
[[List of pipeline accidents|Explosions caused by natural]] [[gas leak]]s occur a few times each year.  Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure.  Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing.  In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries.  Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process.   Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls and/or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk.
The gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough.  From 1994 through 2013, the United States had 745 serious incidents with gas distribution, causing 278 fatalities and 1059 injuries, with $110,658,083 in property damage.<ref>https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview</ref> However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.

===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===
Natural gas heating systems may cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. [[Carbon monoxide detector|Detectors]] are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).<ref>US Consumer Product Safety Commission, [http://www.cpsc.gov/Global/Research-and-Statistics/Injury-Statistics/Carbon-Monoxide-Posioning/NonFireCarbonMonoxideDeathsAssociatedwiththeUseofConsumerProducts2011AnnualEstimatesSept2014.pdf Non-Fire Carbon Monoxide Deaths, 2011 Annual Estimate], September 2014.</ref>

Quantities of natural gas are measured in [[normal cubic meter]]s (cubic meter of gas at "normal" temperature {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|101.325|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}) or [[Standard cubic foot|standard cubic feet]] (cubic foot of gas at "standard" temperature {{convert|60.0|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|14.73|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}), {{convert|1|m3|cuft|4|spell=in|sp=us|disp=x|&nbsp;≈&nbsp;}}. The [[higher heating value|gross heat of combustion]] of commercial quality natural gas is around {{convert|39|MJ/m3|kWh/cuft|abbr=on}}, but this can vary by several percent.

In [[United States customary units|US units]], {{convert|1|cuft|L |adj=pre|standard |spell=in}} of natural gas produces around {{convert |1028|btu |kJ|lk=in}}. The actual heating value when the water formed does not condense is the [[lower heating value|net heat of combustion]] and can be as much as 10% less.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100531191519/http://www.energy.wsu.edu/documents/distributed/03_025_CHP_glossary_fct.pdf Heat value definitions].

In the United States, retail sales are often in units of [[therm]]s (th); 1 therm = 100,000&nbsp;BTU. Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 [[standard cubic feet]] (scf). [[Gas meter]]s measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one [[Residential Customer Equivalent]] (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in [[decatherm]]s (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.

The price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.007|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000&nbsp;BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU or around $7 per [[gigajoule]] (GJ). In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1000 cubic feet ($10/million BTU).<ref>{{cite web|author=James L. Williams |url=http://www.wtrg.com/daily/gasprice.html |title=NYMEX Natural Gas Futures |website=WTRG Economics|date=1998-10-02 |accessdate=2017-11-22}}</ref> The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12–$16 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.012|–|.016|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_dcu_nus_m.htm |title=U.S. Natural Gas Prices |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Agency |accessdate=2012-08-21}}</ref> Natural gas in the United States is traded as a [[futures contract]] on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]. Each contract is for 10,000&nbsp;million BTU or {{convert|10|e9BTU|GJ|0|abbr=unit}}. Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.

===Canada===
Canada uses [[metric units|metric]] measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.

A [[gigajoule]] (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250&nbsp;lbs) of oil, or 1&nbsp;million BTUs, or {{convert|1000|ft3|m3|disp=or|abbr=on}} of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from {{convert|37|to|43|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.

===Elsewhere===
Outside of the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000&nbsp;kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized [[LNG carrier|transport ships]], as the gas is liquified at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.

In the Russian Federation, [[Gazprom]] sold approximately {{convert|250|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 they produced {{convert|487.4|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with {{convert|161.5|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of gas in 2013.

In August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a [[Giant oil and gas fields|"supergiant" gas field]] in the Mediterranean Sea covering about {{convert|40|sqmi}}. This was named the [[Zohr Field|Zohr]] gas field and could hold a potential {{convert|30|e12cuft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas. ENI said that the energy is about{{convert|5.5|e9BOE|abbr=~}}. The [[Zohr Field|Zohr]] field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of Egypt and ENI claims that it will be the largest ever in the Mediterranean and even the world.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNN Money |date=30 August 2015 |url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/08/30/news/companies/eni-gas-field/ |title=Natural gas discovery could be largest ever |first=David |last=Goldman}}</ref>

==Natural gas as an asset class for institutional investors==
Research conducted by the [[World Pensions Council]] (WPC){{when|date=March 2014}} suggests that large US and Canadian pension funds and Asian and [[MENA]] area [[Sovereign wealth fund|SWF]] investors have become particularly active in the fields of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, a trend started in 2005 by the formation of [[Scotia Gas Networks]] in the UK by [[OMERS]] and [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Adsorbed natural gas (ANG)==
Natural gas may be stored by adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents. The optimal condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Pressures up to 4 MPa (about 40 times atmospheric pressure) will yield greater storage capacity. The most common sorbent used for ANG is activated carbon (AC), primarily in three forms: Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF), Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), and activated carbon monolith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang|title=Adsorbed Natural Gas|work=scopeWe – a Virtual Engineer|accessdate=11 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109181802/http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang/|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
