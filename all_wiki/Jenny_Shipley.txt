'''Dame Jennifer Mary Shipley''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|size=100%|DNZM|PC}} (née '''Robson'''; born 4 February 1952)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/jenny-shipley |title=Jenny Shipley |date=27 October 2017 |website=New Zealand history online |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |language=en |access-date=2 February 2018}}</ref> is a New Zealand former politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|36th Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1997 to 1999. She was the first female prime minister of New Zealand, and the first woman to have led the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) "Jenny Shipley and Helen Clark" in ''Women of Power – Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide''.

''The New Zealand Herald''. 14 July 2020. Accessed on 14 July 2020. "[Collins] is the party's first female leader since Jenny Shipley departed in 2001."</ref>

Shipley was born in [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]], [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]]. She grew up in rural [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], and attended [[Marlborough Girls' College]] and the [[Christchurch College of Education]]. Before entering politics, she worked as a schoolteacher and was involved with various community organisations. Shipley was elected to [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] at the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 election]], winning the [[Ashburton (New Zealand electorate)|Ashburton]] electorate (later renamed [[Rakaia (New Zealand electorate)|Rakaia]]). When the National Party returned to power [[1990 New Zealand general election|in 1990]], she was appointed to [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] under [[Jim Bolger]]. Shipley subsequently served as [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|Minister of Social Welfare]] (1990–1996), [[Minister for Women (New Zealand)|Minister for Women's Affairs]] (1990–1996), [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]] (1993–1996), and [[Minister of Transport (New Zealand)|Minister of Transport]] (1996–1997).

In December 1997, Bolger resigned as Prime Minister after losing the confidence of his party. Shipley was elected as his replacement unopposed. She inherited [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|an uneasy coalition]] with [[New Zealand First]], led by [[Winston Peters]]. The coalition was dissolved in August 1998, but Shipley was able to remain in power with the aid of [[Mauri Pacific]], an NZ First splinter group. At the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]], Shipley's government was defeated by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], led by [[Helen Clark]]. She continued on as [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] until October 2001. Shipley has involved herself with business and charitable interests since leaving politics, and is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Gore, New Zealand]], Shipley was one of four sisters.<ref name="wolfe">{{cite book |title=Battlers Bluffers & Bully Boys |first=Richard |last=Wolfe |publisher=Random House New Zealand |isbn=1-86941-715-1|year=2005 }}</ref> After attending [[Marlborough Girls' College]], she qualified in 1971 as a teacher through the [[Christchurch College of Education]] and taught in New Zealand primary schools until 1976. In 1973 she married Burton Shipley and settled in [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]].<ref name="wolfe" />

Having joined the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] in 1975, Shipley successfully stood in [[Ashburton (New Zealand electorate)|Ashburton]], a safe National seat in the country areas surrounding [[Christchurch]], in the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 election]].  Entering parliament at age 35, she was one of parliament's youngest members.<ref name="wolfe" />

===Cabinet Minister===
Shipley rose quickly in the National caucus.  While still in her first term, party leader [[Jim Bolger]] named her the party's spokeswoman on social welfare.  When Bolger led the National Party to victory in the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 general election]], Shipley was reelected in [[Rakaia (New Zealand electorate)|Rakaia]], essentially a reconfigured Ashburton. She became Minister of Social Welfare, and also served as [[Ministry for Women#Ministers for Women|Minister for Women's Affairs]] (1990–1996).<ref>{{cite web |title=Minister of Women's Affairs |url=http://www.mwa.govt.nz/about/minister-of-wa |publisher=Ministry of Women's Affairs |accessdate=27 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195933/http://www.mwa.govt.nz/about/minister-of-wa |archive-date=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In her role as Minister of Social Welfare, Shipley presided over sharp cutbacks to state benefits. Later, when she became [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]] in 1993, she caused further controversy by attempting to reform the public health service, introducing an internal market. National won another term at the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]], but was forced into a coalition with [[New Zealand First]]. Shipley left the Women's Affairs portfolio and took on several others, including responsibility for [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|state-owned enterprises]] and [[Minister of Transport (New Zealand)|transport]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1993, Shipley was awarded the [[New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/new-zealand-royal-honours/new-zealand-royal-honours-system/types-new-zealand-royal-honours/other-distinctive-new-zealand-honours/suffrage-medal-register |title=The New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal 1993 – register of recipients |date=26 July 2018 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>

==Prime Minister==
{{see also|Fourth National Government of New Zealand}}
[[File:Clinton Shipley walk.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Shipley (centre) with [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]], 15 September 1999.]]
Shipley grew increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with the cautious pace of National's leader, [[Jim Bolger]], and with what she saw as the disproportionate influence of New Zealand First. She began gathering support to replace Bolger in mid-1997. Later that year, while Bolger attended the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1997|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]], Shipley convinced a majority of her National Party colleagues to back her bid for the [[Leader of the New Zealand National Party|leadership]]. Bolger returned to New Zealand and discovered that he no longer had the support of his party. Rather than face being voted out, he resigned, and Shipley replaced him. As leader of the governing party, she became Prime Minister on 8 December 1997. On 21 May 1998 Shipley was appointed to the [[Member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and became [[The Right Honourable#New Zealand|The Right Honourable]] Jenny Shipley.<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/95eed1350fc35903cc256d2500572b68!OpenDocument Appointments to the Privy Council] (28 May 1998) 74 ''New Zealand'' 1613 at 1644.</ref>

Despite continued economic growth, the Shipley government became increasingly politically unstable. In particular, the relationship between National and New Zealand First deteriorated. While Bolger had been able to maintain good relations with New Zealand First and with its leader, [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Winston Peters]], the alliance became strained after Shipley rose to power. Finally, on 14 August 1998, Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barber|first1=David|title=Shipley sacks rebel minister|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/shipley-sacks-rebel-minister-1171750.html|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=The Independent|date=15 August 1998|location=Wellington}}</ref><ref name="Thompson">{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Alasdair|title=Life Changing: Learning from the past; fixing the future|date=2013|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781483668437|page=333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3K-XAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA233|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=December 2017}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Shipley was nicknamed "the perfumed steamroller," when she first became prime minister.<ref>Denny, Charlotte. "Prepare to meet the perfumed steamroller." Guardian, 24 Nov. 1997, p. T4+. Academic OneFile, http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A20075582/AONE?u=vuw&sid=AONE&xid=59f57256. Accessed 15 May 2018.</ref> During a later interview with [[Guyon Espiner]], Shipley stated that female politicians were labelled differently in the media; she uses the example that male politicians are called bold where female politicians are called vindictive; although she notes that this is an observation, not something that hurts her personally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/28-04-2017/jenny-shipley-women-politics/|title='Look at the language: men are bold, women are vindictive' – ex-PM Jenny Shipley on depictions of politicians (WATCH)|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>

Shipley, along with the [[New Zealand Tourism Board]], backed the quasi-national emblem of the [[Cyathea dealbata|silver fern]] on a black background as a [[New Zealand flag debate|possible alternative flag]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Calls for a new flag |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/calls-new-flag |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=8 June 2018 |language=en-NZ}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Blundell|first1=Sally|title=A symbol solution|url=http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2014/a-symbol-solution/|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=Noted|publisher=The Listener|date=12 March 2014|language=en}}</ref> along the lines of the [[Canadian flag]], but she took pains to publicly disassociate herself from Bolger's support for [[Republicanism in New Zealand|republicanism]]. As the debate continued in 1999, the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] visited New Zealand, and Shipley stated, "I am an unashamed royal supporter, along with many New Zealanders".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Princess Royal's Unfailing Efforts Praised By Pm|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/princess-royal039s-unfailing-efforts-praised-pm|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=9 September 2017|language=en-nz|date=17 March 1999}}</ref> However, the debate was muted by the controversy surrounding Tourism Board contracts going to the public-relations firm [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose World CEO [[Kevin Roberts (businessman)|Kevin Roberts]], also an advocate of the [[silver fern flag]], was a good friend of Shipley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestandard.org.nz/standfornz-when-social-media-goes-bad/ |title=Standfornz – when social media goes bad « The Standard |publisher=Thestandard.org.nz |accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>

The [[APEC Summit]] was hosted in Auckland in September 1999. Shipley met with the [[President of the United States]], [[Bill Clinton]], in one of only two [[state visit]]s to New Zealand by a US President.<ref>{{cite press release|title=State visit of the United States President|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/state-visit-united-states-president|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=9 September 2017|language=en-nz|date=27 August 1999}}</ref>

Shipley was the first Prime Minister to attend the gay and lesbian [[Hero Parade]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Pride and Progress: The Past and the Future of Auckland's Pride Parade – Tearaway|url=http://tearaway.co.nz/pride-progress-past-future-aucklands-pride-parade/|website=Tearaway|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=24 February 2017}}</ref> being the first National Party leader to seek to make electoral overtures to the gay and lesbian voting public. She advocated lowering the [[Legal drinking age#Oceania|alcohol purchase age]] from 20 to 18 and achieved this in 1999.<ref name="Thompson"/> This was part of her expressed desire to expand the traditional National Party voting base.

Shipley became a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers.<ref name="McLeod">{{cite news|last1=McLeod|first1=Rosemary|title=Jenny Shipley: 'Leadership is a life sentence'|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/5836380/Jenny-Shipley-Leadership-is-a-life-sentence|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|publisher=Stuff|date=22 October 2011}}</ref>

==Defeat and resignation==
Shipley led the National Party into the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]], hoping to become the first woman to be elected prime minister in her own right. However, she was defeated by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], also led by a woman, [[Helen Clark]]. This election was a significant moment in history for New Zealand as it was the first New Zealand election in which the leaders of both major parties were women.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vowles|first1=Jack|title=Proportional Representation on Trial: The 1999 New Zealand General Election and the Fate of MMP?|chapter=Gender and Leadership|date=2013|publisher=Auckland University Press|location=Auckland|isbn=9781869407155|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUJeAwAAQBAJ|language=en}}</ref>

Shipley served as the [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] until October 2001, when [[Bill English]] took over as National Party leader.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Small|first1=Vernon|last2=Armstrong|first2=John|last3=Mold|first3=Fran|title=Shipley out, English next in line|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=221356|accessdate=10 September 2017|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=9 October 2001|language=en-NZ}}</ref> She retired from Parliament in January 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jenny Shipley Announces Retirement|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0201/S00236/jenny-shipley-announces-retirement.htm|publisher=Scoop News|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=31 January 2002}}</ref>
