Lymphoma may present with certain nonspecific symptoms; if the symptoms are persistent, an evaluation to determine their cause, including possible lymphoma, should be undertaken.
*[[Lymphadenopathy]]<ref name=lymphoma.org>{{cite web|title=About Lymphoma|url=http://www.lymphoma.org/site/pp.asp?c=bkLTKaOQLmK8E&b=6299689|publisher=Lymphoma Research Foundation|access-date=22 December 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202175216/http://www.lymphoma.org/site/pp.asp?c=bkLTKaOQLmK8E&b=6299689|archive-date=2 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=lymphoma.about.com/> or swelling of lymph nodes, is the primary presentation in lymphoma.

=== Mouth ===
Asymptomatic soft swelling, which may or may not be ulcerated, is primarily seen on the tonsils, buccal mucosa, palate, gums, salivary glands, tongue, floor of the mouth, and retromolar region.

==Diagnosis==
Lymphoma is definitively diagnosed by a [[lymph node biopsy|lymph-node biopsy]], meaning a partial or total excision of a [[lymph node]] examined under the microscope.<ref name=diag.about.com>{{cite web|last=Mallick|first=Indranil|title=How Is Lymphoma Diagnosed?|url=http://lymphoma.about.com/od/testsforlymphoma/p/diagnosis.htm|publisher=lymphoma.about.com|access-date=22 December 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116151305/http://lymphoma.about.com/od/testsforlymphoma/p/diagnosis.htm|archive-date=16 January 2013}}</ref> This examination reveals [[histopathology|histopathological]] features that may indicate lymphoma. After lymphoma is diagnosed, a variety of tests may be carried out to look for specific features characteristic of different types of lymphoma. These include:

* [[Flow cytometry]]
* [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|Fluorescence ''in situ'' hybridization]] testing

===Classification===
[[File:Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte predominant - low power view - H&E - by Gabriel Caponetti.jpg|thumb|Lymph node with mantle cell lymphoma (low-power view, H&E)]]

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lymphoma classification should reflect in which lymphocyte population the neoplasm arises.<ref name=":0">Manli Jiang, N. Nora Bennani, and Andrew L. Feldman. Lymphoma classification update: T-cell lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma, and histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms. Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Mar; 10(3): 239-249. Author Manuscript.</ref> Thus, neoplasms that arise from precursor lymphoid cells are distinguished from those that arise from mature lymphoid cells.<ref name=":0" /> Most mature lymphoid neoplasms comprise the non-Hodgkin lymphomas.<ref name=":0" /> Historically, mature histiocytic and dendritic cell (HDC) neoplasms have been considered mature lymphoid neoplasms, since these often involve lymphoid tissue.<ref name=":0" />

Lymphoma can also spread to the [[central nervous system]], often around the brain in the [[meninges]], known as lymphomatous meningitis (LM).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Canova|first1=F|last2=Marino|first2=D|last3=Trentin|first3=C|last4=Soldà|first4=C|last5=Ghiotto|first5=C|last6=Aversa|first6=SM|title=Intrathecal chemotherapy in lymphomatous meningitis.|journal=Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology|date=August 2011|volume=79|issue=2|pages=127–34|pmid=20696592|doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.07.005}}</ref>

====Hodgkin lymphoma====
{{Main|Hodgkin lymphoma}}
Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for about 15% of lymphomas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hodgkins Lymphoma Incidence|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/hodgkin-lymphoma|access-date=2 October 2017|date=2015-05-14}}</ref> It differs from other forms of lymphomas in its [[prognosis]] and several [[pathology|pathological]] characteristics. A division into Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas is used in several of the older classification systems.

====Non-Hodgkin lymphomas====
[[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]s, which are defined as being all lymphomas except Hodgkin lymphoma, are more common than Hodgkin lymphoma. A wide variety of lymphomas are in this class, and the causes, the types of cells involved, and the prognoses vary by type. The number of cases per year of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increases with age. It is further divided into several subtypes.

====Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases====
[[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases]] are a group of benign, [[premalignant]], and malignant diseases of [[lymphoid cells]], i.e. [[B cells]], [[T cells]], [[NK cells]], and [[Histiocyte|histiocytic-dendritic cells]] in which one or more of these cell types is infected with the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). The virus may be responsible for the development and/or progression of these diseases. In addition to [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein-Barr virus-positive Hodgkin lymphoma|EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphomas]], the World Health Organization (2016) includes the following lymphomas, when associated with EBV infection, in this group of diseases: [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma|Burkitt lymphoma]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified diffuse|large B cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein Barr virus-associated diffuse large B cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation|diffuse large B cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Fibrin-associated diffuse large B cell lymphoma|fibrin-associated diffuse large B cell lymphoma]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Primary effusion lymphoma|primary effusion lymphoma]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein Barr virus-positive plasmablastic lymphoma|plasmablastic lymphoma]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type|extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein-Barr virus-associated peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified|peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma|angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma]]; [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Follicular T Cell lymphoma|follicular T cell lymphoma]]; and [[Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Systemic Epstein-Barr virus-positive T cell lymphoma of childhood|systemic T cell lymphoma of childhood]].<ref name="pmid29885408">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rezk SA, Zhao X, Weiss LM | title = Epstein - Barr virus - associated lymphoid proliferations, a 2018 update | journal = Human Pathology | volume = 79| pages = 18–41| date = June 2018 | pmid = 29885408 | doi = 10.1016/j.humpath.2018.05.020 }}</ref>

====WHO classification====
The WHO classification, published in 2001 and updated in 2008,<ref name="Jaffe_2011_1"/><ref name="Swerdlow2008"/> is based upon the foundations laid within the "revised European-American lymphoma classification" (REAL). This system groups lymphomas by cell type (i.e. the normal cell type that most resembles the tumor) and defining [[phenotypic]], [[molecular]], or [[cytogenetic]] characteristics. The five groups are shown in the table. Hodgkin lymphoma is considered separately within the WHO and preceding classifications, although it is recognized as being a tumor, albeit markedly abnormal, of lymphocytes of mature B cell lineage.

Of the many forms of lymphoma, some are categorized as indolent (e.g. [[small lymphocytic lymphoma]]), compatible with a long life even without treatment, whereas other forms are aggressive (e.g. [[Burkitt's lymphoma]]), causing rapid deterioration and death. However, most of the aggressive lymphomas respond well to treatment and are curable. The [[prognosis]], therefore, depends on the correct diagnosis and classification of the disease, which is established after examination of a biopsy by a [[pathology|pathologist]] (usually a [[hematopathology|hematopathologist]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Wagman LD. |chapter=Principles of Surgical Oncology |chapter-url=http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter01/article/10165/1399286 |veditors=Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ |title=Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach |publisher=CMPMedica |year=2008 |isbn=9781891483622 |edition=11th |url=http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224102/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ |archive-date=2013-10-04 }}</ref>

====Previous classifications====

Several previous classifications have been used, including Rappaport 1956, Lennert/Kiel 1974, BNLI, Working formulation (1982), and REAL (1994).

The [[Working Formulation]] of 1982 was a classification of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]. It excluded the Hodgkin lymphomas and divided the remaining lymphomas into four grades (low, intermediate, high, and miscellaneous) related to prognosis, with some further subdivisions based on the size and shape of affected cells. This purely histological classification included no information about [[cell surface markers]], or genetics, and it made no distinction between [[T-cell lymphoma]]s and [[B-cell lymphoma]]s. It was widely accepted at the time of its publication, but is now obsolete.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke CA, Glaser SL, Dorfman RF, Bracci PM, Eberle E, Holly EA | title = Expert review of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in a population-based cancer registry: reliability of diagnosis and subtype classifications | journal = Cancer Epidemiol.

In 1994, the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification applied immunophenotypic and genetic features in identifying distinct clinicopathologic entities among all the lymphomas except Hodgkin lymphoma.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|203399|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma}}</ref> For coding purposes, the [[ICD-O]] (codes 9590–9999)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cog.ufl.edu/publ/apps/icdo/icdo_morph.txt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-11-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040627090029/http://www.cog.ufl.edu/publ/apps/icdo/icdo_morph.txt |archive-date=June 27, 2004 }}</ref> and [[ICD|ICD-10]] (codes C81-C96)<ref>[http://www3.who.int/icd/vol1htm2003/fr-icd.htm?gc81.htm+ who.int]</ref> are available.

===Staging===
[[File:DIagram showing where lymphoma can spread in the body CRUK 382.svg|thumb|Diagram showing common sites where lymphoma spreads]]
After a diagnosis and before treatment, a cancer is [[cancer staging|staged]]. This refers to determining if the cancer has spread, and if so, whether locally or to distant sites. Staging is reported as a grade between I (confined) and IV (spread). The stage of a lymphoma helps predict a patient's prognosis and is used to help select the appropriate therapy.<ref name="Cheson">{{cite journal |last1=Cheson |first1=Bruce D. |last2=Fisher |first2=Richard I. |last3=Barrington |first3=Sally F. |last4=Cavalli |first4=Franco |last5=Schwartz |first5=Lawrence H. |last6=Zucca |first6=Emanuele |last7=Lister |first7=T. Andrew |title=Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification |journal=J Clin Oncol |date=20 September 2014 |volume=32 |issue=27 |pages=3059–3067 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2013.54.8800|pmid=25113753 |pmc=4979083 }}</ref>

The [[Ann Arbor staging|Ann Arbor staging system]] is routinely used for staging of both HL and NHL. In this staging system, I represents localized disease contained within a lymph node group, II represents the presence of lymphoma in two or more lymph nodes groups, III represents spread of the lymphoma to lymph nodes groups on both sides of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], and IV indicates spread to tissue outside the lymphatic system. Different suffixes imply involvement of different organs, for example S for the spleen and H for the liver. Extra-lymphatic involvement is expressed with the letter E. In addition, the presence of B symptoms (one or more of the following: unintentional loss of 10% body weight in the last 6 months, night sweats, or persistent fever of 38°C or more) or their absence is expressed with B or A, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carbone |first1=PP |last2=Kaplan |first2=HS |last3=Musshoff |first3=K |last4=Smithers |first4=DW |last5=Tubiana |first5=M |title=Report of the Committee on Hodgkin's Disease Staging Classification. |journal=Cancer Res |date=November 1971 |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=1860–1 |pmid=5121694}}</ref>

[[CT scan]] or [[PET scan]] imaging modalities are used to stage a cancer. PET scanning is advised for [[fludeoxyglucose (18F)|fluorodeoxyglucose]]-avid lymphomas, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, as a staging tool that can even replace bone marrow biopsy. For other lymphomas, CT scanning is recommended for staging.<ref name="Cheson"/>

Age and poor [[performance status]] are other established poor prognostic factors.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Predictive Model for Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma |journal=N Engl J Med |date=30 September 1993 |volume=329 |issue=14 |pages=987–994 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199309303291402|pmid=8141877 |author1=International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project }}</ref>  This means that people who are elderly or too sick to take care of themselves are more likely to die from lymphoma than others.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Certain lymphomas ([[extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type]] and [[enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma#Genetics|type II enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma]]) can be mimicked by two benign diseases which involve the excessive proliferation of non-malignant NK cells in the GI tract, [[natural killer cell enteropathy]], a disease wherein NK cell infiltrative lesions occur in the intestine, colon, stomach, or esophagus, and [[Natural killer cell enteropathy|lymphomatoid gastropathy]], a disease wherein these cells' infiltrative lesions are limited to the stomach. These diseases do not progress to cancer, may regress spontaneously and do not respond to, and do not require, chemotherapy or other lymphoma treatments.<ref name="pmid30212873">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xia D, Morgan EA, Berger D, Pinkus GS, Ferry JA, Zukerberg LR | s2cid = 52272766 | title = NK-Cell Enteropathy and Similar Indolent Lymphoproliferative Disorders: A Case Series With Literature Review | journal = American Journal of Clinical Pathology | volume = 151 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–85 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30212873 | doi = 10.1093/ajcp/aqy108 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Prognoses and treatments are different for HL and between all the different forms of NHL,<ref name="pmid20017283">{{cite journal | author = Sweetenham JW | title = Treatment of lymphoblastic lymphoma in adults | journal = Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.) | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 1015–20 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 20017283 }}</ref> and also depend on the [[cancer grading|grade]] of tumour, referring to how quickly a cancer replicates. Paradoxically, high-grade lymphomas are more readily treated and have better prognoses: {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[Burkitt lymphoma]], for example, is a high-grade tumour known to double within days, and is highly responsive to treatment. Lymphomas may be curable if detected in early stages with modern treatment.

=== Low-grade===
Many low-grade lymphomas remain [[Indolent lymphoma|indolent]] (growing slowly or not at all) for many years – sometimes, for the rest of the person's life. With an indolent lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma, [[watchful waiting]] is often the initial course of action, because monitoring is less risky and less harmful than early treatment.<ref name="pmid18467294">{{cite journal|author=Elphee EE|s2cid=25207677|date=May 2008|title=Understanding the concept of uncertainty in patients with indolent lymphoma|journal=Oncol Nurs Forum|volume=35|issue=3|pages=449–54|doi=10.1188/08.ONF.449-454|pmid=18467294}}</ref> 

If a low-grade lymphoma becomes symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice.  Although these treatments do not permanently cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful [[lymphadenopathy]]. People with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, even though the disease is technically [[incurable]]. 

Some centers advocate the use of single agent [[rituximab]] in the treatment of follicular lymphoma rather than the wait-and-watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a desirable strategy for everyone, as it leads to significant distress and [[anxiety]] in some people. It has been called "watch and worry".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ansell SM | title = Follicular lymphoma: Watch and wait is watch and worry | journal = The Lancet Oncology | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 368–9 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24602759 | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70066-X }}</ref>

===High-grade===

Treatment of some other, more aggressive, forms of lymphoma {{which|date=July 2013}} can result in a cure in the majority of cases, but the prognosis for people with a poor response to therapy is worse.<ref name="pmid20008238">{{cite journal | author = Bernstein SH, Burack WR | title = The incidence, natural history, biology, and treatment of transformed lymphomas | journal = Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program | volume = 2009 | pages = 532–41 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20008238 | doi = 10.1182/asheducation-2009.1.532 | last2 = Burack }}</ref> Treatment for these types of lymphoma typically consists of aggressive chemotherapy, including the [[CHOP (chemotherapy)|CHOP or R-CHOP]] regimen. A number of people are cured with first-line chemotherapy. Most relapses occur within the first two years, and the relapse risk drops significantly thereafter.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jenkins EC | title = Wire-loop application of liquid emulsion to slides for autoradiography in light microscopy. | journal = Stain Technology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–6 | date = Jan 1972 | pmid = 4550425 | doi = 10.3109/10520297209116530 }}</ref> For people who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is a proven approach.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Philip T, Guglielmi C, Hagenbeek A, Somers R, Van der Lelie H, Bron D, Sonneveld P, Gisselbrecht C, Cahn JY, Harousseau JL | title = Autologous bone marrow transplantation as compared with salvage chemotherapy in relapses of chemotherapy-sensitive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 333 | issue = 23 | pages = 1540–5 | date = Dec 7, 1995 | pmid = 7477169 | doi = 10.1056/nejm199512073332305 }}</ref>

The treatment of side effects is also important as they can occur due to the chemotherapy or the [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell transplantation]]. It was evaluated whether mesenchymal stromal cells can be used for the treatment and prophylaxis of [[graft-versus-host disease]]s. The evidence is very uncertain about the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stromal cells to treat graft-versus-host diseases on the all-cause mortality and complete disappear of chronic acute graft-versus-host diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells may results in little to no difference in the all-cause mortality, relapse of malignant disease and incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host diseases if they are used for prophylactic reason.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Sheila A|last2=Cutler|first2=Antony|last3=Doree|first3=Carolyn|last4=Brunskill|first4=Susan J|last5=Stanworth|first5=Simon J|last6=Navarrete|first6=Cristina|last7=Girdlestone|first7=John|date=2019-01-30|editor-last=Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group|title=Mesenchymal stromal cells as treatment or prophylaxis for acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with a haematological condition|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2019|issue=1|pages=CD009768|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009768.pub2|pmid=30697701|pmc=6353308}}</ref> Moreover, it was seen that [[platelet transfusion]]s for people undergoing a chemotherapy or a stem cell transplantation for the prevention of bleeding events had different effects on the number of participants with a bleeding event, the number of days on which a bleeding occurred, the mortality secondary to bleeding and the number of platelet transfusions depending of the way they were used (therapeutic, depending on a threshold, different dose schedules or prophylactic).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Estcourt|first1=Lise|last2=Stanworth|first2=Simon|last3=Doree|first3=Carolyn|last4=Hopewell|first4=Sally|last5=Murphy|first5=Michael F|last6=Tinmouth|first6=Alan|last7=Heddle|first7=Nancy|date=2012-05-16|editor-last=Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group|title=Prophylactic platelet transfusion for prevention of bleeding in patients with haematological disorders after chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=5|pages=CD004269|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004269.pub3|pmid=22592695}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Estcourt|first1=Lise J|last2=Stanworth|first2=Simon J|last3=Doree|first3=Carolyn|last4=Hopewell|first4=Sally|last5=Trivella|first5=Marialena|last6=Murphy|first6=Michael F|date=2015-11-18|editor-last=Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group|title=Comparison of different platelet count thresholds to guide administration of prophylactic platelet transfusion for preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD010983|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010983.pub2|pmid=26576687|pmc=4717525}}</ref>

Scientists evaluated whether [[Positron emission tomography|positron-emission-tomography]] scans between the chemotherapy cycles can be used to make assumptions about the survival. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of negative (= good prognosis) or positive (= bad prognosis) interim PET scan results on the progression-free survival.

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of Nivolumab for patients with a Hodgkin’s lymphoma on the overall survival, the quality of life, the survival without a progression, the response rate (=complete disappear) and grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goldkuhle|first1=Marius|last2=Dimaki|first2=Maria|last3=Gartlehner|first3=Gerald|last4=Monsef|first4=Ina|last5=Dahm|first5=Philipp|last6=Glossmann|first6=Jan-Peter|last7=Engert|first7=Andreas|last8=von Tresckow|first8=Bastian|last9=Skoetz|first9=Nicole|date=2018-07-12|editor-last=Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group|title=Nivolumab for adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma (a rapid review using the software RobotReviewer)|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2018|issue=7|pages=CD012556|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012556.pub2|pmid=30001476|pmc=6513229}}</ref>

=== Supportive treatment ===
Adding physical exercises to the standard treatment for adult patients with haematologicl malignancies like lymphomas may result in little to no difference in the mortality, the quality of life and the physical functioning. These exercises may result in a slight reduction in depression. Furthermore, aerobic physical exercises probably reduce fatigue. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on anxiety and serious adverse events.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Knips|first1=Linus|last2=Bergenthal|first2=Nils|last3=Streckmann|first3=Fiona|last4=Monsef|first4=Ina|last5=Elter|first5=Thomas|last6=Skoetz|first6=Nicole|date=2019-01-31|editor-last=Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group|title=Aerobic physical exercise for adult patients with haematological malignancies|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2019|issue=1|pages=CD009075|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009075.pub3|pmid=30702150|pmc=6354325}}</ref>

Lymphoma is the most common form of [[hematological malignancy]], or "blood cancer", in the developed world.

Taken together, lymphomas represent 5.3% of all cancers (excluding simple basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers) in the United States and 55.6% of all blood cancers.<ref>{{cite web |title       = SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975–2006 |work        = Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) |publisher   = [[National Cancer Institute]] |url         = http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2006/ |vauthors    = Horner MJ, Ries LG, Krapcho M, Neyman N |location    = Bethesda, MD |access-date  = 3 November 2009 |quote       = Table 1.4: Age-Adjusted SEER Incidence and U.S. Death Rates and 5-Year Relative Survival Rates By Primary Cancer Site, Sex and Time Period |url-status     = live |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090926004001/http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2006/ |archive-date = 26 September 2009 }}</ref>

According to the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]], lymphomas account for about 5%, and Hodgkin lymphoma in particular accounts for less than 1% of all cases of cancer in the United States.

Because the whole system is part of the body's immune system, people with a weakened immune system such as from HIV infection or from certain drugs or medication also have a higher number of cases of lymphoma.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tran H, Nourse J, Hall S, Green M, Griffiths L, Gandhi MK | title = Immunodeficiency-associated lymphomas | journal = Blood Reviews | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 261–281 | date = Sep 2008 | pmid = 18456377 | doi = 10.1016/j.blre.2008.03.009 }}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of lymphoma}}
[[File:Thomas Hodgkin photo.jpg|thumb|190px|Thomas Hodgkin]]
[[Thomas Hodgkin]] published the first description of lymphoma in 1832, specifically of the form named after him.<ref name="Mauch1999">{{cite book | last = Hellman | first = Samuel |author2=Mauch, P.M. Ed.  | title = Hodgkin's Disease | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 1999 | location = Chapter 1 | page = 5 | isbn = 0-7817-1502-4}}</ref> Since then, many other forms of lymphoma have been described.

The term "lymphoma" is from latin lympha ("water") and from greek -oma ("morbid growth, tumor").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/-oma?ref=etymonline_crossreference|title=-oma|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

==Research==
The two types of lymphoma research are clinical or [[translational research]] and [[basic research]]. Clinical/translational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately applicable way, such as testing a new drug in people. Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for people, or appropriate care in remission or after cures. Hundreds of [[clinical trials]] are being planned or conducted at any given time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=lymphoma |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106213155/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=lymphoma |archive-date=2013-01-06 }}</ref>

Basic science research studies the disease process at a distance, such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause healthy cells to turn into lymphoma cells in the laboratory or how the DNA changes inside lymphoma cells as the disease progresses. The results from basic research studies are generally less immediately useful to people with the disease,<ref>{{cite web|website=The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society|title=Understanding Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers|url=http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1162487596.pdf|publisher=Leukemia and Lymphoma Society|access-date=19 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105213515/http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1162487596.pdf|archive-date=5 January 2011}}</ref> but can improve scientists' understanding of lymphoma and form the foundation for future, more effective treatments.
