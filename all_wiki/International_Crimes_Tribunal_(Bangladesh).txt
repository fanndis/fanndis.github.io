The '''International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)''' ('''ICT of Bangladesh''') is a domestic war crimes tribunal in Bangladesh set up in 2009 to investigate and prosecute suspects for the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|genocide]] committed in 1971 by the [[Pakistan Army]] and their local collaborators, [[Razakars (Pakistan)|Razakars]], [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badr]] and [[Al-Shams (East Pakistan)|Al-Shams]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref name="Wierda" /> During the [[2008 Bangladeshi general election|2008 general election]], the [[Awami League]] (AL) pledged to try war criminals.<ref name="Kibria" /> The government set up the tribunal after the Awami League won the general election in December 2008 with a more than two-thirds majority in parliament.

The [[War Crimes Fact Finding Committee]], tasked to investigate and find evidence, completed its report in 2008, identifying 1,600 suspects.<ref name="Rahman" /><ref name="Montero" /> Prior to the formation of the ICT, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] offered assistance in 2009 on the tribunal's formation.<ref name="D'Costa2p144" /> In 2009, the parliament amended the 1973 act that authorised such a tribunal to update it.<ref name=dwonparty>{{cite news |last=Shams |first=Shamil |date=18 February 2013 |title=Will ban on Islamic party heal wounds? |url=http://www.dw.de/will-ban-on-islamic-party-heal-wounds/a-16607674 |work=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> The first indictments were issued in 2010. However, the main perpetrators of the war crimes, the Pakistan soldiers, remained out of the reach of the courts.<ref name=economist1>{{cite magazine |title=Politics and the past in Bangladesh: Dialling down |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21629455-series-trials-war-crimes-still-matter-politically-less-dialling-down |magazine=The Economist |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

By 2012, nine leaders of [[Jamaat-e-Islami]], the largest Islamist party in the nation, and two of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], had been indicted as suspects in [[war crime]]s. Three leaders of Jamaat were the first tried; each were convicted of several charges of war crimes. The first person convicted was [[Abul Kalam Azad (Bachchu)|Abul Kalam Azad]], tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' as he had left the country; he was sentenced to death in January 2013.

The ICT initially received some offers of international assistance. In 2009, the UN offered its expertise, expressing an interest in helping Bangladesh avoid the problems other countries faced in similar trials.<ref name="Haq"/><ref name=dawn>{{cite news |title=UN to help Bangladesh war crimes trial planning |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/904714/un-to-help-bangladesh-war-crimes-trial-planning |newspaper=DAWN |date=24 April 2009 |access-date=4 July 2015}}</ref> The [[European Union|EU]] has passed three resolutions supporting the trials and [[Jean Lambert]] has said "she expected that the trial would conform to the highest standard possible."<ref name="Ullah" />

However, since the beginning of the trials several human rights organisations and international legal figures have raised objections to the court proceedings.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Shamim |date=29 October 2014 |title=The politics at play in Bangladesh war trials |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/10/politics-at-play-bangladesh-war-trials-2014102953244138968.html |newspaper=Al Jazeera |access-date=4 July 2015 |quote=Human Rights Watch and the International Bar Association are just two of a number of bodies that have formally criticised the ICT for being incompatible with international standards on matters of transparency and fairness, and for not following due process.}}</ref> Human Rights Watch, which initially supported the establishment of the tribunal, have criticised it for issues of fairness and transparency, as well as reported harassment of lawyers and witnesses representing the accused.<ref name="Adams" /><ref name="Adams2" /> Bianca Karim and Tirza Theunissen have written that the international community have voiced concerns that the trial will not be transparent or impartial.<ref name="Karim" />

Jamaat-e-Islami supporters and their student wing, [[Islami Chhatra Shibir|Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir]], called a general strike nationwide on 4 December 2012, which erupted in violence. The group demanded the tribunal be scrapped permanently and their leaders be released immediately.<ref name="Attack_star-1" /><ref name="attack_newage-1" /><ref name="attack_sun-1" />

Annual public opinion polls regularly rank the war-crimes trials ranked among the top three "positive steps that the government has taken", though the issue is not considered among the top ten most pressing issues facing the country.<ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013>{{cite magazine |title=Bangladesh's warcrimes trials: Final sentence |magazine =The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2013/09/bangladesh-s-war-crimes-trials |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> Polling in 2013 by [[AC Nielsen]] found that more than two-thirds of Bangladeshis characterise the ICT as "unfair" or "very unfair", though 86% support its implementation.<ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013/>

In February 2013, [[Abdul Quader Molla]], Assistant Secretary General of Jamaat, was the first person sentenced to death by the ICT who was not convicted in absentia.<ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013/> Initially, Molla was sentenced to life imprisonment, but demonstrations, including the [[2013 Shahbag protests]] in Dhaka, lead to a new punishment.<ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013/>

==Background==
The events of the nine-month conflict of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] are widely viewed as [[genocide]]; the Pakistan Army and collaborators targeted mass people, intellectuals and members of the political opposition for attacks.<ref name="D'Costa2p144" /><ref name="D'Costa2p76" /><ref name="Simms" /><ref name="Trim" /> Historians have estimated that, during the conflict, between two hundred thousand<ref name="Saikia Sexual Violence" /> and four hundred thousand<ref name="Riedel p10" /> women and children<ref name="Ghadbian" /> were [[Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War|raped]] leading to an estimated 25,000 [[war babies]] being born.<ref name="D'Costa3" /> Estimates of persons killed during the conflict range to three million.<ref name="Totten" /> An estimated ten million refugees entered India, a situation which contributed to its government's decision to intervene militarily in the civil war. Thirty million people were displaced.<ref name="Totten" />

In 2009 [[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, announced that the trials would be organised under the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973.<ref name="Alffram" /> This act authorises prosecution only of persons living within Bangladesh who were members of the armed forces, including paramilitary groups. The act was amended in 2009 to update it, and the International Crimes Tribunal Rules of Procedure and Evidence were put in place by 2010. Some critics maintain that further amendments are needed to bring the act up to the standards of international law.<ref name="Karim" />

==Formation of the tribunal==
Seeing the broad support for war crimes trials, the [[Awami League]]-led fourteen-party alliance included this in their election platform.<ref name="ictformed"/> The Four-Party Alliance, including the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] and [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]], had several alleged war criminals among their top-ranking politicians.<ref>[http://icsforum.org/mediarchive/2008/12/31/no-against-war-criminals-won/ "No against war criminals won"], ''The Daily Prothom Alo,'' 31 December 2008, collected from [http://icsforum.org/mediarchive/ ICSF Media Archive]</ref>

On 29 January 2009, [[Mahmud-us-Samad Chowdhury]], a member of the parliament (MP) from the Awami League (AL), proposed taking action to establish a tribunal to prosecute war crimes during a session of the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. A resolution was passed unanimously calling on the government to proceed as promised in the election.<ref>{{cite news |title=JS passes proposal to try war criminals |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=73557 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=30 January 2009}}</ref>

In 1973 the newly independent government of Bangladesh passed a law, the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (ICT Act 1973), to authorise the investigation and prosecution of the persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes under [[international law]] committed in 1971.

On 25 March 2010, the government announced the formation of the following: a three-member judges' tribunal, a seven-member investigation agency, and a twelve-member prosecution team to hold the trials according to the ICT Act of 1973.

==Accused and verdicts==

===Abul Kalam Azad===
[[Abul Kalam Azad (politician)|Abul Kalam Azad]], a nationally known Islamic cleric and former member of Jamaat, was charged with genocide, rape, abduction, confinement and torture. He was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' after having fled the country; the police believe he is in Pakistan.<ref name="Quadir" /> In January 2013 Azad was the first suspect to be convicted in the trials; he was found guilty of seven of eight charges and sentenced to death by hanging.<ref name="Ahmed2" /> Azad's defence lawyer, a prominent Supreme Court lawyer appointed by the state, did not have any witnesses in the case; he said Azad's family failed to co-operate in helping locate witnesses and refused to testify.<ref name="AzadNoWitnesses" />

United Nations human rights experts expressed concern that the trial did not meet all the criteria of a [[fair trial]] and [[due process]].<ref name="UNAzad" /> Speaking for the British government, [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Sayeeda Warsi]] said of the verdict, "The British government supports the efforts of Bangladesh to bring to justice those responsible for committing atrocities during the 1971 War, although we remain strongly opposed to the application of the death penalty in all circumstances." The French Ambassador to Bangladesh, [[Michel Trinquier]], and the German Ambassador [[Albrecht Conze]] each said that individual nations must find their own ways to deal with past events.<ref name="Star Online Report" /> The US state department has said, "The [[United States]] supports bringing to justice those who commit such crimes. However, we believe that any such trials must be free, fair, and transparent, and in accordance with domestic standards and international standards Bangladesh has agreed to uphold through its ratification of international agreements, including the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]."<ref name="Nuland" />

==Controversies==

===2012 Skype controversy===
{{Main|2012 ICT Skype controversy}}
In December 2012, ''[[The Economist]]'' published contents of leaked communications between the chief justice of the tribunal, [[Mohammed Nizamul Huq]], and [[Ahmed Ziauddin]], a Bangladeshi attorney in [[Brussels]] who specialises in international law and is director of the Bangladesh Centre for Genocide Studies. Huq issued an order for ''The Economist'' bureau chief and Asia specialist to appear before the tribunal to explain how they got the materials.<ref name="The Economist">{{cite magazine |title=Discrepancy in Dhaka |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/12/bangladesh |work=The Economist |date=8 December 2012}}</ref> ''The Economist'' said in response, "We did not solicit the material, nor pay for it, nor commit ourselves to publish it".<ref name="Ethirajan" /> After the leaked communication was published in a local daily, Huq resigned from the tribunal.<ref name="Wright"/> He had been revealed to have had "prohibited contact" with the "prosecution, government officials, and an external adviser."<ref name="Adams3"/>

According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ), the e-mails and [[Skype]] calls showed that Ziauddin was playing an important part in the proceedings, although he had no legal standing. The WSJ also said that the communications suggested that the Bangladeshi government was trying to secure a quick verdict, as Huq referred to pressure from a government official.<ref name="Wright"/>

[[Human Rights Watch]] and defence lawyers acting for the suspects, [[Ghulam Azam]] and Delawar Hossain Sayeedi, requested retrials for the two because of the controversy during their trials.<ref name="Wright" /><ref name="HRW Retrial" /> Mahbubey Alam, the Attorney General, suggested that the hacking was an attempt to disrupt the trial.<ref name="Attorney general" /> [[Sheikh Hasina]], the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said the trials would continue regardless of this incident and Huq's resignation.<ref name="BdST PM" /> Fazle Kabir was appointed as chair of the ICT.<ref>{{cite news |title=Justice Kabir made ICT-1 chief |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/latest_news.php?nid=43147 |newspaper=Daily Star |date=13 December 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref> Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch expressed concern that, because of changes among all the judges in the course of the trial, none of the three judges in Sayeedi's case would have heard the entirety of the testimony before reaching a verdict.<ref name="HRW Retrial" />

===Allegations by the government===
[[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law and Justice, referring to Ziauddin, said that Huq "sought help on procedural matters from an expert. That's not illegal or uncommon."<ref name="Al-Mahmood" /> [[Amnesty International]] criticised the arrest of [[Mahmudur Rahman]], who had published the hacked files in the daily ''[[Amar Desh]].'' The government obtained a court order that accused Rahman of [[sedition]]; but Amnesty said that his newspaper stopped publishing the story once the government ban came into effect on 13 December.<ref name="Online Report" />

Shafique Ahmed alleged that Jamaat-e-Islami has paid US$25&nbsp;million to lobbyists in the USA and the UK to influence public opinion against the trials.<ref name="lobbyists" /> Mizanur Rahman, chair of the [[National Human Rights Commission]], complained about the lobbying efforts, saying there was misinformation being spread among western nations about the war crimes tribunal.<ref name="Mizanur Rahman" />

===Shibir protests===
[[Shibir]], the student wing of Jamaat, led huge protests against the trials beginning with a general strike on 4 December 2012; they were attacked by police whenever they want to come down the streets to protest.<ref name="Attack_star-1" /><ref name="attack_newage-1" /><ref name="attack_sun-1" />  In one incident in shatkhira police shot open fire, which resulted in three Shibir workers being injured.<ref name="Jamaat-Shibir men run amok" /> In this reaction, Numerous vehicles, including one of the US embassy in Dhaka, were torched and vandalised.<ref name=us_embassy-1>{{cite news |title=Sorry only for US embassy vehicle |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=259962 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=New_Nation-1>{{cite news |title=Violences mark hartal |url=http://thenewnationbd.com/newsdetails.aspx?newsid=59383 |newspaper=The New Nation |date=26 January 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=Jessor_attack>{{cite news |title=Jamaat attacks cops in Jessore |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/latest_news.php?nid=43709 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref> In one incident, police fired [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s at the activists. One Jamaat-e-Islami activist was killed and scores were injured when police used live ammunition against the protesters during clashes in December 2012.<ref name="rt" /> The activists were demanding the release of [[Miah Golam Parwar]], [[Delawar Hossain Sayedee]] and other party members being tried.<ref name="Jamaat-Shibir men run amok" /><ref name="Jamaat attack" />

===Concerns for human rights===
[[Brad Adams]], director of the Asia branch of [[Human Rights Watch]], said in November 2012: "The trials against (...) the alleged war criminals are deeply problematic, riddled with questions about the independence and impartiality of the judges and fairness of the process.<ref name="HRWReport2012"/> In its November 2012 report, Human Rights Watch found that "glaring violations of fair trial standards" became apparent during 2012 but noted that changes were made in June 2012 which improved the process.<ref name="HRWReport2012"/> Adams said, "If the Bangladeshi government wants these trials to be taken seriously it must ensure that the rights of the accused are fully respected. That means making sure that lawyers and witnesses don't face threats or coercion.<ref name="Adams2" /> [[Toby Cadman]], an international law expert who is an advisor to the Jamaat leaders has been highly critical of the ICT, saying of the international community  "Expressing concern will not be enough. The international community should take quick action to stop the injustice being committed against Jamaat leaders,"<ref name="Ghafour" />

In January 2013, Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted concern about [[Shukho Ranjan Bali]], who had first appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the [[Delwar Hossain Sayeedi]] case. The defence said he was due to give additional evidence in their favour on 5 November 2012. That day Bali was stopped before entering the courthouse by several police officers; witnesses said he was taken away in a white police van. HRW criticised the Bangladeshi government for not working to find him and for its lack of adequate response to allegations criticising the tribunal. The attorney general rejected the abduction claim as a fabrication by the defence to bring the tribunal into disrepute.<ref name="Adams3" /> In May 2013, Bali was found in an Indian prison, and he alleged state abduction and that officials told him that both he and Sayeedi would be killed.<ref name="nabali"/>

In March 2013, ''The Economist'' criticised the tribunal, mentioning government interference, restrictions on public discussion, not enough time allocated for the defence, the kidnapping of a defence witness and the judge resigning due to [[2012 ICT Skype controversy|controversy over his neutrality]].<ref name=Economist2>{{cite magazine | title=Justice in Bangladesh: Another kind of crime | url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573990-bangladeshs-war-crimes-tribunal-sullying-its-judicial-and-political-systems-another-kind | magazine=[[The Economist]] | date=23 March 2013 | accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>

==Reactions==
[[Human Rights Watch]] initially supported the establishment of the tribunal and recommended amendments to the 1973 law. The government already had planned to update the law, and proceeded in consultation with experts, as noted above.<ref name="Adams"/>

When the tribunal was being planned, [[Stephen Rapp]], the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, said that the "US government will help Bangladesh hold an open and transparent war crimes trial with the rights of defense for the accused."<ref name="Haq" /> Kristine A. Huskey, writing for the NGO Crimes of War, said Rapp gave a ten-page letter to the prosecution which included recommendations and various concerns.<ref name="Huskey" />

A [[WikiLeaks]] [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked cable]] in November 2010 from the US State Department said, "There is little doubt that hard-line elements within the ruling party Awami League believe that the time is right to crush Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamic parties."<ref name="Allchin" />

Bangladeshi opposition political parties have demanded the release of those held, claiming the arrests are politically motivated.<ref name="Haq" /> [[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law and Justice, disagrees, saying, "No one is being arrested or tried on religious or political grounds."<ref name="bdnews24" />

[[Steven Kay]], a British [[Queen's Counsel]] and criminal attorney, has been part of the defence team for Delwar Hossain Sayeedi.<ref name=Report>{{cite news |title=ICT recommends action against Sayedee's UK lawyers |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/latest_news.php?nid=33648 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=14 November 2011}}</ref> He had earlier criticised the authorising legislation and 2009 amendments, saying: "The current system of war crimes trial and its law in Bangladesh does not include international concerns, required to ensure a fair, impartial and transparent trial."<ref name="Correspondent"/> The ICT accused him of violating the British bar's code of conduct.<ref name="Ahmed" />

The Turkish president [[Abdullah Gül]] sent a letter to the tribunal asking that clemency be shown to those accused of war crimes.<ref name="Zaman" /> The [[European Parliament]] has passed three resolutions supporting the trials, though in at least one, it expressed its "strong opposition against the use of the death penalty in all cases and under any circumstances and its call on the Bangladesh authorities to commute all death sentences and introduce a moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of capital punishment."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&reference=B7-2013-0144&language=EN|title=Motion for a resolution on the situation in Bangladesh - B7-0144/2013|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> [[Jean Lambert]] welcomed the trials and said she expected them to adhere to international standards.<ref name="Ullah" /> Mizanur Rahman, chair of the National Human Rights Commission, has said the trials do adhere to international law as the "national standards are in compliance with international standards".<ref name="NHRC" /> Sam Zarifi of the [[International Commission of Jurists]] expressed concern that the flawed nature of trials conducted at the ICT could deepen the divisions in Bangladeshi society which resulted from the war of 1971, rather than heal them.<ref name="ZarifiICJ"/>

The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has said that the arbitrary detention of the suspects and refusal by the government to grant bail to them violates Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. Shafique Ahmed has responded, "It is not right to think that the accused are being detained without any reason. There are no violations of human rights in the ongoing trial of crimes against humanity, and questions of human rights violation are being raised simply to create confusion."<ref name="UNWGAD" />

Some human rights advocates are concerned that the mass rapes and killings of women may not be fully addressed in the prosecutions.<ref name="RoyNYT" /> [[Irene Khan]], a Bangladeshi [[human rights activist]], has described the government's response to abuses against women in the liberation war as the following:

<blockquote>A conservative Muslim society has preferred to throw a veil of negligence and denial on the issue, allowed those who committed or colluded with gender violence to thrive, and left the women victims to struggle in anonymity and shame and without much state or community support.<ref name="RoyNYT" /></blockquote>

The Bangladeshi government has dismissed criticisms of the legal provisions and fairness of the tribunal. [[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law and Justice, said:

<blockquote>There is no scope for questioning the fairness and standard of the ongoing trial for war crimes during the Liberation War in 1971.<ref name="BestLaw" /></blockquote>
