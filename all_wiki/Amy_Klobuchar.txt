==Early life and education==
Born in [[Plymouth, Minnesota]], Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose (née Heuberger) and [[Jim Klobuchar]].

==Early career==
After law school, Klobuchar worked as a corporate lawyer.<ref name=":0" /> Before seeking public office, besides working as a prosecutor, Klobuchar was a partner at the Minnesota law firms [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and [[Gray Plant Mooty]], where she specialized in "regulatory work in telecommunications law".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=k000367 | title=Klobuchar, Amy – Biographical Information | website=bioguide.congress.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070201220009/http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=K000367|archive-date=February 1, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2006/campaign/senate/klobuchar/ | title=MPR: Campaign 2006: U.S. Senate: Amy Klobuchar|website=Minnesota Public Radio| language=en | access-date=May 14, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322122031/http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2006/campaign/senate/klobuchar/ | archive-date=March 22, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/02/10/amy-klobuchar-timeline | title = Klobuchar timeline: A life of law and politics led to presidential aspirations|first1=Briana|last1=Bierschbach|first2=Cody|last2=Nelson|first3=Jiwon|last3=Choi|work=MPR News|date=February 10, 2019|access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> Her first foray into politics came after she gave birth and was forced to leave the hospital 24 hours later, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Klobuchar's daughter, Abigail,<ref name=":0" /> was born with a disorder that prevented her from swallowing. The experience led Klobuchar to appear before the [[Minnesota Legislature|Minnesota State Legislature]], advocating for a bill that would guarantee new mothers a 48-hour hospital stay. Minnesota passed the bill and President Clinton later made the policy federal law.<ref name=":0" />

Klobuchar was first a candidate for public office in 1994 when she ran for [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]] attorney. But she had pledged to drop out if the incumbent, [[Michael O. Freeman|Michael Freeman]], got back in the race after failing to win the endorsement of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) Party for governor. Klobuchar quit the race in June 1994 and supported Freeman for reelection.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuTCBwAAQBAJ&q=mike+freeman+amy+klobuchar+1994&pg=PA115 |title=The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland |author= Amy Klobuchar |via=Books.google.com |year= 2015 |access-date=December 14, 2018|isbn=978-1627794183 }}</ref> Before running for office, Klobuchar was active in supporting DFL candidates, including Freeman in 1990. The county attorney election is nonpartisan, but Freeman, like Klobuchar, is a Democrat.

Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998 (Freeman declined to run for another term) and was reelected in 2002 with no opposition.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/rachel-maddow-show/2015-09-01 | title=The Rachel Maddow Show| date=September 1, 2015 | work=MSNBC | access-date=May 14, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115001249/http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/rachel-maddow-show/2015-09-01 | archive-date=January 15, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=":0" /> ''Minnesota Lawyer'' named her "Attorney of the Year".<ref name="Gale">"Amy Klobuchar."

{{main|2006 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}
In early 2005, after U.S. senator [[Mark Dayton]] announced that he would not seek reelection, Klobuchar became an early favorite for the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|DFL]] nomination for the [[2006 United States Senate election in Minnesota|2006 election]]. [[EMILY's List]] endorsed her on September 29, 2005, and Klobuchar won the DFL endorsement on June 9, 2006. She gained the support of the majority of DFL state legislators in [[Minnesota]] during the primaries. A poll of DFL state delegates showed Klobuchar beating her then closest opponent, [[Patty Wetterling]], 66% to 15%. In January Wetterling dropped out of the race and endorsed Klobuchar. Former Senate candidate and prominent lawyer [[Mike Ciresi]], who was widely seen as a serious potential DFL candidate, indicated in early February that he would not enter the race; that was viewed as an important boost for Klobuchar.<ref>[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2006/02/the_friday_senate_line.html The Fix&nbsp;– The Friday Line: Can Democrats Get to 6?] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224200139/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2006/02/the_friday_senate_line.html | date=February 24, 2006 }}.

Klobuchar led in the polls throughout the campaign, and won with 58% of the vote to Kennedy's 38% and Fitzgerald's 3%, carrying all but eight of Minnesota's 87 counties. She is the first woman to be elected U.S. senator from Minnesota. ([[Muriel Humphrey]], the state's first female senator and former [[second lady of the United States]], was appointed to fill [[Hubert Humphrey|her husband]]'s unexpired term and not elected.)<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mooar|first=Brian|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/junkie/links/humphrey.htm|title=Hubert Humphrey's Widow Dies at 86|date=September 21, 1998|work=Washington Post|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref>
