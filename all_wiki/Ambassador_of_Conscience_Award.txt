The '''Ambassador of Conscience Award''' is [[Amnesty International]]'s most prestigious [[human rights]] award. It celebrates individuals and groups who have furthered the cause of human rights by showing exceptional courage standing up to injustice and who have used their talents to inspire others.
It also aims to generate debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of inspirational stories and human rights issues. The Award ceremonies are organised by [[Art for Amnesty]] on behalf of [[Amnesty International]].

The Award was conceived and created by [[Bill Shipsey]] founder of [[Art for Amnesty]] in 2003. It was inspired by a poem written by [[Seamus Heaney]] for [[Amnesty International]] in 1985. The poem, "From the Republic of Conscience" ends with the lines: 
"Their embassies he said, were everywhere 
but operated independently 
and no ambassador would ever be relieved"
