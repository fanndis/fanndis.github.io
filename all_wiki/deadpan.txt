'''Deadpan''', '''dry humour''', or '''dry-wit humour'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Rishel|first=Mary Ann|title=Writing humor|year=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0-8143-2959-4|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBsC3ItxoYQC&q=%22dry+wit%22&pg=PA166}}</ref> is the deliberate display of emotional neutrality or no emotion, commonly as a form of [[Comedy|comedic]] delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness or absurdity of the subject matter. The delivery is meant to be blunt, [[ironic]], [[laconic]], or apparently unintentional.

==Etymology==
The term ''deadpan'' first emerged as an [[adjective]] or [[adverb]] in the 1920s, as a [[compound word]] combining "dead" and "pan" (a [[slang]] term for the face). The oldest usage recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comes from ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1928), which defines the term as "playing a role with expressionless face".<ref name="oed">''Oxford English Dictionary''. [http://oed.com/view/Entry/47677 "dead-pan, adj., n., adv., and v."] Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. accessed 17 February 2012. First published in ''A Supplement to the OED I'', 1972</ref> An example of this usage is in a scene from the 1934 film ''[[The Gay Bride]]'' in which a [[gangster]] tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to "give it a dead pan" (with the emphasis on "pan"), so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about to say. The usage of deadpan as a [[verb]] ("to speak, act, or utter in a deadpan manner; to maintain a dead pan") is recorded at least as far back as 1942.<ref name="oed"/>

Early in his vaudeville days, [[Buster Keaton]] developed his deadpan expression.  Keaton realized that audiences responded better to his stony expression than when he smiled, and he carried this style into his silent film career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/deadpan-the-comedy-of-buster-keaton|title=Deadpan: the comedy of Buster Keaton|work=[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=17 April 1964|accessdate=4 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101220315/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/deadpan-the-comedy-of-buster-keaton|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=live}}</ref> The 1928 [[Vitaphone]] short film [[The Beau Brummels (film)|''The Beau Brummels'']], with [[vaudeville]] comics Al Shaw and Sam Lee, was performed entirely in deadpan.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knipfel|first1=Jim|title=Shaw and Lee: Vaudeville's Loony Futurists|url=https://www.ozy.com/performance/shaw-and-lee-vaudevilles-loony-futurists/41753/|website=OZY|accessdate=16 January 2020|date=29 May 2015}}</ref> The 1980 film ''[[Airplane!]]'' was performed almost entirely in deadpan.<ref name="MIL">{{cite news| last=Dudek| first=Duane| title=25 years and still laughing; 'Airplane!' maintains its cruising| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|accessdate=23 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430053901/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}</ref>

Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, including ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''. More recent examples are [[Andre Braugher]] as Captain Raymond Holt from the TV show ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'', [[Matthew Perry]] as [[Chandler Bing]] in ''[[Friends]]'', [[Aubrey Plaza]] as April Ludgate in ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', [[Jennette McCurdy]] as Sam Puckett in ''[[iCarly]]'', and [[Louis C.K.]] in ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. Another example is the comedy of [[Steven Wright]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=E.

Dry humor is often confused with [[highbrow]] or [[egghead]] humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words or delivery. Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and [[Context (language use)|context]]. Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny. However, the term "deadpan" itself actually refers only to the method of delivery.
