After the [[September 11 attacks]], O'Reilly accused the [[United Way of America]] and [[American Red Cross]] of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks. He reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims.

On a September 2007 edition of ''[[The Radio Factor]]'', while having a discussion about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author [[Juan Williams]] about a meal he shared with [[Al Sharpton]], O'Reilly said "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything.

I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." He commented that no one in Sylvia's was "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" He further added, "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the [[Jesse Jackson|Jacksons]] and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture.

== Disputed claims ==
===George de Mohrenschildt claim===
In his bestselling 2013 book ''[[Killing Kennedy]]'' and on ''Fox and Friends'', O'Reilly claimed he was knocking at the front door of [[George de Mohrenschildt]]'s daughter's home at the moment Mohrenschildt committed suicide and that he heard the shotgun blast:

<blockquote>In March of 1977, a young television reporter at WFAA in Dallas began looking into the [[Kennedy assassination]]. As part of his reporting, he sought an interview with the shadowy Russian professor who had befriended the Oswalds upon their arrival in Dallas in 1962. The reporter traced George de Mohrenschildt to Palm Beach, Florida and traveled there to confront him. At the time de Mohrenschildt had been called to testify before a congressional committee looking into the events of November 1963. As the reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt's daughter's home, he heard the shotgun blast [Emphasis added]{{clarify|date=September 2018}} that marked the suicide of the Russian, assuring that his relationship with [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] would never be fully understood.

By the way, that reporter's name is Bill O'Reilly.</blockquote>

This claim has been disproven by former ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' editor Jefferson Morley, who cites audio recordings made by [[Gaeton Fonzi]] indicating O'Reilly was not present in Florida on the day of Mohrenschildt's suicide.<ref name="jfkf_JFKf">{{cite web|title=JFKfacts » Investigator's tape exposes Bill O'Reilly's JFK fib |first=Jeff |last=Morley |work=JFK Facts |date=January 30, 2013 |access-date=March 10, 2015 |url=http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/news/reporters-tape-exposes-bill-oreillys-jfk-fib/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311051029/http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/news/reporters-tape-exposes-bill-oreillys-jfk-fib/ |archive-date=March 11, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="mone_Bill">{{cite web | title = Bill O'Reilly faces new questions: His JFK story | last = Kludt | first = Tom | work = [[CNNMoney]] | date = February 25, 2015 | access-date = March 10, 2015 | url = https://money.cnn.com/2015/02/25/media/bill-oreilly-jfk-george-de-mohrenschildt/ }}</ref>

===War coverage claims===
On February 19, 2015, [[David Corn]] from ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' broke a story reporting a collection of inconsistencies of O'Reilly when recalling his experience covering the 1982 [[Falklands War]].<ref name="motherjones1" /> On April 17, 2013, O'Reilly said on his show: "I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, (...)".<ref>{{cite episode |series=The O'Reilly Factor | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly |network=Fox News | date=April 17, 2013}}</ref> In his book, ''The No Spin Zone'', he wrote: "You know that I am not easily shocked.

I wrote about this in my novel ''Those who Trespass''."}}</ref>

During an interview with [[Blaze Media|TheBlaze]] television network, O'Reilly said: "And if that moron [Corn] doesn't think it was a war zone in Buenos Aires, then he's even dumber than I think he is."<ref>{{Cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Tom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/20/bill-oreilly-falkland-islands-war-exaggeration-accusations-mother-jones|title=Bill O'Reilly calls accusations of exaggerated war reporting 'total bullshit'|date=February 20, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|access-date=February 11, 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> This characterization by O'Reilly was disputed by former CBS colleague [[Eric Engberg]] who was in Buenos Aires at the time and challenged his (O'Reilly's) description of the riot as a "combat situation."

The video appears to show riot police firing tear gas and plastic bullets toward the crowd; additionally, former NBC bureau chief [[Don Browne]] referred to the riot as an "intense situation" with many people hurt and [[tank]]s in the streets of Buenos Aires.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/02/24/cbs-news-releases-video-falklands-war-riots/ |title= CBS News releases video of the Falklands War riots |website=[[Fox News Channel]]|access-date= March 7, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150301030121/http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/02/24/cbs-news-releases-video-falklands-war-riots/ |archive-date= March 1, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

The fallout from the coverage generated by the questioning of O'Reilly's reporting during the Falklands War led to questions of claims made by O'Reilly while in El Salvador and Northern Ireland. In his 2013 book, ''Keep it Pithy'', O'Reilly wrote: "I've seen soldiers gun down unarmed civilians in Latin America, Irish terrorists kill and maim their fellow citizens in Belfast with bombs." In a 2005 radio program O'Reilly said he had "seen guys gun down nuns in El Salvador" and in 2012, on ''The O’Reilly Factor'', said "I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head." O'Reilly and Fox News clarified that he had not been an eyewitness to any of those events but had just seen photographs of the murdered nuns and Irish bombings.<ref>{{cite news|first=Husna|last=Haq|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Buzz/2015/0302/Bill-O-Reilly-lied-says-Fox-News-Why-that-won-t-hurt-him-at-Fox|title= Bill O'Reilly lied, says Fox News: Why that won't hurt him at Fox|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|publisher=[[Christian Science Publishing Society]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=March 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Farhi|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/is-bill-oreilly-making-things-up-or-just-bloviating/2015/02/27/bd5e7f66-bea4-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html|title= Bill O'Reilly cites conflicts that he witnessed.

==Sexual harassment lawsuits {{anchor|Sexual harassment lawsuit}}==
On October 13, 2004, O'Reilly sued Andrea Mackris, a former producer for ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', alleging extortion. O'Reilly claimed that Mackris had threatened a lawsuit unless he paid her more than $60&nbsp;million. Later the same day, Mackris sued O'Reilly for [[sexual harassment]], seeking $60&nbsp;million in damages.<ref name=Mackris_complaint>{{cite web  |url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/oreilly-hit-sex-harass-suit |title = O'Reilly Sex Harassment Suit: Andrea Mackris 22 page complaint filed with the New York Supreme Court.

After Fox News executive [[Roger Ailes]] was the subject of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former Fox News coworker [[Gretchen Carlson]], O'Reilly said in July 2016, that Ailes was a "target" as a "famous, powerful or wealthy person" and called him the "best boss I ever had."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/14/bill-o-reilly-defends-roger-ailes-from-gretchen-carlson-suit-i-stand-by-roger-100-percent.html|title=Bill O'Reilly Defends Roger Ailes from Gretchen Carlson Suit: 'I Stand by Roger 100 Percent'|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|date=July 14, 2016|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref> After Ailes was fired and the network settled the lawsuit with Carlson, O'Reilly declined to comment further, saying that "for once in my life, I'm going to keep my big mouth shut."<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Weprin|url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/09/bill-oreilly-on-roger-ailes-for-once-in-my-life-im-going-to-keep-my-big-mouth-shut-004759|title=Bill O'Reilly on Roger Ailes: 'For once in my life I'm going to keep my big mouth shut'|website=Politico|access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref>

Shortly after Ailes was fired, Fox News settled a sexual harassment claim against O'Reilly with former Fox host [[Juliet Huddy]]. Huddy alleged that O'Reilly pursued a romantic relationship with her, and made lewd remarks. Legal fees in this case were settled and paid for by Fox News.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Steel|first1=Emily|title=Fox News Settled Sexual Harassment Allegations Against Bill O'Reilly, Documents Show|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news-juliet-huddy.html|date=January 10, 2017|work=The New York Times}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported the settlement to have been worth $1.6 million.<ref name="nyt-settlements"/> In August 2016, former Fox host [[Andrea Tantaros]] filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News, claiming that O'Reilly made sexually suggestive comments to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/08/23/andrea-tantaros-fox-news-scott-brown-harassment-outnumbered/|title=Ex-Fox News Host Says Scott Brown Put His Hands On Her, Made Sexually Suggestive Comments|publisher=CBS News|date=August 23, 2016|access-date=August 23, 2016}}</ref> Judge [[George B.
