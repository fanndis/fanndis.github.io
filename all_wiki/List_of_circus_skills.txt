'''Circus skills''' are a group of disciplines that have been performed as entertainment in [[circus]], [[sideshow]], [[Street performance|busking]], or [[variety show|variety]], [[vaudeville]] or [[music hall]] shows. Most circus skills are still being performed today. Many are also practiced by non-performers as a hobby.

[[Circus school]]s and instructors use various systems of categorization to group circus skills by type. Systems that have attempted to formally organize circus skills into pragmatic teaching groupings include the Gurevich system<ref>"The Classification of Circus Techniques" by Hovey Burgess. ''The Drama Review'': TDR, Vol. 18, No. 1, Popular Entertainments (Mar., 1974), pp. 65-70. doi:10.2307/1144863.</ref> (the basis of the Russian Circus School's curriculum) and the Hovey Burgess system.
