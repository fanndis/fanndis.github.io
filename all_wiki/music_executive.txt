Although music executives work in senior management, a number of music executives have gone on to establish their own record labels as owners themselves, sometimes being involved in the music industry initially as artists, A&Rs, or producers for a number of years and building a strong reputation.

Music executives work in a variety of settings for major record labels such as [[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]], or [[Warner Music Group]]. However, many choose to work with, or start their own [[independent record labels]] such as [[Sub Pop]], [[Block Starz Music]], [[Ironworks (record label)|Ironworks]], [[Jagjaguwar]], [[Perry Music Group]], and [[419 Records]].
