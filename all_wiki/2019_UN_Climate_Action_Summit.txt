Sixty countries were expected to "announce steps to reduce emissions and support populations most vulnerable to the climate crisis" including [[France]], a number of other European countries, small island countries and [[India]].<ref>{{cite news |author-last=Rosane |author-first=Olivia |title=What to Expect From Today's UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/climate-action-summit-2019-2640522348.html |access-date=23 September 2019 |website=Ecowatch |date=23 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923145525/https://www.ecowatch.com/climate-action-summit-2019-2640522348.html |archive-date=23 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> To increase pressure on political and economic actors to achieve the aims of the summit, a [[September 2019 climate strikes|global climate strike]] was held around the world on 20 September with over four million participants.<ref name="Vox 350">{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/20/20876143/climate-strike-2019-september-20-crowd-estimate |title=How big was the global climate strike? 4 million people, activists estimate. |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |author-last1=Barclay |author-first1=Eliza |author-last2=Resnick |author-first2=Brian |access-date=21 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921012020/https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/20/20876143/climate-strike-2019-september-20-crowd-estimate |archive-date=21 September 2019 |url-status=live |date=20 September 2019}}</ref>

== Results ==
The results of the summit were significant though it is believed that they were not enough to limit the rise of global temperature to less than 1.5 degrees as needed to address the climate crisis. China did not increase its Paris agreement commitments, India did not pledge to reduce its use of coal, and the U.S. did not even speak at the conference.<ref name="Rosane-20190924">{{cite news |author-last=Rosane |author-first=Olivia |title=UN Climate Action Summit Falls 'Woefully Short' of Expectations |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/un-climate-action-summit-2640575796.html |access-date=25 September 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=24 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925160854/https://www.ecowatch.com/un-climate-action-summit-2640575796.html |archive-date=25 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, important commitments were made in many areas and the organizers declared that: "Summit initiatives were designed to ensure the actions undertaken would be fair for all, supporting jobs and clear air for better health, and protect the most vulnerable, as well as new initiatives on adaptation, agriculture and early warning systems that will protect 500 million additional people against the impacts of climate change."<ref name="Rosane-20190924"/>

On the web, a page called "Announcements" contained press releases about the results of the summit.<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcements |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/announcements.shtml |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |publisher=United Nations |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006112348/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/announcements.shtml |archive-date=6 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Press releases with information about the issue were also published in September 2019, in the section "Press Materials"<ref>{{cite web |title=Press Materials |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/press-materials.shtml |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923214659/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/press-materials.shtml |archive-date=23 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The information is also stored in the UN portal of climate action "NAZCA"<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Action Summit 2019 |url=https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |website=Global Climate Action NAZCA |publisher=United Nations |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017025150/https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |archive-date=17 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Governmental commitments ===
* Sixty-five countries and the [[European Union]] pledged to cut [[Greenhouse gas emission]] to zero by the year 2050.<ref>{{cite web |title=About the summit |url=https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |website=Global Climate Action NAZCA |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924050932/https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The number of countries making this pledge reached 77.<ref>{{cite web |author-last=Kosolapova |author-first=Elena |title=77 Countries, 100+ Cities Commit to Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 at Climate Summit |url=https://sdg.iisd.org/news/77-countries-100-cities-commit-to-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-at-climate-summit/ |website=SDG Knowledge Hub |publisher=IISD |access-date=8 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005131913/https://sdg.iisd.org/news/77-countries-100-cities-commit-to-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-at-climate-summit/ |archive-date=5 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
* Many small countries, including [[Small Island Developing States]] and [[Least Developed Countries]] were among the states who made the biggest steps. The [[Small Island Developing States]] collectively increased their climate targets by 2020, achieve 100% of energy from renewables sources by 2030, and achieve a zero carbon economy by 2050, provided they are helped by the international community.
* [[France]] pledged to not enter into trade deals with countries that have policies contrary to the [[Paris Agreement]].
* [[Greece]] and [[Hungary]] pledged to close their coal-fired power plants by 2028 and 2030, respectively.
* The Global Campaign for Nature begun to function. The target of the campaign is protect 30% of the earth surface by the year 2030. [[Guatemala]] and [[Costa Rica]] are leading this initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the face of worsening climate crisis, UN Summit to deliver new pathways and practical actions to shift global response into higher gear |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002095940/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Political and financial support for new efforts to scale up use of nature-based solutions to be announced at Climate Action Summit |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_nature_based_solutions.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006112357/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_nature_based_solutions.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
* The Climate Ambition Alliance was created. The president of the alliance is the president of [[Chile]], Sebastián Piñera. The alliance want to unite the countries that want to increase their commitments by the year 2020. Fifty-nine countries said that they will do so. Eleven countries have begun the process of boosting their commitments.
* The [[Powering Past Coal Alliance]] became much bigger: after the summit, 32 countries, 25 states and regions, and 34 corporations are members of the alliance that wants to stop building coal power plants by the year 2020 and make transition to renewable energy.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-summit/factbox-12-global-initiatives-to-beat-back-climate-threats-idUKL5N26E5P0 |title=FACTBOX-12 global initiatives to beat back climate threats |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=23 September 2019}}</ref>
* The organization "High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy" was created. It include 14 countries, covering a large part of the world coasts and fisheries. It seeks to protect the oceans and create marine protected areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the face of worsening climate crisis, UN Summit to deliver new pathways and practical actions to shift global response into higher gear |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002095940/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
* The [[European Union]] promised to give a quarter of its budget to climate action in the next year.
* [[China]] announced, that it will go through "high quality growth and low-carbon development". China created a partnership with a target of removing 12 billion tons from the annual global [[Greenhouse gas emission]] by natural solutions.
* [[India]] promised to bring their renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts by the 2022 and to 450 gigawatts after.
* Eighty countries joined the [[International Solar Alliance]].
* The [[Russian Federation]] pledged to ratify the [[Paris Agreement]], increasing the number of signatories to 187. The agreement was ratified by Russia's Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev. Russia is the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG). The targets for Russia in the agreement are reducing the emissions by 30% from the level of 1990 by the year 2030. The emissions of Russia in 2017 were already 32% lower than in 1990, so in fact the pledge does not decrease them. But as Russia has a growing economy relying primarily on fossil fuels, this will have some effects. Russian forests also play a role in removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news |author-last=Sauer |author-first=Natalie |title=Russia formally joins Paris climate agreement |url=https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/09/23/russia-formally-joins-paris-climate-agreement/ |access-date=10 October 2019 |agency=Climate Home News |date=23 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924144037/https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/09/23/russia-formally-joins-paris-climate-agreement/ |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author-last=Luhn |author-first=Alec |title=Russia ratifies Paris climate accord - but targets are 'critically insufficient' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/23/russia-ratifies-paris-climate-accord-targets-critically-insufficient/ |access-date=10 October 2019 |newspaper=[[The Telegraph (newspaper)|The Telegraph]] |date=23 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010093706/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/23/russia-ratifies-paris-climate-accord-targets-critically-insufficient/ |archive-date=10 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author-last=Teslova |author-first=Elena |title=Russia joins Paris agreement on climate change |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/russia-joins-paris-agreement-on-climate-change/1591771# |access-date=10 October 2019 |agency=[[Anadolu Agency]] |date=23 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004024244/https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/russia-joins-paris-agreement-on-climate-change/1591771 |archive-date=4 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

* The "Nature-Based Solutions Coalition", composed of more than 40 countries, 150 organizations, 50 private companies, and 12 foundations, led by [[China]] and [[New Zealand]], made important commitments:
* The [[Central African Forest Initiative]] pledged to save the forest in central Africa, the second largest tropical forest on Earth, preventing the release to the atmosphere of 70 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>, and protecting the livelihoods of 60 million people.
* [[Pakistan]] pledged to restore parts of its degraded ecosystems: 30% of forests, 5% of croplands, 6% of grasslands and 10% of wetlands, what will make it [[land degradation]] neutral by 2030.
* [[El Salvador]] committed to protect 10 million [[hectare]]s of forest and change the food sector, so that GHG emissions from it will be 40% lower by 2030.<ref>{{cite web |title=Political and financial support for new efforts to scale up use of nature-based solutions to be announced at Climate Action Summit |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_nature_based_solutions.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006112357/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_nature_based_solutions.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Cities commitments ===
* One hundred and two cities pledged reduce greenhouse gas emission to zero by 2050.<ref>{{cite web |title=About the summit |url=https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |website=Global Climate Action NAZCA |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924050932/https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
* The initiative "Action Toward Climate Friendly Transport" (ACT) was created. It wants to plan cities in a way that will minimize the need for transport, advancing non-motorized transport and decreasing emissions.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the face of worsening climate crisis, UN Summit to deliver new pathways and practical actions to shift global response into higher gear |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002095940/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Over 100 organizations are members of this group including governments, cities, and companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Action Summit yields plans to increase financing for green, livable cities, and to promote sustainable infrastructure, transport |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_cities_local_action.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=2 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924023332/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_cities_local_action.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
* The initiative "Zero Carbon Building For All" pledged that by the year 2030 all new buildings will be "zero carbon". By the year 2050 all existing building will be so. Over 100 organizations are members of this group including governments, cities, and companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the face of worsening climate crisis, UN Summit to deliver new pathways and practical actions to shift global response into higher gear |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002095940/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Private sector commitments ===
* Eighty-seven companies and 15 investors pledged to reach zero carbon economy by the year 2050.<ref>{{cite web |title=About the summit |url=https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |website=Global Climate Action NAZCA |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924050932/https://climateaction.unfccc.int/views/events.html |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

* Companies with a capitalisation of US$2.3 trillion united in an organization named "[[United Nations Global Compact|UN Global Compact]]" to commit to manage their businesses to achieve climate targets.
* An organization of investors, the "Asset Owner Alliance", with US$2 trillion in capital, said that by 2050 it will move to carbon-free investments.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the face of worsening climate crisis, UN Summit to deliver new pathways and practical actions to shift global response into higher gear |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002095940/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
* A platform to advance financial tools that can protect the oceans was created by the head of [[Axa]]. It is called ORRAA.<ref>{{cite web |title=Political and financial support for new efforts to scale up use of nature-based solutions to be announced at Climate Action Summit |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_nature_based_solutions.pdf |website=Climate Action Summit 2019 |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006112357/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/release_nature_based_solutions.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== What was not achieved ===
The commitments of the summit are not enough to limit the rise of global temperature to less than 1.5 degrees, as needed to address the climate crisis. [[António Guterres]], the Secretary General of the UN, said at the close of the summit: "Much more is needed to reach [[carbon neutrality]] by 2050 and keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century."<ref>{{cite web |title=Secretary-General's remarks at closing of Climate Action Summit [as delivered] |url=https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2019-09-23/secretary-generals-remarks-closing-of-climate-action-summit-delivered |website=United Nations Secretary-General |access-date=3 October 2019 |date=23 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008100125/https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2019-09-23/secretary-generals-remarks-closing-of-climate-action-summit-delivered |archive-date=8 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Andrew Steer, the president of the [[World Resources Institute]], said that: "most of the major economies fell woefully short" of increasing their targets. Those who promise to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 are unsure how to do it.<ref>{{cite news |author-last=Farand |author-first=Chloé |title=The UN asked for climate plans.

Some points are especially troubling:
* [[China]] did not increase its [[Paris agreement]] commitments
* [[India]] did not pledge to reduce its use of coal
* The [[U.S.]] did not speak at the conference
* A prohibition of new coal plants by the year 2020 was not achieved. They are "a looming threat to us all" according to the UN Secretary-General.<ref name="Rosane-20190924"/>

[[Voyage of Greta Thunberg|In mid-August 2019]], climate activist [[Greta Thunberg]] sailed from [[Plymouth]] to the United States to participate in the UN Climate Action Summit.<ref name="Independent 2019"/> Speaking on 23 September, Thunberg  opened her statement to the General Assembly with an impassioned and emotional commentary which was widely covered by the media.<ref>{{cite news |author-last=Thunberg |author-first=Greta |author-link=Greta Thunberg |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg |title=If world leaders choose to fail us, my generation will never forgive them |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |language=en |date=23 September 2019 |access-date=23 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923160144/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg |archive-date=23 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
<blockquote>"This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg |title=If world leaders choose to fail us, my generation will never forgive them |author-last=Thunberg |author-first=Greta |author-link=Greta Thunberg |date=23 September 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=23 September 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923160144/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg |archive-date=23 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

At her appearance, Thunberg announced that she and 15 other children
including [[Alexandria Villaseñor]], [[Catarina Lorenzo]], and Carl Smith were filing a lawsuit against five nations that are not on track to meet the emission reduction targets they committed to in their [[Paris Agreement]] pledges: Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey. The lawsuit is challenging the nations under the UN's [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (specifically the right to life, health, and peace). If the complaint is successful, the countries will be asked to respond, but any suggestions aren’t legally binding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earther.gizmodo.com/its-kids-vs-the-world-in-a-landmark-new-climate-lawsui-1838343565 |title=It's Kids vs. the World in a Landmark New Climate Lawsuit |first=Brian |last=Kahn |date=23 September 2019 |access-date=23 September 2019 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923170617/https://earther.gizmodo.com/its-kids-vs-the-world-in-a-landmark-new-climate-lawsui-1838343565 |archive-date=23 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/greta-thunberg-leads-young-people-in-climate-complaint-to-un |title=Greta Thunberg Leads Young People in Climate Complaint to UN |date=23 September 2019 |access-date=23 September 2019 |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924041649/https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/greta-thunberg-leads-young-people-in-climate-complaint-to-un?utm_medium=ehsdesk&utm_campaign=530399D8-DE13-11E9-B270-A91350017A06&utm_source=twitter |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Following her appearance, US President Donald Trump, who had attended the meeting for 10 minutes and then left, tweeted a video of her opening remarks in which she is obviously emotionally distressed and commented, "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"<ref>{{cite news |title='She seems very happy': Trump appears to mock Greta Thunberg's emotional speech |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/she-seems-very-happy-trump-appears-to-mock-greta-thunbergs-emotional-speech |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=24 September 2019 |date=24 September 2019 |author-last=Lyons |author-first=Kate |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924070220/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/she-seems-very-happy-trump-appears-to-mock-greta-thunbergs-emotional-speech |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
