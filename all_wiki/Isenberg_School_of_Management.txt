==History==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2020}}
[[File:IsenbergSchoolExternal.jpg|thumb|right|The Isenberg School of Management building on the University of Massachusetts Amherst campus.]]
[[File:Isenberg Students.tif|thumb|right|Students at the Isenberg School.]]
Business courses were first offered at the Massachusetts Agricultural College in the early years of the 20th century, expanding rapidly during the 1930s and 1940s in response to student demand. The college's board of trustees established the School of Business Administration in 1947, and within seven years, it was conferring graduate degrees, including doctorates after 1967. The school was accredited at the undergraduate level by the [[AACSB|Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] in May 1958, and in March 1959, the board of trustees authorized the establishment of four academic departments within the school: Accounting, General Business and Finance, Management, and Marketing. In September 1967, a program leading to the degree of PhD in Business Administration was introduced.

In 1964, the school moved to its current building in the heart of the UMass Amherst campus.<ref name="BIG">{{cite news|url=https://www.archpaper.com/2019/07/bigs-copper-and-glass-clad-isenberg-school-expansion-falls-into-place/#gallery-0-slide-0 |title=BIG's copper-and-glass-clad Isenberg School Expansion falls into place |first= Matthew |last=Marani |work=[[The Architect's Newspaper]] |date=July 31, 2019 |accessdate=July 29, 2020}}</ref> In 1983, the School of Business Administration changed its name to School of Management. In 1998 the Isenberg School of Management was named after Eugene Isenberg,<ref name="Isenberg name direction">{{cite web|title=UMass business school gets new name, direction|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/1999/01/04/story4.html|publisher=[[Boston Business Journal]]|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref> the chairman and CEO of [[Nabors Industries]],<ref name="Isenberg Nabors">{{cite web|title=A Very Rich Adieu for Nabors CEO|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204528204577007932167790556|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref> which at the time was a world leader in gas and petroleum drilling. Isenberg's gift was the largest contribution from an individual in UMass Amherst's history, and facilitated the school's campaign to build its 42,000-square-foot Harold Alfond Management Center addition, and established several endowed chairs for the campus.
