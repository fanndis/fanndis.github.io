Quibi's app fell out of the list of the 50 most downloaded free iPhone apps in the United States a week after it was released.

Sensor Tower also said the app had been installed by 2.9 million customers, although Quibi says the figure was closer to 3.5 million. Of those who had installed the app, Quibi says 1.3 million were active users.

So, out of respect for these people that put up this extraordinary amount of capital to do it, that's irresponsible and we both felt we shouldn't do it." In the interview, Katzenberg also cited the unfortunate timing of the launch during the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]] as a contributing factor.<ref name="deadlineshutdown"/> At the time of the announcement, Quibi had approximately 500,000 subscribers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A look at why Quibi failed so soon after launching|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/look-why-quibi-failed-so-soon-after-launching-n1244312|access-date=2020-10-23|website=NBC News|language=en|archive-date=October 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023111715/https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/look-why-quibi-failed-so-soon-after-launching-n1244312|url-status=live}}</ref>
