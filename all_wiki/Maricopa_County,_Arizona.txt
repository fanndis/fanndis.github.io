==Government, policing, and politics==
===Government===
The governing body of Maricopa County is its Board of Supervisors. The [[Maricopa County Board of Supervisors]] consists of five members chosen by popular vote within their own districts. Currently, the Board consists of four Republicans and one Democrat. Each member serves a four-year term, with no term limits.

===Maricopa County sheriff===
The [[Maricopa County Sheriff's Office]] provides court protection, administers the county jail, and patrols the unincorporated areas of the county plus incorporated towns by contract.

===Politics===
For much of the time after [[World War II]], Maricopa County was one of the more conservative urban counties in the United States. While the city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has leaned [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in recent years, most of the rest of the county was strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Until [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]], every Republican presidential candidate since [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] had carried Maricopa County. This includes the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] presidential run of native son [[Barry Goldwater]], who would not have carried his own state had it not been for a 21,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Until 2020, it was the largest county in the country to vote Republican. Since 1964, Democrats have held the margin within single digits only four times–in 1992, 1996, 2016, and 2020. In 2020, [[Joe Biden]] became the first Democrat in 72 years to win the county, which in turn, resulted in Arizona flipping to the Democratic column for the first time since 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/biden-wins-arizona/index.html|title=Biden carries Arizona, flipping a longtime Republican stronghold|author=Merica, Dan|date=November 13, 2020|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 13, 2020|quote=The Democratic victory -- declared days after CNN projected Biden's win in the presidential race -- was anchored by Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and nearly 60% of all people in the state. Maricopa is the fastest-growing county in the country, transforming over the last two decades into a sprawling mass of metropolitan hubs, sun-scorched planned communities and bustling strip malls.}}</ref> Furthermore, Biden became the first presidential candidate to win more than one million votes in the county. This makes Maricopa County the third county in American history to cast more than one million votes for a presidential candidate.

Despite its political leanings at the time, Maricopa County voted against Proposition 107 in the 2006 election. This referendum, designed to ban gay marriage and restrict domestic partner benefits, was rejected by a  51.6–48.4% margin within the county, and statewide by a similar margin. Two years later, however, a majority of county residents voted to pass a successful state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The amendment was later invalidated by the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', which declared that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right in the United States.

Unlike cities and towns in Arizona, counties are politically and legally subordinate to the state and do not have charters of their own. The county Board of Supervisors acts under powers delegated by state law, mainly related to minor ordinances and revenue collection. With few exceptions, these powers are narrowly construed. The state legislature devotes considerable time to local matters, with legislative approval required for many routine local issues. The chairperson of the board presides for a one year term, selected by the board members during a public hearing.

The County Sheriff, County Attorney, County Assessor, County Treasurer, Superintendent of Schools, County Recorder, Constables, Justices of the Peace, and Clerk of the Superior Court are elected by the people. Retention of Superior Court Judges is also determined by popular vote.

The county's dominant political figure for over two decades (from 1993 to 2017) was Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]], who called himself "America's Toughest Sheriff" and gained national notoriety for his flamboyant and often controversial practices and policies.<ref>[http://www.mcso.org/index.php?a=GetModule&mn=Sheriff_Bio Joseph M. Arpaio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612192118/http://mcso.org/index.php?a=GetModule&mn=Sheriff_Bio |date=June 12, 2010 }}, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, 2005. Retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>

Maricopa County is home to 62 percent of the state's population, thus dominating Arizona's politics. For example, in the [[2018 United States Senate election in Arizona|2018 Senate election]], Democrat [[Kyrsten Sinema]] carried the county en route to becoming the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Arizona since 1988.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/us/kyrsten-sinema-senate-arizona.html | title=How Kyrsten Sinema Won Her Senate Seat and Pulled Off a Historic Arizona Triumph | last=Romero | first=Simon | date=2018-11-13 | work=The New York Times | access-date=2019-08-01 | language=en-US | issn=0362-4331}}</ref> She won the county by over 60,000 votes, more than enough for the victory; she won statewide by 55,900 votes.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/results/arizona/senate | title=2018 Arizona Senate election results | publisher=CNN}}</ref> All but one of the state's nine congressional districts include part of the county, and five of the districts have their population center located there. Most of the state's prominent elected officials live in the county. Further underlining Maricopa County's political dominance, Biden's margin of 45,109 votes was more than enough to carry the state; he only won Arizona by 10,457 votes.
