'''Ohio''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Ohio.ogg|oʊ|ˈ|h|aɪ|oʊ}} is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[East North Central states|East North Central]] region of the [[Midwestern United States]]. Of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|fifty states]], it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|34th-largest by area]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|seventh-most populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|tenth-most densely populated]]. The state's capital and [[List of cities in Ohio|largest city]] is [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], with the [[Columbus metropolitan area, Ohio|Columbus metro area]], [[Greater Cincinnati]], and [[Greater Cleveland]] being the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|largest metropolitan areas]]. Ohio is bordered by [[Lake Erie]] to the north, [[Pennsylvania]] to the east, [[West Virginia]] to the southeast, [[Kentucky]] to the southwest, [[Indiana]] to the west, and [[Michigan]] to the northwest.

The state takes its name from the [[Ohio River]], whose name in turn originated from the [[Seneca language|Seneca]] word '' ohiːyo{{'}}'', meaning "good river", "great river", or "large creek".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/ohio_quick_facts.php |title=Quick Facts About the State of Ohio |publisher=Ohio History Central |access-date=July 2, 2010 |quote=From Iroquois word meaning 'great river' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127153916/http://ohiohistorycentral.org/ohio_quick_facts.php |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="mithun312">{{cite book |first=Marianne |last=Mithun |year=1999 |chapter=Borrowing |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALnf3s2m7PkC&pg=PA311 |pages=311–3 |title=The Languages of Native North America |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-29875-9 |quote=Ohio ('large creek')}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanindianstudies.osu.edu/ohio.cfm |title=Native Ohio |access-date=February 25, 2007 |website=American Indian Studies |publisher=[[Ohio State University]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202230727/http://americanindianstudies.osu.edu/ohio.cfm<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = February 2, 2007 |quote=Ohio comes from the Seneca (Iroquoian) ohiiyo' 'good river'}}</ref> Partitioned from the [[Northwest Territory]], Ohio was the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the [[Northwest Ordinance]].<ref name="MS">{{cite book|author=Mary Stockwell|title=Ohio Adventure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJKroULBUpgC|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-4236-2382-3|page=88|year=2006|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331200155/http://books.google.com/books?id=VJKroULBUpgC|archive-date=March 31, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="WD">{{cite book|author=William M.

Ohio rose from the land west of Appalachia in colonial times through the [[Northwest Indian War]]s as part of the Northwest Territory in the early frontier, to become the first non-colonial ''free'' state admitted to the union, to an industrial powerhouse in the 20th century before transitioning to a more information and service based economy in the 21st.

The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch, led by the [[List of Governors of Ohio|governor]]; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral [[Ohio General Assembly]]; and the judicial branch, led by the state [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Supreme Court]].

Ohio's geographic location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. Because Ohio links the Northeast to the Midwest, much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways. Ohio has the nation's 10th largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America's population and 70% of North America's manufacturing capacity.<ref>{{Cite journal | archive-date = January 24, 2008 | url = http://www.dot.state.oh.us/budget/Feb12-03/TransDelivers2-12.asp | place = Ohio | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080124091721/http://www.dot.state.oh.us/budget/Feb12-03/TransDelivers2-12.asp | date = February 12, 2003 | title = Transportation delivers for Ohio | publisher = Department of Transportation | access-date = December 22, 2005}}</ref> To the north, [[Lake Erie]] gives Ohio {{convert|312|mi|km}} of coastline,<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.ohiodnr.com/Home/about/counties/tabid/18020/Default.aspx | title = Ohio Coastal Counties | publisher = Department of Natural Resources | place = Ohio | access-date = September 3, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080830020758/http://ohiodnr.com/Home/about/counties/tabid/18020/Default.aspx | archive-date = August 30, 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref> which allows for numerous cargo ports. Ohio's southern border is defined by the [[Ohio River]] (with the border being at the 1792 low-water mark on the north side of the river),<ref name="Ohio_v_Kentucky"/> and much of the northern border is defined by Lake Erie. Ohio's neighbors are [[Pennsylvania]] to the east, [[Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Lake Erie]] to the north, [[Indiana]] to the west, [[Kentucky]] on the south, and [[West Virginia]] on the southeast. Ohio's borders were defined by [[metes and bounds]] in the [[Enabling Act of 1802]] as follows:
{{quote |Bounded on the east by the Pennsylvania line, on the south by the Ohio River, to the mouth of the [[Great Miami River]], on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami aforesaid, and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of [[Lake Michigan]], running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid, from the mouth of the Great Miami until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line, and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid.}}

Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly all of the river itself belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia. In 1980, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that, based on the wording of the cessation of territory by [[Virginia]] (which at the time included what is now Kentucky and West Virginia), the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky (and, by implication, West Virginia) is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792.<ref name="Ohio_v_Kentucky">{{Cite journal | url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=444&invol=335 | publisher = Find law | title = Ohio v.

The border with Michigan has also changed, as a result of the [[Toledo War]], to angle slightly northeast to the north shore of the mouth of the Maumee River.

Much of Ohio features [[Glacial till plains (Ohio)|glaciated till plains]], with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the [[Great Black Swamp]]. This glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the [[glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], and then by another belt known as the [[unglaciated Allegheny Plateau]]. Most of Ohio is of low relief, but the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau [[Appalachian Ohio|features rugged hills and forests]].

The rugged southeastern quadrant of Ohio, stretching in an outward bow-like arc along the Ohio River from the West [[Northern Panhandle of West Virginia|Virginia Panhandle]] to the outskirts of Cincinnati, forms a distinct [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] unit. Geologically similar to parts of West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, this area's coal mining legacy, dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments, and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of the state.

Significant [[List of rivers of Ohio|rivers]] within the state include the [[Cuyahoga River]], [[Great Miami River]], [[Maumee River]], [[Muskingum River]], and [[Scioto River]]. The rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the northern Atlantic Ocean via [[Lake Erie]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]], and the rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Ohio River]] and then the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].

The worst weather disaster in Ohio history occurred along the Great Miami River in 1913. Known as the [[Great Dayton Flood]], the entire [[Great Miami River|Miami River]] watershed flooded, including the downtown business district of [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]. As a result, the [[Miami Conservancy District]] was created as the first major flood plain engineering project in Ohio and the United States.<ref name="MCDAct">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiconservancy.org/about/conservancy.asp|title=The History of the MCD: The Conservancy Act|access-date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Miami Conservancy District|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314003325/http://www.miamiconservancy.org/about/conservancy.asp|archive-date=March 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[Grand Lake St. Marys]] in the west-central part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for [[canal]]s in the canal-building era of 1820–1850. For many years this body of water, over {{convert|20|sqmi|km2}}, was the largest artificial lake in the world. [[:Category:Canals in Ohio|Ohio's canal-building projects]] were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states. Some cities, such as Dayton, owe their industrial emergence to location on canals, and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state.

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate change in Ohio}}
[[File:Ohio Köppen.svg|thumb|left|Köppen climate types in Ohio now showing majority as humid subtropical]]

The climate of Ohio is a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa/Dfb'') throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's [[Bluegrass region]] section, which are located on the northern periphery of the [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and [[Upland South]] region of the United States. Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round. Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are typically fewer [[tornado]] reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the [[Tornado Alley]]. Severe [[lake effect snow]]storms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of [[Lake Erie]], which is located in an area designated as the [[Snowbelt]].

Although predominantly not in a subtropical climate, some warmer-climate flora and fauna do reach well into Ohio. For instance, some trees with more southern ranges, such as the [[blackjack oak]], ''Quercus marilandica'', are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia ''([[Magnolia grandiflora]])'', [[Albizia julibrissin]] (mimosa), [[Crape Myrtle]], and even the occasional [[Needle Palm]] are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the [[Bluegrass region]] of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]] from [[Cincinnati]] to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's [[common wall lizard]], one of the few examples of permanent "subtropical" fauna in Ohio.

Due to flooding resulting in severely damaged highways, Governor [[Mike DeWine]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in 37 Ohio counties in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=State of Emergency in 37 Ohio Counties Declared |url=https://governor.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/governor/media/news-and-media/032019 |website=www.governor.ohio.gov |access-date=21 March 2019 |date=20 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322002420/https://governor.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/governor/media/news-and-media/032019 |archive-date=March 22, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Archeological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by [[Nomad|nomadic people]] as early as 13,000&nbsp;BC.<ref name="knepper9">Knepper (1989), p. 9.</ref> These early nomads disappeared from Ohio by 1,000&nbsp;BC.<ref name="knepper9"/> Between 1,000 and 800&nbsp;BC, the sedentary [[Adena culture]] emerged. The Adena were able to establish "semi-permanent" villages because they domesticated plants, including, [[sunflowers]], and "grew [[squash (plant)|squash]] and possibly [[maize|corn]]"; with hunting and gathering, this cultivation supported more settled, complex villages.<ref name="knepper10">Knepper (1989), p. 10.</ref> The most notable remnant of the Adena culture is the [[Great Serpent Mound]], located in [[Adams County, Ohio]].<ref name="knepper10"/>
[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|[[Iroquois]] conquests during the [[Beaver Wars]] (mid-1600s), which largely depopulated the upper and mid-[[Ohio River]] valley]]

Around 100&nbsp;BC, the Adena evolved into the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] people who were also mound builders. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] can be found in modern-day [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]], [[Newark, Ohio|Newark]], and [[Circleville, Ohio|Circleville]].<ref name="knepper11">Knepper (1989), p. 11.</ref> They were also a prolific trading society, their trading network spanning a third of the continent.<ref>Douglas T.

The [[Mississippian Culture]] rose as the Hopewell Culture declined. Many Siouan-speaking peoples from the plains and east coast claim them as ancestors and say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approximately the 13th century.<ref name="knepper13">Knepper (1989), p. 13.</ref>

There were three other cultures contemporaneous with the Mississippians: the [[Fort Ancient]] people, the [[Whittlesey Focus people]]<ref name="knepper13"/> and the [[Monongahela Culture]].<ref>"Monongahela culture-AD 1050–1635". Fort Hill Archeology. Retrieved 2010-01-14.</ref> All three cultures disappeared in the 17th century. Their origins are unknown. The Shawnees may have absorbed the Fort Ancient people.<ref name="knepper13"/> It is also possible that the Monongahela held no land in Ohio during the Colonial Era. The Mississippian Culture were close to and traded extensively with the Fort Ancient people.

Indians in the Ohio Valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the [[Iroquois Confederation]], based in central and western New York.<ref name="knepper14">Knepper (1989), p. 14.</ref> After the [[Beaver Wars]] in the mid-17th century, the Iroquois claimed much of the Ohio country as hunting and, more importantly, beaver-trapping ground. After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, which largely emptied the Ohio country of indigenous people{{dubious|date=January 2019}} by the mid-to-late 17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]. Many of these Ohio-country nations were multi-ethnic (sometimes multi-linguistic) societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease,{{clarify|reason=no disease has been mentioned yet|date=January 2019}} war, and subsequent social instability. They subsisted on agriculture ([[maize|corn]], sunflowers, [[bean]]s, etc.) supplemented by seasonal hunts. By the 18th century, they were part of a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the [[fur trade]].<ref name="roseboom20">Roseboom (1967), p. 20.</ref>

During the 18th century, the [[French colonisation of the Americas|French]] set up a system of [[trading post]]s to control the fur trade in the region. Beginning in 1754, France and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] fought the [[French and Indian War]]. As a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder of the [[Old Northwest]] to Great Britain.

===Northwest Territory===
{{Main|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory}}
[[Image:Ohio Country en.png|thumb|left|The [[Ohio Country]] indicating battle sites between American settlers and indigenous tribes, 1775–1794]]
The United States created the [[Northwest Territory]] under the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.<ref name="cayton3">Cayton (2002), p. 3.</ref> [[Slave states and free states|Slavery was not permitted]] in the new territory. Settlement began with the founding of [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] by the [[Ohio Company of Associates]], which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. Following the Ohio Company, the [[Miami Purchase|Miami Company]] (also referred to as the "[[Symmes Purchase]]") claimed the southwestern section, and the [[Connecticut Land Company]] surveyed and settled the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Northeast Ohio]]. Territorial surveyors from Fort Steuben began surveying an area of eastern Ohio called the [[Seven Ranges]] at about the same time.

The old Northwest Territory originally included areas previously known as [[Ohio Country]] and [[Illinois Country]]. As Ohio prepared for statehood, the [[Indiana Territory]] was created, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]] and the eastern tip of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called "The Gore".

The coalition of Native American tribes, known as the [[Western Confederacy]], was forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795.

Under the [[Northwest Ordinance]], areas could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached 60,000. Although Ohio's population was only 45,000 in December 1801, [[United States Congress|Congress]] determined that it was growing rapidly and had already begun the path to statehood. In regards to the [[Leni Lenape]] natives, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the [[Muskingum River]] in the present state of Ohio would "be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the [[Moravian Brethren]]&nbsp;... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity".<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774–89|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=April 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502224644/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html|archive-date=May 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Rufus Putnam, the "Father of Ohio"===
[[Rufus Putnam]] served in important capacities in both the [[French and Indian War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]].  He was one of the most highly respected men in the early years of the United States.<ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.  ''General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the "Father of Ohio,"'' pp. 1–4, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina.  {{ISBN|978-1-4766-7862-7}}.</ref>
[[File:PUTNAM exb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rufus Putnam]].  This portrait by James Sharples, Jr. is in the collection of [[Independence National Historical Park]], and hangs in the Second Bank of the United States building in Philadelphia.]]
 
In 1776, Putnam created a method of building portable fortifications, which enabled the [[Continental Army]] to drive the British from Boston.  [[George Washington]] was so impressed that he made Putnam his chief engineer.  After the war, Putnam and [[Manasseh Cutler]] were instrumental in creating the [[Northwest Ordinance]], which opened up the Northwest Territory for settlement.  This land was used to serve as compensation for what was owed to Revolutionary War veterans.  It was also at Putnam's recommendation that the land would be surveyed and laid out in townships of six miles square.  Putnam organized and led the first group of veterans to the territory.  They settled at [[Marietta, Ohio]], where they built a large fort called [[Campus Martius (Ohio)|Campus Martius]].<ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

Putnam and Cutler insisted that the Northwest Territory would be free territory – no slavery.  They were both from [[Puritan]] New England, and the Puritans strongly believed that slavery was morally wrong.  The Northwest Territory doubled the size of the United States, and establishing it as free of slavery proved to be of tremendous importance in the following decades.  It encompassed what became Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota.  Had those states been slave states, and their electoral votes gone to [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] main competitor, Lincoln would not have been elected president.  The Civil War would not have been fought.  And, even if eventually there had been a civil war, the North would probably have lost.<ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

Putnam, in the Puritan tradition, was influential in establishing education in the Northwest Territory.  Substantial amounts of land were set aside for schools.  Putnam had been one of the primary benefactors in the founding of [[Leicester Academy]] in Massachusetts, and similarly, in 1798, he created the plan for the construction of the Muskingum Academy (now [[Marietta College]]) in Ohio.  In 1780, the directors of the Ohio Company appointed him superintendent of all its affairs relating to settlement north of the Ohio River.  In 1796, he was commissioned by President George Washington as Surveyor-General of United States Lands.  In 1788, he served as a judge in the Northwest Territory's first court.  In 1802, he served in the convention to form a constitution for the State of Ohio.<ref> Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

===Statehood and settlement===
{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}
[[File:James Abram Garfield, photo portrait seated.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. president [[James A. Garfield]] was from Ohio.]]

On February 19, 1803, U.S. president [[Thomas Jefferson]] signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution.<ref>An act to provide for the due execution of the laws of the United States, within the state of Ohio, ch. 7, {{USStat|2|201}} (February 19, 1803).</ref> However, Congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812,{{disputed inline|date=September 2017}} with [[Louisiana]]'s admission as the 18th state. Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, as Ohio began preparations for celebrating its sesquicentennial, Ohio congressman [[George H. Bender]] introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the [[Ohio General Assembly]] first convened.<ref name=Blue/> At a special session at the old state capital in [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]], the Ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood which was delivered to Washington, D.C., on horseback. On August 7, 1953 (the year of Ohio's 150th anniversary), [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] signed a congressional [[joint resolution]] that officially declared March 1, 1803, the date of Ohio's admittance into the Union.<ref name=Blue>{{cite journal |last=Blue |first= Frederick J. |title=The Date of Ohio Statehood |journal=Ohio Academy of History Newsletter |date= Autumn 2002 |url=http://www2.uakron.edu/OAH/newsletter/newsletter/Autumn2002/features.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911164131/http://www2.uakron.edu/OAH/newsletter/newsletter/Autumn2002/features.html |archive-date=September 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>Joint Resolution for admitting the State of Ohio into the Union, ({{USStatute|83|204|67|407|1953|08|07}}).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/slg/explanation-ohio-statehood.phtml|title=Clearing up the Confusion surrounding OHIO's Admission to Statehood|access-date=October 30, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017120249/http://www.thegreenpapers.com/slg/explanation-ohio-statehood.phtml|archive-date=October 17, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

Ohio has had three capital cities: Chillicothe, [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]], and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved to Zanesville for two years, as part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe, which was the capital from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, to have it near the geographic center of the state.

Although many Native Americans had migrated west to evade American encroachment, others remained settled in the state, sometimes assimilating in part. In 1830 under President [[Andrew Jackson]], the US government forced [[Indian Removal]] of most tribes to the [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River.

In 1835, Ohio fought with [[Michigan]] in the [[Toledo War]], a mostly bloodless boundary war over the Toledo Strip. Only one person was injured in the conflict. Congress intervened, making Michigan's admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], in addition to the eastern third which was already considered part of the state.

===Civil War and growth===

Ohio's central position and its population gave it an important place during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads. The industry of Ohio made the state one of the most important states in the Union during the Civil war. Ohio contributed more soldiers per-capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Shiloh]], a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties.<ref name="knepper233-234">Knepper (1989), pp. 233–234.</ref> Later that year, when [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops under the leadership of [[Stonewall Jackson]] threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor [[David Tod]] still could recruit 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service.<ref name="roseboom188">Roseboom and Weisenburger (1967), p. 188.</ref> From July 12 to July 23, 1863, Southern Ohio and Indiana were attacked in [[Morgan's Raid]].

===Industrialization===
{{missing info|the Industrial Revolution, the World Wars, and the Great Depression|date=December 2018}}

In 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with [[Charles Burleigh Galbreath]] as secretary. The result reflected the concerns of the [[Progressive Era]]. It introduced the initiative and the referendum. Also, it allowed the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and [[constitutional amendment]]s originating in the Legislature. Under the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on Ohio's general election ballots every 20 years. The question asks whether a new convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, it has never been approved. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.

==Transportation==
===Ground travel===
Many major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio. One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as "Main Market Route 3", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic [[Lincoln Highway]] which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], and [[Van Wert, Ohio|Van Wert]]. The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Ohio was a major influence on the development of the state. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became [[U.S. Route 30 in Ohio|U.S. Route 30]].

Ohio also is home to {{convert|228|mi|km|0}} of the Historic [[National Road]], now [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]].

Ohio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate highways. Major east-west through routes include the [[Ohio Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 80 in Ohio|I-80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]]) in the north, [[Interstate 76 in Ohio|I-76]] through [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] to [[Pennsylvania]], [[Interstate 70 in Ohio|I-70]] through [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], and the [[Appalachian Highway (Ohio)|Appalachian Highway]] ([[Ohio State Route 32|State Route 32]]) running from [[West Virginia]] to [[Cincinnati]]. Major north–south routes include [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|I-75]] in the west through [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], Dayton, and Cincinnati, [[Interstate 71|I-71]] through the middle of the state from [[Cleveland]] through Columbus and Cincinnati into [[Kentucky]], and [[Interstate 77 in Ohio|I-77]] in the eastern part of the state from Cleveland through Akron, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]] and [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] south into West Virginia. Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton is one of the heaviest traveled sections of interstate in Ohio.

Ohio also has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes. Many of them follow [[rail trail]]s, with conversion ongoing. The [[Ohio to Erie Trail]] (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. [[U.S. Bicycle Route 50]] traverses Ohio from [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] to the Indiana state line outside [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]].<ref name="USRN USBR 50">{{cite web|title=Report to SCOH|first=Marty|last=Vitale|location=Louisville, Kentucky|publisher=Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering, [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]]|date=May 29, 2014|access-date=June 1, 2014|url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/USRN%20Report%20May%2029%202014.docx|format=Office Open XML|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105136/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/USRN%20Report%20May%2029%202014.docx|archive-date=May 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Ohio has several long-distance hiking trails, the most prominent of which is the [[Buckeye Trail]] which extends {{convert|1444|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} in a loop around the state of Ohio. Part of it is on roads and part is on wooded trail. Additionally, the [[North Country Trail]] (the longest of the eleven [[National Scenic Trail]]s authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]]) and the [[American Discovery Trail]] (a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast route across the mid-tier of the [[United States]]) pass through Ohio. Much of these two trails coincide with the Buckeye Trail.

Ohio has extensive railroads, though today most are only utilized by freight companies. Major cities in the north and south of Ohio lie on [[Amtrak]] intercity rail lines. The ''[[Capitol Limited]]'' and the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' serve Toledo, Cleveland and other northern Ohio cities. The ''[[Cardinal (train)|Cardinal]]'' serves Cincinnati. Columbus is the [[List of major cities in U.S. lacking inter-city rail service|largest city in the United States]] without any form of passenger rail. Its [[Union Station (Columbus, Ohio)|Union Station]] last had an inter-city train in 1979 with the ''[[National Limited (Amtrak train)|National Limited]].'' Mass transit exists in many forms in Ohio cities, primarily through bus systems, though Cleveland has light and heavy rail through the [[GCRTA]], and Cincinnati reestablished a [[Cincinnati Bell Connector|streetcar line]] in 2016.

===Air travel===

{{See also|List of airports in Ohio}}

Ohio has four international airports, four commercial, and two military. The four international include [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]], [[John Glenn Columbus International Airport]], [[Dayton International Airport]], and [[Rickenbacker International Airport]] (one of two military airfields). The other military airfield is [[Wright Patterson Air Force Base]] which is one of the largest Air Force bases in the United States. Other major airports are located in [[Toledo Express Airport|Toledo]] and [[Akron-Canton Airport|Akron]]. Cincinnati's primary airport, [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]], is in [[Hebron, Kentucky]], and therefore is not included in Ohio airport lists.

===Voter suppression===

Since 1994, the state has had a policy of purging infrequent voters from its rolls. In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy on the grounds that it violated the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993|National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993]]<ref name="aclu-husted" /> and the [[Help America Vote Act of 2002]].<ref name="atlantic-husted">{{cite web |last1=Ford |first1=Matt |website=The Atlantic |date=May 30, 2017 |title=Use It or Lose It? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/supreme-court-ohio-voting/528573/ |access-date=May 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629004540/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/supreme-court-ohio-voting/528573/ |archive-date=June 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In June, the federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election.

==Education==

Ohio's system of [[public education]] is outlined in Article VI of the [[Ohio Constitution|state constitution]], and in Title XXXIII of the [[Ohio Revised Code]]. [[Ohio University]], the first university in the [[Northwest Territory]], was also the first public institution in Ohio. Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found in [[Education in the United States|other states]]. At the State level, the Ohio Department of Education, which is overseen by the [[Ohio State Board of Education]], governs primary and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level, there are approximately 700 school districts statewide. The [[Ohio Board of Regents]] coordinates and assists with Ohio's institutions of higher education which have recently been reorganized into the [[University System of Ohio]] under Governor Strickland. The system averages an annual enrollment of more than 400,000 students, making it one of the five largest state university systems in the U.S.
