==Career==

===2009–2011: Early projects and ''Shakkapellas''===
Shakka self-released his first official EP, ''Foolishness'', in July 2009 which was recorded at a local youth centre.<ref name="Foolishness Vol 1 on Bandcamp">{{cite web|url=https://shakka.bandcamp.com/album/foolishness-vol-1|title=Foolishness Vol.1 by Shakka|publisher=}}</ref> With production from both Shakka and TE1, this was Shakka's introduction into the music industry. Shakka consciously decided to sing with his British accent as opposed to an American-influenced accent that many of his contemporaries were using at the time and this formed part of his trademark sound.

He then went on to release a conceptual mixtape, The Shakka Crown Affair, in 2011<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shakka.bandcamp.com/album/the-shakka-crown-affair|title=The Shakka Crown Affair, by Shakka|website=Shakka|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> which gained Shakka much respect amongst his peers, solidified him as an emerging creative phenomenon in the UK and brought him to the attention of successful British rapper [[Wretch 32]].

Having developed a fanbase in the UK, Shakka went on to release a series of YouTube covers and mashups entitled ''Shakkapellas''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC6438435F977886B|title=Shakkapella - YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> in 2012 which gained him fans globally and put him on the radar of music industry tastemakers.<ref name="Shakkapellas">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobo.com/news-blogs/interview-shakka|title=Interview with Shakka - MOBO Awards|publisher=}}</ref>

===2013–2014: Rise to fame===
2013 proved to be a successful year for Shakka, collaborating with various artists, most notably featuring on [[Wretch 32]]'s single "[[Blackout (Wretch 32 song)|Blackout]]", which reached number 6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>[http://www.wretch32.com Wretch 32]. wretch32.com/</ref> He was also selected to perform on the BBC Introducing stage at [[Glastonbury Festival]],<ref name="Glasto">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ej58q9/acts/acgnc8|title=Glastonbury 2013 - Shakka|publisher=}}</ref> and then toured globally with [[Basement Jaxx]] as their guest vocalist.

This year also saw Shakka receive extensive recognition named in [[MTV]]'s top 20 Unsigned Artists of 2013 list<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brandnew.mtv.co.uk/brand-new-unsigned|title=Brand New For 2015 - MTV UK|publisher=}}</ref> and receiving two [[MOBO Award]] nominations; including Best Newcomer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobo.com/news-blogs/spotlight-2013-best-newcomer-nominee-association-htc-shakka|title=2013 BEST NEWCOMER NOMINEE IN ASSOCIATION WITH HTC: Shakka  - MOBO Awards|publisher=}}</ref> BBC's [[Radio 1Xtra]] were early champions of Shakka's music playing some of his Shakkapellas on the station and have supported him throughout his rise to fame.

Noted television performances in 2013 included performing on 'The Graham Norton Show'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYSdtbGtsdQ|title=NME Videos|website=NME.com|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> alongside [[Wretch 32]], as well as on ''Sunday Brunch'' and Channel 5's ''The Wright Stuff''.

He followed this growing success with another independent project, the ''Tribe'' EP,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/tribe-ep/id656848914|title=Tribe - EP by Shakka on Apple Music|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> in 2013. In July 2013 he released the single by "Spin", taken from ''Tribe''.<ref name="Tribe - EP by Shakka on iTunes">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/tribe-ep/id656848914|title=Tribe - EP by Shakka on iTunes|publisher=}}</ref> In November 2013 he released the single "Just Want to See You".<ref name="Tribe - EP by Shakka on iTunes"/>

In 2013 Shakka was also chosen to perform in, and produce music for, a National Theatre production called "Home"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23599713|title=Home at National Theatre shines light on homelessness|last=Geoghegan|first=Kev|date=2013-08-27|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> directed by Nadia Fall which ran for two months during late summer. During this production he had the pleasure of sharing the stage with Antonia Thomas (E4's [[Misfits (TV series)|Misfits]]) and BAFTA award-winning [[Michaela Coel]] (E4's ''[[Chewing Gum (TV series)|Chewing Gum]]'').

===2015–present: Breakthrough: ''The Lost Boys'' and ''The Island''===
In 2014, Shakka released a collection of remixes aptly named ''Shakka B-Sides''. It featured the remix of [[Ten Walls]]' "[[Walking with Elephants]]" featuring Frisco ([[Boy Better Know|BBK]]), which achieved over 8 million views on YouTube.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mela music|title=Shakka - Walking with elephants feat Frisco (HQ)|date=2015-01-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfA8H6whjy8|accessdate=2017-02-01}}</ref> In 2015, Shakka signed to Pitched Up/[[Sony Music]].<ref name="Signed to Sony">{{cite web|url=http://www.wearebang.com/index.php/shakka-signs-to-sonypitched-up/#sthash.cLCPuU5V.XtiOJllt.dpbs|title=Shakka signs to Sony - We Are BANG Radio|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2015, Shakka released his debut major label EP ''The Lost Boys'' and a new single entitled "[[Say Nada]]".
