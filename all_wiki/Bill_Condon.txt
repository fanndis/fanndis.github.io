At the age of twelve, Condon found himself drawn to screenplay writing with his first viewing of [[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|''Bonnie and Clyde'']]:
{{Quote|Part of the pleasure of it was a completely instinctual thing that drew me into the world of writing about movies. Suddenly it became all of your senses—your mind was engaged by it. The most pleasurable thing was that you felt as if you were part of the movement and part of that fun.<ref>Condon in {{cite book|title=The Film That Changed My Life|first= Robert K.|last= Elder|location= Chicago|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year= 2011|page=44}}</ref>}}

In college he saw ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]'' (1969) starring [[Shirley MacLaine]]. He later described its impact:
{{Quote|''Sweet Charity'' was probably the first movie musical I saw on the screen … It was Bob Fosse's first movie, and the sense of wonder of somebody that gifted discovering a new medium is just intoxicating.… For me, ''Sweet Charity'' started a lifelong love affair with movies that are reviled and rejected in their time, which it was.<ref name=columbiacollege/>}}

After completing college, Condon worked as a journalist for film magazines, including ''[[American Film (magazine)|American Film]]'' and ''Millimeter''. Circa 1981, he won "the world's most difficult film trivia quiz" sponsored by the ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref>{{cite news | work = The New York Times | accessdate = March 11, 2017 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/movies/awardsseason/04ciep.html | date = December 31, 2008 | title = A Hollywood Party, and You're Invited | first = Michael | last = Cieply|archivedate=January 26, 2018| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126204928/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/movies/awardsseason/04ciep.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
His career as a filmmaker began with screenplays for the [[independent film|independent feature]] ''[[Strange Behavior]]'' (1981), an homage to the pulp horror films of the 1950s,<ref name=sb>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DE6DC103BF935A25753C1A967948260 |date=October 16, 1981 |accessdate=March 9, 2017 |title=A Taste of the 50s in 'Strange Behavior' |first=Janet |last=Maslin |quote=Mr. Condon appears in the film, rather sportingly, as the first kid in Galesville to be hideously murdered by some unidentified demon.}}</ref> and the [[science-fiction]] feature ''[[Strange Invaders]]'' (1983), which starred [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] and [[Wallace Shawn]]. It depicted present-day encounters with extraterrestrials who have been living in Illinois since 1958, when they entered into a secret pact with the Eisenhower administration.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=March 13, 2017|date=September 16, 1983 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9402E7D9103BF935A2575AC0A965948260 |title=Monster Power in 'Strange Invaders' |first=Vincent |last=Canby |work=The New York Times}}</ref> His directorial debut was ''[[Sister, Sister (1987 film)|Sister, Sister]]'' (1987), an eerie [[Southern Gothic]] mystery starring [[Eric Stoltz]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Test screenings led to major changes to the film, which still proved a critical failure that set back Condon's career.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=March 12, 2017 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/20/sister_sister_1987_dvd_review.shtml |title=Sister Sister DVD (1987) |publisher=BBC News |date=October 28, 2014}}</ref>

Condon emerged a few years later directing a series of made-for-TV thrillers, including ''[[Murder 101 (1991 film)|Murder 101]]'' (1991), which starred [[Pierce Brosnan]] and earned Condon and co-writer Roy Johansen a 1992 [[Edgar Award]] for their screenplay.<ref name=mysterynet>{{cite web|url= http://www.mysterynet.com/awards/edgars/previous/tv-episode/|title= Best Mystery TV Episode Edgar Award Winners and Nominees – Complete Lists|publisher=Mystery.net|accessdate=March 3, 2017|archivedate=March 3, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303204606/http://www.mysterynet.com/awards/edgars/previous/tv-episode/ |url-status=live}}</ref> During this period he also wrote the screenplay for the thriller ''[[F/X2]]'' (1991), which was directed by Australian director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-05-10/entertainment/9102110493_1_rollie-tyler-new-york-cop-bill-condon |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |date=May 10, 1991 |title=Effects Aside, 'Fx 2' Isn't As Special As The First |first=Clifford |last=Terry |quote= ... there are instances when Bill Condon`s script just doesn`t make sense.}}</ref>

In 1994, he directed the television movie ''[[The Man Who Wouldn't Die (1995 film)|The Man Who Wouldn't Die]]'', which starred [[Roger Moore]] and Nancy Allen. ABC chose it to air during sweeps week, but reviews were mixed.<ref>{{cite news |work= Sun-Sentinel |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |date=May 28, 1995 |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-05-28/entertainment/9505180372_1_grace-s-life-bomb-blast-novels |first=Tom |last=Jicha |title='The Man Who Wouldn't Die' Should }}</ref> He directed ''[[Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh]]'' (1995), a sequel to [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose's]] 1992 horror film. It was a critical and commercial failure.<ref>{{cite news |work=TimeOut |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |title=Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/candyman-2-farewell-to-the-flesh |quote=Atrocious.}}</ref> Reminded years later of this phase of his career, Condon said: "It's hard to be lower on the totem pole than being the director for a sequel to a horror movie."<ref name=columbiacollege />

Condon wrote and directed ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998). He based his screenplay on a novel by [[Christopher Bram]]. His screenplay won the [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. ''The New York Times'' said Condon "may have been the most stunned person at the Academy Awards when his name was announced as the winner for the best adapted screenplay. He has struggled for years in Hollywood as a screenwriter and journalist and is unaccustomed to the hoopla that is now around him."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Weinraub|first1=Bernard|title=At the Movies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/26/movies/at-the-movies.html|accessdate=March 13, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=March 26, 1999}}</ref> He was nominated for the same award for his screenplay for ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', based on the Broadway musical of the [[Chicago (musical)|same name]].<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/mar/24/awardsandprizes.oscars20032 |title=Complete list of Oscar winners |date=March 24, 2003}}</ref> He received a second Edgar Award for his ''Chicago'' screenplay as well.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrity Watch|work=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|location= West Palm Beach, Florida |page=53|date=May 6, 2003|quote=I had the extreme pleasure of presenting the Edgar Award for best motion picture screenplay to Chicago's Bill Condon at the Hyatt Thursday night.}}</ref>

In 2004 he wrote and directed the film ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]'', chronicling the life of the controversial sex researcher [[Alfred Kinsey]]. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A.O. Scott]] wrote that "Bill Condon's smart, stirring [film] has a lot to say on the subject of sex, which it treats with sobriety, sensitivity and a welcome measure of humor." He continued: "I can't think of another movie that has dealt with sex so knowledgeably and, at the same time, made the pursuit of knowledge seem so sexy. There are some explicit images and provocative scenes, but it is your intellect that is most likely to be aroused.... Mr. Condon's great achievement is to turn Kinsey's complicated and controversial career into a grand intellectual drama."<ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/12/movies/where-darkness-ruled-he-shone-a-bright-light.html |accessdate=March 9, 2017 |date=November 12, 2004 |first=A.O. |last=Scott |title=Where Darkness Ruled, He Shone a Bright Light}}</ref>

In 2005, he received the [[GLAAD Media Awards|Stephen F.

Condon wrote the screenplay for and directed ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', an adaptation of the acclaimed Broadway musical of the [[Dreamgirls|same name]] based on the career of the musical group [[The Supremes]]. It was released in December 2006. Condon received [[Directors Guild of America]] and [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] nominations for directing. The film was nominated in eight Academy Awards in six categories, but not for best film, directing, or screenplay.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/oscar-nominations-announced-dreamgirls-receives-eight-noms-excluding-best-picture-com-137907 |work=Playbill |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |title=Oscar Nominations Announced; "Dreamgirls" Receives Eight Noms, Excluding Best Picture |date=January 23, 2007 |first=Andrew |last=Gans}}</ref>

Condon was executive producer of the [[81st Academy Awards]] television broadcast that aired on February 22, 2009, working with producer [[Laurence Mark]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/movies/awardsseason/15brow.html |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |date=February 12, 2009 |title=The Little Gold Man in a New Blue World |first=Patricia Leigh |last=Brown}}</ref>

Condon directed both parts of ''[[Breaking Dawn (disambiguation)|The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn]]'' (2011 and 2012), adapted from the fourth and final novel in ''[[Twilight (novel series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' by [[Stephenie Meyer]]. He was twice nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Razzie for Worst Director]] for these films, winning for ''Part 2''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/twilight-wins-7-razzie-awards-423720 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |date=February 23, 2013 |title='Twilight' Wins 7 Razzie Awards Including Worst Picture |first=Aaron |last=Crouch}}</ref>

Condon directed ''[[The Fifth Estate (film)|The Fifth Estate]]'' (2013), a thriller about [[WikiLeaks]] starring [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]. He said he chose the project for a change of pace and liked its non-ideological approach to a very complex subject. He saw it "in the great tradition of journalistic thrillers".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.startribune.com/after-twilight-wikileaks-director-richard-condon-on-fifth-estate/228225471/ |accessdate=March 12, 2017 |date=October 17, 2013 |title=After 'Twilight,' WikiLeaks: Director Richard Condon on 'Fifth Estate.' |work=StarTribune }}</ref> It failed with critics and at the box office. Condon said he was shocked by the complete lack of public interest and questioned the public appeal of its principal subject, [[Julian Assange]]. He said: "I do think there's something about him that does not suggest an evening's entertainment."<ref>{{cite news |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=March 12, 2017 |url=https://ew.com/article/2013/11/01/bill-condon-fifth-estate/amp/ |date=November 1, 2013 |title=Bill Condon on 'Fifth Estate' disaster: Assange just 'wore out his welcome' |first=Laura |last=Herzfeld }}</ref>

In late 2013, he directed a revised version of the 1997 stage musical  ''[[Side Show]]'' at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]]. A production of this revision played in June and July 2014 at the [[Kennedy Center]]. [[Charles Isherwood]] described it in ''The New York Times'' as "a full-scale reimagining" of the musical that involved "the addition and subtraction of several songs ..., the reordering of others", and new dialogue contributed by Condon.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/theater/side-show-in-a-new-production-at-the-kennedy-center.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 12, 2017 |first=Charles |last=Isherwood |date=June 20, 2014 |title=A Grandeur That Eclipses the Grotesque}}</ref> That production received excellent reviews when it moved to Broadway in the fall, but it proved a failure at the box office and closed after just seven weeks.<ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/theater/side-show-reportedly-to-end-broadway-run-in-january.html |accessdate=March 12, 2017 |title=Theater Owner Pushes 'Side Show' to Close |date=December 12, 2014 |first=Patrick |last=Healy}}</ref>

In 2015, Condon directed ''[[Mr. Holmes]]'' starring [[Ian McKellen]]. Condon noted its similarity to ''Gods and Monsters'', not only because of its lead actor but because "[b]oth movies are about aging and mortality. You have a celebrated man facing the decline of his public image."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farber|first1=Stephen|title=The clues to 'Mr. Holmes' director Bill Condon's varied career|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-bill-condon-mr-holmes-20150712-story.html|accessdate=March 13, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 11, 2015}}</ref>

He's confused about what he wants. It's somebody who's just realizing that he has these feelings.'}}</ref>

He co-authored the screenplay for ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'', a biography of [[P.T. Barnum]], starring [[Hugh Jackman]] and released in December 2017. He rewrote the draft of co-author [[Jenny Bicks]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |date=October 24, 2013 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-condon-rewrite-foxs-pt-650669 |title=Bill Condon to Rewrite Fox's P.T.
