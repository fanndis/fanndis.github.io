==Mayor of Yonkers==
In 1996, John Spencer was sworn in as mayor of Yonkers.  The city's finances had been under the oversight of a State Emergency Financial Control Board for more than a decade.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DA133DF931A2575BC0A96E948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Control Board Clears Some Yonkers Spending | first=Lisa W. | last=Foderaro | date=1988-08-12 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref>   Mayor Spencer insisted that the City had met its obligations and called for the removal of the New York State Control Board.

In 1998, control of the city's finances was returned to the city.<ref name= NYGOV>{{cite web

Judge Sand agreed and after negotiations gave control back to the City on both issues, thus ending the Federal role in Yonkers.  Mayor Spencer presided over development in Yonkers.  Retail and housing were built on the downtown waterfront, a new library was completed, along with the Austin Avenue development of Costco, Home Depot, and Stew Leonard's.  As part of the New State Control Board leaving, Mayor Spencer also went on to cut the Income Tax Surcharge by 2/3 and cut the Real Estate transfer tax from 3% to 1%, thus forcing the city to raise property taxes to make up the difference.

His mayoral chief of staff Kathy Spring bore him two children and later had a third in 2005.<ref name=Santora_2006/>   Spring's annual salary started at $52,000, and increased to $138,000 by the time Spencer left office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Golding |display-authors=et al |title=Spencer's Quest |url=http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060115/NEWS02/601150349/1026/NEWS10 |work=The Yonkers Journal News |publisher=LoHud.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623090915/http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060115%2FNEWS02%2F601150349%2F1026%2FNEWS10 |archivedate=June 23, 2006 }}</ref>

In November 2003, Spencer could not run for re-election as mayor due to the [[term limits]] law that he himself championed and then tried to rescind. Mayor Spencer's deputy mayor Phil Amicone sought the office of Mayor with the support of Spencer, and successfully defeated Assemblyman Michael Spano in a Republican primary, and then went on to defeat Democratic candidate Joe Farmer in the general election.

==2006 New York Senate race==
{{Main|2006 New York United States Senate election}}

In 2005, Spencer announced his [[candidate|candidacy]] for the Republican nomination for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat held by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hillary Clinton]], who was seeking re-election to a second term. Politically, Spencer is opposed to [[abortion]] and [[gun control]], and a supporter of tighter border security.<ref name=Issues>[http://www.joinspencer.com/site/c.euLPK3MNItG/b.1009951/k.C792/Issues/apps/nl/newsletter2.asp Issues - Spencer for Senate] URL accessed 2006-04-17  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027212328/http://www.joinspencer.com/site/c.euLPK3MNItG/b.1009951/k.C792/Issues/apps/nl/newsletter2.asp |date=2005-10-27 }}</ref>  His support for the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and its policies is well known, including but not limited to the [[war in Iraq]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

On August 18, 2005, Spencer gave a radio interview where he said [[Westchester County|Westchester County, New York]] [[District Attorney]] [[Jeanine Pirro]], another candidate for the Republican nomination, didn't have a "Chinaman's chance" of getting the [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative]] line. Spencer was asked to apologize for the comment after an outcry from the [[Asian American|Asian community]] that the statement was derogatory.<ref name=Blain>{{cite news | first=Glenn | last=Blain | title=Spencer blasted for 'Chinaman' comment | date=2005-08-18 | publisher=[[The Journal News]] | url=http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050818/NEWS10/508180413/1026/NEWS10 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112062827/http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050818%2FNEWS10%2F508180413%2F1026%2FNEWS10 | archivedate=2006-01-12 }}</ref> Pirro dropped out of the race in December 2005.

On May 31, 2006, Spencer won the endorsement of the [[New York Republican Party|state Republican Party organization]] but did not achieve the threshold of 75 percent he needed to exclude his rival, former [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] aide [[Kathleen Troia McFarland|Kathleen Troia "K.T." McFarland]], from the [[primary election|primary]] ballot.  He received 63 percent, and thus faced McFarland in the September 12, 2006 Republican primary, which he won by a margin of almost two to one.<ref>[http://www.ny1.com/ny/Election/2006primary/index.html?page_name=statewide Primary 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312071726/http://www.ny1.com/ny/Election/2006primary/index.html?page_name=statewide |date=2007-03-12 }}</ref> Spencer called on McFarland to step aside after the vote, but McFarland told CQPolitics.com she had no intention of withdrawing from the race.<ref>{{cite news| first=Marie| last=Horrigan| title=NY Senate: Spencer Wins GOP Nod, But Still Faces Primary| date=2006-05-31| publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly]]| url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/05/ny_senate_spencer_wins_gop_nod.html| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829102819/http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/05/ny_senate_spencer_wins_gop_nod.html| archivedate=2006-08-29}}</ref>

In a June 2006 radio ad, Spencer expressed his disappointment in the national Republicans for not helping his Senate campaign.

In his 2006 election campaign, Spencer came out in favor of a [[New York Court of Appeals]] [[judicial decision|decision]] rejecting the claim of 42 [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] couples that [[same-sex marriage]] as [[constitutional right]]. On Kevin McCullough's talk radio program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larryboy.nycradio.com/~mp3/audio/Kevin%20McCullough%20Live%20From%20New%20York%20WMCA570%20Hour%201%20-%20Kevin%20McCullough%20-%20tue.mp3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820080442/http://larryboy.nycradio.com/~mp3/audio/Kevin%20McCullough%20Live%20From%20New%20York%20WMCA570%20Hour%201%20-%20Kevin%20McCullough%20-%20tue.mp3 |archivedate=2007-08-20 }}</ref> Spencer said marriage is "between a man and a woman" and that a constitutional amendment is needed to enshrine that.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/god-gay-marriage-and-john-spencer/ | work=The New York Times | title=God, Gay Marriage, and John Spencer | date=2006-06-21}}</ref>

Clinton spent $36&nbsp;million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. [[#Opinion polling|Polls during the general election campaign]] generally showed Clinton with a 20-point lead or better over Spencer.  On November 7, 2006, Clinton won easily, garnering 67% of the vote to Spencer's 31%.

In 2006, former mayor Spencer was sued in civil court by a former City of Yonkers employee, Joan Gronowski, who later served as a city council member, who stated that she was told not to engage in political campaign activities while working for the city. Following a jury verdict, a $75,000 judgement against the city was narrowly affirmed in a 3–2 split decision.<ref>''[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1398120.html Matter of Gronowski v. Spencer]''. Docket No. 04-2605-Cv, 424 F.3d 285 (2d Cir. 2005)</ref>
