The '''Terrorism Act 2000''' (c.11) is the first of a number of general [[Terrorism Acts]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It superseded and repealed the [[Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989]] and the [[Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996]]. It also replaced parts of the [[Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/19/terrorism-act|title=A-Z of legislation: Terrorism Act 2000|last=Staff|first=Guardian|date=2009-01-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-03-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The powers it provides the police have been controversial, leading to noted cases of alleged abuse, and to legal challenges in British and European courts. The stop-and-search powers under section 44 of the Act have been ruled illegal by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

==Definition of terrorism==
{{clear}}
Terrorism is defined, in the first section of the Act, as follows:

<blockquote style="background: #fff8f8; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 2px">
'''Section 1.''' –
:(1) In this Act "terrorism" means the use or threat of action where-
::(a) the action falls within subsection (2),
::(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government [or an international governmental organisation]<ref>Words in square brackets inserted by [[Terrorism Act 2006]].</ref> or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and
::(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious[, racial]<ref>Word in square brackets inserted by [[Counter-Terrorism Act 2008]].</ref> or ideological cause.

:(2) Action falls within this subsection if it-
::(a) involves serious violence against a person,
::(b) involves serious damage to property,
::(c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person committing the action,
::(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or
::(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.

:(3) The use or threat of action falling within subsection (2) which involves the use of firearms or explosives is terrorism whether or not subsection (1)(b) is satisfied.</blockquote>

Sections (2)(b) and (e) have been criticised<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gearty|first=Conor|title=11 September 2001, Counter-terrorism, and the Human Rights Act|journal=Journal of Law and Society| date=March 2005 |volume=32|issue=1|pages=18–33|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6478.2005.312_1.x}}</ref> as falling well outside the scope of what is generally understood to be the [[definition of terrorism]], i.e. acts that require life-threatening violence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Iris Schaechter |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/terrorism_definitions.html |title=UNODC – Terrorism Definitions |date=16 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216050500/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/terrorism_definitions.html |archive-date=16 February 2006 }}</ref>

Prior to this, terrorism was defined in an Act as a footnote, such as Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Act 1993 (c. 18) section 2(2):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1993/Ukpga_19930018_en_1.htm |title=Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Act 1993 1993 CHAPTER 18 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk }}</ref>

<blockquote>"acts of terrorism" means acts of persons acting on behalf of, or in connection with, any organisation which carries out activities directed towards the overthrowing or influencing, by force or violence, of Her Majesty's government in the United Kingdom or any other government de jure or de facto.</blockquote>

and Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (c. 4) section 20(1):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1989/Ukpga_19890004_en_6.htm |title=Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (c. 4) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk }}</ref>

<blockquote>In this Act "terrorism" means the use of violence for political ends, and includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear.</blockquote>

In the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, the criminal offences referred to as terrorism are provided as an exhaustive list of over 70 items.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1996/ukpga_19960022_en_1|title=Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 1996 CHAPTER 22|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>

This move to establish a sound definition of terrorism in the law made it possible to build an entirely new set of police and investigatory powers into incidents of this kind, beyond what they could do for ordinary violent offences.

The inclusion in its definition of the phrase ''or threat'' mirrors the common law, as it was codified with respect to written words, in [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1740–59#27 Geo. 2|27 Geo II c.15 (1754)]] and again in [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1820–1839#1823 .284 Geo. 4.29|4 Geo IV c.54 (1823)]].<ref>Sir [[William Oldnall Russell]]: "[[Russell on Crime|A Treatise on Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors]]" vol 2, ch.3, p.576-7 (2nd ed, 1828)</ref>

==Proscribed groups==
As in previous [[Prevention of Terrorism Act (Northern Ireland)|Terrorism Acts]], such as the [[Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989]], the [[Home Secretary]] had the power to maintain a list of "proscribed groups" that they believe are "concerned in terrorism". The act of being a member of, or supporting such a group, or wearing an item of clothing such as "to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation" is sufficient to be prosecuted for a terrorist offence.

Under the act aliases of organizations can be added. For example, [[Al Muhajiroun]], [[Islam4UK]], [[Call to Submission]], [[Islamic Path]], [[London School of Sharia]] and [[Muslims Against Crusades]] were added in January 2010 and November 2011 as alternative names for Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect (also deemed to be the same organization) and in June 2014 [[Need4Khilafah]], the [[Shariah Project]] and the [[Islamic Dawah Association]] were added to this list.  An alias does not have to be added to the list for prosecution to be possible, provided it can be demonstrated that for all intents and purposes the organization is a proscribed one, and that the person involved has committed a proscribed act.

{{As of|2020|02|post=,}} the following 75 organisations appear in Schedule 2 of the Act, to which they have been added periodically since March 2001 by [[statutory instruments]], and are listed under the above heading in the [[Home Office]] document 'Proscribed Terrorist Organisations:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/proscribed-terror-groups-or-organisations--2|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref>

==Provisions==

===Section 41 (arrest without warrant)===
Section 41 of the Act provided the police with the power to arrest and detain a person without charge for up to 48 hours if they were suspected of being a terrorist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/41 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=15 August 2013|access-date=2016-01-03|title=2000 c. 11 - Part V Suspected terrorists - Section 41}}</ref> This period of detention could be extended to up to seven days if the police can persuade a judge that it is necessary for further questioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00011--w.htm |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=15 August 2013}}</ref>

This was a break from ordinary criminal law where suspects had to be charged within 24 hours of detention or be released. This period was later extended to 14 days by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/30044--x.htm#306 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=15 August 2013}}</ref> and to 28 days by the [[Terrorism Act 2006]].

===Stop and search without suspicion===

====Section 44====
The most commonly encountered use of the Act was outlined in Section 44 which enables the police and the [[Home Secretary]] to define any area in the country as well as a time period wherein they could stop and search any vehicle or person, and seize "articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00011--f.htm#44 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=15 August 2013}}</ref> Unlike other [[Stop and search|stop and search powers]] that the police can use, Section 44 does not require the police to have "reasonable suspicion" that an offence has been committed, to search an individual.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/dec/09/police-detain-arrest-kettling|title=How can the police detain you?|last=Welch|first=James|date=9 December 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

In 2009, over 100,000 searches were conducted under the powers, but none of these resulted in people being arrested for terrorism offences. 504 were arrested for other offences.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alan Travis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/28/terrorism-police-stop-search-arrests |title=No terror arrests in 100,000 police counter-terror searches, figures show |work=The Guardian |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

In January 2010 the stop-and-search powers granted under Section 44 were ruled illegal by the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. It held that [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] had been violated in the case of two people stopped in 2003 outside the [[ExCeL London|ExCeL convention centre]] in London, which at the time was hosting a military equipment exhibition. The Court found the powers were "not sufficiently circumscribed" and lacked "adequate legal safeguards against abuse", over-ruling a 2003 [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judgment upheld at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and the [[House of Lords]].<ref name=BBC-Web1>{{cite news

Pending new powers in the [[Protection of Freedoms Bill]] (see [[#Section 47A|Section 47A]]), [[Theresa May]] made a [[Statutory Instrument (UK)#Remedial Orders under the Human Rights Act 1998|remedial order]] under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] (the [[Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011]]), which had the effect of repealing sections 44, 45, 46 and most of section 47.<ref name=HOpage>{{cite web|title=Home > Publications > Counter-terrorism > Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter-terrorism/terrorism-act-remedial-order/|work=Home Office website|publisher=[[Home Office]]|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="TA(R)O 2011"/>

====Section 47A====
As discussed above, since 18 March 2011 section 44 has been treated as repealed. It has been replaced with a new section 47A by the Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011. Under the new provisions, searches can only be carried out as follows:

A senior police officer must make an authorisation in relation to a specified area or place. He can make such an authorisation only if he:<ref name="TA(R)O 2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/631/made |title=Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk }}</ref>
*reasonably suspects that an act of terrorism will take place, and
*considers that:
**the authorisation is necessary to prevent such an act,
**the specified area or place is no greater than is necessary to prevent such an act, and
**the duration of the authorisation is no longer than is necessary to prevent such an act.

When such an authorisation is in force, any constable in uniform can, in the specified area or place, stop:<ref name="TA(R)O 2011"/>
*a vehicle, and search:
**the vehicle,
**the driver of the vehicle,
**a passenger in the vehicle, and
**anything in or on the vehicle or carried by the driver or a passenger,
*a pedestrian, and search:
**the pedestrian, and
**anything carried by the pedestrian.

But the power to search can only be used for the purpose of discovering whether there is anything which may constitute evidence that:<ref name="TA(R)O 2011"/>
*the vehicle concerned is being used for the purposes of terrorism, or that
*the person concerned is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

The power conferred by such an authorisation may be exercised whether or not the constable reasonably suspects that there is such evidence.<ref name="TA(R)O 2011"/>  A person or vehicle searched under this power may be detained for as long as is reasonably required. A person who is searched may be required to remove their headgear, footwear, outer coat, jacket or gloves, but nothing else whilst in public. If requested, a form must be given stating that the person/vehicle was stopped.<ref name="TA(R)O 2011"/>

An authorisation can be given by an [[Assistant Chief Constable]] (or if the area is in the [[Metropolitan Police District]] or the [[City of London]], then a [[Borough Commander|Commander]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]]/[[City of London Police]]).<ref name="TA(R)O 2011"/> Authorisations can also be given by the Assistant Chief Constables of:
*the [[British Transport Police]], in relation to railway property,
*the [[Ministry of Defence Police]], in relation to military land, ordnance factories or dockyards, or other places where the Ministry of Defence Police have an agreement to police (some [[gas terminal]]s)
*the [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]], in relation to nuclear power stations and associated land, and land up to 5 kilometres from such places.

If given verbally, authorisations must be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable, and in either case must be notified to the [[Home Office]] as soon as reasonably practicable. Authorisations must be confirmed by the Home Office within 48 hours of their being made, or they expire automatically. If confirmed, an authorisation can only last for up to 14 days. An authorisation can be cancelled at any time, or restricted in respect of the time it ends or the area which it covers, but it cannot be expanded. New authorisations can be made regardless of whether previous authorisations exist, or have been cancelled or have expired.<ref name="TA(R)O 2011"/>

===Section 58 – Collection of information===<!-- This section is linked from [[Abu Bakr Mansha]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->
This section creates the offence, liable to a prison term of up to ten years, to collect or possess "information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism".

Sections 57–58: Possession offences:  Section 57 is dealing with possessing articles for the purpose of terrorist acts.

===Part 7===
Part 7, comprising sections 65 to 113, contained particular provisions applying to [[Northern Ireland]], that were to require parliamentary approval on an annual basis by means of a [[statutory instrument]] to continue in force. The part replaced previous provisions under the [[Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996]].

Part 7 was succeeded by the [[Terrorism (Northern Ireland) Act 2006]], which in turn was succeeded by the [[Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007]].

====Section 75 (Trial without jury)====
Section 75 provided for [[bench trial]]s instead of [[jury trials]] in Northern Ireland for scheduled offences, continuing the system of [[Diplock court]]s first established in 1973.

==Stop and search, arrest and conviction rates==
Between July and December 2007, the BBC reported that more than 14,000 people and vehicles had been stopped and searched by British Transport Police in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7146080.stm|title=Random searches on rail network |date=15 December 2007|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref> In 2008 the [[Metropolitan Police]] conducted 175,000 searches using Section 44, these included over 2313 children (aged 15 or under), of whom 58 were aged under 10.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/aug/18/met-police-stop-search-children|title=Metropolitan police used anti-terror laws to stop and search 58 under-10s|last=Dodd|first=Vikram|date=18 August 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

Up to early 2004 around 500 people are believed to have been arrested under the Act; seven people had been charged. By October 2005 these figures had risen to 750 arrested with 22 convictions; the then current [[Home Secretary]], [[Charles Clarke]], said "the statistics illustrate the difficulty of getting evidence to bring prosecution".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/515/5101105.htm|work=Select Committee on Home Affairs Minutes of Evidence |title=Examination of Witnesses (Questions 60–73)|author=Charles Clarke and Mr Benyon|date=11 October 2005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>

Figures released by the [[Home Office]] on 5 March 2007 show that 1,126 people were arrested under the Act between 11 September 2001 and 31 December 2006. Of the total 1,166 people arrested under the Act or during related police investigations, 221 were charged with terrorism offences, and 40 convicted.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/terrorism/story/0,,2027077,00.html|title=1,166 anti-terror arrests net 40 convictions|author=Press Association|date=5 March 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

Noted arrests under Section 58 include [[Abu Bakr Mansha]] in December 2005, and the eight suspects involved in the [[2004 financial buildings plot]].

==Reactions and analysis==
In his comprehensive commentary on this Act and other anti-terrorism legislation, Professor Clive Walker of the University of Leeds comments:<ref>[http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9781841741833 ''The Anti-Terrorism Legislation'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123528/http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9781841741833 |date=29 September 2007 }}</ref>

<blockquote>The Terrorism Act 2000 represents a worthwhile attempt to fulfil the role of a modern code against terrorism, though it fails to meet the desired standards in all respects. There are aspects where rights are probably breached, and its mechanisms to ensure democratic accountability and constitutionalism are even more deficient, as discussed in the section on 'Scrutiny' earlier in this chapter. It is also a sobering thought, proffered by the Home Affairs Committee, that the result is that 'This country has more anti-terrorist legislation on its statute books than almost any other developed democracy.' (Report on the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill 2001 (2001–02 HC 351) para.1). But at least that result initially flowed from a solemnly studied and carefully constructed legislative exercise.</blockquote>

The Terrorism Act 2000 is subject to annual review by the [https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/ Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation].  The Independent Reviewer's reports are submitted to the Home Secretary, laid before Parliament and published in full.

==Alleged abuses==
The laws have been criticised for allowing excessive police powers leaving scope for abuse. There have been various cases in which the laws have been used in scenarios criticised for being unrelated to fighting terrorism. Critics allege there is systematic abuse of the act against protesters.<ref name='TeleAbuse'/>

Many instances have been reported in the media of innocent people who have been stopped and searched under section 44 of the Act. According to [[Home Office]] guidelines, police are required to have "reasonable suspicion" that a person is acting as a terrorist.<ref name="photo-homeoffice">{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/publications/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/ |title=Photography and Counter-Terrorism legislation |date=18 August 2009 |publisher=The Home Office |accessdate=30 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329112945/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/publications/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/ |archive-date=29 March 2010 }}</ref> Critics of the Act claim that, in practice, police are using Section 44 emergency powers as "an additional tool in their day-to-day policing kit" to stop and search innocent citizens without reasonable grounds, going beyond the original intention of Parliament.<ref name="bbc-powers">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3886833.stm|title= Pair seek unlawful search ruling|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 December 2009 | date=12 July 2004}}</ref><ref name="liberty-s44">{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/issues/6-free-speech/s44-terrorism-act/index.shtml |title=Section 44 – Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Liberty |accessdate=2 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511160628/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/issues/6-free-speech/s44-terrorism-act/index.shtml |archive-date=11 May 2008 }}</ref>

One of the issues arising from the Section 44 authorisations has been the use of the Act to detain lawful protestors or other people who are in the vicinity of demonstrations. Critics claim the Act gives police extended powers to deter or prevent peaceful protest.<ref name="liberty-freespeech">{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/issues/6-free-speech/index.shtml|title=Free Speech & Protest|publisher=Liberty|accessdate=2 December 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929145108/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/issues/6-free-speech/index.shtml|archive-date=29 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:DemonstrationAgainstAntiTerrorismLawLondon23Jan.jpg|thumb|Protesters demonstrating against police harassment of photographers under Section 44. Trafalgar Square, London, 23 January 2010]]

Problematic use of Section 44 powers has not been restricted to political protestors; according to reports, journalists, amateur and professional photographers, [[trainspotter]]s, politicians and children have been subject to stop and search under suspicion of being involved in terrorist activities while engaged in lawful acts such as photography. The taking of photographs in public spaces is permitted under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] ([[freedom of panorama]]), and while the Terrorism Act does not prohibit such activity,<ref name="photo-homeoffice"/> critics have alleged misuse of the powers of the Act to prevent lawful photography.<ref name="bbc-terrorist">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7351252.stm|title= Innocent photographer or terrorist?|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom |date=17 April 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> (Further restrictions on photography have, however, been introduced with the [[Counter-Terrorism Act 2008]])

Disquiet among the police and government about Section 44 increased; in an interview on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s programme [[PM (Radio 4)|iPM]], Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, remarked that the Act was not clear about police and that a lack of training for police officers had led to some officers being "overzealous" in implementing the Act.<ref name=amateur-photo-dec2011>{{cite web|title=Terror Act: Police attack government over photography in public|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/news/terror_act_police_attack_government_over_photography_in_public_news_254852.html|work=Amateur Photographer|accessdate=14 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204134752/http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/news/Terror_Act_Police_attack_government_over_photography_in_public_news_254852.html|archive-date=4 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Vernon Coaker]], the [[Minister of State]] stated on 20 April 2009 that, "counter-terrorism measures should only be used for counter-terrorism purposes".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/Coaker_reportresponse200409.pdf |title=Demonstrating Respect for Rights?

===Incidents===

====General====
*In October 2005 Sally Cameron was held for four hours after being arrested under the act for walking on a cycle path in a controlled port area in [[Dundee]] owned by [[Forth Ports]]. While cyclists were free to pass through the port zone, she was arrested and detained because she was a pedestrian and under suspicion of being a terrorist.

{{quote|I've been walking to work every morning for months and months to keep fit. One day, I was told by a guard on the gate that I couldn't use the route any more because it was solely a cycle path and he said, if I was caught doing it again, I'd be arrested...The next thing I knew, the harbour master had driven up behind me with a megaphone, saying, 'You're trespassing, please turn back'. It was totally ridiculous. I started laughing and kept on walking. Cyclists going past were also laughing...But then two police cars roared up beside me and cut me off, like a scene from [[Starsky and Hutch]], and officers told me I was being arrested under the Terrorism Act. The harbour master was waffling on and (saying that), because of September 11, I would be arrested and charged.<ref>{{cite news | title=Two wheels: good.

The boy was awarded compensation and given an apology.<ref name=mattson-photographer>{{cite web|title=Photographer wins police payout over lawful pics|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/news/Photographer_wins_police_payout_over_lawful_pics_news_310784.html|work=Amateur Photographer|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=12 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108032807/http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/news/Photographer_wins_police_payout_over_lawful_pics_news_310784.html|archive-date=8 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=mattson-telegraph>{{cite news|title=Police apologise for gay jibe against photographer|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8951188/Police-apologise-for-gay-jibe-against-photographer.html|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 December 2011|location=London|first=Richard|last=Alleyne}}</ref>
