'''Newton Leroy "Newt" Gingrich''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|r|ɪ|tʃ}}; born June 17, 1943) is an American [[politician]] and [[author]] who served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives|50th]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from 1995 to 1999. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he was the [[U.S. Representative]] for [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] serving north Atlanta and nearby areas from 1979 until his resignation in 1999. In [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], Gingrich unsuccessfully ran for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|Republican nomination]] for [[President of the United States]].

A professor of history and geography at the [[University of West Georgia]] in the 1970s, Gingrich won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1978|November 1978]], the first Republican in the history of Georgia's 6th congressional district to do so. He served as [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Whip]] from 1989 to 1995.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordguidetouni00john |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordguidetouni00john/page/264 264] |title=The Oxford Guide to the United States Government |last1=Patrick |first1=John J. |last2=Pious |first2=Richard M. |last3=Ritchie |first3=Donald A. |date=July 4, 2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195142730}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000225 |title=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress: Gingrich, Newton Leroy |publisher=bioguide.congress.gov/ |accessdate=April 20, 2017 |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628222423/http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000225 |url-status=live }}</ref> A co-author and architect of the "[[Contract with America]]", Gingrich was a major leader in the Republican victory in the [[United States House of Representatives election, 1994|1994 congressional election]].

As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House of [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]] and a [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997|capital gains tax cut]] in 1997. Gingrich played a key role in several government shutdowns, and impeached [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] on a party-line vote in the House.

Since leaving the House, Gingrich has remained active in public policy debates and worked as a political consultant. He founded and chaired several policy [[think tanks]], including [[American Solutions for Winning the Future]] and the [[Center for Health Transformation]]. Gingrich ran for the [[Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012|Republican nomination]] for President in the 2012 presidential election, and was considered a potential frontrunner at several points in the race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111206/NEWS90/111209826/-1/NEWS01 |title=Gingrich tops polls in Iowa, South Carolina, North Carolina and Colorado |publisher=PoconoRecord.com |date=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-28 |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121230042/http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20111206%2FNEWS90%2F111209826%2F-1%2FNEWS01 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite an impressive late victory in the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2012|South Carolina primary]], Gingrich was ultimately unable to win enough primaries to sustain a viable candidacy, he withdrew from the race in May 2012 and endorsed eventual nominee [[Mitt Romney]].

Gingrich received a B.A. degree in history from [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]] in 1965. He went on to graduate study at [[Tulane University]], earning an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1968) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in European history (1971).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/newt-gingrich|title=Newt Gingrich|publisher=Answers.com|accessdate=May 12, 2011|archive-date=May 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510031116/http://www.answers.com/topic/newt-gingrich|url-status=live}}</ref> He spent six months in [[Brussels]] in 1969–70 working on his dissertation, ''Belgian Education Policy in the Congo 1945–1960.''<ref>{{cite news |last=Norman |first=Laurence |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2012/01/18/newt-gingrichs-brussels-digs |title=Newt Gingrich's Brussels Digs |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 18, 2011 |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |archive-date=January 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120213512/http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2012/01/18/newt-gingrichs-brussels-digs/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Gingrich received [[Selective Service System|deferments]] from the military during the years of the [[Vietnam War]] for being a student and a father. In 1985, he stated, "Given everything I believe in, a large part of me thinks I should have gone over."<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Vanity Fair |title=Good Newt, Bad Newt |last=Boyer |first=Peter J. |date=July 1989 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newt/boyernewt1.html |access-date=September 6, 2017 |archive-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917091055/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newt/boyernewt1.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1970, Gingrich joined the history department at [[University of West Georgia|West Georgia College]] as an assistant professor. In 1974, he moved to the geography department and was instrumental in establishing an [[interdisciplinary]] [[environmental studies]] program, which put him on the university's [[Academic tenure in North America|tenure track]]. He left the college in 1978 when he was elected to Congress.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203735304577167041714568630 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Williamson |title=Gingrich's college records show a professor hatching big plans |date=January 18, 2012 |access-date=August 8, 2017 |archive-date=June 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630185304/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203735304577167041714568630 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Early political career ==
Gingrich was the southern regional director for [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Republican primaries]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Chameleon |first=Ed |last=Kilgore |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/84568/kilgore-gingrich-liberal-policies |magazine=The New Republic |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archive-date=March 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306165723/http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/84568/kilgore-gingrich-liberal-policies |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Congressional campaigns ===
In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1974|1974]], Gingrich made his first bid for political office as the Republican candidate in {{ushr|Georgia|6}}, which stretched from the southern [[Atlanta]] suburbs to the [[Alabama]] state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat [[John James Flynt, Jr.|Jack Flynt]] by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, but was unable to overcome Flynt's lead in the more urban areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=31926 |title=Race details for 1974 election [in 6th District] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195814/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=31926 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref> Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts.

Gingrich sought a rematch against Flynt in 1976. While the Republicans did slightly better in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1976|1976 House elections]] than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]] was former Governor of Georgia [[Jimmy Carter]].

In 1983, Gingrich founded the Conservative Opportunity Society (COS), a group that included young conservative House Republicans. Early COS members included [[Robert Smith Walker]], [[Judd Gregg]], [[Dan Coats]] and [[Connie Mack III]]. The group gradually expanded to include several dozen representatives,<ref name=Balz>{{cite news |title=Gingrich, allies made waves and impression; conservative rebels harassed the house |first=Charles R. |last=Babcock |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 20, 1994 |page=A1}}</ref> who met each week to exchange and develop ideas.<ref name="Roberts" />

Gingrich's analysis of polls and public opinion identified the group's initial focus.<ref name=Balz/> [[Ronald Reagan]] adopted the "opportunity society" ideas for his 1984 re-election campaign, supporting the group's conservative goals on economic growth, education, crime, and social issues.

Gingrich and others in the House, including the newly minted [[Gang of Seven]], railed against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control. The [[House banking scandal]] and [[Congressional Post Office scandal]] were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank.

Due to population increases recorded in the 1990 United States Census, Georgia picked up an additional seat for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|1992 U.S. House elections]]. However, the Democratic-controlled [[Georgia General Assembly]], under the leadership of fiercely partisan Speaker of the House [[Tom Murphy (U.S. politician)|Tom Murphy]], specifically targeted Gingrich, eliminating the district Gingrich represented.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/20murphy.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Brenda |last=Goodman |title=Tom B.

Gingrich remarked that "The Speaker, by raising money and gerrymandering, has sincerely dedicated a part of his career to wiping me out."<ref name="NYT" />

At the same time, the Assembly created a new, heavily Republican 6th District in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] counties in the wealthy northern suburbs of Atlanta—an area that Gingrich had never represented. Gingrich sold his home in Carrollton and moved to [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] in the new 6th. His primary opponent, State Representative Herman Clark, made an issue out of Gingrich's 22&nbsp;overdraft checks in the House Bank Scandal, and also criticized Gingrich for moving into the district.

In the November 1994 elections, Republicans gained 54 seats and took control of the House for the first time since 1954. Long-time [[House Minority Leader]] [[Bob Michel]] of [[Illinois]] had not run for re-election, giving Gingrich, the highest-ranking Republican returning to Congress, the inside track at becoming Speaker.

Gingrich frequently questioned the patriotism of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States. Gingrich furthermore oversaw several major government shutdowns.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions |title=How a Democracy Dies |magazine=The New Republic |access-date=April 12, 2018 |archive-date=December 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211105538/https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems |title=''How Democracies Die'' authors say Trump is a symptom of 'deeper problems' |publisher=NPR |access-date=April 12, 2018 |archive-date=December 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181208011203/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/ |title=The rising pressures on American democracy |date=January 29, 2018 |newspaper=Harvard Gazette |access-date=April 12, 2018 |archive-date=November 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130201624/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":3" />

University of Maryland political scientist Lilliana Mason uses Gingrich's instructions to Republicans to use words such as “betray, bizarre, decay, destroy, devour, greed, lie, pathetic, radical, selfish, shame, sick, steal, and traitors” about Democrats as an example of a breach in social norms and exacerbation of partisan prejudice.<ref name=":0" /> Gingrich is a key figure in the 2017 book ''The Polarizers'' by Colgate University political scientist Sam Rosenfeld about the American political system's shift to polarization and gridlock.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo24660595.html|title=The Polarizers|last=Rosenfeld|first=Sam|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2017|access-date=October 6, 2018|archive-date=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115061143/https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo24660595.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Rosenfeld describes Gingrich as follows, "For Gingrich, responsible party principles were paramount... From the outset, he viewed the congressional minority party's role in terms akin to those found in parliamentary systems, prioritizing drawing stark programmatic contrasts over engaging the majority party as junior participants in governance."<ref name=":1" />

Boston College political scientist David Hopkins writes that Gingrich helped to nationalize American politics in a way where Democratic politicians on the state and local level were increasingly tied to the national Democratic party and President Clinton. Hopkins notes that Gingrich's view<ref name=":8" />

<blockquote>directly contradicted the conventional wisdom of politics... that parties in a two-party system achieve increasing electoral success as they move closer to the ideological center... Gingrich and his allies believed that an organized effort to intensify the ideological contrast between the congressional parties would allow the Republicans to make electoral inroads in the South. They worked energetically to tie individual Democratic incumbents to the party's more liberal national leadership while simultaneously raising highly charged cultural issues in Congress, such as proposed constitutional amendments to allow prayer in public schools and to ban the burning of the American flag, on which conservative positions were widely popular – especially among southern voters. </blockquote>

Gingrich's view was however vindicated with the Republican Party's success in the 1994 U.S. midterm elections, sometimes referred to as the "Gingrich Revolution."<ref name=":8" /> Hopkins writes, "More than any speaker before or since, Gingrich had become both the strategic architect and public face of his party."<ref name=":8" /> One consequence of the increasing nationalization of politics was that moderate Republican incumbents in blue states were left more vulnerable to electoral defeat.<ref name=":8" />

According to University of Texas political scientist Sean M. Theriault, Gingrich had a profound influence on other Republican lawmakers, in particular those who served with him in the House, as they adopted his obstructionist tactics.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-gingrich-senators-9780199307456?cc=is&lang=en&#|title=The Gingrich Senators: The Roots of Partisan Warfare in Congress|last=Theriault|first=Sean M.|date=May 23, 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199307456|location=Oxford, New York|access-date=October 6, 2018|archive-date=November 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122012735/https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-gingrich-senators-9780199307456?cc=is&lang=en&|url-status=live}}</ref> A 2011 study by Theriault and Duke University political scientist [[David W.

=== Legislation ===

==== Welfare reform ====
A central pledge of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s campaign was to reform the welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the [[Clinton Administration]] appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a [[universal health care]] program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill in as little as 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Clinton Puzzle: How to Delay Welfare Reform Yet Seem to Pursue It |first=Jason |last=DeParle |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 5, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/us/clinton-puzzle-how-to-delay-welfare-reform-yet-seem-to-pursue-it.html |accessdate=October 28, 2010 |archive-date=May 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112326/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/us/clinton-puzzle-how-to-delay-welfare-reform-yet-seem-to-pursue-it.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients.<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Connor |first=Brendan |title=The protagonists and ideas behind the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996: The enactment of a conservative welfare system |journal=Social Justice |date=Winter 2001}}</ref> The bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glass |first1=Andrew |title=Clinton signs 'Welfare to Work' bill, Aug. 22, 1996 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/22/clinton-signs-welfare-to-work-bill-aug-22-1996-790321 |website=politico.com |publisher=Politico, LLC |accessdate=4 March 2020 |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304010642/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/22/clinton-signs-welfare-to-work-bill-aug-22-1996-790321 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In his 1998 book ''Lessons Learned the Hard Way'', Gingrich encouraged volunteerism and spiritual renewal, placing more importance on families, creating tax incentives and reducing regulations for businesses in poor neighborhoods, and increasing property ownership by low-income families. He also praised [[Habitat for Humanity]] for sparking the movement to improve people's lives by helping them build their own homes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way: A Personal Report |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=74–85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34J4AAAAMAAJ |accessdate=March 18, 2014 |archive-date=August 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806184804/https://books.google.com/books?id=34J4AAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Balancing the federal budget ====
A key aspect of the 1994 [[Contract with America]] was the promise of a [[United States federal budget|balanced federal budget]]. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress would not be able to draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gingrich concedes he can't force balanced budget in 1996 |first=Ceci |last=Connolly |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=January 25, 1996}}</ref>

By May 1997, Republican congressional leaders reached a compromise with Democrats and President Clinton on the federal budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152&nbsp;billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years.<ref name=taxcuts>{{cite news|title=Clinton Lauds Bipartisanship Behind Budget; He Signs Bills That Will Cut Taxes For Many.|first=Marsha|last=Mercer|agency=Media General News Service|newspaper=Richmond Times Dispatch|date=August 6, 1997}}</ref> Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115&nbsp;billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24&nbsp;billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the [[working poor]], tax credits for college tuition, and a $2&nbsp;billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clinton, GOP leaders craft budget package; Deal would erase shortfall by 2002, cut taxes by $ 85b |first=Brian |last=McGrory |newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=May 3, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Clinton signs balanced budget, tax break law.|first=Sonya|last=Ross|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=August 5, 1997}}</ref>

President Clinton signed the budget legislation in August 1997. At the signing, Gingrich gave credit to ordinary Americans stating, "It was their political will that brought the two parties together."<ref name=taxcuts />

In early 1998, with the economy performing better than expected, increased tax revenues helped reduce the federal budget deficit to below $25&nbsp;billion. Clinton submitted a balanced budget for 1999, three years ahead of schedule originally proposed, making it the first time the federal budget had been balanced since 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/budget/stories/010698.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com: Clinton to Propose '99 Balanced Budget|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=September 22, 2019|archive-date=September 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922074403/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/budget/stories/010698.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ====
In 1997, President Clinton signed into effect the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]], which included the largest [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]] cut in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filetax.com/97taxact.html#home |title=Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 |publisher=Filetax.com |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712205931/http://www.filetax.com/97taxact.html |archive-date=July 12, 2008 }}</ref> There were also reductions in a number of other taxes on investment gains.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reaganomics: What We Learned|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704364004576132473777840938|first=Arthur B.|last=Laffer|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 10, 2011|access-date=August 8, 2017|archive-date=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827125915/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704364004576132473777840938|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=FindLaw>{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997: An Overview of Selected Provisions|url=http://library.findlaw.com/1997/Jan/1/126242.html|author1=Buchanan Ingersoll|author2=Rooney PC|name-list-style=amp|work=FindLaw|accessdate=May 5, 2011|archive-date=April 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425045452/http://library.findlaw.com/1997/Jan/1/126242.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Additionally, the act raised the value of inherited [[Estate (law)|estates]] and gifts that could be sheltered from taxation.<ref name=FindLaw /> Gingrich has been credited with creating the agenda for the reduction in capital gains tax, especially in the "Contract with America", which set out to balance the budget and implement decreases in estate and capital gains tax. Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with Clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate,<ref>{{cite news |title=Like him or not, Gingrich deserves credit for budget |first=John |last=Farmer |newspaper=The Star-Ledger |location=Newark, New Jersey |date=August 4, 1997}}</ref> however Gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the Republican Congress in the face of opposition from the Clinton administration.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gingrich sees life in GOP revolution|first=John|last=Marelius|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=August 19, 1997}}</ref> Gingrich along with [[Bob Dole]] had earlier set-up the [[Kemp Commission]], headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [[Jack Kemp]], a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1042061 |title=Kemp Commission |publisher=Npr.org |date=January 17, 1996 |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618104408/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1042061 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=two>{{cite journal |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/1996/0205taxes_gale/19960205.pdf |title=The Kemp Commission and the Future of Tax Reform |first=William |last=Gale |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |date=February 5, 1996|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103100614/http://www3.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/1996/0205taxes_gale/19960205.pdf |archive-date=November 3, 2007}}</ref>

==== Other legislation ====
Among the first pieces of legislation passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]], which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to remove some of the entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.<ref>{{cite news |title='Contract' fulfilled, but job isn't finished; GOP keeps up fast pace in Congress |first=Laurie |last=Kellman |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=April 7, 1995}}</ref>

=== Government shutdown ===
{{Main|United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996}}

Gingrich and the incoming Republican majority's promise to slow the rate of government spending conflicted with the president's agenda for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], education, the [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[public health]], leading to two temporary shutdowns of the federal government totaling 28 days.<ref name=fram>{{cite news |title=Clinton vetoes borrowing bill—government shutdown nears as rhetoric continues to roil |first=Alan |last=Fram |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951113&slug=2152355 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 13, 1995 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archive-date=May 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523001904/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951113&slug=2152355 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Clinton said Republican amendments would strip the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] of its ability to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.<ref name=fram />

A GOP amendment opposed by Clinton would not only have increased [[Medicare (United States)#Part B: Medical insurance|Medicare Part&nbsp;B]] premiums, but it would also cancel a scheduled reduction. The Republicans held out for an increase in Medicare Part&nbsp;B premiums in January 1996 to $53.50 a month. Clinton favored the then current law, which was to let the premium that seniors pay drop to $42.50.<ref name=fram/>

The government closed most non-essential offices during the shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history at the time. The shutdown ended when Clinton agreed to submit a CBO-approved balanced budget plan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Record-breaking federal shutdown ends |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9601/budget/01-06/pm/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=January 6, 1996 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archive-date=January 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120220139/http://www.cnn.com/US/9601/budget/01-06/pm/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the crisis, Gingrich's public image suffered from the perception that the Republicans' hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of Gingrich by Clinton during a flight on Air Force One to and from [[Yitzhak Rabin]]'s funeral in Israel.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=DeLay |first1=Tom |author-link1=Tom DeLay |author2=Stephen Mansfield |title=No Retreat, No Surrender: One American's Fight |page=112}}</ref> That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich, while being questioned by [[Lars-Erik Nelson]] at a ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' breakfast, said that he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight.<ref name="columbia">{{cite web |url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may01/may01_profile_nelson.html |title=''Lars-Erik Nelson '64: A Subversive Among Cynics'' |publisher=Columbia University |access-date=October 15, 2013 |archive-date=October 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173906/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may01/may01_profile_nelson.html |url-status=live }}</ref> He complained that he and Dole were instructed to use the plane's rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was "part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9511/debt_limit/11-16/budget_gingrich |title=White House: Gingrich comment "bizarre" |publisher=CNN |date=November 16, 1995 |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |archive-date=April 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415225750/http://www.cnn.com/US/9511/debt_limit/11-16/budget_gingrich/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In response to Gingrich's complaint that they were "forced to use the rear door," NBC news released their videotape footage showing both Gingrich and Dole disembarking at Tel Aviv just behind Clinton via the front stairway.<ref name=Seattle-Times-111695>{{cite news |title=Gingrich: Snub caused impasse – treatment on Air Force One blamed |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951116&slug=2152925 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 16, 1995 |accessdate=January 5, 2013 |archive-date=November 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125051641/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951116&slug=2152925 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Discussing the impact of the government shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, "Everybody in Washington thinks that was a big mistake. They're exactly wrong.

=== Leadership challenge ===
[[File:Dick Gephardt.jpg|thumb|[[Dick Gephardt]] tried to replace Gingrich as Speaker of the House]]
In the summer of 1997, several House Republicans attempted to replace him as Speaker, claiming Gingrich's public image was a liability. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting of Republican conference chairman [[John Boehner]] of [[Ohio]] and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out.

However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN |title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |archive-date=January 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121040531/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker. This would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Democrat [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. 

On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to his position{{snd}}by Gingrich{{snd}}instead of elected.<ref name=Lessons159>{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34J4AAAAMAAJ |accessdate=March 18, 2014 |archive-date=August 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806184804/https://books.google.com/books?id=34J4AAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> Gingrich accepted Paxon's resignation and directed Paxon to immediately vacate his leadership office space.<ref name=Lessons159/><ref>{{Cite news|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=1997-07-21|title=Paxon Says He Doesn't Want Speaker's Post Despite Revolt|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/21/us/paxon-says-he-doesn-t-want-speaker-s-post-despite-revolt.html|access-date=2020-06-10|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=June 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200610132953/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/21/us/paxon-says-he-doesn-t-want-speaker-s-post-despite-revolt.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=AllPolitics - Paxon Resigns From GOP Leadership - July 17, 1997|url=https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/17/paxon.gingrich/|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.cnn.com|archive-date=September 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907031540/https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/17/paxon.gingrich/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Resignation ===
In 1998, Gingrich's private polls had given his fellow Republicans the impression that pushing the [[Clinton-Lewinsky scandal]] would damage Clinton's popularity and result in the party winning a net total of six to thirty seats in the House of Representatives.

The day after the election, a Republican caucus ready to rebel against him prompted his resignation of the speakership. He also announced his intended and eventual full departure from the House a few weeks later. In January 1999 he resigned his seat.<ref name="nytimes1998">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/08/us/the-speaker-steps-down-excerpts-from-phone-call-about-gingrich-s-future.html |title=The Speaker Steps Down |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804035421/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/08/us/the-speaker-steps-down-excerpts-from-phone-call-about-gingrich-s-future.html |archive-date=August 4, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 8, 1998}}</ref> When relinquishing the speakership, Gingrich referred to other Republicans when he said he was "not willing to preside over people who are [[cannibal]]s".<ref name="nytimes1998"/>

== Post-speakership ==
Gingrich has since remained involved in national politics and public policy debate.  [[McKay Coppins]] of ''The Atlantic'' summarized time with Gingrich in 2018:

<blockquote>[Gingrich] is dabbling in geopolitics, dining in fine Italian restaurants. When he feels like traveling, he crisscrosses the Atlantic in business class, opining on the issues of the day from bicontinental TV studios and giving speeches for $600 a minute. There is time for reading, and writing, and midday zoo trips—and even he will admit, "It's a very fun life." The world may be burning, but Newt Gingrich is enjoying the spoils.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Coppins, McKay |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/ |title=How Newt Gingrich destroyed ... |magazine=The Atlantic |date=November 2018 <!-- 15 October 2018 --> |access-date=October 16, 2018 |archive-date=October 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015211803/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/ |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

In 2003, he founded the [[Center for Health Transformation]]. Gingrich supported the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003, creating the [[Medicare Part D]] federal prescription drugs benefit program. Some conservatives have criticized him for favoring the plan, due to its cost. However, Gingrich has remained a supporter, stating in a 2011 interview that it was a necessary modernization of Medicare, which was created before pharmaceutical drugs became standard in medical care. He has said that the increase in cost from medication must be seen as preventive, leading to reduced need for medical procedures.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gingrich Says He Doesn't Regret Supporting Medicare Drug Plan Which Is Now a $7.2&nbsp;Trillion Unfunded Liability |first=Nicholas |last=Ballasy |url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/gingrich-no-regret-supporting-medicare-p |work=CNS News |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321135854/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/gingrich-no-regret-supporting-medicare-p |archive-date=March 21, 2011}}</ref> In a May 15, 2011, interview on Meet the Press, Gingrich repeated his long-held belief that "all of us have a responsibility to pay—help pay for health care", and suggested this could be implemented by either a mandate to obtain health insurance or a requirement to post a bond ensuring coverage.<ref name="WaPo20110516">{{Cite news |title=Gingrich calls Medicare voucher proposal 'right-wing social engineering{{'-}} |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gingrich-calls-medicare-voucher-proposal-right-wing-social-engineering/2011/05/15/AFHhoR4G_story.html |date=May 16, 2011 |first1=Emi |last1=Kolawole |newspaper=The Washington Post |first2=Rachel |last2=Weiner |accessdate=May 17, 2011 |archive-date=January 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106121639/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gingrich-calls-medicare-voucher-proposal-right-wing-social-engineering/2011/05/15/AFHhoR4G_story.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="PoliticoMarr20110516">{{cite news |title=Newt Gingrich's rough roll-out |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55082.html |date=May 16, 2011 |first=Kendra |last=Marr |newspaper=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |accessdate=May 17, 2011 |archive-date=May 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518144432/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55082.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In the same interview Gingrich said "I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering.

Gingrich has taken a dim view of [[Multilateralism|internationalism]] and the [[United Nations]]. He said in 2015, "after several years of looking at the UN, I can report to you that it is sufficiently corrupt and sufficiently inefficient.

In 2007, Gingrich authored a book, ''[[Rediscovering God in America]]'', arguing that the [[Founding Fathers]] actively intended the new republic to not only allow, but encourage, religious expression in the public square. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Following publication of the book, he was invited by [[Jerry Falwell]] to be the speaker for the second time at Liberty University's graduation, on May 19, 2007, due to Gingrich having "dedicated much of his time to calling [the United States of] America back to our Christian heritage".<ref name=newsmaxfalwell>Falwell, Jerry.

Gingrich's later books take a large-scale policy focus, including ''Winning the Future'', and the most recent, ''[[To Save America]]''. Gingrich has identified education as "the number one factor in our future prosperity", and has partnered with [[Al Sharpton]] and Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] on education issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/33931557 |title=Meet the Press Transcript |first=David |last=Gregory |date=November 15, 2009 |work=Meet the Press |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 15, 2020 |archive-date=November 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122132246/https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna33931557 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although he previously opposed gay marriage, in December 2012, Gingrich suggested that Republicans should reconsider their opposition to it.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/20/newt-gingrich-republicans-gay-marriage| title=Newt Gingrich urges Republicans to rethink opposition to gay marriage| newspaper=The Guardian| date=December 20, 2012| last1=McCarthy| first1=Tom| access-date=December 17, 2016| archive-date=February 6, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206154501/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/20/newt-gingrich-republicans-gay-marriage| url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 21, 2016, Gingrich argued that members of [[NATO]] "ought to worry" about a U.S. commitment to their defense.
