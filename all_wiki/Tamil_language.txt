[[File:Tamil inscriptions.jpg|thumb|Tamil inscriptions on a pillar in a large temple]]

According to linguists like [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]], Tamil, as a Dravidian language, descends from [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian]], a [[proto-language]]. Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the third [[millennium]] BC, possibly in the region around the lower [[Godavari]] river basin in peninsular India. The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the [[Neolithic]] complexes of [[South India]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Southworth|2005|pp=249–250}}</ref> The earliest [[Tamil-Brahmi|epigraphic]] attestations of Tamil are generally taken to have been written from the 2nd century BC.<ref>{{Harvnb|Southworth|2005|pp=250–251}}</ref>

=== Etymology ===
The earliest extant Tamil literary works and their commentaries celebrate the [[Pandiyan Kingdom|Pandiyan Kings]] for the organization of long-termed [[Tamil Sangams]], which researched, developed and made amendments in Tamil language. Even though the name of the language which was developed by these [[Tamil Sangams]] is mentioned as Tamil, the period when the name "Tamil" came to be applied to the language is unclear, as is the precise etymology of the name. The earliest attested use of the name is found in [[Tholkappiyam]], which is dated as early as late 2nd century BC.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zvelebil|1992|p=x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Zvelebil|first=Kamil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=degUAAAAIAAJ&q=info:3mNeiVqlnhoJ:scholar.google.com/&pg=PR9|title=The Smile of Murugan: On Tamil Literature of South India|date=1973|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-03591-1|language=en}}</ref>

Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of {{IAST|tamiḻ}} < {{IAST|tam-iḻ}} < *{{IAST|tav-iḻ}} < *{{IAST|tak-iḻ}}, meaning in origin "the proper process (of speaking)".<ref>{{Harvnb|Zvelebil|1992|p=ix–xvi}}</ref>

=== Old Tamil ===
{{Main|Old Tamil language}}
Old Tamil is the period of the Tamil language spanning the 3rd century BC to the 8th century AD. The earliest records in Old Tamil are short inscriptions from between the 3rd and 2nd century BC in caves and on pottery. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the [[Brahmi script]] called [[Tamil-Brahmi]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mahadevan|2003|pp=90–95}}</ref> The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]'', an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could be as old as the late 2nd century BC.<ref name="Lehmann 1998 75"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Zvelebil|first=Kamil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=degUAAAAIAAJ&q=info:3mNeiVqlnhoJ:scholar.google.com/&pg=PR9|title=The Smile of Murugan: On Tamil Literature of South India|date=1973|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-03591-1|language=en}}</ref> Many literary works in Old Tamil have also survived. These include a corpus of 2,381 poems collectively known as [[Sangam literature]]. These poems are usually dated to between the 1st century BC and 5th century AD.<ref name="Lehmann 1998 75"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Zvelebil|first=Kamil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=degUAAAAIAAJ&q=info:3mNeiVqlnhoJ:scholar.google.com/&pg=PR9|title=The Smile of Murugan: On Tamil Literature of South India|date=1973|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-03591-1|language=en}}</ref>

=== Middle Tamil ===
{{Main|Middle Tamil language}}
[[File:Tanjavur Tamil Inscription2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Tamil inscriptions in [[Vatteluttu|Vatteluttu script]] in stone during [[Chola empire|Chola]] period c.1000 AD at [[Brahadeeswara temple]] in [[Thanjavur]], Tamil Nadu.]]
The evolution of [[Old Tamil]] into [[Middle Tamil]], which is generally taken to have been completed by the 8th century,<ref name="Lehmann 1998 75"/> was characterised by a number of phonological and grammatical changes. In phonological terms, the most important shifts were the virtual disappearance of the aytam (ஃ), an old phoneme,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kuiper|1958|p=194}}</ref> the coalescence of the alveolar and dental nasals,<ref>{{Harvnb|Meenakshisundaran|1965|pp=132–133}}</ref> and the transformation of the alveolar [[plosive]] into a [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kuiper|1958|pp=213–215}}</ref> In grammar, the most important change was the emergence of the present tense. The present tense evolved out of the verb ''{{IAST|kil}}'' ({{lang|ta|கில்}}), meaning "to be possible" or "to befall". In Old Tamil, this verb was used as an [[Grammatical aspect|aspect marker]] to indicate that an action was micro-durative, non-sustained or non-lasting, usually in combination with a time marker such as ''{{IAST|ṉ}}'' ({{lang|ta|ன்}}). In Middle Tamil, this usage evolved into a present tense marker – ''{{IAST|kiṉṟa}}'' ({{lang|ta|கின்ற}}) – which combined the old aspect and time markers.<ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.2307/601707| jstor = 601707| title = The Duration of an Action-Real or Aspectual?

S.}} at pp. 284–285</ref>

=== Modern Tamil ===
The [[Nannul]] remains the standard normative grammar for modern literary Tamil, which therefore continues to be based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shapiro|Schiffman|1983|p=2}}</ref> Colloquial spoken Tamil, in contrast, shows a number of changes. The negative conjugation of verbs, for example, has fallen out of use in Modern Tamil<ref>{{Harvnb|Annamalai|Steever|1998|p=100}}</ref> – instead, negation is expressed either morphologically or syntactically.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steever|2005|pp=107–8}}</ref> Modern spoken Tamil also shows a number of sound changes, in particular, a tendency to lower high vowels in initial and medial positions,<ref>{{Harvnb|Meenakshisundaran|1965|p=125}}</ref> and the disappearance of vowels between plosives and between a plosive and rhotic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Meenakshisundaran|1965|pp=122–123}}</ref>

Contact with European languages affected written and spoken Tamil. Changes in written Tamil include the use of European-style punctuation and the use of consonant clusters that were not permitted in Middle Tamil. The syntax of written Tamil has also changed, with the introduction of new aspectual auxiliaries and more complex sentence structures, and with the emergence of a more rigid word order that resembles the [[Theta role|syntactic argument structure]] of English.<ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.1515/ijsl.1978.16.59| title = Standard Language and Socio-Historical Parameters: Standard Lankan Tamil| journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language| volume = 1978| issue = 16| year = 1978| last1 = Kandiah | first1 = T. | s2cid = 143499414}} at pp. 65–69</ref> Simultaneously, a strong strain of [[linguistic purism]] emerged in the early 20th century, culminating in the [[Pure Tamil Movement]] which called for removal of all Sanskritic elements from Tamil.<ref name="thaniththamizh">{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|1997}}</ref> It received some support from [[Dravidian parties]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|1997}}: "Dravidianism, too, lent its support to the contestatory classicist project, motivated principally by the political imperative of countering (Sanskritic) Indian nationalism...

== Geographic distribution ==
Tamil is the primary language of the majority of the people residing in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Puducherry]], (in India) and in the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern]] and [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern]] provinces of [[Sri Lanka]]. The language is spoken among small minority groups in other states of India which include [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]], [[Maharashtra]] and in certain regions of Sri Lanka such as [[Colombo]] and [[Central Province, Sri Lanka|the hill country]]. Tamil or dialects of it were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century AD. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in southern [[Andhra Pradesh]] districts of [[Chittoor district|Chittoor]] and [[Nellore district|Nellore]] until the 12th century AD.<ref>{{Harvnb|Talbot|2001|pp=27–37}}</ref> Tamil was used for inscriptions from the 10th through 14th centuries in southern Karnataka districts such as [[Kolar District|Kolar]], [[Mysore]], [[Mandya]] and [[Bangalore]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Murthy|Rao|Veluthat|Bari|1990|pp=85–106}}</ref>

=== Region-specific variations ===

The [[Socio-linguistics|socio-linguistic]] situation of Tamil is characterised by [[diglossia]]: there are two separate registers varying by [[socioeconomic status]], a high register and a low one.<ref>Arokianathan, S. [http://www.ciil-ebooks.net/html/piil/acharya2.html Writing and Diglossic: A Case Study of Tamil Radio Plays] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092717/https://www.ciil-ebooks.net/html/piil/acharya2.html |date=28 September 2007 }}. ciil-ebooks.net</ref><ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.2307/414796| jstor = 414796| title = Diglossia: A Study of the Theory, with Application to Tamil| journal = Language| volume = 64| issue = 1| pages = 152–155| year = 1988| last1 = Steever | first1 = S. B. | last2 = Britto | first2 = F. }}</ref> Tamil dialects are primarily differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. For example, the word for "here"—''{{IAST|iṅku}}'' in ''Centamil'' (the classic variety)—has evolved into ''{{IAST |iṅkū}}'' in the Kongu dialect of [[Coimbatore]], ''inga'' in the dialect of [[Thanjavur]],  and ''{{IAST |iṅkai}}'' in some [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects|dialects of Sri Lanka]]. Old Tamil's ''{{IAST|iṅkaṇ}}'' (where ''{{IAST|kaṇ}}'' means place) is the source of ''{{IAST |iṅkane}}'' in the dialect of [[Tirunelveli]], Old Tamil ''{{IAST |iṅkiṭṭu}}'' is the source of ''{{IAST |iṅkuṭṭu}}'' in the dialect of [[Madurai]],  and ''{{IAST |iṅkaṭe}}'' in some northern dialects. Even now, in the Coimbatore area, it is common to hear "{{IAST|akkaṭṭa}}" meaning "that place". Although Tamil dialects do not differ significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in Sri Lanka retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India,<ref name="Lehmann 1998 75"/><ref name=as>{{Harvnb|Annamalai|Steever|1998|pp=100–28}}</ref> and use many other words slightly differently.<ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.1163/000000066790086440| title = Some features of Ceylon Tamil| journal = Indo-Iranian Journal| volume = 9| issue = 2| page = 113| year = 1966| last1 = Zvelebil | first1 = K. }}</ref> Tamil dialects include [[Central Tamil dialect]], [[Kongu Tamil]], [[Madras Bashai]], [[Madurai Tamil]], [[Nellai Tamil]], [[Kumari tamil]] in [[India]] and [[Batticaloa Tamil dialect]], [[Jaffna Tamil dialect]], [[Negombo Tamil dialect]] in Sri Lanka. [[Sankethi dialect]] in Karnataka has been heavily influenced by [[Kannada]].

==== Loanword variations ====
{{See also|Indo-Aryan loanwords in Tamil|Loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil}}
The dialect of the district of [[Palakkad]] in Kerala has many [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax, and has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from [[Kanyakumari district]] is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. [[Hebbar Iyengars|Hebbar]] and [[Mandyam]] dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] who migrated to [[Karnataka]] in the 11th century, retain many features of the ''Vaishnava paribasai'', a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values.<ref>Thiru.

}}
In addition to its dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language (''{{IAST|sankattamiḻ}}''), a modern literary and formal style (''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}''), and a modern [[colloquial]] form (''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}''). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}'' with a vocabulary drawn from ''{{IAST|caṅkattamiḻ}}'', or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}''.<ref>Schiffman, Harold (1997). "[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/handbuk.html Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation]", in Florian Coulmas (ed.), ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd. pp. 205 ff.</ref>

In modern times, ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}'' is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of [[Tamil literature]] and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'' has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}''. Most contemporary cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'', and many politicians use it to bring themselves closer to their audience. The increasing use of ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'' in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial ‘standard' spoken dialects. In India, the ‘standard' ''{{IAST|koṭuntamiḻ}}'', rather than on any one dialect,<ref name="Standard restandard">{{Citation | last1 = Schiffman | first1 = Harold | year = 1998 | title = Standardization or restandardization: The case for 'Standard' Spoken Tamil  | url =http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/public/stantam/STANTAM.HTM | journal = Language in Society | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 359–385 |doi=10.1017/S0047404598003030 | postscript = .}}</ref> but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of [[Thanjavur]] and [[Madurai]]. In Sri Lanka, the standard is based on the dialect of [[Jaffna]].

[[File:History of Tamil script.jpg|thumb|upright=1.81|Historical evolution of Tamil writing from the earlier [[Tamil Brahmi]] near the top to the current [[Tamil script]] at bottom.]]
[[File:Tirukkural manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=1.81|[[Tirukkural|Thirukkural]] [[palm leaf manuscript]].]]
After [[Tamil Brahmi]] fell out of use, Tamil was written using a script called [[Vatteluttu alphabet|{{IAST|vaṭṭeḻuttu}}]] amongst others such as [[Grantha script|Grantha]] and [[Pallava script|Pallava]]. The current Tamil script consists of 12 [[vowel]]s, 18 [[consonant]]s and one special character, the ''[[āytam]]''. The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters (12 + 18 + 1 + (12 x 18)). All consonants have an inherent vowel ''a'', as with other [[Indic scripts]]. This inherent vowel is removed by adding a [[tittle]] called a ''{{IAST|puḷḷi}}'', to the consonantal sign<!--, whereas no such distinction is there in other Indic scipts-->. For example, {{lang|ta|ன}} is ''ṉa'' (with the inherent ''a'') and {{lang|ta|ன்}} is ''ṉ'' (without a vowel). Many Indic scripts have a similar sign, generically called [[virama]], but the Tamil script is somewhat different in that it nearly always uses a visible ''puḷḷi'' to indicate a 'dead consonant' (a consonant without a vowel). In other Indic scripts, it is generally preferred to use a ligature or a half form to write a syllable or a cluster containing a dead consonant, although writing it with a visible virama is also possible. The Tamil script does not differentiate voiced and unvoiced [[plosive]]s. Instead, plosives are articulated with voice depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of [[Tamil phonology]].

In addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the [[Grantha script]], which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied.<ref>{{citation|last=Fowler|first=Murray|title=The Segmental Phonemes of Sanskritized Tamil|journal=Language|volume=30|pages=360–367|doi=10.2307/410134|year=1954|jstor=410134|issue=3}} at p. 360.</ref> [[ISO 15919#Overview|ISO 15919]] is an international standard for the [[Tamil script#Letters|transliteration of Tamil]] and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. Tamil can be transliterated into English by using ISO 15919, since English language uses the [[Latin script]] for writing.

=== Numerals and symbols ===
{{Main|Tamil numerals}}

Apart from the usual numerals, Tamil has numerals for 10, 100 and 1000. Symbols for day, month, year, debit, credit, as above, rupee, and numeral are present as well. Tamil also uses several historical fractional signs.

Tamil phonology is characterised by the presence of [[retroflex consonant]]s and multiple [[Rhotic consonant|rhotics]]. Tamil does not distinguish phonologically between voiced and unvoiced consonants; phonetically, voice is assigned depending on a consonant's position in a word.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Schiffman | first1=Harold F. | last2=Arokianathan | first2=S. | contribution=Diglossic variation in Tamil film and fiction | editor1-last=Krishnamurti | editor1-first=Bhadriraju | editor1-link=Bhadriraju Krishnamurti | editor2-last=Masica | editor2-first=Colin P. | editor2-link=Colin Masica | title=South Asian languages: structure, convergence, and diglossia | year=1986 | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | place=New Delhi | isbn=978-81-208-0033-5 | page=371}}</ref> Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a "secondary character", the āytam.

=== Vowels ===
Tamil has five vowel qualities, namely {{IPAslink|a}}, {{IPAslink|e}}, {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|o}} and {{IPAslink|u}}. Each may be long or short. {{IPAslink|ɯ}} is an allophone of {{IPAslink|u}} at the end of words. There are two [[diphthong]]s, {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}}. Long vowels are about twice as long as short vowels. The [[diphthong]]s are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as short vowels. Most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

=== Consonants ===

Tamil [[consonants]] are presented as hard, soft and medial in some grammars which roughly corresponds to plosives, nasals and approximants. Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not distinguish [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated and unaspirated]] consonants. In addition, the voicing of [[plosive]]s is governed by strict rules in ''{{IAST|centamiḻ}}''. Plosives are unvoiced if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming [[fricative]]s [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalically]], which means that voicing is not a phonological trait for plosives. [[Nasal stop|Nasals]] and [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] are always voiced.<ref>''See e.g.'' the pronunciation guidelines in G.U. Pope (1868). ''A Tamil hand-book, or, Full introduction to the common dialect of that language''. (3rd ed.). Madras, Higginbotham & Co.</ref>

Tamil is characterised by its use of more than one type of [[coronal consonant]]s: like many of the other languages of India, it contains a series of [[retroflex consonant]]s. Notably, the Tamil retroflex series includes the [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|/ɻ/}} ({{lang|ta|ழ}}) (example Tami'''l'''; often transcribed 'zh'), which is rare in the Indo-Aryan languages. Among the other Dravidian languages, the retroflex approximant also occurs in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] (for example in 'Ko'''zh'''ikode'), disappeared from spoken [[Kannada language|Kannada]] around 1000 AD (although the character is still written, and exists in [[Unicode]], ೞ as in ಕೊೞೆ), and was never present in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. In some dialects of colloquial Tamil, this consonant is seen as disappearing and shifting to the [[alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|/l/}}.<ref name="retroflex_consonants">{{Citation

While this distinction can still be seen in the written language, it has been largely lost in colloquial spoken Tamil, and even in literary usage the letters {{lang|ta|ந}} (dental) and {{lang|ta|ன}} (alveolar) may be seen as [[allophonic]].<ref>{{Citation | first=Harold F. | last=Schiffman | title=Phonetics of Spoken Tamil | url =http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/plc/tamilweb/book/chapter1/node5.html | pages =12–13 | year=1995 | access-date=28 August 2009|work=A Grammar of Spoken Tamil}}</ref> Likewise, the historical alveolar stop has transformed into a dental stop in many modern dialects.

The plosives are [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] when medial and after nasals. The sounds {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/ʂ/}} are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} respectively. There are well-defined rules for [[elision]] in Tamil categorised into classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.

=== Āytam ===
Classical Tamil had a phoneme called the ''[[visarga|āytam]]'', written as ‘{{lang|ta|ஃ}}'. Tamil grammarians of the time classified it as a dependent phoneme (or restricted phoneme<ref name="krishnamurti">{{harvnb|Krishnamurti|2003|p=154}}</ref>) (''{{IAST|cārpeḻuttu}}''), but it is very rare in modern Tamil. The rules of pronunciation given in the ''Tolkāppiyam'', a text on the grammar of Classical Tamil, suggest that the ''āytam'' could have [[Glottal stop|glottalised]] the sounds it was combined with. It has also been suggested that the ''āytam'' was used to represent the [[Implosive consonant|voiced implosive]] (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuiper|1958|p=191}}</ref> The āytam, in modern Tamil, is also used to convert ''p'' to ''f'' when writing English words using the Tamil script.

{{Main|Tamil grammar}}

Tamil employs [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] grammar, where suffixes are used to mark [[noun class]], [[grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical case|case]], verb [[grammatical tense|tense]] and other grammatical categories. Tamil's standard [[metalanguage|metalinguistic]] terminology and scholarly vocabulary is itself Tamil, as opposed to the [[Sanskrit]] that is standard for most [[Indo-Aryan languages|Aryan languages]].<ref name="metalanguage_zvelbil">{{Citation

Much of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]''. Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar ''{{IAST|Naṉṉūl}}''  which restated and clarified the rules of the ''Tolkāppiyam'', with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ''{{IAST|eḻuttu}}'', ''sol'', ''{{IAST|poruḷ}}'', ''yāppu'', ''{{IAST|aṇi}}''. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.<ref name="five_parts_grammar">{{Citation

</ref>

Tamil words consist of a [[lexeme|lexical root]] to which one or more [[affix]]es are attached. Most Tamil affixes are [[suffix]]es. Tamil suffixes can be [[Morphological derivation|derivational]] suffixes, which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or [[inflection]]al suffixes, which mark categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of [[agglutination]], which can lead to long words with many suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English. To give an example, the word ''pōkamuṭiyātavarkaḷukkāka'' (போகமுடியாதவர்களுக்காக) means "for the sake of those who cannot go" and consists of the following [[morpheme]]s:

=== Morphology ===
Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (''{{IAST|tiṇai}}'')—the "rational" (''{{IAST|uyartiṇai}}''), and the "irrational" (''{{transl|ta|ISO|akṟiṇai}}'')—which include a total of five classes (''pāl'', which literally means "gender"). Humans and [[deity|deities]] are classified as "rational", and all other nouns (animals, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The "rational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (''pāl'')—masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The "irrational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes: irrational singular and irrational plural. The ''pāl'' is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an [[honorific]], gender-neutral, singular form.<ref name="classes_of_nouns">{{Citation

Suffixes are used to perform the functions of [[Grammatical case|cases]] or [[postposition]]s. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in [[Sanskrit]]. These were the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[sociative case|sociative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[ablative case|ablative]]. Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial,<ref name='CaseMarkerZvelebil'>{{citation|title=Dravidian Case-Suffixes: Attempt at a Reconstruction|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 1972|first=K. V.|last=Zvelebil|volume=92|issue=2|pages=272–276 |jstor=600654|quote=The entire problem of the concept of "case" in Dravidian will be ignored in this paper. In fact, we might posit a great number of "cases" for perhaps any Dravidian language once we departed from the familiar types of paradigms forced upon us by traditional, indigenous and European grammars, especially of the literary languages. It is, for instance, sheer convention based on Tamil grammatical tradition (influenced no doubt by Sanskrit) that, as a rule, the number of cases in Tamil is given as eight.|doi=10.2307/600654}}</ref> and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case.<ref name="Standard restandard" /> Tamil nouns can take one of four [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]]: ''i'', ''a'', ''u'', and ''e'' which are functionally equivalent to the [[demonstrative]]s in English. For example, the word ''vazhi'' (வழி) meaning "way" can take these to produce ''ivvazhi'' (இவ்வழி) "this way", ''avvazhi'' (அவ்வழி) "that way", ''uvvazhi'' (உவ்வழி) "the medial way" and ''evvazhi'' (எவ்வழி) "which way".

Tamil verbs are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of [[suffix]]es, which show person, number, mood, tense, and voice.
* Person and number are indicated by suffixing the [[oblique case]] of the relevant pronoun. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from [[grammatical particle]]s, which are added to the stem.
* Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence ''undergoes'' or ''is the object of'' the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence ''directs'' the action referred to by the verb stem.
* Tamil has three simple tenses—past, present, and future—indicated by the suffixes, as well as a series of perfects indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same [[morpheme]]s which mark tense categories. Tamil verbs also mark [[evidentiality]], through the addition of the hearsay [[clitic]] ''{{IAST|ām}}.''<ref name="steeverevidentiality">{{Citation |first=Sanford B. |last=Steever | editor-last=Güldemann | editor-first=Tom | editor2-last=von Roncador | editor2-first=Manfred | contribution=Direct and indirect discourse in Tamil |title=Reported Discourse: A Meeting Ground for Different Linguistic Domains |year=2002 |page=105 | place=Amsterdam |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company   |isbn=978-90-272-2958-8}}</ref> Verb inflection is shown below using example ''aḻintukkoṇṭiruntēṉ''; (அழிந்துக்கொண்டிருந்தேன்); "(I) was being destroyed".

Traditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s, including both of them under the category ''uriccol'', although modern grammarians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds.<ref name="lehmann1989">{{Citation |last=Lehmann |first=Thomas |title=A Grammar of Modern Tamil |year=1989 |publisher=Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture |location=Pondicherry|pages= 9–11}}</ref> Tamil has many [[ideophone]]s that act as adverbs indicating the way the object in a given state "says" or "sounds".<ref>{{Citation |last=Swiderski |first = Richard M. |title=The metamorphosis of English: versions of other languages |publisher=Bergin & Garvey |location=New York |year=1996 |page=61 |isbn=978-0-89789-468-5 }}</ref>

Tamil does not have [[article (grammar)|articles]]. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context.<ref name="steeversummary">{{Harvnb|Annamalai|Steever|1998|p=109}}</ref> In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between [[Clusivity|inclusive]] pronouns {{lang|ta|நாம் }} ''{{IAST|nām}}'' (we), {{lang|ta|நமது}} ''{{IAST|namatu}}'' (our) that include the addressee and exclusive pronouns {{lang|ta|நாங்கள் }} ''{{IAST|nāṅkaḷ}}'' (we), {{lang|ta|எமது}} ''{{IAST|ematu}}'' (our) that do not.<ref name="steeversummary"/>

=== Syntax ===
Tamil is a consistently [[head-final]] language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with a typical word order of [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV).<ref name="SOV_language">{{Citation|url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/schuh/lx001/Discussion/d02.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030919235821/http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/schuh/lx001/Discussion/d02.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 September 2003 |title=Tamil is a head-final language |access-date=1 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_tml |title=WALS – Tamil |publisher=Wals.info |access-date=13 September 2012}}</ref> However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects. Tamil has [[postposition]]s rather than [[prepositions]]. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

Tamil is a [[null-subject language]]. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs, and objects. It is possible to construct grammatically valid and meaningful sentences which lack one or more of the three. For example, a sentence may only have a verb—such as ''{{IAST|muṭintuviṭṭatu}}'' ("completed")—or only a subject and object, without a verb such as ''{{IAST|atu eṉ vīṭu}}'' ("That [is] my house"). Tamil does not have a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (a linking verb equivalent to the word ''is''). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.

The vocabulary of Tamil is mainly Dravidian. A strong sense of [[linguistic purism]] is found in Modern Tamil,<ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.1017/S0010417500018673| title = En/gendering Language: The Poetics of Tamil Identity| journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History| volume = 35| issue = 4| page = 683| year = 2009| last1 = Ramaswamy | first1 = S. }}</ref> which opposes the use of foreign loanwords.<ref>{{Harvnb|Krishnamurti|2003|p=480}}.</ref> Nonetheless, a number of words used in classical and modern Tamil are loanwords from the languages of neighbouring groups, or with whom the Tamils had trading links, including [[Munda languages|Munda]] (for example, {{IAST|tavaḷai}} "frog" from Munda {{IAST|tabeg}}), [[Malay language|Malay]] (e.g. {{IAST|cavvarici}} "sago" from Malay {{IAST|sāgu}}), Chinese (for example, {{IAST|campān}} "skiff" from Chinese san-pan) and Greek (for example, {{IAST|ora}} from Greek ὥρα). In more modern times, Tamil has imported words from [[Urdu]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]], reflecting groups that have influenced the Tamil area at times, and from neighbouring languages such as [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], and Sinhala. During the modern period, words have also been adapted from European languages, such as Portuguese, French, and English.<ref>{{Harvnb|Meenakshisundaran|1965|pp=169–193}}</ref>

The strongest impact of purism in Tamil has been on words taken from Sanskrit.

In the 20th century, institutions and learned bodies have, with government support, generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing [[neologism]]s and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages.<ref name="thaniththamizh" /> As of 2019, the language had a listed vocabulary of over 470,000 unique words, including those from old literary sources. In November 2019, the state government issued an order to add 9,000 new words to the vocabulary.<ref>{{cite news

{{Main|Tamil loanwords in other languages}}

Words of Tamil origin occur in other languages. A notable example of a word in worldwide use with Dravidian (not specifically Tamil) etymology is ''[[:wikt:orange|orange]]'', via Sanskrit ''{{IAST|nāraṅga}}'' from a Dravidian predecessor of Tamil ''nartaṅkāy'' "fragrant fruit". One suggestion as to the origin of the word ''anaconda'' is the Tamil ''anaikkonda,'' "having killed an elephant".<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/anaconda “Origin and Meaning of Anaconda.”] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.</ref> [[Words of Tamil origin|Examples in English]] include ''cheroot'' (''{{IAST|churuṭṭu}}'' meaning "rolled up"),<ref name="OED">{{Citation| url = http://dictionary.oed.com| title = Oxford English Dictionary Online| access-date =14 April 2007| work = Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref> ''mango'' (from ''māngāi''),<ref name="OED"/> ''mulligatawny'' (from ''{{IAST|miḷaku taṇṇīr}}'', "pepper water"), ''pariah'' (from ''paraiyan''), ''curry'' (from ''kari''),<ref name="oed-curry">"curry, n.<sup>2</sup>", ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 14 August 2009</ref> ''catamaran'' (from ''{{IAST|kaṭṭu maram}}'', "bundled logs"),<ref name="OED"/> and ''congee'' (from ''kanji'' – rice porridge or gruel).<ref>{{citation|title=congee|url=http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/12703/congee|website=academic.ru}}</ref>
