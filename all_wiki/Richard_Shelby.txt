'''Richard Craig Shelby''' (born May 6, 1934) is an American politician serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Alabama]]. First elected to the U.S. Senate in [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 1986|1986]], he is the Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]], succeeding [[Thad Cochran]]. He previously served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Senate Committee on Rules and Administration]]. He is the longest serving U.S. Senator from Alabama, having surpassed [[John Sparkman]]'s previous record in March 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thornton |first1=William |title=Richard Shelby now Alabama's longest serving senator |url=https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/03/richard-shelby-now-alabamas-longest-serving-senator.html |accessdate=3 March 2019 |agency=AL.com |date=3 March 2019}}</ref>

Born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Shelby received his law degree from the [[Birmingham School of Law]] in 1961. After law school in 1963, he went on to serve as city prosecutor (1963–1971). During this period he worked as a [[United States magistrate judge|U.S. Magistrate]] for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama|Northern District of Alabama]] (1966–1970) and Special Assistant [[Attorney General of Alabama]] (1969–1971). He won a seat in the [[Alabama Senate]] in 1970. In 1978, he was elected from the [[Alabama's 7th congressional district|7th District]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he was among a group of [[Conservative Democrats]] known as the [[boll weevil (politics)|boll weevils]].

In [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 1986|1986]], Shelby won a tight race as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for the U.S. Senate. In 1994, the day after the [[Republican Revolution]] in which the GOP gained the majority in [[United States Congress|Congress]] midway through President [[Bill Clinton]]'s first term, Shelby switched party affiliations and became a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]. Shelby was re-elected by a large margin in [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 1998|1998]] and has faced no significant electoral opposition since. He is currently the dean of the Alabama delegation.

He attended the [[Birmingham School of Law]], where he earned his Juris Doctor in 1961. He was admitted to the [[Alabama State Bar]] on August 29, 1961. He received an [[LL.B.]] from [[The University of Alabama]] in 1963.

Shelby is a member of the [[American Bar Association]] and [[Alabama State Bar]], as well as the [[American Judicature Society]], Alabama Law Institute, [[Delta Chi]] fraternity, and [[Phi Alpha Delta]] legal fraternity.

Shelby was a city prosecutor in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] from 1963 to 1971.<ref name="wapo-members">{{cite news|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/S000320|title=Richard Shelby (R)|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> From 1966 to 1970, Shelby was a U.S. Magistrate for the Northern District of Alabama; from 1969 to 1971, he was a Special Assistant State Attorney General.

Shelby was elected to the [[Alabama Senate]] in 1970 and served until 1978. That year he ran for and was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from the Tuscaloosa-based 7th district from which Congressman [[Walter Flowers]] was retiring. He was re-elected three times. Shelby was one of the more [[Conservative Democrats]] in Congress, and a member of the [[boll weevil (politics)|boll weevils]], a group of moderate to conservative-leaning Democrats who often worked with Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]] on defense issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conservativeamerica-online.com/conservative-senators-6-richard-shelby/|title=Conservative Senators – #6 – Richard Shelby|work=conservativeamerica-online.com|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>

===Elections===
In the [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 1986|1986 U.S. Senate election in Alabama]], Shelby won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat held by Republican [[Jeremiah Denton]], the first Republican elected to the Senate from Alabama since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. He won a very close race as the Democrats regained control of the Senate. He was easily re-elected in [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 1992|1992]] even as [[Bill Clinton]] lost [[United States presidential election in Alabama, 1992|Alabama's electoral votes]].

On November 9, 1994, Shelby switched his party affiliation to Republican, one day after the [[Republican Revolution]] in which they won control of both houses in the midterm elections, giving the Republicans a 53–47 majority in the Senate. He won his first full term as a Republican in [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 1998|1998]] by a large margin. He has since faced no significant opposition in [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 2004|2004]] or [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 2010|2010]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sen.

A September 2009 poll showed Shelby had a 58% approval rating, with 35% disapproving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=be14ad40-d8e9-4c99-8100-57f0f59fa64b |title=SurveyUSA News Poll #15743 |publisher=Surveyusa.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

In 2014, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized Shelby for hoarding campaign and PAC contributions and not sharing them with other colleagues.<ref name=wp/>

=== Tenure ===

====1980s====
In 1987, Shelby opposed President Reagan's nomination of [[Robert Bork]] to the Supreme Court, a move attributed to lobbying by Alabama African-American leaders who reminded Shelby that he had relied on support from black voters in narrowly defeating Denton in 1986. However, in 1991, Shelby supported President George H. W. Bush's conservative Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/55748032.html?dids=55748032:55748032&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+05%2C+1987&author=Bob+Minzesheimer&pub=USA+TODAY+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=President+to+stick+with+Bork+to+end&pqatl=google |work=USA TODAY |title=President to stick with Bork to end |first=Bob |last=Minzesheimer |date=October 5, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/104734077.html?dids=104734077:104734077&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+07%2C+1987&author=By+Susan+Page.+Newsday+Washington+Bureau&pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&desc=Heflin%3A+When+in+Doubt%2C+Don%27t&pqatl=google |title=Heflin: When in Doubt, Don't |date=October 7, 1987}}</ref>

====1990s====
In 1991, Shelby sponsored legislation granting federal recognition to the [[MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians]]. Though confident it would pass, Shelby stressed the "need to get more documentation regarding establishment of their tribal identity." The Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs voted 11 to 2 in favor of the legislation on July 18.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/us/new-ways-to-recognize-tribes-split-indians.html|title=New Ways to Recognize Tribes Split Indians|date=August 4, 1991|work=New York Times}}</ref>

Shelby publicly feuded with President [[Bill Clinton]] during the first half of Clinton's first term. At a meeting with Vice President [[Al Gore]], he turned to the TV cameras and denounced the Clinton program as "high on taxes, low on [spending] cuts".<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/107016266/ ''Indianapolis Star'', March 19, 1997, p.&nbsp;7].</ref>

Shelby served on the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] from 1995 to 2003, stepping down because of a Senate rule limiting committee terms to eight years. Shelby took an adversarial stance toward the intelligence community during both Clinton and Bush administrations. He helped sink [[Anthony Lake]]'s nomination as CIA director in 1997 and promised to investigate the use of American-made satellites by the Chinese to gather intelligence. Shelby took a hard line on leaks of classified information. In 2000 he introduced a bill (vetoed by President Clinton) "that would have broadened the law that criminalizes release of national defense information."<ref name=Pincus>[[Walter Pincus|Pincus, Walter]] (February 17, 2006) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/16/AR2006021602186.html Senator May Seek Tougher Law on Leaks], ''[[Washington Post]]''</ref> According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'':

<blockquote>Civil liberties groups and news organizations, which argued that the legislation would chill their ability to get information from officials, lobbied for the veto. ...

In 2002, with George W. Bush in the White House, Shelby reintroduced his language, but then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft said that "rigorous investigation" and enforcement of existing laws—not new legislation—were the best way to fight leaks.<ref name=Pincus/>
</blockquote>

In 1991 Shelby supported the 1991 Crime Bill S.1241<ref name="senate1">{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00125 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref> sponsored by then Senator [[Joseph Biden]] that instituted a national waiting period for handgun purchases as well as a federal ban on semi-automatic firearms.<ref>{{cite web  |last=Biden |first=Joseph |title=S.1241  |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/1241 |date=June 6, 1991 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=}}</ref>

In January 1992, Shelby met with [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Alan Greenspan]], advocating for the basic cost of money being reduced from 3.5 percent to 3 percent to assist with the stimulation of the economy. Shelby confirmed afterward that he intended to vote for Greenspan for another term as Federal Reserve Chair and said that Greenspan was not opposed to his suggestion to cut the discount rate to its lowest in twenty years in addition to agreeing with him on the need for a restoration of investment tax credits and a special tax rate for capital gains along with the providing of incentives to encourage savings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19920129&id=LF4eAAAAIBAJ&pg=3682,3633754|title=Shelby urges another cut in interest rates|date=January 29, 1992|publisher=Times Daily}}</ref>

In 1999, he opposed the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]], which repealed parts of the [[Glass–Steagall Legislation]], and was the only Republican Senator and one of eight Senators overall to vote against it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-10-23/consumer-unit-born-of-2008-crisis-would-be-shelby-target |title=Consumer Unit Born of 2008 Crisis Would Be Shelby Target |publisher=Businessweek |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name="106-354.EH">Congressional roll-call: [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=1&vote=00354 S.900 as reported by conferees: Financial Services Act of 1999, Record Vote No: 354], November 4, 1999, Clerk of the Senate.

Shelby was highly critical of CIA Director [[George Tenet]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2002-10-09-tenet_x.htm|title=CIA director's allies outrank his enemies|work=usatoday.com|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>
From 2003 until 2007, he chaired the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2015/01/ala_sen_richard_shelby_named_t.html|title=Alabama Senator Richard Shelby named chairman of the Senate Banking Committee|work=al.com|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> He is{{when|date=June 2015}} a member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] where he chaired its subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science and [[U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging|Special Committee on Aging]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He lost his chairmanships in 2007 when the Democrats regained control of the Senate.

In March 2009, as the Obama administration was expected to reverse limits on embryonic stem-cell research imposed by the Bush administration, Shelby said, "My basic tenet here is I don't think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth. I know that people argue there are other ways. I think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can, but we should have some ethics about it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/08/obama.stem.cells/index.html|title=Embryonic stem cell reversal is distraction, congressman says|date=March 8, 2009|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Later that month, Shelby was one of fourteen senators to vote against a procedural move that essentially guarantees a major expansion of a national service corps. The bill was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost at least an outlay for the fiscal year 2010 of $418 million toward around $5.7 billion from 2010 through 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/national-service-corps-bill-clears-senate-hurdle/|title=National Service Corps Bill Clears Senate Hurdle|first=Kate|last=Phillips|date=March 23, 2009|work=The New York Times}}</ref>
