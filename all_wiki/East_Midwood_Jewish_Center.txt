'''East Midwood Jewish Center''' is a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[synagogue]] located at 1625 [[Ocean Avenue (Brooklyn)|Ocean Avenue]], [[Midwood, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].

Organized in 1924,<ref name=NRHPS8P2/> the congregation's [[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance revival]] building (completed in 1929) typified the large multi-purpose synagogue centers being built at the time,<ref name=Kaufman259/> and was from the 1990s until 2010 the only synagogue with a working swimming pool in Brooklyn.<ref name=NRHPS7P1/> The building has been unmodified architecturally since its construction,<ref name=NRHPS7P1/> and in 2006 was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP).<ref name=NRHPlistings/>

Membership dropped during the [[Great Depression]], and the synagogue suffered financial hardship, but it recovered, and by 1941 had 1,100 member families. In 1950 the congregation built an adjoining school; at its peak its enrollment was almost 1,000.<ref name=EMJCHistory/> As neighborhood demographics changed in the late 20th century, and Brooklyn's Jewish population became more [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], the East Midwood Jewish Center absorbed three other Conservative Brooklyn congregations.<ref name=NRHPS8P4/>

The East Midwood Jewish Center had only three [[rabbi]]s from its founding until 2014.<ref name=Kass200606/> Reuben Kaufman served from 1924 to 1929, [[Harry Halpern]] from 1929 to 1977 and [[Rabbi Alvin Kass|Alvin Kass]] from 1976 to 2014.<ref name=EMJCHistory/> In 2014, Matt Carl became the rabbi.<ref name=EMJCStaff/>

== History ==

=== Founding ===
East Midwood was organized in 1924<ref name=NRHPS8P2>[[#refNRHPS8|NRHP Continuation Sheet, Section 8]], p.&nbsp;2.</ref> by Jacob R. Schwartz, a dentist who was concerned that his two sons had no nearby [[Hebrew school]] which they could attend.<ref name=Kaufman258>[[#refKaufman1999|Kaufman (1999)]], p.&nbsp;258.</ref> From the start his intention had been to create a Conservative synagogue: [[Conservative Judaism]] was seen as a compromise between [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], providing the familiar (and lengthy) [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] services of Orthodox Judaism, but, like Reform, adding some English prayers.<ref name=NRHPS8P2/> East Midwood differed from earlier [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] synagogues in New York, as services were to be conducted in Hebrew and English only (not Hebrew and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]), and the members were to come from immigrants from all over Europe, not just one city or region.<ref name=NRHPS8P3>[[#refNRHPS8|NRHP Continuation Sheet, Section 8]], p.&nbsp;3.</ref>

East Midwood held its first annual meeting on November 18, 1924 at the Jewish Communal Center of [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]]<ref name=Kaufman258/> (also known as the Flatbush Jewish Center),<ref name=NRHPS7P3>[[#refNRHPS7|NRHP Continuation Sheet, Section 7]], p.&nbsp;3.</ref> and there elected its first president, Pincus Weinberg.<ref name=EMJCHistory/> Weinberg, who was also chair of the Real Estate Committee, was the father of [[Sidney Weinberg]], who rose from the job of assistant porter to head [[Goldman Sachs]] from 1930 to 1969. Prior to moving to Flatbush, Pincus Weinberg had been president of [[Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes]].<ref name=Greenwald35>[[#refGreenwald2001|Greenwald (2001)]], p.&nbsp;35.</ref><ref name=Barton>[[#refBarton2006|Barton (2006)]].</ref>

East Midwood's first [[rabbi]] was Reuben Kaufman, and its first [[Hazzan|cantor]] was Jacob Schraeter.<ref name=EMJCHistory/> Kaufman, a Brooklyn native, had celebrated his [[bar mitzvah]] at Baith Israel Anshei Emes.<ref name=Levin20060317>[[#refLevin20060317|Levin (2006)]].</ref>

=== Building construction ===
The Real Estate Committee almost immediately purchased land located on Avenue L between East 26th and 27th Streets. Most members, however, felt a location on [[Ocean Avenue (Brooklyn)|Ocean Avenue]] would be more desirable. Issues arose with developing the land on Avenue L, and in 1925 the Committee purchased the current location at 1625 Ocean Avenue in [[Midwood, Brooklyn]]. The cornerstone was laid in 1926, and, although not complete, the building was fully enclosed by the autumn, and [[High Holidays|High Holiday]] services were held there that year. The Center's [[Talmud Torah]], which had been created in 1925 and held in a temporary structure, also moved into the new building.<ref name=EMJCHistory/>
[[File:EMJC groundbreaking 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Groundbreaking, July 13, 1925.]]
Designed in the [[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance revival]] style,<ref name=NRHPS7P1/> the building was finally completed in 1929 at the cost of $1 million (today ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1000000|1929|r=-5}}}}).<ref name=EMJCHistory/><ref name=Kaufman259>[[#refKaufman1999|Kaufman (1999)]], p.&nbsp;259.</ref> It typified the new "synagogue-centers" being built at that time, combining the functions of both a synagogue and [[community center]], and included "a synagogue, auditorium, kitchens, restaurant, classrooms, gymnasium, and swimming pool".<ref name=Kaufman259/> That year Kaufman left the Center to become the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in [[Paterson, New Jersey]],<ref name=Kass200606>[[#refKass200606|Kass (2006).]]</ref> and [[Harry Halpern]] became East Midwood's rabbi.<ref name=EMJCHistory/> Halpern, who also became an adjunct professor of pastoral psychiatry at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTSA), would go on to serve as rabbi for 49 years, until his retirement in 1977, four years before his death in 1981.<ref name=Waggoner1981>[[#refWaggoner1981|Waggoner (1981)]].</ref>

=== Great Depression and mid-20th century ===
[[File:East Midwood Jewish Center sign door.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Street level doors]]
The [[Great Depression]] took its toll on the congregation, and membership dropped. In order to cope with the financial burdens, dues were raised, teachers were given endorsed notes rather than paychecks, the Executive Secretary was laid off, pews were sold, and individual members provided mortgage guarantees. The synagogue survived, and membership recovered; by 1934 there were 300 members, and by 1944 there were 1,100.<ref name=EMJCHistory/>

Joseph Eidelson [Jozef Ajdelson] became cantor in 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Finding Aid|url=http://www.emjc.org/about/mission-history/finding-aid/|access-date=2020-08-14|website=East Midwood Jewish Center|language=en}}</ref> Born in Warsaw, Poland, Eidelson previously served as cantor at Warsaw's Sinai Synagogue, and in 1935 at the [[Great Synagogue of Vilna]], Lithuania.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Błaszczyk, Leon Tadeusz.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/903074583|title=Żydzi w kulturze muzycznej ziem polskich w XIX i XX wieku : słownik biograficzny|isbn=978-83-939735-1-4|location=Warszawa|oclc=903074583}}</ref>  

In October 1968, then [[Mayor of New York City]] [[John Lindsay]] was booed and jeered by a huge crowd at the East Midwood Jewish Center, in an infamous incident during the 1968 New York City teachers strike.<ref name=NYT1968116>[[#refNYT1968116|New York Times, October 16, 1968]].</ref> Lindsay had supported a school decentralization plan that had pitted mostly black parents against mostly Jewish teachers and school administration; after the administrator of the [[Ocean Hill, Brooklyn|Ocean Hill]]—[[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] school board dismissed 13 teachers and 6 administrators (mostly Jewish) for opposing decentralization, the [[United Federation of Teachers]] "called a strike that closed 85 percent of the city's 900 schools for 55 days".<ref name=McFadden2000>[[#refMcFadden2000|McFadden (2000)]].</ref>

When Lindsay arrived he was met by a mob of 2,000 people outside the synagogue, who shouted "Lindsay must go" and "we want [[Albert Shanker|Shanker]]". Halpern admonished the protesters, asking "Is this the exemplification of the Jewish faith?", but many replied "yes".<ref name=Kahlenberg2007p108>[[#refKahlenberg2007|Kahlenberg (2007)]], p. 108.</ref> Lindsay was heckled off the podium by the audience inside, and his limousine was "pounded on" and "pelted with trash" by the mob outside (which had grown to 5,000) as he drove away.<ref name=LindsayMob>See [[#refKahlenberg2007|Kahlenberg (2007)]], p. 108, and [[#refDashMoore2003|Dash Moore (2003)]].</ref> The strike, which was marked by "threats of violence and diatribes laced with racism and anti-Semitism", ended when the [[New York legislature]] suspended the administrator and the board.<ref name="McFadden2000"/>

Following Halpern's retirement in 1977, East Midwood hired as rabbi [[Rabbi Alvin Kass|Alvin Kass]], a graduate of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] and the JTSA, with a Ph.D. in philosophy from [[New York University]].<ref name=Lipsyte1996>[[#refLipsyte1996|Lipsyte (1996)]].</ref>

=== Late 20th and early 21st century ===
As Brooklyn's changing demographics made non-Orthodox institutions less viable, East Midwood absorbed three other congregations, including the Jewish Communal Center of Flatbush,<ref name=NRHPS8P4>[[#refNRHPS8|NRHP Continuation Sheet, Section 8]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref> where East Midwood had held its first annual meeting,<ref name=Kaufman258/> and, in 1978, [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]]'s Congregation Shaare Torah.<ref name=EMJCPomerantz>[[#refEMJCPomerantz|In Loving Memory: Rabbi Aaron Pomerantz]], East Midwood Jewish Center website.</ref> In 1996, membership was 1,000 families.<ref name="Lipsyte1996"/> 

At that time the membership had become divided over the issue of [[Role of women in Judaism|role of women]] in the synagogue. Though some members left the congregation over this issue, by 2009 East Midwood had become fully egalitarian. According to then-Vice President Michael Sucher "Those individuals who championed depriving women of the rights to be full members of the congregation were overruled by a majority of members who wanted to have an egalitarian Conservative congregation".<ref name=Dickter2009>[[#refDickter2009|Dickter (2009)]].</ref>

[[File:East Midwood Jewish Center menorah.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Upper level doors]]
The synagogue building has remained architecturally unchanged since its construction, and was from the 1990s until 2010 the only synagogue in Brooklyn with a functioning swimming pool.<ref name=NRHPS7P1/> In June 2006, it was added to the NRHP.<ref name=NRHPlistings/> That year the congregation received a $300,000 loan from the [[New York Landmarks Conservancy]] for repairs for "masonry and steel repairs on the side and rear facades."<ref name=NYLCAR2007>[[#refNYLCAR2007|2007 Annual Report, New York Landmarks Conservancy]], p. 15.</ref> It also raised $40,000 in order to receive a 2:1 "[[Matching funds|matching grant]]" of $20,000 from the Conservancy, and completed the repair work in 2007.<ref name=NYLCAR2007/> In November 2007 East Midwood was awarded a $409,575 New York State Environmental Protection Fund grant to "restore features of the sanctuary including stained glass windows, stained glass dome and skylight."<ref name=EPFGrants2007>[[#refEPFGrants2007|Press release, Governor Eliot Spitzer]], New York State Executive Chamber, November 29, 2007.</ref><ref name=EPFProjects2007>[[#refEPFProjects2007|Environmental Protection Fund Projects]], New York State Executive Chamber, November 29, 2007.</ref>

Aaron Pomerantz joined as associate rabbi in 1978. Born in Poland, he had escaped Europe after the outbreak of [[World War II]], moving to Canada and then the United States. There he graduated from Manhattan's [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]], and in 1952 received his [[Semikhah|rabbinic ordination]] from [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]]. From 1948 he had served as ritual director and then rabbi of Congregation Shaare Torah, joining the East Midwood Jewish Center when the two congregations merged. He served until his death in May 2009.<ref name=EMJCPomerantz/>

Joseph Eidelson retired to become Cantor Emeritus in 1995, 9 years before his death in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2004-11-24|title=Paid Notice: Deaths EIDELSON, HAZZAN JOSEPH|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/classified/paid-notice-deaths-eidelson-hazzan-joseph.html|access-date=2020-08-14|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Sam Levene became East Midwood's cantor in 2004. Born in Jerusalem and raised in Toronto, Levene was a graduate of the [[H.L. Miller Cantorial School]] and the JTSA's cantorial program.<ref name="EMJCStaff" />

Kass retired to become Rabbi Emeritus in 2014.<ref name=EMJCStaff/> During his tenure Kass, also served as a New York City Police Department chaplain for over 40 years, and had previously served as a [[United States Air Force]] chaplain for two years.<ref name=Lipsyte1996/> At one point during his service as Police Department chaplain he and his family received months of 24-hour security after death threats, and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the [[Carnegie Deli]].<ref name=DeliHostage>See [[#refParkerFreeman2004|Parker & Freeman (2004)]], pp. 60–61, [[#refJacobs2006|Jacobs (2006)]].</ref> Kass, who teaches ethics at the Police Academy, was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. He also convinced the [[Shomrim (fraternal police organization)|NYPD Shomrim Society]] (the [[fraternal organization]] of Jewish members of the New York City Police Department) to admit David Durk. Durk, along with the more famous [[Frank Serpico]], had been the source of the allegations of police corruption that led to the formation of the [[Knapp Commission]].<ref name=Lipsyte1996/> 

Matt Carl joined as rabbi in 2014. A graduate of [[Vassar College]] and the JTSA , he had previously served as rabbi of Battery Park Synagogue in Manhattan and Congregation Mount Sinai in Brooklyn.<ref name=EMJCStaff/>

===East Midwood Day School===
East Midwood Jewish Center ran a successful [[Talmud Torah]] for after school Jewish instruction.<ref name=EMJCMission>[[#refEMJCMission|Mission & History]], East Midwood Jewish Center website.</ref> As a child in the 1940s, feminist author [[Susan Brownmiller]] attended it two afternoons a week.<ref name=Brownmiller>[[#refBrownmiller|Brownmiller]].</ref><ref name=Gay2012p83>[[#refGay2012|Gay (2012)]], p. 83.</ref> In 1950, the congregation built a three-story school building and a two-story bridge link between the school and synagogue.<ref name=NRHPS7P1/> At its peak in the early 1950s the school had an enrollment of almost 1,000.<ref name=EMJCHistory/>

East Midwood subsequently created a Conservative [[Jewish day school]], serving students from kindergarten to Grade 8, and also providing "afternoon religious instruction for public school students through high school"<ref name=Fioravante1996>[[#refFioravante1996|Fioravante (1996).]],</ref> operated separately from the Talmud Torah.<ref name=EMJCMission/> Author and talk show host [[Dennis Prager]] taught at the day school.<ref name=Koppell>[[#refKoppell2004|Koppell (2004).]]</ref> It was later renamed the Rabbi Harry Halpern Day School, in honor of Rabbi Halpern.<ref name=EMJCHistory/>

Like the synagogue, the day school also suffered from Brooklyn's changing (and increasingly Orthodox) demographics;<ref name=Dickter2009/><ref name=Siegel2008>[[#refSiegel2008|Siegel (2008)]].</ref> enrollment had dropped from 400 students to 99 by the early 21st century.<ref name=Siegel2008/> Invigorated by a new principal, enrollment climbed to 160 by 2008,<ref name=Dickter2009/><ref name=Siegel2008/> but the school was still not financially stable.<ref name=Dickter2009/> In addition, the day school had become more independent in the 1990s, and its relationship with the synagogue deteriorated to that of a tenant to a landlord.<ref name=Dickter2009/> As a result, some of the synagogue's board members wanted to evict the school and find a new tenant.<ref name=Dickter2009/> In 2009 the synagogue and the school signed a new agreement to bring the two organizations closer again, under which the synagogue would absorb some of the school's costs, and the parents of school children would become members of the synagogue.<ref name=Dickter2009/> According to the synagogue's website, however, in 2018 the day school "reorganized itself, and modified into a more orthodox tradition".<ref name=EMJCMission/> The Talmud Torah continued to operate as a congregational school.<ref name=EMJCMission/>

== Architecture ==
[[File:EMJC cornerstone 1926.jpg|thumb|right|Ceremony in honor of the laying of the cornerstone, June 13, 1926.]]
The East Midwood Jewish Center synagogue building's architect is uncertain.<ref name=Howe2009S8P10F35>[[#refHowe2009|Howe (2009)]], section 8, page 10, footnote 35.</ref> The design is officially credited to the Building Committee and Irving Warshaw, the construction superintendent. The architect's name is not recorded in synagogue records, nor on the building's [[Commemorative plaque|dedicatory plaque]]. The Center's [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) nomination form, however, argues that the architect was Louis Abramson, based on visual evidence and one piece of written evidence.<ref name=NRHPS7P2/>

Abramson was a leading architect of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the [[Jewish Center (Manhattan, New York)|Manhattan Jewish Center]] (1918), as well as the Brooklyn Jewish Center, the Flatbush Jewish Center, and the [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]] Jewish Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish Center, and the Brooklyn Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans.<ref name=NRHPS7P2/> The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center, and that the Building Committee completed them, in order to save money.<ref name=NRHPS7P3/>

Alternatively, Maurice Courland's 1957 obituary claims the East Midwood Jewish Center as his work.<ref name=Courland>See [[#refNYT19571118|New York Times, November 18, 1957]], which also attributes the design of the Flatbush Jewish Center to Courland.</ref> Courland also designed a number of synagogues and New York landmarks, including Brooklyn's [[Magen David Synagogue (Brooklyn)|Magen David Synagogue]].<ref name=Howe2009S8P10>[[#refHowe2009|Howe (2009)]], section 8, page 10.</ref>

== Famous members ==
Famous congregational members have included [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who was [[Confirmation#Judaism|confirmed]] at East Midwood,<ref name=Pogrebin19>[[#refPogrebin2007|Pogrebin (2007)]], p.&nbsp;19.</ref> rather than having her [[bat mitzvah]] there, because (at the time) Conservative Judaism did not have bat mitzvah ceremonies for girls (a fact Ginsberg could not understand).<ref name=BG2016>[[#refBG2016|Bader Ginsburg (2016)]], pp 15–17.</ref><ref name=Dolsten2016>[[#refDolsten2016|Dolsten (2016)]].</ref> When Ginsberg was 13 she also had essays published in the synagogue's bulletin about [[Stephen S. Wise]], and on prejudice and world unity following [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=BG2016/><ref name=Dolsten2016/> Filmmaker [[Marc Levin]] was also a member;<ref name=Kalish>[[#refKalish2005|Kalish (2005)]].</ref> Levin's grandfather, Herman Levin, had been a president of the East Midwood Jewish Center, and had also helped found, and been a long-time lay-leader of, the [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist movement]].<ref name=Koppell/><ref name=NYT19900402>[[#refNYT19900402|New York Times, April 2, 1990]].</ref>

East Midwood has also had members who have died under tragic circumstances, including Jason Sekzer, who was killed in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]],<ref name=4000Jews>[[#ref4000Jews|The 4,000 Jews Rumor]], [[United States Department of State]]'s [[Bureau of International Information Programs]] website.</ref> and Danny Farkas, a New York police lieutenant and National Guard soldier who died while stationed in [[Kabul, Afghanistan]].<ref name=Edward>[[#refEdward2008|Edward (2008)]].</ref><ref name=Chandler>[[#refChandler2008|Chandler (2008)]].</ref><ref name=Yaniv>[[#refYaniv2008|Yaniv (2008)]].</ref>

==Media appearances==
In 2018 scenes from the television series ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'' were filmed here.<ref name=Ginsberg2018>[[#refGinsberg2018|Ginsberg (2018)]].</ref>
