Maas was an SPD delegate to the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] for the purpose of electing the [[President of Germany]] in 2010 and 2012.

After the [[2012 Saarland state election|2012 state election]], the SPD went into coalition with the CDU,<ref>{{cite web|author=Politik |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/saarland-kramp-karrenbauer-als-ministerpraesidentin-wiedergewaehlt-a-832240.html |title=Saarland: Kramp-Karrenbauer als Ministerpräsidentin wiedergewählt|work=Spiegel|date=26 March 2012|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> which before that election had been governing the state in coalition with the Green Party and the Liberals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17505712|title=Huge defeat for German Free Democrats in Saarland|work=BBC |date=25 March 2012|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> While the Social Democrats and [[The Left (Germany)|Left]] had won enough seats to form a coalition, Maas ruled out such an alliance in favor of a coalition with the CDU led by incumbent [[List of Ministers-President of the Saarland|Minister-President]] [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]].<ref>Brian Parkin and Tony Czuczka (26 March 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-25/merkel-s-cdu-wins-saarland-elections-zdf-exit-poll-shows.html Merkel’s Party Wins Saarland State in Show of Crisis Backing] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> As deputy minister-president, he took over responsibility for the economy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sr-online.de/sronline/nachrichten/politik_wirtschaft/geudinger_schleuse100.html |title=Schließungspläne für die Schleuse Güdingen? |work=SR-online |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627200403/http://www.sr-online.de/sronline/nachrichten/politik_wirtschaft/geudinger_schleuse100.html |archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref> transport, and employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/print_politik/article106281413/Politik-Kompakt-I.html |title=Politik Kompakt I - Nachrichten Print|work=Die Welt|date=6 February 2013|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>

=== Career in national politics ===
Following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]], Maas was part of the SPD team in the negotiations with the CDU/CSU on a coalition agreement; he was a member of the energy policy working group led by [[Peter Altmaier]] and [[Hannelore Kraft]]. On 17 December 2013, he was sworn in as the [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection]] in the [[Third Merkel cabinet|third cabinet]] of [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Merkel rival to take toughest job in new-look cabinet |url=http://m.france24.com/en/20131215-merkel-rival-take-toughest-job-new-look-cabinet/ |accessdate=17 December 2013 |work=France24 |date=15 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221433/http://m.france24.com/en/20131215-merkel-rival-take-toughest-job-new-look-cabinet/ |archivedate=17 December 2013}}</ref> succeeding [[Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger]]. He left his position of Deputy [[List of Ministers-President of the Saarland|Minister-President of the Saarland]] and Minister of Economy, Labor, Energy and Transport he was holding since 9 May 2012.

In June 2017, Maas disclosed to the [[Bild|Bild newspaper]] that he was the recent recipient of an unprecedented number of death threats including a bullet casing in the mailbox of his private residence. He attributed the threats to dissatisfaction with current German immigration policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Far-right targets German justice minister with 'disgusting' death threats |series=News|url=http://www.dw.com/en/far-right-targets-german-justice-minister-with-disgusting-death-threats/a-19308052|website=DW.COM|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=13 July 2017|language=en|date=5 June 2017}}</ref>

Since taking office as foreign minister in 2018, Maas has been markedly tougher than his immediate predecessors – [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]] – in his rhetoric and approach towards [[Russia]]. On his first day in office, he issued a frank warning about Russian “aggression” and chastised its leadership for “defining itself in antagonism to many in the west”.<ref>Tobias Buck (29 March 2018), [https://www.ft.com/content/caafe62c-2eb4-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381 German foreign minister Heiko Maas makes waves] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Under his leadership, Germany – in coordination with its allies – expelled four Russian diplomats over Russia’s suspected involvement in the poisoning of former Russian double agent [[Sergei Skripal]] in Salisbury, UK.<ref>Joseph Nasr (30 March 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-germany/russia-expels-four-german-diplomats-in-nerve-agent-poisoning-dispute-idUSKBN1H61D2 Russia expels four German diplomats in nerve agent poisoning dispute] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 8 May 2019, [[European Union]] struggle to keep preserve [[Iran Nuclear Deal]] agreement Maas said, “Our opinion is and remains: We want to preserve the agreement, in particular to prevent Iran from coming into possession of nuclear weapons, We don’t need further escalation in the region”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/32ee12070bc44a71936e5eb8331fba0e|title=Europeans struggle to preserve Iran nuclear accord|date=8 May 2019|website=AP NEWS}}</ref>

Maas expressed deep concern over the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|escalation of hostilities]] in the disputed region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and called on [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] to immediately halt fighting and progress towards a peaceful resolution.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes: How the world reacted|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/27/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-world-reactions|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927124156/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/27/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-world-reactions|archive-date=27 September 2020|website=aljazeera.com|language=en}}</ref>

On 26 October 2020, in response to the [[2020 Thai protests]], Maas mentioned that Germany is continuing to monitor the behavior of [[Thailand|Thai]] King [[Vajiralongkorn]] during the time he spends in Germany. He had "made clear that politics that concern the country of Thailand can’t be conducted from German soil" and if there are things that are considered to be illegal, it will have "immediate consequences." <ref>{{Cite web|title=Thailand's King Becomes a Foreign Relations Challenge for Germany|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/thailands-king-becomes-a-foreign-relations-challenge-for-germany-11603733852|date=October 26, 2020|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|language=en}}</ref>

===Homeland security===
Following the release of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] in December 2014, Maas told German newspaper ''[[Bild]]'': "The CIA's practice of torture is gruesome […] Everybody involved must be legally prosecuted."<ref>Frank Jack Daniel and Peter Cooney (10 December 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/12/10/us/politics/10reuters-usa-cia-torture.html Psychologist Says U.S. Senate's CIA Report Makes False Charges] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In early 2015, Maas successfully introduced a new law meant to mitigate radical Islamist attacks, by making it a criminal offence to travel abroad to receive military training.<ref>Daniel Tost (5 February 2015), [http://www.euractiv.com/sections/justice-home-affairs/germany-set-pass-one-harshest-anti-terror-laws-europe-311851  Germany set to pass ‘one of the harshest’ anti-terror laws in Europe] ''[[EurActiv]]''.</ref> Shortly after, he and Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maizière]] (CDU) jointly submitted a draft law permitting the temporary [[data retention|retention]] of internet and telephone data – excluding e-mail traffic – to aid criminal investigations.<ref>Daniel Tost (16 April 2015), [http://www.euractiv.com/sections/infosociety/german-government-repackages-data-retention-regulations-313821 German government repackages data retention regulations] ''[[EurActiv]]''.</ref>

[[File:Nicolas de Rivière, Boris Johnson, Mike Pompeo and Heiko Maas in Brussels - 2018 (40838347435).jpg|thumb|Maas at the [[NATO Headquarters]] in Brussels in April 2018]]
In July 2015, Maas announced plans to amend Germany's [[Strafgesetzbuch|penal code]] on [[sexual assault]] in accordance with the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] of the [[Council of Europe]]; the reform is to punish abuse which exploits a victim's fear of a "perceived menace" and tighten sentences in rape cases.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/german-justice-minister-announces-harsher-punishment-against-sexual-assault/a-18595257 German justice minister announces harsher punishment against sexual assault] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>

In August 2015, Maas initiated the dismissal and retirement of [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|chief federal prosecutor]] [[Harald Range]]; his ministry had questioned Range's decision to open a much-criticized treason investigation against journalists of ''[[netzpolitik.org]]'' who had reported about plans of Germany's domestic spy agency – the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] – to expand surveillance of online communication.<ref name="nytimes.com">[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/08/04/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-treason-probe.html German Justice Minister Fires Country's Top Prosecutor] ''[[New York Times]]'', 4 August 2015.</ref> Range, meanwhile, had accused the government of interfering in the investigation.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

===Digital policy===
In a 2014 interview with the ''[[Financial Times]]'', Maas called it "not acceptable" that [[Google]] "dominates the search engine world, and is able to rank its search results in a manner apt to promote its own business interests."<ref>Jeevan Vasagar (15 September 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/766b6116-3cf7-11e4-a2ab-00144feabdc0.html Transcript of interview with Heiko Maas, German justice minister] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> In 2015, he endorsed criticism expressed by Federation of German Consumer Organizations (VzBz) which held that [[Facebook]]’s data protection terms were too vague.<ref>Natascha Divac (26 February 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-consumer-group-warns-facebook-over-data-protection-1424970061 German Consumer Group Warns Facebook Over Data Protection] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> Later that year, he publicly accused Facebook of doing too little to thwart racist posts and hate comments on the social media platform.<ref>Erik Kirschbaum (27 August 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/27/us-facebook-germany-racism-idUSKCN0QW1SG20150827 German justice minister takes aim at Facebook over racist posts] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

====Anti-whistleblower law====

==== Freedom of speech ====
In early 2017, Maas proposed the "Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz" ("network enforcement law") to combat [[online hate speech]] and [[fake news]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/gesetzentwurf-von-heiko-maas-erdoganismus-in-reinkultur/19537970.html|title=Erdoganismus in Reinkultur|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/heiko-maas-wirtschaft-und-netzszene-protestieren-gegen-hassrede-gesetz-a-1142861.html|title=Hass im Netz: Wirtschaft und Aktivisten verbünden sich gegen Maas-Gesetz - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Netzwelt|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/debatte-um-hatespeech-deklaration-fuer-die-meinungsfreiheit-gegen-gesetz-von-heiko-maas/19658306.html|title="Deklaration für die Meinungsfreiheit" gegen Gesetz von Heiko Maas|publisher=}}</ref> The [[United Nations]] responded with a letter, warning that several democratic freedoms were under attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/heiko-maas-ist-der-justizminister-in-wahrheit-ein-verfassungsfeind-a-1155044.html|title=Alle gegen Heiko Maas: ...und nur Natalia hält noch zu ihm|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref> The proposed law was met with criticism throughout Germany from industry associations, IT experts, scientists, net-politicians, lawyers, privacy activists and civil rights campaigners who regard it as unconstitutional and defiant of EU-law and warn of "catastrophic effects for [[freedom of expression]]", causing online platforms to drastically [[Internet censorship|censor online speech]], resulting in privatization of legal enforcement and abolishing [[online anonymity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Neuer-Entwurf-des-Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetzes-Frontalangriff-auf-das-Vertrauen-im-Internet-3668533.html|title=Neuer Entwurf des "Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetzes": Frontalangriff auf das Vertrauen im Internet|first=|last=|publisher=Heise}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Ende-der-Anonymitaet-im-Netz-Maas-verschaerft-Gesetzesentwurf-gegen-Hate-Speech-3668265.html|title="Ende der Anonymität im Netz": Maas verschärft Gesetzesentwurf gegen Hate Speech|first=|last=|publisher=Heise}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2017-03/hate-speech-heiko-maas-netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz-entwurf-erweitert/seite-2|title=Hate-Speech: Katalog der zu löschenden Inhalte wurde erweitert|date=29 March 2017|newspaper=Die Zeit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heute.de/spd-naher-verein-d64-kritisiert-gesetz-von-heiko-maas-gegen-hasskommentare-scharf-46780030.html|title=Zensur befürchtet: SPD-naher Verein zerreißt Maas' Facebook-Gesetz - heute-Nachrichten|publisher=|access-date=22 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331220206/http://www.heute.de/spd-naher-verein-d64-kritisiert-gesetz-von-heiko-maas-gegen-hasskommentare-scharf-46780030.html|archive-date=31 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2017/hate-speech-gesetz-schon-ausgeweitet-bevor-es-in-kraft-tritt/|title=Hate-Speech-Gesetz: Schon ausgeweitet, bevor es in Kraft tritt|first=Markus|last=Reuter|date=28 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2017-04/heiko-maas-netzdg-allianz-meinungsfreiheit|title=Heiko Maas: Breites Bündnis gegen das Facebookgesetz|first=Patrick|last=Beuth|date=11 April 2017|publisher=|via=Die Zeit}}</ref>

====Law governing sexual offences ====
After the massive sexual assaults of New Year 2016 in Cologne,<ref name="Germany shocked by Cologne New Year gang assaults on women">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35231046 |title=Germany shocked by Cologne New Year gang assaults on women - BBC News |format= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> Heiko Maas wanted to reform sexual prosecution laws.<ref name="BMJV | Interviews | Sexuelle Gewalt findet in der Mitte unserer Gesellschaft statt">{{cite web |url=http://www.bmjv.de/SharedDocs/Interviews/DE/2016/Namensartikel/02062016_TSP_ReformSexualstrafrecht.html |title=BMJV &#124; Interviews &#124; Sexuelle Gewalt findet in der Mitte unserer Gesellschaft statt |work=Tagesspiegel |date=2016-02-06 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>  Tonio Walter, writing an op-ed in ''Die Zeit'', said that the law was overly broad: under a proposed ban on groping, he claimed, a wife could be punished for embracing her husband from behind, while rules against sex by coercion could punish a boss whose employee consented to sex under a (possibly mistaken, said Walter) fear of losing the job. Walter likewise said that the penalty of 10 years in prison for a sexual assault and 15 for rape by coercion would be too much, noting that non-sexual assaults received a lesser penalty under the laws.<ref name="Sexualstrafrecht: Zu früh, zu weit | ZEIT ONLINE">{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-02/sexualstrafrecht-koeln-heiko-maas-reform-gesetzgebung |title=Sexualstrafrecht: Zu früh, zu weit &#124; ZEIT ONLINE |format= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>

==== Sexist advertisement ====
In April 2016, Maas called for a legal ban on sexist advertisements, which "reduce women or men to sexual objects." Germany's Association of Communications Agencies (GWA) observed that it is a subjective matter of taste whether an advertisement is sexist or not.  FDP leader [[Christian Lindner]] remarked that the proposed ban indicated a similar mindset as radical Islamic leaders.<ref name="DW.COM 2016">{{cite web | title=German Justice Minister Maas slammed over proposed 'sexist advert' ban - News| website=DW.COM | date=2016-04-11 | url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-justice-minister-maas-slammed-over-proposed-sexist-advert-ban/a-19179720 | accessdate=2016-04-14}}</ref>
