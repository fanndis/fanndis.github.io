The film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 22, 2019, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. It grossed $68 million worldwide, and critics praised Hanks' and Rhys' performances, Heller's direction, and its heart-warming messages. ''A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'' was chosen by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] as one of the ten best films of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5737103/best-movies-2019/|title=The 10 Best Movies of 2019|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Stephanie|last=Zacharek|date=November 25, 2019|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> For his performance, Hanks was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Awards]], as well as the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globes]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actor|Critics' Choice]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Awards]], among others.

== Plot ==
In 1998, Lloyd Vogel is an [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] journalist known for his cynical writing style. He attends his sister Lorraine's wedding, along with his wife, Andrea, and their newborn son, Gavin. During the reception, Lloyd starts a fistfight with his estranged father, Jerry, over memories of Lloyd's deceased mother Lila, whom Jerry cheated on and abandoned.

Lloyd's editor assigns him to interview children's television presenter [[Fred Rogers]] for a 400-word article about heroes, but Lloyd feels the assignment is beneath him. He travels to the [[WQED (TV)|WQED]] studio in [[Pittsburgh]] to interview Rogers. Rogers is dismissive of his fame and displays concern for Lloyd's nose injury. Lloyd relates to Rogers the issue of his relationship with his father, whose apology and attempt at reconciliation Lloyd has rebuffed. Rogers tells him he has many ways of dealing with anger, such as striking the keys of his piano.

Determined to expose Rogers' friendly persona as an act, Lloyd watches several episodes of Rogers' show but is unable to discern anything. Lloyd interviews Rogers again when he visits New York. During the interview, Rogers dodges Lloyd's questions and reminisces about raising his two sons. Fred takes out his puppets and asks Lloyd about his childhood rabbit stuffed animal and his father, provoking Lloyd into ending the interview. Lloyd arrives home to find Jerry and his wife Dorothy there talking with Andrea. Lloyd berates Jerry for cheating on his mother Lila, while she was dying of cancer. He orders him to leave, but Jerry suffers a heart attack and is transported to the hospital. 

Lloyd refuses to remain overnight at the hospital with the rest of the family and returns to Pittsburgh to see Rogers. Exhausted, Lloyd collapses on the set of the [[Neighborhood of Make-Believe]] and dreams about his repressed childhood trauma. In his dream, he stumbles into an episode of Rogers' show about hospitals, finding himself wearing rabbit ears and shrunken to the size of [[Daniel Striped Tiger]] and [[King Friday XIII]], while Rogers and Andrea tower over him. Lloyd also dreams about Lila, who urges him to release his anger.

Rogers and his wife, Joanne, bring Lloyd to their home to recuperate. Lloyd and Rogers later go to a restaurant, where Rogers asks Lloyd to spend one minute thinking about the people who "loved him into being," and encourages him to forgive Jerry. Lloyd apologizes to Andrea for leaving her and Gavin at the hospital and visits Jerry and Dorothy at their home. He learns that Jerry is dying of cardiac stenosis, the reason Jerry attempted to reconnect with Lloyd. Lloyd forgives Jerry, promises to be a better father to Gavin, and writes an article about Rogers' impact on his life. Lorraine, her husband Todd, and Rogers visit Jerry. Rogers asks Jerry to pray for him before he departs. Jerry dies shortly after Rogers' visit and Lloyd's 10,000-word article, "Can You Say{{Spaces}}... Hero?" is published as ''Esquire''{{'}}s cover story.

At his studio, Rogers films the final take of an episode of his show. He shows his audience how the Vogel family overcame resentments of the past and are now close once again. As the production ends, he plays the piano alone, strikes the keys angrily, and resumes playing.

Steve Pond of ''[[TheWrap]]'' wrote: "''A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'' finds a gentle state of grace and shows the courage and smarts to stay in that zone, never rushing things or playing for drama{{nbsp}}... But just as Mr. Rogers used his show to talk about big issues with children in a tone that was softer and more halting than you'd expect given the subject matter, so does Heller stick to understatement in a way that threatens to become dull or sappy but never does."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-film-review-tom-hanks-mr-rogers/|title='A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' Film Review|website=[[The Wrap]]|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> Armond White of ''[[National Review]]'' was more critical: "Heller and screenwriters Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster don't show enough faith in Rogers' remedies—and not enough interest in their religious origins. In short, the movie seems wary of faith (it briefly mentions that Rogers was an ordained minister) and settles for secular sentimentality to account for his sensibility and behavior. This not only weakens the film, but it also hobbles Hanks's characterization."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/movie-review-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-fred-rogers-faith-missing/|title=Christian Faith Is the Missing Ingredient in ''A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood''|website=[[National Review]]|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref> Benjamin Lee of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: "It's a given that Hanks will nab at least a best supporting actor nomination but it would be all too easy to forget his co-star. The cynic-becomes-a-believer arc is age old but it unfolds here without cliche thanks to an emotionally intelligent script from Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, but mainly because of a marvelous, prickly turn from Rhys."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/09/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review-tom-hanks-charms-as-mister-rogers|title=A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood review—Tom Hanks charms as Mister Rogers|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref>
