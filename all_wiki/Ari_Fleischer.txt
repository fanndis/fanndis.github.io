'''Lawrence Ari Fleischer''' (born October 13, 1960) is an American media consultant and political aide who served as the twenty-first [[White House Press Secretary]], for [[President George W. Bush]], from January 2001 to July 2003.

As press secretary in the Bush administration, Fleischer was a prominent advocate for the Invasion of Iraq, and made numerous exaggerated and misleading claims about Iraq in the lead-up to the Iraq War. Since leaving the White House, he has worked as a media consultant and commentator. He joined [[Fox News]] as a contributor in July 2017.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Steinberg |first1=Brian |title=Fox News Signs Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer as Contributor |url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fox-news-ari-fleischer-contributor-white-house-1202490856/ |website=Variety.com |access-date=2 April 2020 |date=10 July 2019}}</ref>

==Early life==
Fleischer was born in 1960 in [[New York City]],<ref>''Taking Heat: The President, the Press and My Years in the White House'', page 1. ([https://books.google.ch/books?redir_esc=y&hl=de&id=rRgySNzhW2wC&q=born#v=snippet&q=born&f=false books.google])</ref> the son of Martha and Alan A.

Both parents were Democrats who were "horrified" when Fleischer became a Republican, he told an interviewer in 2003: "While I lived at home and when I started college, I was a liberal Democrat. In a sense, it was President Carter who drove me out of the Democratic Party and it was President Reagan who welcomed me into the Republican Party."<ref>Tom Tugend,[https://jewishjournal.com/news/los_angeles/community_briefs/8905/ "Q&A with Ari Fleischer"], ''[[Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', December 25, 2003.</ref> He graduated from [[Fox Lane High School]] in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]], in 1978, and graduated from [[Middlebury College]] in [[Vermont]] in 1982.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Congressional staffer==
Upon his graduation from Middlebury, Fleischer worked as press secretary for Jon S. Fossel, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for a New York [[United States House of Representatives|congressional]] seat. Later Fleischer worked as press secretary for [[Norman Lent]]. From 1985 to 1988, he was field director for the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. He went back to being a press secretary in 1988, working for congressman [[Joseph DioGuardi]].{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Fleischer served as U.S. Senator [[Pete Domenici]]'s press secretary from 1989 to 1994 and as spokesman for the House of Representatives [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] for five years. He worked as deputy [[communications director]] for [[George H. W. Bush]]'s 1992 reelection campaign.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guide to the White House Staff|last=Warshaw|first=Shirley Anne|publisher=CQ Press|year=2013|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dN1AwAAQBAJ&dq=ari+fleischer+deputy+communications+director+for+George+H.+W.+Bush%27s+1992+reelection+campaign&source=gbs_navlinks_s|pages=271}}</ref>

==White House press secretary==
Although Fleischer served as communications director for [[Elizabeth Dole]] during her presidential run in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election campaign]], he joined [[George W. Bush]]'s presidential campaign after Dole dropped out of the race. When Bush became the President in 2001, he tapped Fleischer to become the first press secretary of his administration.

Fleischer is credited with having been the first to introduce the phrase "[[homicide bombing]]" to describe what has also been called [[suicide bombing]], in April 2002, to emphasize the terrorist connotations of the [[Tactic (method)|tactic]]:

{{quote|The president ... convened a meeting of the [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]], at which point, in the middle of the meeting, the president was informed about this morning's homicide bombing in [[Jerusalem]] ... The [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[telethon]], as they have told it to us, is to provide assistance to the [[Palestinian people]], and that isn't – no money is going to go to provide the homicide bombers with any assistance from the [[Politics of Saudi Arabia|Saudi government]].|Ari Fleischer, "White House Regular Briefing," [[Federal News Service]], April 12, 2002}}

On May 19, 2003, he announced that he would resign during the summer, citing a desire to spend more time with his wife and to work in the [[private sector]]. He was replaced by deputy press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] on July 15, 2003.

=== Torture ===
In 2003, Fleischer said, "The standard for any type of interrogation of somebody in American custody is to be humane and to follow all international laws and accords dealing with this type subject.

==Alleged role in Plame affair==
{{Further|Plame affair}}
Fleischer became an important figure in the [[CIA]] [[leak]] [[Plame affair|case]]; he testified that [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]], Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s former [[Chief of staff (politics)|chief of staff]], told him that [[Valerie Plame]] was a covert agent weeks before Libby had claimed to have been informed of Plame's status by a reporter.

On July 7, 2003, at The [[James S. Brady]] Briefing Room, Fleischer was asked about [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph Wilson]], a former U.S. ambassador who had recently written an editorial for ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticizing the intelligence information the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] had relied upon to make its case for [[war in Iraq|invading]] the nation of [[Iraq]]. Specifically, Fleischer was asked to respond to Mr. Wilson's assertion that he had been sent to [[Niger]] to investigate claims that [[Saddam Hussein]] had sought [[yellowcake uranium]] and found no evidence that such events had ever occurred.

{{quote|'''Q:''' Can you give us the White House account of Ambassador Wilson's account of what happened when he went to Niger and investigated the suggestions that Niger was passing yellow cake to Iraq? I'm sure you saw the piece yesterday in ''The New York Times''.

'''FLEISCHER:''' Well, there is zero, nada, nothing new here. Ambassador Wilson, other than the fact that now people know his name, has said all this before. But the fact of the matter is in his statements about the Vice President—the Vice President's office did not request the mission to Niger. The Vice President's office was not informed of his mission and he was not aware of Mr. Wilson's mission until recent press accounts—press reports accounted for it.<ref name="Fleischerbriefing">{{cite press release|title=Press Secretary Briefings|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary The White House|date=July 7, 2003|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/07/20030707-5.html#9|access-date=2008-12-07}}</ref>}}

Fleischer testified in open court on January 29, 2007, that Libby told him on July 7, 2003, at lunch, about Plame, who is Wilson's wife. [[MSNBC]] correspondent [[David Shuster]] summarized Fleisher's testimony on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'':

{{quote|Ambassador Wilson was sent to Niger by his wife. His wife works at the CIA," Fleischer recalled Libby saying. Libby said the information was "hush-hush, on the Q-T."

He testified that "The information about Wilson's wife was news to me. It was the first time I had ever heard it."<ref name="hours later">{{cite news| first= David |last= Shuster|title=Libby trial: Jurors taking note of Fleischer testimony|work=Hardball with Chris Matthews|date=January 29, 2007| url= http://hardblogger.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/01/29/44432.aspx|access-date=2007-03-07| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210015340/http://hardblogger.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/01/29/44432.aspx|archive-date=February 10, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}

Fleischer also testified to the fact that [[Dan Bartlett]], the president's communications adviser, told him the same thing on [[Air Force One]] days later on the way to Niger with President Bush. Fleischer had then relayed this information to ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' correspondent [[John Dickerson (journalist)|John Dickerson]] and [[NBC]]'s [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] in Uganda during the African trip.<ref name="Fleischer_testimony">{{cite news| first= James Gordon |last= Meek |title= Fleischer says he leaked Plame's CIA employment |work=New York Daily News |date=January 30, 2007 |url= http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/politics/16577858.htm }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}

On July 18, 2005, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' reported that in his sworn testimony before the [[grand jury]] investigating the leak, Fleischer denied having seen a memo circulating in Air Force One on July 7, 2003, which named Plame in connection to Wilson's mission and which identified her as a "CIA" covert agent. However, a former Bush Administration official also on the plane testified to having seen Fleischer perusing the document.<ref name= "autogenerated1">{{cite news| url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aagJweX0XNCQ&refer=us| work= Bloomberg.com |title= Prosecutor's Probe Centers on Rove, Memo, Phone Calls (Update2)| date= July 18, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/04/11/LI2005041100879.html| work=The Washington Post|title=Cheney's Unforgivable Egotism| first= Dan |last= Froomkin| date= April 11, 2005}}</ref>

Columnist [[Robert Novak]], who published Plame's name on July 14, 2003, made a call to Fleischer on July 7, 2003, before Fleischer's trip to Africa with President Bush. It is unclear whether Fleischer returned Novak's call.<ref name= "autogenerated1" /> However, Fleischer is mentioned in [[Special Prosecutor]] [[Patrick Fitzgerald]]'s indictment of Libby. The indictment states that Libby told Fleischer (referred to as the White House press secretary in the indictment) that Plame worked for the "CIA" and that this fact was not well known.

After receiving an [[Witness immunity|immunity]] agreement, Fleischer testified that he had revealed Plame's identity to reporters after learning it from Libby.<ref name="washingtonpost"/> However, in the end it was discovered that [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] first leaked Plame's identity, not Libby or Cheney.

==Memoir==
Fleischer published a memoir, ''Taking Heat: The President, the Press and My Years in the White House'', in 2005. Michiko Kakutani wrote in ''The New York Times,'' "[T]his book does not provide any new insights into the workings of the current White House.
