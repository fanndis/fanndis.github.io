Faculty and students held important roles in originating the [[New Culture Movement]], the [[May Fourth Movement]] protests, and other significant cultural and sociopolitical events, to the extent that the university's history has been closely tied to that of modern China. Peking University has educated and hosted many prominent modern Chinese figures, including [[Mao Zedong]], [[Lu Xun]], [[Gu Hongming]], [[Hu Shih]], [[Mao Dun]], [[Li Dazhao]], [[Chen Duxiu]], and current [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Keqiang]].<ref name="pku.edu.cn">[http://www.pku.edu.cn/about/about/beida/mingren.htm Peking University - Mingren] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804210142/http://www.pku.edu.cn/about/about/beida/mingren.htm |date=2008-08-04}}</ref>

===Establishment===
Following China's defeat in the [[Sino-Japanese War]], intellectuals - including [[Kang Youwei]], [[Liang Qichao]], and [[Yan Fu]] - called for reforms to the country's education system. In June 1896, Minister Li Duanfen proposed to create a university in the capital. On 11 June 1898, the [[Guangxu Emperor]], as part of the [[Hundred Days' Reform]], authorized the creation of the '''Imperial University of Peking''' (IUP)<ref name="pu_earlyyears">{{cite web |author=Peking University |title=From Imperial University of Peking to Peking University in the Early Years of Republic of China |url=http://english.pku.edu.cn/intro_PKUhistory.shtml |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref> ({{zh |t=京師大學堂 |s=京师大学堂 |p=Jīngshī Dàxuétáng |l = Capital Grand Study Hall}}).<ref name="pu_beginning"/> IUP was formally established on 3 July 1898 when the emperor approved the charter written by Liang. Minister Sun Jianai was charged with the implementation. IUP served as the country's foremost institute for higher learning, but also as its highest educational authority.<ref name="pu_earlyyears"/> [[William Alexander Parsons Martin]] was the first President.<ref name="pu_beginning"/> Most of the reforms were abolished when the conservative [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] seized power on 21 September. The university survived with altered objectives and reduced scope. It opened on 31 December with 160 students, instead of the planned 500.<ref name="pu_earlyyears"/>

In 1900, the university was paralyzed by the [[Boxer Rebellion]], later in the year, the "Eight-Power Allied Forces" (八国联军) entered Beijing and the university's operating was continually suspended. In 1902, "Jingshitongwenguan", a school established by the Qing court in 1862 for foreign language learning was incorporated into the Imperial University of Peking. In 1904, the university sent 47 students to study abroad, which marked the first time for Chinese higher education institution to send students to foreign countries.

Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]], the Imperial University of Peking was renamed "Government University of Peking" in 1912 and then "National University of Peking" in 1919<ref name="pu_beginning">{{Cite web|url=http://english.pku.edu.cn/News_Events/News/Campus/8184.htm|title=[Anniversary Special] "In the beginning was the word"|date=2011-05-02|website=Peking University|access-date=2017-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113111931/http://english.pku.edu.cn/News_Events/News/Campus/8184.htm|archive-date=2017-11-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> ({{zh|t=國立北京大學|s=国立北京大学|p=Guólì Běijīng Dàxué}}).

=== Early Republic of China period (1916–1927) ===
The noted scholar [[Cai Yuanpei]] was appointed president on January 4, 1917, and helped transform Peking University into the country's largest institution of higher learning, with 14 departments and an enrollment of more than 2,000 students. President Cai, inspired by the German model of academic freedom, introduced faculty governance and democratic management to the university. Cai recruited an intellectually diverse faculty that included some of the most prominent figures in the progressive [[New Culture Movement]], including [[Hu Shih]], [[Liu Bannong]], [[Ma Yinchu]], [[Li Dazhao]], [[Chen Duxiu]], [[Lu Xun]] and [[Liang Shuming]]. Meanwhile, leading conservatives [[Gu Hongming]] and [[Huang Kan]] also taught at the university.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A companion to Asian art and architecture|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Brown, Rebecca M., Hutton, Deborah S.|isbn=9781444396355|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|oclc=767516261}}</ref> A firm supporter for freedom of thought, Cai advocated for educational independence and resigned several times protesting the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|government]]'s policy and interference.

[[File:Beijing_students_protesting_the_Treaty_of_Versailles_(May_4,_1919).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Peking University students protesting the Treaty of Versallies in the May Fourth Movement.]]On May 1, 1919, some students of Peking University learned that the Treaty of Versailles would allow Japan to receive Germany's colonising rights in Shandong province. An assembly at Peking University that included these students and representatives from other universities in Beijing was quickly organised. On May 4, students from thirteen universities marched to [[Tiananmen]] to protest the terms of [[Treaty of Versailles]], demanded the Beiyang government to refuse to sign the treaty. Demonstrators also demanded the immediate resignation of three officials: [[Cao Rulin]], Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Zhang Zongxiang, China's Ambassador to Japan and Lu Zongyu, Minister of Currency, who they believed were in cooperation with Japanese. The protest ended up with some protesters being beaten and arrested, and Cao Rulin's house burned by protesters. Following the protest on May 4, students, workers and merchants from nearly all China's major cities went on strike and boycotted Japanese goods in China. The [[Beiyang government]] eventually agreed to release the arrested students and fired the three officials under intense public pressure, China's representatives in Paris refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://worldpolicy.org/world-policy-journal-summer-2005/|title=World Policy Journal - Summer 2005 - World Policy|work=World Policy|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701030616/https://worldpolicy.org/world-policy-journal-summer-2005/|archive-date=2018-07-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>

These protests, now known as the [[May Fourth Movement]], has been widely regarded as one of the most important turning points in modern China's history. In its broader sense, the May Fourth Movement led to the establishment of radical Chinese intellectuals who went on to mobilize peasants and workers into the Communist party and gain the organizational strength that would solidify the success of the [[Communist Revolution]].

Following the May Fourth Movement, [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]] cofounded the [[Communist Party of China]], and Chen served as its first general secretary. Both Chen and Li served as faculty for Peking. Li served as a head librarian, and Chen served as Peking University's dean.

In 1920, Peking University became the first Chinese university to accept female students.

=== World War II (1927–1949) ===
After the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 and the resulting expansion of Japanese territorial control in east China, Peking University was relocated to the southwestern city of [[Changsha]] and formed the Changsha Temporary University along with nearby schools [[Tsinghua University]] and [[Nankai University]]. In 1938, the three schools moved again, this time further southwest to [[Kunming]], and formed the [[National Southwestern Associated University]].

In 1946, after the Japanese surrender in World War II, Peking University moved back to Beijing. At that time, the university comprised six schools (Arts, Science, Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture), and a research institute for humanities. The total student enrollment grew up to 3,000.

===People's Republic of China (1949–present)===
In 1949, after the [[People's Republic of China]] was established, Peking University lost its "national" appellation to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. In 1952, Mao Zedong's government re-grouped the country's higher education institutions with individual institutions tending to specialize in a certain field of study after the Soviet model. As a result, some arts and science faculties of [[Tsinghua University]] and former Yenching University were merged into Peking University. At the same time, however, the university lost its Law, Medicine, Engineering and Agriculture schools. These schools and faculties were either merged into other universities or to found new colleges. During the re-grouping, [[Yenching University]] was closed up. Peking University moved from downtown Beijing to the former Yenching campus.
[[File:PekingUniversityPic6.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Peking University's West Gate, one of the symbols of the university campus]]
The first disturbances of the [[Cultural Revolution]] began at Peking University in 1966; education there ceased between 1966 and 1970.

On May 4, 1998, at the 100th anniversary of Peking University, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] announced that the government would initiate a national project to promote China's higher education by funding selected universities to achieve world-class level. The project was later named “[[Project 985|985]]” based the date of its announcement.

In 2000, [[Beijing Medical University]] was merged back into Peking University and became the Peking University Health Science Campus. Beijing Medical University, which used to be Medical School of Peking University was separated from Peking University in 1952. Peking University now has eight affiliated hospitals and 12 teaching hospitals.

In 2001, Peking University established the Yuanpei Program. It was formalized in 2007 as the [[Yuanpei College]], named in honor of the highly respected former university president [[Cai Yuanpei]]. The college hosts an elite undergraduate liberal arts program that allows students to freely choose specialisations. In the same year, Peking University set up a [[Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School|satellite campus]] for graduate students in Shenzhen. The university's [[Peking University HSBC Business School|second business school]], Peking University HSBC Business School was launched on the Shenzhen campus in 2004.

In 2014, Peking University established the [[Yenching Academy]], a fully funded global fellowship program designed "to cultivate leaders who will advocate for global progress and cultural understanding."

In October 2015, Peking University alumni Professor [[Tu Youyou]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for her discovery of [[artemisinin]]. Having saved millions of lives, artemisinin has made significant contributions to global health in regard to the fight against [[malaria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4966551/#:~:text=Miller-,Summary,of%20China%20to%20global%20health.|accessdate=28 September 2020|last1=Su |first1=Xin-zhuan |last2=Miller |first2=Louis H. |title=The discovery of artemisinin and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine |website=NCBI |publisher=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health}}</ref>

On February 20, 2017, Peking University officially signed a contract with [[The Open University]] to establish the Oxford Campus of Peking University's [[Peking University HSBC Business School|HSBC business school]], marking a turning point for the development of China's higher education.<ref>{{cite news |title=PHBS opening a campus in UK: a turning point for China’s higher education |url=http://newsen.pku.edu.cn/news_events/news/global/5382.htm |accessdate=28 September 2020 |publisher=Peking University HSBC Business School |date=28 February 2017}}</ref>

== Campus ==
[[File:Campus of Peking University.jpg|thumb|220x220px|View of the central campus]]
The campus of Peking University was originally located northeast of the [[Forbidden City]] in the center of Beijing, and was later moved to the former campus of [[Yenching University]] in 1952. The main campus is in northwest Beijing, in [[Haidian District#Higher education|Haidian district]], near the [[Summer Palace]] and the [[Old Summer Palace]]; the area is traditionally where many of Beijing's most renowned gardens and palaces were built.

The university campus is on the former site of [[Qing Dynasty]] imperial gardens and it retains much traditional Chinese-style landscaping, including traditional houses, gardens, pagodas, as well as many notable historical buildings and structures. The landscape in campus gives a presentation of combined western styles with traditional Chinese aesthetic standards. American architect and art historian [[Talbot Hamlin]] designed some of the university's buildings constructed during the 1919 to 1922 period.<ref>{{cite web |title=Talbot F. Hamlin (1889-1956) {{!}} Columbia University Libraries |url=http://library.columbia.edu/locations/avery/da/collections/hamlin_tf.html |website=library.columbia.edu |accessdate=19 August 2020}}</ref> There are several gates that lead into campus &mdash; East, West and South gates, with the West Gate being the most well known for the painted murals on its ceiling. Weiming lake is in the north of the campus and is surrounded by walking paths and small gardens. The university hosts many museums, such as the Museum of University History and the [[Arthur M. Sackler]] Museum of Art and Archaeology.<ref>[http://www.sackler.org/china/amschina.htm Arthur M.

There are ritual pottery vessels as well as elaborate pieces of jewelry on display. There are also human bones set up in the traditional burial style of that period.<ref name="dest" />

Beyond its main campus, [[Peking University Health Science Center]] ([[PKUHSC]]) is on Xueyuan Road where the country's most distinguished colleges are, and is a fitting site for academics and research.

In 2001, Peking University's [[Shenzhen]] campus, the [[Shenzhen Graduate School of Peking University|Shenzhen Graduate School]], opened its doors. The campus is located in the northwest part of Shenzhen City.
