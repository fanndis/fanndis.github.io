The '''Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II''' was the international celebration held in 2002 marking the 50th anniversary of the accession of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to the thrones of [[States headed by Elizabeth II|seven countries]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avictorian.com/|title=Victoria|publisher=Avictorian|language=English|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> upon the death of her father, [[King George VI]], on 6 February 1952, and was intended by the Queen to be both a commemoration of her 50 years as monarch and an opportunity for her to officially and personally thank her people for their loyalty.<ref name=Buck50>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/TheQueensGoldenJubilee/50factsaboutTheQueensGoldenJubilee.aspx| last=The Royal Household| title=Her Majesty The Queen > Jubilees and other milestones > Golden Jubilee > 50 facts about The Queen's Golden Jubilee| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=25 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Blair| first=Tony| author-link=Tony Blair| date=23 November 2000| publication-date=13 January 2003| contribution=House of Commons Debate| editor-last=House of Commons Library| editor-link=House of Commons Library| editor2-last=Pond| editor2-first=Chris| title=Golden Jubilee 2002| page=5| location=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| id=SN/PC/1435| url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-01435.pdf| accessdate=25 November 2009| ref=harv| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605082313/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-01435.pdf| archivedate=5 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Despite the deaths of her sister, [[Princess Margaret]], and mother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], in February and March 2002 respectively, and predictions in the media that the anniversary would be a non-event, the jubilee was marked with large-scale and popular events throughout London in June of the same year, bookended by events throughout the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Elizabeth attended all of the official celebrations as scheduled, along with her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]; over twelve months, the royal couple journeyed more than {{convert|40000|mi|km}} to the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, then around the United Kingdom, and wrapped up the jubilee year in Canada.<ref name=Buck50 /> Numerous landmarks, parks, buildings, and the like, were also named in honour of the golden jubilee and commemorative medals, stamps, and other symbols were issued.

==Celebrations in the Commonwealth realms==
===Australia===
Australian celebrations were markedly on a smaller scale than the 1977 Silver Jubilee event. Unlike in 1977 when Silver Jubilee Medals were issued in Australia, no medal was issued for the Golden Jubilee, this contrasted with the United Kingdom and Canada, both issuing medals on a wide basis. Queen Elizabeth was on 27 February received in [[Adelaide]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[Peter Hollingworth]]; the Australian viceroy, at the time, was in the midst of controversy involving allegations of child abuse cover-ups in the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican Church]] and demonstrators were present when the Queen and Prince Philip landed.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Barkham| first=Patrick| title=Queen triumphs through scandal and dust| newspaper=The Guardian| date=28 February 2002| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/28/australia.jubilee| accessdate=1 December 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> The royal couple undertook a five-day tour through [[South Australia]] and [[Queensland]], which also coincided with that year's [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] in [[Coolum Beach, Queensland|Coolum Beach]].<ref name=Pond7 /> On the [[Queen's Official Birthday#Australia|Queen's Birthday]] holiday for 2002, services of thanksgiving were held in churches and a bonfire was lit during a party at [[Government House, Canberra|the Governor-General's residence]] in [[Canberra]].<ref>{{Cite news| last=Barkham| first=Patrick| title=Australians shun jubilee celebrations| newspaper=The Guardian|  date=31 May 2002| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/31/jubilee.monarchy1| accessdate=1 December 2009| ref=harv}}</ref>

Throughout the year, events were held across Canada to mark the jubilee, such as the Jubilee [[Levée (event)|Levée]] held by [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]] [[Lois Hole]], which was attended by more than 4,000 Albertans and at which Hole stated: "what we want to realize is how important the monarchy is to Canada and certainly to Alberta."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoople| first=Chelsea| title=Alberta honours its citizens in the name of the Queen| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Autumn 2002| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=2002| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2002/03spring005.html| accessdate=27 June 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708023918/http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2002/03spring005.html| archivedate=8 July 2009 }}</ref>

For 12 days in October 2002, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh toured Canada, making stops in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Vancouver]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], [[Fredericton, New Brunswick|Fredericton]], [[Sussex, New Brunswick|Sussex]], [[Moncton]], and [[Ottawa]]. The trip was also unique in that it was the first royal visit to the new [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territory]] of [[Nunavut]], where the royal couple made their first Canadian stop in [[Iqaluit]]. There, on 4 October, the Queen opened and addressed the new [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut|legislative assembly]], stating in her speech: "I am proud to be the first member of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]] to be greeted in Canada's newest territory."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Kay| first=Christine| last2=Kearsey| first2=Tara| title=Royals start tour in Iqaluit| newspaper=Northern News| date=7 October 2002| url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2002-10/oct7_02q.html| accessdate=28 November 2009| ref=harv| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603120711/http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2002-10/oct7_02q.html| archivedate=3 June 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref> After a walk-about through Iqaluit, the Queen unveiled one of the street signs on the town's main thoroughfare, which had been renamed in her honour.

From Nunavut, the royal party flew to Victoria, where the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were received by the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|province's lieutenant governor]]. Saturday was spent at a private retreat and, on the Sunday, the Queen attended religious services at [[Christ Church Cathedral (Victoria, British Columbia)|Christ Church Cathedral]], performed an unscheduled walk-about after the sermon, and travelled to the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings|provincial parliament building]] to unveil a stained glass window commemorating the Golden Jubilee. Once Her Majesty was outside of the legislature, the [[Snowbirds]] performed an acrobatic fly-by for the sovereign and a gathered audience of some 16,000.

In Vancouver, on 6 October, the Queen, accompanied by [[Wayne Gretzky]], and in front of a crowd of 18,000 at [[General Motors Place]], dropped the [[ceremonial first puck]] for the [[National Hockey League]] exhibition game between the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and [[San Jose Sharks]]; this was the first time any reigning monarch, Canadian or otherwise, had performed the task.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Queen visits GM Place to drop ceremonial puck| newspaper=Spirit of Vancouver| publisher=Vancouver Board of Trade| date=7 October 2002| url=http://www.boardoftrade.com/sov_page.asp?pageID=678| accessdate=28 November 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122103132/http://www.boardoftrade.com/sov_page.asp?pageID=678| archivedate=22 November 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Queen to drop puck at Vancouver hockey game |publisher=CTV |date=15 September 2002 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1032038866597_87/ |accessdate=28 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050122173037/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1032038866597_87/ |archivedate=22 January 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref> The Queen and the Duke then watched the first period of the game from the royal box—the first time they had done so since their first hockey game at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in 1951.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen drops puck, raises cheer in arena| publisher=CBC| date=6 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/06/queen_hockey021006.html| accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref> Premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] said during the visit: "Your Majesty, much as the world has changed in the last 50 years, one thing has always remained constant—the sincere affection between the people of British Columbia and their Queen."<ref>{{cite news|  title=Queen drops puck, raises cheer in arena| publisher=CBC| date=7 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/06/queen_hockey021006.html| accessdate=24 June 2009}}</ref>

The couple was next in [[Saskatchewan]], unveiling on the grounds of the provincial parliament the product of the Golden Jubilee Statue Project: a bronze [[Statue of Queen Elizabeth II riding Burmese|equestrian statue of the Queen]] riding [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]], a horse gifted in 1969 to the Queen by the RCMP. In [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], the Queen performed a walk-about at [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]], re-dedicated the newly restored [[Golden Boy (Manitoba)|Golden Boy]] statue atop the [[Manitoba Legislative Building]], and attended an evening performance of the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]], accompanied by the [[Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Loreena McKennitt]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen greeted by thousands of admirers in Winnipeg| publisher=CBC| date=8 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/08/queen_winn021008.html| accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref>

Her Majesty and His Royal Highness were on 9 October welcomed to [[Ontario]] by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|lieutenant governor]] and thousands onlookers in Toronto, and, that evening, appeared at a festival, mounted at [[Exhibition Place]], highlighting the advance of the province over the previous five decades. After a day of relaxation, the Queen then ventured to [[Sheridan College]], to view students learning computer animation, and Hamilton, where at [[Copps Coliseum]] she, as their [[Colonel-in-Chief|colonel-in-chief]], presented the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]] with their new Colours. Rejoined by her husband, Elizabeth attended at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Toronto headquarters an event marking the organisation's 50th anniversary; there, she viewed exhibits and was amused by a video display showing her earlier tours of Canada in the 1950s. Finally, the royal couple were in the audience at [[Roy Thomson Hall]] for a gala concert of Canadian talent, including [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Evelyn Hart]], [[Rex Harrington]], [[Cirque du Soleil]], [[The Tragically Hip]], and others.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen helps CBC TV mark 50th anniversary| publisher=CBC| date=11 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/10/queencbc021010.html| accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref> At the same time, the [[Queen-in-Council|Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council]] named a park near [[Gravenhurst, Ontario|Gravenhurst]] as the [[Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park]] and created the Ontario Golden Jubilee Award for Civilian Bravery.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/csb/news/oct9fs02.html| last=Ministry of Natural Resources| title=Queen Elizabeth II Woodlands Park| publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario| date=9 October 2002| accessdate=24 April 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050323020702/http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/csb/news/oct9fs02.html| archivedate=23 March 2005| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crht.ca/LibraryShelf/CourageoftheQueen.html |publisher=Canadian Royal Heritage Trust |title=Courage of the Queen |accessdate=15 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909224557/http://www.crht.ca/LibraryShelf/CourageoftheQueen.html |archivedate=9 September 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>

As the tour continued on to the [[Maritimes|maritime provinces]], the royal party arrived at [[Old Government House, Fredericton|Government House]] in [[Fredericton]], [[New Brunswick]], where they were welcomed by thousands. The stop in this province was brief, however—only 25 hours in total—with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh flying by helicopter the following morning from Fredericton to [[Sussex, New Brunswick|Sussex]] and then on to Moncton, where they attended a luncheon in [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]] to celebrate the town's 50th anniversary and officially opened a new terminal at [[Greater Moncton International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen begins visit to New Brunswick| publisher=CBC| date=11 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/11/queen_friday021011.html| accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref>

From the east coast the royal couple flew westwards again to the national capital, Ottawa, to be greeted there by [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley]], who had earlier, on the day of the Queen's arrival in Canada, caused controversy by stating [[Republicanism in Canada|Canada should become a republic]]. The day following, 13 October, a multi-faith [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] celebration was held on [[Parliament Hill]] for about 3,500 people, and the Queen laid a wreath at the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]]. A [[state dinner]] was held that evening at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]], at which Her Majesty said: "[I wish] to express my profound gratitude to all Canadians... for the loyalty, encouragement and support you have given to me over these past 50 years." As her motorcade passed across the [[Ottawa River]] into [[Quebec]], about 100 protesters yelled obscenities at the Queen in [[French language|French]], waving [[Flag of Quebec|Quebec flags]] and chanting "We want a country, not a monarchy"; it was the only protest during the jubilee tour of Canada.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen begins final leg of Jubilee tour| publisher=CBC| date=13 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/12/queen_sat021012.html| accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title="It means something to be a Canadian": Queen| publisher=CBC| date=13 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/13/queen_speech021013.html| accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref>

On the last full day of the tour, the Queen, as Honorary Commissioner, watched a performance of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]'s [[Musical Ride]] before moving to her final major event in Canada: a lunch at [[Rideau Hall]] for fifty distinguished Canadians—one from each year of Elizabeth's reign. The Queen also planted another tree on the grounds of her Canadian residence, and met with members of the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen dines with our best| publisher=CBC| date=14 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/14/royalupdate021014.html| accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref> The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh then departed Canada on 15 October.

===Jamaica===
[[Image:GJ trinket pot.jpg|thumb|A trinket pot, sold as memorabilia merchandise for the Golden Jubilee]]
Elizabeth's first official engagements related to the Golden Jubilee took place in [[Jamaica]]. She had acceded in 1952 as [[queen of the United Kingdom]] and became distinctly [[queen of Jamaica]] 10 years later; her tour of the island therefore coincided with the country's 40th anniversary of independence.<ref name=BBCJam1>{{Cite news| title=Queen speaks to Jamaican Parliament| publisher=BBC| date=19 February 2002| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1828657.stm| accessdate=25 November 2009}}</ref> She arrived for the celebrations on 18 February 2002, nine days following the death of her sister, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]]; the Queen established a short period of private, though not state, mourning.<ref name=Pond7>{{Cite journal| last=House of Commons Library| author-link=House of Commons Library| last2=Pond| first2=Chris| title=Golden Jubilee 2002| place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| date=13 January 2003| page=7| url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-01435.pdf| id=SN/PC/1435| accessdate=25 November 2009| ref=harv| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605082313/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-01435.pdf| archivedate=5 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Elizabeth was first welcomed in [[Montego Bay]], after which she travelled to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and stayed at her [[Jamaican prime minister]]'s residence, Jamaica House.

Despite some anti-monarchical sentiment in the country at the time, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were "enthusiastically welcomed" by Jamaicans; 57% of those polled said the visit was important to the country and large crowds turned out to see Elizabeth, though there were small protests by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] seeking reparations for slavery and their repatriation to Africa.<ref name=BBCJam1 /> The Queen received an official welcome at [[King's House, Jamaica|King's House]], the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]]'s residence, met with Jamaican veterans of the [[World War I|First World War]],<ref>{{Cite news| title=Picture gallery: Queen in Jamaica| publisher=BBC| date=19 February 2002| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1829358.stm| accessdate=25 November 2009}}</ref> addressed her [[Parliament of Jamaica|Jamaican parliament]], and visited an underprivileged area of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], known as [[Trenchtown]], viewing urban poverty projects while there.<ref name=BBCJam1 /> The tour ended on a unique note when, at the final banquet in Jamaica, a power outage plunged King's House into darkness during the meal; Elizabeth described the event as "memorable".<ref>{{Cite book| last=Brandreth| first=Gyles| authorlink=Gyles Brandreth| title=Philip and Elizabeth: Portrait of a Marriage| publisher=Century| location=London| page=31| isbn=0-7126-6103-4}}</ref>

===New Zealand===
Following her tour of Jamaica, the Queen next toured New Zealand, making stops in [[Auckland]], [[Taupo]], [[Christchurch]], and [[Wellington]]. She and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in the country on 22 February, just after [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] said in a speech that she felt it "inevitable that New Zealand will become a republic."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Bates| first=Stephen| title=Republican pledge greets Queen| newspaper=The Guardian| date=22 February 2002| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/22/jubilee.monarchy| accessdate=1 December 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> The royal couple were greeted by the Governor-General and other officials when they disembarked from the Royal Flight;<ref name=TVNZ>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/423466/83309|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|title=Low turnout to welcome the Queen|date=22 February 2002|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref> Clark was absent, as she was at a meeting of centre-left leaders in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/83429/411361/article.html|title=Helen Clark attends centre-left flock|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|date=24 February 2002|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref> A low turn out was reported to see the Queen when she arrived at the airport,<ref name=TVNZ /> while an estimated 4,000 people came to view the Queen in Auckland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/83899/2591764.xhtml|title=Royal tour draws to a close|date=26 February 2002|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
Celebrations for Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee took place throughout the United Kingdom between May and July 2002. In the lead-up to those festive weeks, the British media—''[[The Guardian]]'', in particular—predicted that the jubilee would be a failure,<ref>{{Cite news| last=Bates| first=Stephen| title=Palace plays down fears of jubilee flop| newspaper=The Guardian| date=24 January 2002| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/24/monarchy.jubilee| accessdate=1 December 2009| ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last=O'Farrell| first=John| title=God save the jubilee| newspaper=The Guardian| date=2 February 2002| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/02/monarchy.jubilee2| accessdate=1 December 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> arguing that Britain was no longer interested in the monarchy; a pervading sense of apathy amongst the populace seemed to confirm this. However, the predictions were proven wrong, especially during the official jubilee weekend, when people numbering in the hundreds of thousands turned out to participate in the fêtes. These festivities culminated in the 4 June event on [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] in London, when over one million attended the parade and flypast. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' stated in its editorial: "How the sour anti-Royalists in ''The Guardian'' newspaper and elsewhere have been confounded. They were convinced that the occasion would be a flop, that the [[House of Windsor]] was no longer capable of inspiring the loyalties it once did and that anyway the concept of royalty was passe in cool Britannia."<ref>{{Cite news| title=Press revels in jubilee spectacle| publisher=CNN| date=5 June 2002| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/05/jubilee.press/| accessdate=14 November 2007}}</ref>

It was on 3 March that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh returned to London from Australia. Eight days later, on [[Commonwealth Day]], the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] unveiled at [[Buckingham Palace]] a portrait of Elizabeth, painted by [[Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy]] that had been commissioned to mark the Queen's 50 years as [[Head of the Commonwealth]];<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen's Jubilee portrait unveiled| publisher=BBC| date=12 March 2002| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1865633.stm| accessdate=14 November 2007}}</ref> the work now hangs at [[Marlborough House]],<ref>{{Cite book| last=Wilkins| first=Verna| title=Chinwe Roy| publisher=Random House| year=2002| location=London| isbn=1-870516-59-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Lock| first=Imogen| title=Celebrate!| publisher=Sheeran Lock| year=2003| location=London| isbn=1-900123-90-8}}</ref> with a study kept as part of the Queen's collection at [[St James's Palace]]. At the end of the month, however, the Queen was dealt another blow when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|her mother]] died on 30 March; the [[Commonwealth realm]]s observed a period of mourning, and on 9 April, the day of [[Funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|her funeral]], more than one million people filled the area outside [[Westminster Abbey]] and along the {{convert|23|mi|km|sing=on}} route from central London to the Queen Mother's final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=Queues at Queen Mother vault| publisher=CNN| date=10 April 2002| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/10/uk.queenmum/index.html| accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref>

Plans for the Golden Jubilee in the United Kingdom went ahead as planned, and, after a dinner hosted by [[Tony Blair]] at [[10 Downing Street]] for her and all her living former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]] ([[Sir John Major]], [[The Baroness Thatcher]], [[Sir Edward Heath]], and [[The Lord Callaghan of Cardiff]]),<ref>{{Cite news| last=Katz| first=Laine| title=Former PMs gather for jubilee dinner| newspaper=The Guardian| date=29 April 2002| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/29/redbox.jubilee| accessdate=1 December 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> the Queen officially launched the celebrations in the UK with a speech to both [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|houses of the British parliament]] at [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] on 30 April,<ref name=Pond2>{{Harvnb| Pond| 2003| p=2}}</ref> marking the fifth time in five decades that Elizabeth II addressed her British parliament on her own account. The Queen spoke of 50 unforgettable years and the changes to British life and society in that time, and elaborated that the monarchy must change also; Elizabeth said she had "witnessed the transformation of the international landscape through which [the United Kingdom] must chart its course" and declared her "resolve to continue, with the support of [the Royal Family], to serve the people... to the best of [her] ability through the changing times ahead."

For the Queen's goodwill visits, which commenced on 1 May, two to three days were spent in each corner of England; the Queen and the Duke first stopped in [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and [[Somerset]] before travelling to [[Tyne and Wear]], then finally to [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Berkshire]]. On 13 May, the couple were received in [[Northern Ireland]], and visited such areas as [[County Fermanagh]], [[Cookstown, County Tyrone|Cookstown]], and [[Omagh]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Pond| 2003| p=3}}</ref> Then, throughout much of mid-May, the royal couple were in London devoting much time to the promotion of the arts, attending the [[Chelsea Flower Show]], dedicating the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, and attending a reception at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. The jubilee trips recommenced on 23 May with a six-day trip to [[Scotland]]; the royals first stopped in [[Glasgow]], and then travelled on to [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], [[Stornoway]] and [[Aberdeen]], and, following the jubilee weekend in London, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on 7 June toured [[West Sussex]], spent three days in [[Wales]], touring [[Anglesey]], [[Llanelli]], and [[Cardiff]]. The next month, the royal couple made two-day trips to the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[Yorkshire]] (where the Queen visited the set of the [[soap opera]] ''[[Emmerdale]]''),<ref name=Buck50 /> and the counties of [[Suffolk]] and [[Norfolk]], as well as undertaking a three-day goodwill trip to [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], where the Queen opened the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]].<ref name=Pond2 /> The Queen closed out July by touring the [[East Midlands]], and ended her domestic tour by visiting [[Lancashire]].<ref name=Pond4>{{Harvnb| Pond| 2003| p=4}}</ref>

Amongst several other events independently organised to celebrate the Jubilee in June 2002 were the [[British Army]]'s staging at [[Portsmouth]] of a special parade of 6,000 personnel from all three branches of the [[British Armed Forces]]. This contrasted with the vastly larger events of past Royal Jubilee, in that there was no Royal Naval Fleet Review, or large scale Army Review. The Queen's bodyguards mounted a conjoined parade, wherein 300 members of the [[Gentlemen at Arms]], [[Yeoman of the Guard]], and [[Yeoman Warders]] all marched together for the first time in the centuries since their respective foundations. Elizabeth also hosted a banquet for all of Europe's reigning kings and queens, one for all her incumbent [[Governor-General|Governors-General]], and garden parties at both Buckingham Palace and [[Holyrood Palace]] for people born on [[Accession Day]] 1952.<ref name=Pond2 /> Around the country, street parties were organised, for which some 40,000 toolkits were distributed.<ref name=Buck50 />

====Golden Jubilee Weekend====

The Golden Jubilee Weekend took place between 1 and 4 June 2002 in London,<ref name=Pond2 /> for which the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh left Scotland on 29 May to make final preparations. On the first evening, the Saturday, the ''[[Prom at the Palace]]'' took place in the [[Garden at Buckingham Palace|gardens of Buckingham Palace]] and highlighted [[European classical music|classical music]]; out of the two million who applied for tickets, 12,500 people were selected to attend,<ref name=Pond8>{{Harvnb| Pond| 2000| p=8}}</ref> making the event the largest ever held on the royal property. The crowds were entertained by the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] and [[BBC Symphony Chorus]], conducted by [[Sir Andrew Davis]], and guest vocalists included [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]], [[Angela Gheorghiu]], and [[Roberto Alagna]].

The following day, the Queen and her husband attended a church service at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], while their family were present at thanksgiving services elsewhere in the United Kingdom; [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] and his sons, Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]], in [[Swansea]]; [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Earl]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]] in [[Salisbury]]; and [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] in [[Ayr]].

After time on 3 June touring [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]], Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh returned to London and the former at 1:00&nbsp;pm launched the nationwide [[BBC Music Live]] Festival, in which more than 200 towns and cities across the United Kingdom publicly played the [[Beatles]] song "[[All You Need Is Love]]". During the day, street parties were held around the country, and that evening, the Queen, the Duke, and other members of the immediate [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], made themselves present at another concert on the grounds of Buckingham Palace; this fête, called ''[[Party at the Palace]]'', showcased achievements in [[pop music]] over the previous 50 years, with headlining acts including [[Paul McCartney]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Cliff Richard]], and [[Tony Bennett]]. ''[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'' guitarist [[Brian May]] commenced the event by playing his arrangement of "[[God Save the Queen]]" from the roof of the palace, and Paul McCartney concluded the night with such numbers as "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" and "[[Hey Jude]]", which were each performed before and after the Queen lit the National Beacon at the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]], the last in a string of 2,006 [[beacon]]s to be lit in a chain throughout the world,<ref name=Buck50 /> echoing [[Queen Victoria]]'s own Golden Jubilee in 1887. 12,000 guests were allowed into the concert, while an additional one million people thronged The Mall to watch and listen to the festivities on giant television screens and join in with the palace audience's singing from outside the gates of Buckingham Palace,<ref name=Pond8 /> and a further 200 million watched the televised event around the world.<ref name=Buck50 />

On 4 June, the entire royal family attended the [[National Service of Thanksgiving]] at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], to which the Queen rode in the [[Gold State Coach]],<ref name=Pond8 /> followed by lunch at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]]. There the Queen addressed the crowd and expressed pride at the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]'s achievements, both during her reign as queen and throughout time; Elizabeth was quoted as saying: "Gratitude, respect and pride, these words sum up how I feel about the people of this country and the Commonwealth—and what this Golden Jubilee means to me."<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Royal Household| title=Jubilee Journal| journal=Royal Insight| issue=June 2002| publisher=Queen's Printer| location=London| date=4 June 2002| url=http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk/output/Page1336.asp| accessdate=16 September 2005| ref=harv| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050913041139/http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk/OutPut/Page1336.asp| archivedate=13 September 2005| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The jubilee procession then started along The Mall in the early afternoon; in addition to entertainers performing for the Queen, numerous floats were decorated to illustrate British life through the years of Elizabeth's reign and driven through The Mall. The parade concluded with 5,000 adults and children from the 54 member-states of the Commonwealth of Nations marching in their various [[national costume]]s before the Queen and presenting to her a "rainbow of wishes", consisting of handwritten notes from school children across the Commonwealth. In front of more than one million people,<ref name=Buck50 /> the Royal Family assembled on the balcony of the Centre Room of Buckingham Palace and watched a [[flypast]] consisting of every type of [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft in service (27 in all),<ref name=Buck50 /> [[Concorde]], and the [[Red Arrows]].  There was only one publicly noted negative event in relation to the jubilee when approximately 40 activists, mostly drawn from the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Movement Against the Monarchy]], were arrested during a protest in the run-up to the Jubilee Weekend.<ref>{{Cite news|  title=Jubilee protesters get damages| publisher=BBC| date=4 February 2004| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3459393.stm| accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref>

====Celebrations in The Turks & Caicos Islands====
In the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], a [[British overseas territories|British Overseas Territory]], for the first four days of June, celebrations took place throughout the Islands, presided over by [[Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands|Governor]] [[Mervyn Jones]]. The Public Relations Department of the Tourist Board for the Jubilee Committee produced the Jubilee Souvenir Brochure, with text and images covering historical Royal Visits provided by the National Museum; only 5,000 were produced, issue number 1 being given to Queen Elizabeth II herself. The museum also provided photographs for the production of three sets of stamps, and, for the Jubilee Weekend, prepared a temporary exhibition on royal visits, with other items from the past, such as the coronation medals issued in to some local residents in 1953. Other items produced to commemorate the Jubilee were a straw crown made on [[Middle Caicos]] by Loathie Harvey and Judy Geddis, two 20-crown coins, and a badge given to all school children as a memento of the historic occasion.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tcmuseum.org/royal_events/queen_elizabeth_ii_golden_jubilee_celebrations/| last=Sadler| first=Nigel| title=Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Celebrations| publisher=Turks and Caicos National Museum| accessdate=4 November 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008081328/http://www.tcmuseum.org/royal_events/queen_elizabeth_ii_golden_jubilee_celebrations/| archivedate=8 October 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Celebrations outside the Commonwealth==
The Golden Jubilee was also marked in [[New York City]], where the pinnacle of the [[Empire State Building]] was lit in royal purple and gold. The city's mayor, [[Michael Bloomberg]], and officials at the British consulate said the tribute was a sign of thanks both to the Queen for having had the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|American national anthem]] played at Buckingham Palace during the [[Queen's Guard#Queen.27s Guard|Changing of the Guard]] on 13 September 2001 and to the British people for their support afterwards.<ref name=NewYork>{{Cite news| last=Stanley| first=Jane| title=Empire State dons Jubilee colours|publisher=BBC|date=5 June 2002| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2026783.stm| accessdate=4 November 2007}}</ref> It had been more than 10 years since the Empire State Building gave such an honour to an individual not from the United States; the most recent instance was when [[Nelson Mandela]] visited New York after his release from prison in 1990.<ref name=NewYork/>

==Monuments and souvenirs==
Before, during, and after the jubilee year, souvenirs were created, monuments unveiled, and public works named in commemoration of the royal event. In Australia, [[Australia Post]] released a special stamp combining old and new images of Queen Elizabeth II, along with a booklet outlining the Queen's reign.<ref>{{Cite press release| title=Australia Post Celebrates The Golden Jubilee Of Queen Elizabeth II| publisher=Queen's Printer for Australia| date=11 February 2002| url=http://www.auspost.com.au/BCP/0,1467,CH2470%257EMO19,00.html| accessdate=30 November 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In Canada, the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] earmarked [[Canadian Dollar|$CAD]] 250,000 as a donation in the Queen's name to the [[Dominion Institute]]'s [[Dominion Institute#The Memory Project|Memory Project]], aimed at educating Canadian youth on the experiences and contributions of the country's veterans from the First World War through to modern [[peacekeeping]] missions.<ref>{{Cite press release| title=The Government of Canada offers gift in honour of Her Majesty to commemorate 2005 Royal Visit| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2005| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/news-comm/cu050318e.htm| accessdate=16 June 2005| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901163142/http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/news-comm/cu050318e.htm| archivedate=1 September 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The provinces also marked the milestone; the [[Ontario]] Governor-in-Council, on the advice of his [[Premier of Ontario|premier]], approved the renaming of Dalton Digby Wildlands Provincial Park as the [[Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park]] and,<ref>{{Cite book| last=Ontario Parks| author-link=Ontario Parks| title=Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands: Background Information| page=1| place=Toronto| publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario| year=2006| url=http://www.ontarioparks.com/English/planning_pdf/quee_background.pdf| isbn=0-7794-9883-6| accessdate=26 November 2009| ref=harv| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704170733/http://www.ontarioparks.com/English/planning_pdf/quee_background.pdf| archivedate=4 July 2010| df=dmy-all}}</ref> in [[Saskatchewan]], an equestrian statue of Queen Elizabeth II was commissioned and erected alongside the Queen Elizabeth II Gardens on the grounds of the [[Saskatchewan Legislative Building|Legislative Building]].<ref>{{Cite press release| title=Queen's Statue Maquettes Presented to Donors| publisher=Queen's Printer for Saskatchewan| date=4 February 2004| url=http://www.gov.sk.ca/news?newsId=51ebe038-90fd-4135-9588-5673bc53172c| accessdate=29 November 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611022622/http://www.gov.sk.ca/news?newsId=51ebe038-90fd-4135-9588-5673bc53172c| archivedate=11 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[Alberta]], the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Recognition Act established the Queen's Golden Jubilee Citizenship Medal, the Queen's Golden Jubilee Scholarship for the Visual and Performing Arts, and the Premier's Citizenship Award in Recognition of the Queen's Golden Jubilee.<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=20 March 2002| title=Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Recognition Act| series=2| location=Edmonton| publisher=Queen's Printer for Alberta| url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/sa-2002-c-q-0.5/latest/sa-2002-c-q-0.5.html| accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref>

A special £5 coin was released in the United Kingdom to celebrate the event, and the annual Queen's Golden Jubilee Award for volunteer service groups was founded in 2002, while private enterprises produced various ornaments and trinkets as memorabilia of the jubilee; manufacturers such as [[Spode]] created various forms of commemorative china and crystalware.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Pandya| first=Nick| title=Celebrating the dawn of a golden age for royal memorabilia| newspaper=The Guardian| date=11 May 2002| url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/may/11/alternativeinvestment.jubilee| accessdate=1 December 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> At [[Windsor Castle]], the Jubilee Gardens were opened, the first new public area to be created since 1820,<ref name=Buck50 /> and a 167 feet (51-metre) inverted roller coaster, [[Jubilee Odyssey]], was constructed at the [[Fantasy Island (UK amusement park)|Fantasy Island]] theme park in [[Lincolnshire]].<ref>{{Cite news|  last=Marshall| first=Doug| title=Riding the highs and lows| publisher=BBC| date=4 May 2002| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1964086.stm| accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref>

==Legacy==
It was argued in retrospective analysis that the jubilee had been of benefit both to nationalism and the monarchy;<ref>{{Harvnb| Pond| 2003| p=9}}</ref> the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' stated: "Below and in front of her an event as magical and magnificent as the Golden Jubilee itself was unfurling before her captivated eyes—Britain was rediscovering the [[Land of Hope and Glory|land of hope and glory]],"<ref>{{Cite news| title=Press revels in jubilee spectacle| publisher=CNN| date=5 June 2002| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/05/jubilee.press/| accessdate=13 January 2009}}</ref> and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said: "When she daintily bent over to drop a puck at an NHL game... she achieved perhaps the most brilliant melding of symbolism in Canadian history... The [[JumboTron|Jumbotron]] in Vancouver's GM Place said it all, flashing the Queen's golden EIIR [[Royal cypher|cypher]] on the giant screen atop the beer advertisement: '[[I Am Canadian|I am Canadian]]'. The crowd went hysterical."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Valpy |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Valpy |title=Queen wraps up her visit with poignant nod to future |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |pages=A1 |date=15 October 2002 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/queen-wraps-up-her-visit-with-poignant-nod-to-future/article25423388/ |accessdate=13 January 2009 |ref=harv }}</ref>
