'''Andrew Lamar Alexander Jr.''' (born July 3, 1940) is an American politician who is currently serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Tennessee]], a seat he has held since 2003. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he also was the [[List of Governors of Tennessee|45th]] [[governor of Tennessee]] from 1979 to 1987 and the [[List of United States Secretaries of Education|5th]] [[United States Secretary of Education]] from 1991 to 1993, where he helped the implementation of Education 2000. 

Born in [[Maryville, Tennessee]], Alexander graduated from [[Vanderbilt University]] and the [[New York University School of Law]]. After establishing a legal career in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Alexander ran for Governor of Tennessee in 1974, but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Ray Blanton]]. Alexander ran for governor again in 1978, and this time defeated his Democratic opponent. He won re-election in 1982 and served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] from 1985 to 1986.

Alexander served as the president of the [[University of Tennessee]] from 1988 until 1991, when he accepted an appointment as Secretary of Education under President [[George H. W. Bush]]. Alexander sought the presidential nomination in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1996|1996 Republican primaries]], but withdrew before the [[Super Tuesday]] primaries. He sought the nomination again in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|2000 Republican primaries]], but dropped out after a poor showing in the [[Iowa Straw Poll (1979-2011)|Iowa Straw Poll]].

In [[2002 United States Senate election in Tennessee|2002]], Alexander won election to succeed retiring Senator [[Fred Thompson]]. Alexander defeated Congressman [[Ed Bryant]] in the Republican primary and Congressman [[Bob Clement]] in the general election. He served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States Senate|Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference]] from 2007 to 2012. Alexander has served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee]] since 2015. He introduced the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which supplanted the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] in 2015. On December 17, 2018, Alexander announced that he would not run for a fourth term in the Senate in [[2020 United States Senate election in Tennessee|2020]].

==Early life and education==

==Career==

===Early political career===
[[File:Nixon Contact Sheet WHPO-4140 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Alexander with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1970]]
After graduating from law school, Alexander clerked for [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] Judge [[John Minor Wisdom]] in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1965 to 1966.<ref name="Miller">{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/bush/essays/cabinet/689|title=Lamar Alexander (1991–1993): Secretary of Education|publisher=[[Miller Center of Public Affairs]], University of Virginia.|access-date=January 3, 2013|archive-date=March 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317142805/http://millercenter.org/president/bush/essays/cabinet/689|url-status=dead}},</ref>

In 1967, Alexander worked as a Legislative Assistant for Senator [[Howard Baker]]. While a staffer, he was briefly roommates with future U.S. Senator [[Trent Lott]], and met his future wife at a staffer softball game. In 1969, he worked for [[Bryce Harlow]], President [[Richard Nixon]]'s executive assistant.<ref name="Miller" /> In 1970, he moved back to Tennessee, serving as campaign manager for Memphis dentist [[Winfield Dunn]]'s successful gubernatorial bid.<ref name=tsla /> Dunn was the first Republican in 50&nbsp;years to win the governorship.<ref name=langsdon>Phillip Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'' (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 370–381, 370–393.</ref> After this campaign, Alexander co-founded<ref name=vandymag/> and worked as a partner in the Nashville law firm of Dearborn and Ewing.<ref name=tsla /> Meanwhile, Alexander rented a [[garage apartment]] to [[Thomas W.

The [[Tennessee State Constitution]] at the time prevented governors from serving consecutive terms, so with Dunn unable to run, Alexander sought the party's nomination for governor in 1974. He defeated his two chief opponents, Commissioner of Mental Health [[Nat T. Winston, Jr.]], and [[Southwestern Company]] president Dortch Oldham, 120,773 votes to 90,980 and 35,683, respectively.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=358825 Our Campaigns – 1974 TN Governor, Republican Primary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113041853/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=358825 |date=January 13, 2014 }}, ''Our Campaigns''.

After the 1974 campaign, Alexander returned to the practice of law.<ref name=langsdon /> In 1974, ''[[TIME magazine|TIME Magazine]]'' named Alexander one of the ''200 Faces of the Future''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,879402,00.html|title=Special Section: 200 Faces for the Future|date=July 15, 1974|work=Time|volume=104|issue=3|access-date=July 18, 2018|archive-date=March 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328004851/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,879402,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref>  In 1977, Alexander once again worked in Baker's Washington office following Baker's election as [[Senate Minority Leader]].<ref name=langsdon />

===Governor of Tennessee===

Although the [[Tennessee State Constitution]] had been amended in early 1978 to allow a governor to succeed himself, Blanton chose not to seek re-election, due to a number of scandals. Alexander once again ran for governor, and made a name for himself by walking from [[Mountain City, Tennessee|Mountain City]] in the far northeast of the state to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in the far southwest, a distance of {{convert|1022|mi|km}}, wearing a red and black flannel shirt that would become something of a trademark for him.<ref name=tsla /><ref>{{Cite news |title=Politics: Lamar Alexander; Behind the Flannel Shirt, Deep Washington Roots |work=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/26/us/politics-lamar-alexander-behind-the-flannel-shirt-deep-washington-roots.html |access-date=January 24, 2014 |first1=Elaine |last1=Sciolino |first2=Jeff |last2=Gerth |archive-date=May 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512014316/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/26/us/politics-lamar-alexander-behind-the-flannel-shirt-deep-washington-roots.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Sen.

In early 1979, a furor ensued over pardons made by Governor Blanton, whose administration was already under investigation in a cash-for-clemency scandal.<ref>Fred Rolater, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=97 Leonard Ray Blanton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129225252/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=97 |date=January 29, 2018 }}, ''[[Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture]]'', 2009.

Wilder later called the move "impeachment Tennessee-style."

In February 1979, shortly after his inauguration, Alexander created an Office of Ombudsman, which was charged with cutting government red tape.<ref name=tsla />  He also gave state employees a 7% raise,<ref name=langsdon /> and replaced state prisoners working at the [[Tennessee Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]] with a paid staff.<ref name=6months />  One of Alexander's biggest accomplishments as governor was the relationship he cultivated with the Japanese corporate community, which resulted in the construction of a $500&nbsp;million [[Nissan]] [[Nissan Smryna assembly plant|assembly plant]] in [[Smyrna, Tennessee|Smyrna]] in 1982, the largest single investment in the state's history up to the time.<ref name=mcwherter>Billy Stair, ''The Life and Career of Ned McWherter'' (State Public Affairs Office, 2011), pp. 67–79.</ref> Alexander was also instrumental in the location of [[General Motors]]' [[Spring Hill Manufacturing|Saturn Manufacturing Facility]] in [[Spring Hill, Tennessee|Spring Hill]], which began operations in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flessner|first=Dave|date=May 24, 2011|title=Lamar Alexander touts Tennessee|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/business/aroundregion/story/2011/may/24/lamar-alexander-touts-tennessee/50370/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=March 28, 2019|archive-date=March 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328194944/https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/business/aroundregion/story/2011/may/24/lamar-alexander-touts-tennessee/50370/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In [[1982 Tennessee gubernatorial election|1982]] Alexander took advantage of the 1978 constitutional amendment allowing governors to serve a second consecutive four-year term. He ran again and defeated Knoxville mayor [[Randy Tyree]], 737,963 votes to 500,937.<ref name=langsdon /> During his second term, he served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] from 1985 to 1986, and was chair of the President's Commission on American Outdoors, 1985 to 1986.<ref name=tsla />  He also oversaw the "Tennessee Homecoming" in 1986, in which local communities launched numerous projects that focused on state and local heritage.<ref name=tehc>Carroll Van West, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=18 Lamar Alexander] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512194636/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=18 |date=May 12, 2013 }}," ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2009.

Later that year, Alexander convinced House Speaker [[Ned McWherter]] to support an amended version of the bill, which passed.<ref name=mcwherter />

In 1986, Alexander proposed the "Better Roads Program" to fund a backlog of needed highway projects. The project increased the state's [[fuel taxes in the United States|gasoline tax]] by three cents, and funded fifteen priority projects and six interstate-type projects including [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville, and the eastern extension of the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] near Knoxville, now signed as Interstate 140.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/documents/TDOT-History.pdf|title=A Brief History of TDOT|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=2015|website=tn.gov|publisher=[[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]|access-date=March 28, 2019|archive-date=January 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200123205455/https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/documents/TDOT-History.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> A similar initiative based on the Better Roads Program, the "IMPROVE Act", was signed by Governor [[Bill Haslam]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Joel|date=April 24, 2017|title=Tennessee gas tax increase: What it means for you|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/24/tennessee-gas-tax-increase-what-means-you/100839608/|work=[[The Tennessean]]|location=Nashville|access-date=January 27, 2018|archive-date=November 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120171849/https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/24/tennessee-gas-tax-increase-what-means-you/100839608/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As Education Secretary, he sparked controversy after he approved [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]] (TRACS) to [[educational accreditation|accredit schools]] despite an advisory panel that repeatedly recommended against it in 1991 and 1987.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rejecting Review Board's Advice, Alexander Grants Federal Recognition to Christian Accrediting Body|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|url=http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/articles-38.dir/issue-02.dir/02a03401.htm|format=A40|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=September 4, 1991|access-date=December 26, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Accrediting body angers secretary of education|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/WT/lib00179,0EB0EF6AF5F54465.html|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=November 7, 1991|access-date=December 26, 2008|archive-date=November 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120171852/https://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0EF6AF5F54465&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Battle Lines Drawn on a College Diversity Debate |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB2A28280FA2D5C.html|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=October 20, 1991 |access-date=December 26, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2020}}</ref><ref name="DinosaurTRACS">{{cite news |url=http://www.nexusjournal.org/2002judicial/dinosaurtracsRTP.htm|title=Dinosaur TRACS: The Approaching Conflict between Establishment Clause Jurisprudence And College Accreditation Procedures|publisher=[[Nexus (law journal)]] from [[Chapman University School of Law]]|date=March 24, 2002|first=Timothy|last=Sandefur |access-date=November 4, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133955/http://www.nexusjournal.org/2002judicial/dinosaurtracsRTP.htm|archive-date=January 6, 2007}}</ref>

In 1993, [[Steve Levicoff]] published a book-length critical discussion of TRACS and Alexander's decision in ''When The TRACS Stop Short''.<ref>[[Steve Levicoff]], ''When The TRACS Stop Short: An Evaluation And Critique Of The Transnational Association Of Christian Colleges And Schools'', (Institute on Religion and Law, 1993)</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/art-41.dir/issue-40.dir/40a02801.htm|title=Christian Accrediting Group Faulted in Federal Review|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=June 16, 1995|first=Scott|last=Jaschik|access-date=May 4, 2007}}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Former Department of Education employee and writer Lisa Schiffren has stated that, "His fortune is founded on sweetheart deals not available to the general public, and a series of cozy sinecures provided by local businessmen. Such deals are not illegal..."  Schiffren further notes that, in 1987, Alexander helped found Corporate Child Care Management, Inc. (now known as [[Bright Horizons Family Solutions]] Inc.), a company that{{spaced ndash}}via a merger{{spaced ndash}}is now the nation's largest provider of worksite day care. While businessman [[Jack C. Massey]] spent $2&nbsp;million on this enterprise, Alexander co-founded the company with only $5,000 of stock which increased in value to $800,000, a 15,900 percent return within four years. Also in 1987, he wrote a never-cashed investment check for $10,000 to [[Chris Whittle|Christopher Whittle]] for shares in Whittle Communications that increased in value to $330,000. In 1991, Alexander's house just purchased for $570,000 was sold to Whittle for $977,500. Alexander's wife obtained an $133,000 profit from her $8,900 investment in a company created to privatize prisons. Alexander frequently shifted assets to his wife's name, yet such transfers are not legal under federal ethics and security laws.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Schiffren |first= Lisa |date= September 1995 |title= The Man From Tennessee |journal= [[The American Spectator]] |pages= 35–36 |location= Arlington, Virginia |url= http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmSpectator-1995sep-00033 |access-date= April 29, 2012 |archive-date= February 3, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130203062412/http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmSpectator-1995sep-00033 |url-status= live }}</ref>  In his 2005 US Senate financial disclosure report, he listed personal ownership of BFAM (Bright Horizons Family Solutions) stock valued (at that time) between $1&nbsp;million and $5&nbsp;million.

===United States presidential bids===

Alexander made two unsuccessful runs for President of the United States, in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]. In 1996, he finished third in the [[Iowa caucuses]] and the [[New Hampshire primary]], and dropped out before the [[Super Tuesday]] primaries. After dropping out of the race, Alexander took on an advisory role in the [[Bob Dole|Dole]]/[[Jack Kemp|Kemp]] campaign. In 2000, during his second candidacy, he traveled around the US in a [[Ford Explorer]], eschewing a [[campaign bus]] or plane. That journey lasted less than six months, from the announcement of Alexander's candidacy on March 9, 1999, to his withdrawal on August 16, 1999, after a poor showing in the [[Ames Straw Poll]]. He ended both of his presidential campaigns in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christcenteredmall.com/news/politics/Republican-Race/alexander-profile.htm |title=Biography of Lamar Alexander |date=May 29, 2017 |work=Christ-Centered Mall, Inc., US |access-date=May 29, 2017 |archive-date=August 26, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826035746/http://www.christcenteredmall.com/news/politics/Republican-Race/alexander-profile.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/12/us/alexander-after-6-year-run-is-short-on-time-and-money.html |title=Alexander, After 6-Year Run, Is Short on Time and Money |date=August 12, 1999 |first1=Melinda |last1=Henneberger |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 29, 2017 |archive-date=September 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912131333/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/12/us/alexander-after-6-year-run-is-short-on-time-and-money.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===U.S. Senate career===
[[File:Lamar Alexander and George W. Bush.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] in 2004]]
[[File:Lamar and Mrs. Alexander.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Senator and Mrs. Alexander with the Presbyterian Chaplain of the 844th from [[Rhea County]] in 2005]]
Despite vowing not to return to elective office, Alexander was nevertheless persuaded by the [[White House]] to run for the open seat of retiring Senator [[Fred Dalton Thompson|Fred Thompson]] in 2002. Seen as a moderate Republican by Tennessee standards, his candidacy was vigorously opposed by conservatives, who instead supported US Representative, and a House manager during the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, [[Ed Bryant]].

Alexander was better-funded and armed with more prominent endorsements, however, and edged Bryant in the primary, 295,052 votes to 233,678.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=72|title=TN US Senate - R Primary|work=Our Campaigns|access-date=January 6, 2013|archive-date=December 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120309/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=72|url-status=live}}</ref> Democrats had high hopes of retaking the seat that they lost in 1994 with their candidate, US Representative [[Bob Clement]], a member of a prominent political family. However, Clement's campaign never really caught on, and Alexander defeated him in the general election with 54 percent of the vote. With his election to the US Senate, he became the first Tennessean to be popularly elected both governor and senator. At the age of 62, Alexander also became the oldest elected freshman US senator from Tennessee since Democrat [[Lawrence D. Tyson]] in 1924.

In 2006, a newly discovered species of [[springtail]] found in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] was named ''[[Cosberella lamaralexanderi]]'' in Alexander's honor, because of his support of scientific research funding in the park and because the springtails' patterning is reminiscent of the [[Tartan|plaid]] shirts Alexander typically wears while campaigning.<ref>"[http://www.wvlt.tv/home/headlines/11787751.html Scientists Name Insect Species After Sen.

Alexander opposed the proposed [[Green New Deal]], saying that it is not the proper solution to climate change and calling it "an assault on cars, cows, and combustion," and in response proposed what he calls the "New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy" (named after the World War II-era [[Manhattan Project]], which developed the first [[atomic bomb]]).<ref>{{cite news|last=Fearnow|first=Benjamin|date=March 27, 2019|title=REPUBLICAN SENATOR PROPOSES 'NEW MANHATTAN PROJECT,' RIDICULES GREEN NEW DEAL AS 'ASSAULT ON CARS, COWS'|url=https://www.newsweek.com/climate-change-green-new-deal-lamar-alexander-manhattan-project-nuclear-clean-1376942%3famp=1|work=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=March 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327162427/https://www.newsweek.com/climate-change-green-new-deal-lamar-alexander-manhattan-project-nuclear-clean-1376942?amp=1|archive-date=March 27, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The proposed plan contains ten major points of developing advanced nuclear power, more efficient [[natural gas]], [[carbon capture]], more efficient batteries, more efficient buildings, more [[electric vehicle]]s, cheaper [[solar power]], [[fusion power]], advanced computing, and doubled funding for the [[U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Lamar|date=March 29, 2019|title=Senator Alexander: The Green New Deal Would Cost Trillions Annually—Here's A Better Idea (Op- ed)|url=https://www.chattanoogan.com/2019/3/27/387255/Senator-Alexander-The-Green-New-Deal.aspx|work=[[The Chattanoogan]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=March 27, 2019|archive-date=March 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328040400/https://www.chattanoogan.com/2019/3/27/387255/Senator-Alexander-The-Green-New-Deal.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> Alexander proposed a similar plan by the same name in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alexander|first1=Lamar|date=Summer 2008|title=A New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy Independence|url=https://issues.org/alexander/|journal=[[Issues in Science and Technology]]|volume=24|issue=4|access-date=March 27, 2019|archive-date=March 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328042428/https://issues.org/alexander/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Trade ====
In November 2018, Alexander was one of twelve Republican senators to sign a letter to President Trump requesting the [[United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement]] be submitted to Congress by the end of the month to allow a vote on it before the end of the year as they were concerned "passage of the USMCA as negotiated will become significantly more difficult" if having to be approved through the incoming [[116th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/21/trade-senate-republicans-trump-canada-mexico-1010053|title=GOP senators seek quick passage of Mexico-Canada trade deal|first=Burgess|last=Everett|work=Politico|date=November 21, 2018|access-date=September 30, 2020|archive-date=January 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109011931/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/21/trade-senate-republicans-trump-canada-mexico-1010053|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Judiciary ====

In March 2016, around seven months before the next presidential election, Alexander declared his opposition to the Senate considering President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court. Alexander said: "I believe it is reasonable to give the American people a voice by allowing the next president to fill this lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court." In September 2020, with less than two months to the next presidential election, Alexander supported an immediate vote on President Trump's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. Alexander declared that "even during a presidential election year", "no one should be surprised that a Republican Senate majority would vote on a Republican president’s Supreme Court nomination".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Desjardins |first1=Lisa |title=What every Republican senator has said about filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-every-republican-senator-has-said-about-filling-a-supreme-court-vacancy-in-an-election-year |access-date=October 4, 2020 |work=[[PBS NewsHour]] |date=September 22, 2020 |archive-date=October 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031171254/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-every-republican-senator-has-said-about-filling-a-supreme-court-vacancy-in-an-election-year |url-status=live }}</ref>

The following is an incomplete list of legislation that Alexander introduced in the Senate.
* [[PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252; 113th Congress)]] – a bill that would reauthorize research programs on [[preterm birth]]s that are run by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].<ref name=marchofdimes1>{{cite web|title=PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252/H.R. 541) |url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/advocacy/preemie-reauthorization-act.aspx |publisher=March of Dimes |access-date=November 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903131017/http://www.marchofdimes.org/advocacy/preemie-reauthorization-act.aspx |archive-date=September 3, 2014 }}</ref>   It would also authorize grants and demonstration programs to be run by the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] that will try to decrease preterm births.

* Exchange Information Disclosure Act – a bill that would require the government to report on the number of visitors and enrollees on the federal government's healthcare exchanges, as well as what level of insurance coverage people buy on the exchanges. The bill would apply only to the federally run healthcare exchanges, which cover 36 states, not the state-run exchanges, according to ''Ripon Advance''. On January 16, 2014, the U.S. House passed the bill.<ref>{{cite web|date=2014-01-20|url=http://riponadvance.com/news/alexander-bill-pushes-aca-enrollment-data/6275|title=Alexander bill pushes for more ACA enrollment data|work=The Ripon Advance|access-date=January 21, 2014|archive-date=January 21, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140121163558/http://riponadvance.com/news/alexander-bill-pushes-aca-enrollment-data/6275|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its companion bill [[Exchange Information Disclosure Act (H.R. 3362; 113th Congress)]] was introduced in the House by [[Lee Terry|Rep.

====Republican leadership====
In late 2006, Alexander announced that he had secured the requisite number of votes to become the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s [[Minority Whip]] in the Senate during the [[110th Congress]]. Even though he was seen as the preferred choice of Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] and the Bush Administration, he lost the election to former [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]] by one vote (25–24).<ref>{{cite news|last=Babington|first=Charles|title=Lott Rejoins Senate Leadership|date=November 16, 2006|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111500533.html|work=The Washington Post|access-date=December 21, 2007|archive-date=February 6, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206153204/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111500533.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Alexander would get a second shot at entering his party's leadership a year later when Lott announced his intent to resign from the Senate by the end of 2007. Sen. [[Jon Kyl]] of Arizona, then [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States Senate|Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference]], ran for Whip and was elected without opposition. With the Conference Chair vacant, Alexander announced that he would seek the position.<ref>{{cite news|title=Alexander Announces Interest in Conference Chair|url=https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2007/11/alexander-announces-interest-in-conference-chair|website=alexander.senate.gov|publisher=Office of Senator Lamar Alexander|date=November 26, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2008|archive-date=December 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227151321/https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2007/11/alexander-announces-interest-in-conference-chair|url-status=live}}</ref> He would go on to defeat Sen.

Alexander stepped down as Conference Chairman in January 2012, citing his desire to foster consensus. He said, "I want to do more to make the Senate a more effective institution so that it can deal better with serious issues." He added, "For these same reasons, I do not plan to seek a leadership position in the next Congress", ending speculation that he would run for the position of Republican Whip after Jon Kyl retired in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Raju|first=Manu|author-link=Manu Raju|title=Lamar Alexander quitting leadership post in Senate|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63919.html|date=September 20, 2011|access-date=March 5, 2012|work=Politico|archive-date=March 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321205744/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63919.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====2008 re-election campaign====
{{main|2008 United States Senate election in Tennessee}}

In April 2007, Alexander announced he would run for re-election to the Senate in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Alexander Running Again, Sets Fundraiser|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_104845.asp|work=[[The Chattanoogan]]|date=April 3, 2007|access-date=April 6, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008041908/http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_104845.asp|archive-date=October 8, 2007}}</ref>

Alexander was favored throughout the entire campaign, due to his long history in Tennessee politics and a disorganized Democratic opposition. His rivals were former state Democratic Party Chairman [[Bob Tuke]], who won a heated primary, and Libertarian candidate Daniel T. Lewis.

Alexander won reelection, taking 65 percent of the vote to Tuke's 32 percent. Alexander also carried all but one of Tennessee's 95 counties; he lost only in [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]] in western Tennessee, which was secured by Tuke. He won the normally Democratic strongholds of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson]] and [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby]] counties—home to Nashville and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], respectively. Alexander also benefited from riding the [[Coattail effect|coattails]] of [[John McCain]], who won the state with a solid majority.

====2013 presidential inauguration role====
As co-chairman of the Joint Congressional Inaugural Committee, Alexander was one of the speakers at the [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama]] on January 21, 2013, alongside the committee's chair, [[Chuck Schumer|Senator Charles Schumer]].

====2014 senatorial re-election campaign====

In an August 2013 letter to Alexander signed by over 20 Tennessee [[Tea Party movement|tea-party]] groups, the groups called on Alexander to retire from the Senate in 2014, or face a primary challenge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20130816/NEWS02/308160101/Topple-Sen-Lamar-Alexander-TN-tea-party-going-it | title =Topple Sen.

Although Alexander was initially thought to be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right, he worked to avoid this and ultimately did not face a high-profile challenger. He declared his intention to run early, quickly won the endorsement of [[Governor of Tennessee|Governor]] [[Bill Haslam]], every living former [[Tennessee Republican Party]] chair persons and the state's [[United States congressional delegations from Tennessee|entire Republican congressional delegation]] (except scandal-hit [[Scott DesJarlais]]). He also raised a large amount of money and worked to avoid the mistakes of ousted Senators [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] and [[Richard Lugar]] by trying to stay in touch with his constituents, especially in [[East Tennessee]]. Moreover, out-of-state conservative organizations such as the [[Senate Conservatives Fund]] made little effort to defeat Alexander.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollcall.com/2014/08/01/how-lamar-alexander-staved-off-his-primary-challenger-2/|title=How Lamar Alexander Staved Off His Primary Challenger|last=Levinson|first=Alexis|work=[[Roll Call]]|date=August 1, 2014|access-date=September 30, 2020|archive-date=August 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807133936/https://www.rollcall.com/2014/08/01/how-lamar-alexander-staved-off-his-primary-challenger-2/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Alexander won the Republican primary, defeating [[Tennessee House of Representatives|State Representative]] and Tea Party challenger [[Joe S. Carr|Joe Carr]].  However, Alexander recorded the lowest winning percentage (49.7%) and lowest margin of victory (9.2 points) ever in a primary for a Republican U.S. Senator from Tennessee. Carr won a larger percentage of the vote (40.5%) than the previous 11 challengers to sitting Republican U.S. Senators in Tennessee history combined (40.3%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2014/08/alexander_records_weakest_ever.php |title=Alexander Records Weakest Primary Win for GOP US Senator in Tennessee History |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=August 7, 2014 |access-date=March 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809202947/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2014/08/alexander_records_weakest_ever.php |archive-date=August 9, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Alexander won the general election with 62% of the vote.

====Impeachment of Donald Trump====
[[File:Donald Trump and Lamar Alexander.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] in 2019]]
In the [[impeachment trial of Donald Trump]], Alexander was seen as a key swing voter in the bid to allow witness testimony in the trial.  Near midnight on January 30, he said that he would vote against witnesses in the trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-alexander-idUSKBN1ZU0DF|title=Key senator Alexander says he will not vote for impeachment witnesses|last1=Brice|first1=Makini|date=January 31, 2020|work=Reuters|access-date=January 31, 2020|url-status=live|last2=Sullivan|first2=Andy|language=en|archive-date=January 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131041810/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-alexander-idUSKBN1ZU0DF}}</ref>

On January 31, Alexander voted against considering any motion to subpoena witnesses or documents.  Alexander additionally voted for tabling four amendments: an amendment to subpoena [[John Bolton]], [[Mick Mulvaney]], OMB employee Michael Duffey, and White House aide Robert Blair over the [[Trump–Ukraine scandal|Ukraine scandal]], an amendment to subpoena Bolton regarding the Ukraine scandal, an amendment to have Bolton give oral deposition and to testify before the Senate, and an amendment to have the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts, to decide motions from any Senator or party to subpoena relevant witnesses and documents that have relevance to the Impeachment articles. Alexander voted for a Senate resolution to the trial that passed, which concluded the witness testimony portion of the trial and moved to closing statements.<ref>{{cite report |date=January 31, 2020 |title=Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 116th Congress, Second Session |volume=166 |pages=S766–S767 |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2020-01-31/pdf/CREC-2020-01-31.pdf |access-date=February 3, 2020 |archive-date=February 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202012749/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2020-01-31/pdf/CREC-2020-01-31.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite report |date=January 31, 2020 |title=TEXT OF AMENDMENTS; Congressional Record |volume=166 |pages=S769–S772 |url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2020/1/31/senate-section/article/S769-4 |access-date=February 3, 2020 |archive-date=February 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203100454/https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2020/1/31/senate-section/article/S769-4 |url-status=live }}</ref>
