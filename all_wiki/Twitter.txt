===Creation and initial reaction===
[[File:Twttr sketch-Dorsey-2006.jpg|thumb|A sketch, c. 2006, by [[Jack Dorsey]], envisioning an [[SMS]]-based [[social network]].]]
Twitter's origins lie in a "daylong brainstorming session" held by board members of the [[podcast]]ing company [[Odeo]]. [[Jack Dorsey]], then an undergraduate student at [[New York University]], introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.<ref>{{registration required|date=February 2011}} {{cite news|author=Miller, Claire Cain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/technology/31ev.html|title=Why Twitter's C.E.O.

<blockquote>
With Twitter, it wasn't clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.<ref name="Inc">{{cite web|title=Ev Williams on Twitter's Early Years|url=http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/ev-williams-twitter-early-years.html?cid=em01011week40day04b|work=Inc.|access-date=5 October 2013|first=Issie|last=Lapowsky|date=4 October 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out "New Twitter", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including [[YouTube]] and [[Flickr]], and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as '@mentions' and 'Retweets' above the Twitter stream, while 'Messages' and 'Log Out' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com. As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the "New Twitter experience" had been rolled out to all users.

[[File:Twitter 2010 logo - from Commons.svg|thumb|The Twitter logo from September 14, 2010 – June 5, 2012, featuring the silhouette version of "Larry the Bird"]]
Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo, or the Twitter Bird. The original logo, which was simply the word "Twitter", was in use from its launch in March 2006. It was accompanied by an image of a bird which was later discovered to be a piece of [[clip art]] created by the British graphic designer [[Simon Oxley]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/who-made-that-twitter-bird.html |title=Who Made That Twitter Bird?|work= The New York Times |first=Melanie|last=Rehak |date=August 8, 2014 |access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref> A new logo had to be redesigned by founder Biz Stone with help from designer Philip Pascuzzo, which resulted in a more cartoon-like bird in 2009.

[[San Antonio]]-based market-research firm Pear Analytics analyzed 2,000 tweets (originating from the United States and in English) over a two-week period in August 2009 from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm (CST) and separated them into six categories.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution=Twitter Study – August 2009 |title=Twitter Study Reveals Interesting Results About Usage |editor-first=Ryan |editor-last=Kelly |publisher=Pear Analytics |place=San Antonio, Texas |date=August 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715062407/http://www.pearanalytics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Twitter-Study-August-2009.pdf |url=http://www.pearanalytics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Twitter-Study-August-2009.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Small talk|Pointless babble]] made up 40%, with 38% being conversational. Pass-along value had 9%, self-promotion 6% with [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and news each making 4%.

Despite Jack Dorsey's own open contention that a message on Twitter is "a short burst of inconsequential information", social networking researcher [[danah boyd]] responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labeled "pointless babble" is better characterized as "[[social grooming]]" and/or "peripheral awareness" (which she justifies as persons "want[ing] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn't viable").<ref>{{cite web|first=danah |last=boyd |author-link=danah boyd |title=Twitter: "pointless babble" or peripheral awareness + social grooming? |date=August 16, 2009 |url=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/08/16/twitter_pointle.html| access-date=September 19, 2009}}</ref> Similarly, a survey of Twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Avery Holton, Kang Baek, Mark Coddington, Yaschur, Carolyn|title=Seeking and Sharing: Motivations for Linking on Twitter|journal=Communication Research Reports|year=2014|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1080/08824096.2013.843165|s2cid=143390964|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/891aa19e9b46d51fd1a1626cc659a9565041805d}}</ref>

===== Hashtags, usernames, retweets and replies =====
{{Redirect|Twitter hashtag|more about hashtags|Hashtag}}
{{Further|Mention (blogging)#@ (At sign)}}
Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of [[hashtag]]s – words or phrases prefixed with a "<code>#</code>" sign. Similarly, the "<code>@</code>" sign followed by a [[username]] is used for mentioning or replying to other users.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/4698589/Twitter-how-to-set-up-your-account.html |title=Twitter: How To Set Up Your Account |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Donald |last=Strachan |date=February 19, 2009 |access-date=February 13, 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

To repost a message from another Twitter user and share it with one's own followers, a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet. Users can reply other accounts' replies. Since November 2019, users can hide replies to their messages. Since May 2020, users can select who can reply each of their messages: anyone, accounts who follow the poster, specific accounts, and none.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265090/twitter-testing-limited-replies-tweets-conversations Twitter is testing a way to let you limit replies to your tweets] - Jay Peters, The Verge, May 20, 2020</ref>

The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and [[Internet slang|slang commonly used in SMS]] messages. The 140-character limit also increased the usage of [[URL shortening]] services such as [[Bitly|bit.ly]], [[Google URL Shortener|goo.gl]], [[tinyURL|tinyurl.com]], [[tr.im]], and other content-hosting services such as [[TwitPic]], memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate [[multimedia]] content and text longer than 140 characters. Since June 2011, Twitter has used its own [[t.co]] domain for automatic [[URL shortening|shortening]] of all URLs posted on its site, making other link shorteners unnecessary for staying within Twitter's 140 character limit.<ref name="twitterhelpshort">{{cite web|url=http://support.twitter.com/entries/109623|title=About Twitter's Link Service <http://t.co>|publisher=Twitter Help Center (module of Twitter)|access-date=February 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225203154/http://support.twitter.com/entries/109623|archive-date=February 25, 2011}}</ref><ref name="t.co rollout" />

In August 2019, Jack Dorsey's account was hacked by using Twitter's SMS to tweet feature to send crude messages. Days later, the ability to send a tweet via SMS was temporarily turned off.<ref>{{cite news|title=Twitter disables tweeting via SMS after CEO gets hacked|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849865/twitter-disables-sms-text-message-tweeting-jack-dorsey-ceo-hack|publisher=The Verge|date=September 4, 2019}}</ref>

In April 2020, Twitter discontinued the ability to receive SMS messages containing the text of new tweets in most countries.<ref>https://mashable.com/article/twitter-sms-changes-account-removals/?europe=true</ref><ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238131/twitter-sms-notifications-disabled-jack-dorsey-hack</ref>

===== Character limits =====
In 2016, Twitter announced that media such as photos, videos, and the person's handle, would not count against the already constrictive 140 character limit. A user photo post used to count for a large chunk of a Tweet, about 24 characters.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e80322b79d0d4765a2bcea2b473c9a34/coming-soon-twitter-more-room-tweetl|title = Coming soon to Twitter: More room to tweet |agency = Associated Press|date = May 24, 2016|access-date = May 24, 2016}}</ref> Attachments and links would also no longer be part of the character limit.<ref name="New Twitter Name">{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/twitter-eases-140-character-limit-tweets-145347778.html|title=Twitter eases 140 character limit|last=Lever|first=Rob|date=May 24, 2016|website=[[Yahoo Tech]]|access-date=May 25, 2016}}</ref>

Since March 30, 2017, the Twitter handles are outside the tweet itself, therefore they no longer count towards the character limit.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/30/15115290/twitter-replies-redesign-character-limit TheVerge articlefrom 2017-03-30: Mentioning overhaul of Twitter's reply system: No longer counts towards former 140-character limitation.]</ref> Only new Twitter handles added to the conversation count towards the limit.

In 2017, Twitter doubled their historical 140-character-limitation to 280.<ref name="new280limit">{{cite web|url=https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html|title=Giving you more characters to express yourself|access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref> Under the new limit, [[glyph]]s are counted as a variable number of characters, depending upon the script they are from: most European letters and punctuation forms count as one character, while each [[CJK]] glyph counts as two so that only 140 such glyphs can be used in a tweet.<ref name="new280limit" />

===== Image captions =====
On Tuesday, 2016-03-29, Twitter introduced a feature to improve [[accessibility]] for visually impaired people:<ref name="420char">[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/a/2016/accessible-images-for-everyone.html Twitter Blog article: "Accessible images for everyone!"]</ref> A caption with the length of up to 420 characters<ref name="hc_420"><!--"hc" means "help center".-->[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions Twitter Help center: Picture Descriptions - How to make images accessible for people]</ref> can be added to each image optionally.

This caption can be accessed by screen reading software or by hovering the mouse above a picture inside [[TweetDeck]].

====Trending topics====
{{Main|Twitter trends}}
[[File:Twitter TT.PNG|thumb|Countries and cities with local ''trending topics'' in Twitter]]
A word, phrase, or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a "trending topic". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bloggers back media against youth league |access-date=April 3, 2010 |url=http://www.journalism.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3103&Itemid=37 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718104406/http://www.journalism.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3103&Itemid=37 |archive-date=July 18, 2011 }}</ref> These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people's opinions are about it.<ref>{{cite web|title = Top Twitter Trends of 2009| access-date = April 3, 2010| url = http://blog.twitter.com/2009/12/top-twitter-trends-of-2009.html}}</ref>

Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like [[Lady Gaga]] (known as Little Monsters), [[Justin Bieber]] (Beliebers), [[Rihanna]] (Rih Navy) and [[One Direction]] (Directioners), and novel series ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' (Twihards) and ''[[Harry Potter]]'' (Potterheads). Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type with limited success.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vicky |last=Woollaston |url=http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/top-stories/492646/justin-bieber-fans-beat-twitter-block |title=Justin Bieber fans beat Twitter 'block' &#124; Web User magazine |publisher=Webuser.co.uk |access-date=January 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122152133/http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/top-stories/492646/justin-bieber-fans-beat-twitter-block |archive-date=November 22, 2012 }}</ref>

The Twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page, along with sponsored content (see image).

Twitter often censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive. Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican<ref>{{cite news|title = #Thatsafrican – When Twitter Went Racist?| access-date = April 3, 2010| url = https://huffingtonpost.com/david-weiner/thatsafrican----when-twit_b_218673.html | work=Huffington Post| first=David| last=Weiner| date=June 21, 2009}}</ref> and #thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive.<ref>{{cite web|title = Thingsdarkiessay causes a Twitter storm | access-date = January 11, 2012| url = http://www.iol.co.za/scitech/technology/news/thingsdarkiessay-causes-a-twitter-storm-1.909053 |publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]] |location=South Africa |date=November 5, 2009 }}</ref> There are allegations that Twitter removed #[[Narendra Modi|NaMOinHyd]] from the trending list and added an [[Indian National Congress]]-sponsored hashtag.<ref>{{cite news|title = Role of Twitter in trending wars|access-date = August 14, 2013|url = http://www.niticentral.com/2013/08/13/role-of-twitter-in-trending-wars-118256.html|work = NITI Central|first = Kanchan|last = Gupta|date = August 13, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130816010049/http://www.niticentral.com/2013/08/13/role-of-twitter-in-trending-wars-118256.html|archive-date = August 16, 2013|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

==== Moments ====
In October 2015, Twitter introduced "Moments"—a feature that allows users to curate tweets from other users into a larger collection. Twitter initially intended the feature to be used by its in-house editorial team and other partners; they populated a dedicated tab in Twitter's apps, chronicling news headlines, sporting events, and other content.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/meet-moments-twitters-new-feature/|title=Meet Moments, Twitter's Most Important New Feature Ever|last=Pierce|first=David|date=October 6, 2015|work=Wired|access-date=July 17, 2019|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/6/9457267/twitter-moments-project-lightning|title=Twitter launches Moments, its dead-simple tab for browsing the best tweets|last=Newton|first=Casey|date=October 6, 2015|website=The Verge|language=en-US|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> In September 2016, creation of moments became available to all Twitter users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/28/13097924/twitter-moments-creation-opens-to-all|title=Twitter opens its Moments feature up to everyone|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=September 28, 2016|website=The Verge|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

===Adding and following content===
There are numerous tools for adding content, monitoring content and conversations including Twitter's own [[TweetDeck]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[HootSuite]], and Twitterfeed.com. {{As of|2009}}, fewer than half of tweets posted were posted using the web user interface with most users using third-party applications (based on an analysis of 500&nbsp;million tweets by Sysomos).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/clients | title=Inside Twitter Clients – An Analysis of 500 Million Tweets | publisher=[[Sysomos]] | date=November 2009 | access-date=August 23, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901070608/http://sysomos.com/insidetwitter/clients | archive-date=September 1, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Verified accounts===
[[File:Twitter verified account.png|thumb|right|The official Twitter profile of Twitter, Inc. The blue check mark right of the profile name indicates that it is a verified account.]]
In June 2009, after being criticized by [[Kanye West]] and sued by [[Tony La Russa]] over unauthorized accounts run by impersonators, Twitter launched their 'Verified Accounts' program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2009/not-playing-ball.html |title=Not Playing Ball |first=Biz|last=Stone|date=June 6, 2009 |website=Twitter}}</ref><ref name="verifiedhistory">{{cite news|last=Kanalley|first=Craig|title=Why Twitter Verifies Users: The History Behind the Blue Checkmark|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/craig-kanalley/twitter-verified-accounts_b_2863282.html|access-date=June 9, 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=March 12, 2013}}</ref> Twitter stated that an account with a "blue tick" verification badge indicates "we've been in contact with the person or entity the account is representing and verified that it is approved."<ref name="verifiedlaunch">{{cite web|last=Cashmore|first=Pete|title=Twitter Launches Verified Accounts|url=http://mashable.com/2009/06/11/twitter-verified-accounts-2/|date=June 11, 2009|access-date=June 9, 2014}}</ref> After the beta period, Twitter stated in their FAQ that the company "proactively verifies accounts on an ongoing basis to make it easier for users to find who they’re looking for" and that they "do not accept requests for verification from the general public."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/111-features/articles/119135-about-verified-accounts |title=FAQs about verified accounts |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719090643/https://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/111-features/articles/119135-about-verified-accounts |archive-date=July 19, 2016 }}</ref>

In a March 8, 2018 live-stream on Twitter's Periscope, Dorsey discussed the idea of allowing any user to get a verified account.

===Third-party applications===
For many years, Twitter has limited the use of third-party applications accessing the service by implementing a 100,000 user limit per application.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wauters |first=Robin |url=https://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/08/17/twitter-4 |title=Twitter API Changes Set Maximum User Cap for 3rd Parties |publisher=Thenextweb.com |date=August 17, 2012 |access-date=May 9, 2013}}</ref> Since August 2010, third-party Twitter applications have been required to use [[OAuth]], an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application.

===Related headlines feature===
This feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet's permalink page. If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories, the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet. This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn't understand what the tweet means, they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mlot|first=Stephanie|title=Twitter Adds 'Related Headlines' to Embedded Tweets|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2423301,00.asp|access-date=June 9, 2014|work=PC Magazine}}</ref>

===Polls===
In 2015, Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets. Polls are open for up to 7 days, and voters are not personally identified.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Your Twitter Feed Is About to Be Flooded With Polls|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/twitter-polls/|journal=Wired|access-date=October 23, 2015|date=October 21, 2015}}</ref>

=== Account archival ===
Twitter has offered {{cl-span|two different methods|date=October 2019}} of archiving one's own Twitter account data. Those methods have their individual benefits and disadvantages. Since August 2019<!--(or: "as of September 2019"?)-->, only the latter archival method is available.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==== Browsable legacy Twitter archive format ====
In December 2012, Twitter introduced a "Tweet archival" feature, which created a [[ZIP file]] that contains an offline-browsable archive of all tweets.<ref name="archive2012">[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/a/2012/your-twitter-archive.html Blog.Twitter.com article ''"Your Twitter archive"'']</ref>

Those exported tweets could be browsed and searched offline by using the bundled user-interface accessible through an [[Internet browser]], which used [[Pagination#In web browsers|client-side, JavaScript-powered pagination]].<ref name="archivebrowser">[https://searchengineland.com/finally-you-can-search-all-your-tweets-via-twitter-142985 2012 SearchEngineLand article on browsing tweets offline.]</ref>

The user interface of the tweet archive browser had a design similar to Twitter's 2010–2014 desktop user interface, even until the feature's removal.

The tweet text contents, ID's, time data and source labels are located in the file called "<code>tweets.csv</code>".

The ability to export this type of tweet archive, which never existed on [[#Twitter Lite|the new layout]], has been removed entirely in August 2019<sup>[when exactly?]</sup>, after co-existing with the new 2018 data archival method.
Even when accessing the legacy Twitter desktop website layout using the user-agent of an older browser version, the option has disappeared from the account settings.

It was possible to request at least 1 archive per day{{please verify|date=September 2019}}<!--how much exactly?-->.

==== New machine-readable archive format ====
Due to the [[european law|legal]] [[GDPR]] §20 obligation (effective since May 2018) to provide [[data portability]], social media services had to introduce advanced data export <!-- download, backup --> capabilities and utilities.

The original browsable tweet archives did lack a lot of metadata, especially about the account itself, which the new machine-readable archival feature does contain:
* Account ID and creation date
* Direct messages
* List of:
** Following users + count
** Followed users + count
** Blocked user IDs
** Muted user IDs
** Liked tweets
* Twitter ''Moments''
* Information about ''[[Periscope (app)|Periscope]]'' account
* Saved searches
* Screen name changes
* Associated mobile phone number
* Various account settings
* Users in created ''Twitter Lists''
* Member of which ''Twitter Lists''
* Advanced tweet [[metadata]] (e.g. ''tweet source tag'')
* More…
<!-- Are image descriptions also included? -->
<!-- Pending follow requests to private accounts? -->

The tweet contents are located in the file called "<code>tweet.js</code>".

However, this new archival format contains all uploaded multimedia in the highest resolution, which makes its [[file size]] usually multiple times as large.

Additionally, the integrated tweet browser from the legacy archival feature is not bundled.

Another disadvantage is that one can '''only generate one of these archives per 30 days.'''
After obtaining this archive, one has to wait 30 days until requesting the next archive is possible. During that timespan, the previous archive remains downloadable from the account settings.

This feature co-existed with the original browsable tweet archival feature since early 2018, until the latter was removed in August 2019.

In 2009, Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter, said [[Jeremiah Owyang]], an industry analyst studying social media.

In October 2017, Twitter banned the Russian media outlets [[RT (TV network)|RT]] and [[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] from advertising on their website following the conclusions of the U.S. national intelligence report the previous January that both Sputnik and RT had been used as vehicles for [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dwoskin|first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/10/26/twitter-bans-russian-government-news-sites-rt-and-sputnik-from-buying-ads/|title=Twitter bans Russian government-owned news sites RT and Sputnik from buying ads|work=The Washington Post|date=October 26, 2017|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> [[Maria Zakharova]] for the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian foreign ministry]] said the ban was a "gross violation" by the US of free speech.<ref>{{cite news|title = Twitter Bans Ads From Russia Today and the Sputnik Network, Citing Election Meddling|url = https://www.time.com/4999788/twitter-bans-russia-today-sputnik-ads/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = October 27, 2017|access-date = July 26, 2018}}</ref>

In October 2019, Twitter announced it would stop running political ads on its ad platform effective November 22. This resulted from several spurious claims made by political ads. Company CEO Dorsey clarified that internet advertising had great power and was extremely effective for commercial advertisers, the power brings significant risks to politics where crucial decisions impact millions of lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/tech/twitter-bans-political-ads-on-its-platform-pressure-up-on-defiant-facebook-2368007.html|title=Twitter Bans Political Ads on Its Platform, Pressure Up on Defiant Facebook|website=News18|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>

In the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in [[MySQL]] databases that were temporally [[Shard (database architecture)|sharded]] (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.<ref name="raffi">{{cite web|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2013/new-tweets-per-second-record-and-how|title=New Tweets per second record, and how!|first=Raffi|last=Krikorian|date=August 13, 2013|access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref>

From Spring 2007 to 2008, the messages were handled by a Ruby [[persistent data structure|persistent]] queue server called [[Starling (software)|Starling]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 11, 2009 |url=http://dev.twitter.com/2008/01/announcing-starling.html |title=Announcing Starling |publisher=Twitter |date=January 16, 2008 |last=Payne |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120141113/http://dev.twitter.com/2008/01/announcing-starling.html|archive-date=January 20, 2008}}</ref>  Since 2009, implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html |title=Twitter on Scala |date=April 3, 2009 |first=Bill |last=Venners |publisher=Artima Developer |access-date=June 17, 2009}}</ref> The switch from Ruby to Scala and the [[Java Virtual Machine|JVM]] has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through [[remote procedure call]]s.<ref name="raffi" />

As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] server they call Blender.<ref name="Twitter coding">{{cite news|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2011/twitter-search-is-now-3x-faster |title=Twitter Search Is Now 3x Faster|date=April 6, 2011}}</ref>

Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called [[snowflake (software)|snowflake]], and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'. The URL shortener ''[[t.co]]'' then checks for a [[Messaging spam|spam]] link and shortens the URL. Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using [[Gizzard (Scala framework)|Gizzard]], and the user receives an acknowledgement that the tweets were sent. Tweets are then sent to search engines via the [[Firehose (software)|Firehose]] API. The process is managed by [[FlockDB]] and takes an average of {{nowrap|350 ms}}.<ref name="zdnet vaughannichols 2012" />

On August 16, 2013, [[Raffi Krikorian]], Twitter's vice president of platform engineering, shared in a blog post that the company's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record. Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies.<ref name="raffi" /><ref>{{cite web|title=How Twitter scaled its infrastructure to handle record tweet-per-second days|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/08/16/how-twitter-scaled-it-infrastructure-to-handle-record-tweet-per-second-days/|work=GIGAOM|publisher=GIGAOM|access-date=August 17, 2013|first=Om|last=Malik|date=August 17, 2013}}</ref>

===Interface===
Twitter introduced the first major redesign of its user interface in September 2010, adopting a dual-pane layout with a navigation bar along the top of the screen, and an increased focus on the inline embedding of multimedia content. Critics considered the redesign an attempt to emulate features and experiences found in mobile apps and third-party Twitter clients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/history-of-twitter-redesigns/|title=A Brief History Of Twitter's Many Redesigns|website=Adweek.com|language=en-US|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/take-a-tour-of-the-new-twitter/|title=Take a Tour of the New Twitter|last=Calore|first=Michael|date=September 16, 2010|work=Wired|access-date=July 17, 2019|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2010/09/14/new-twitter-web-interface/|title=Here Comes the New Twitter.com|last=Ostrow|first=Adam|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2010/09/14/new-twitter-app/|title=The New Twitter Is an Attack on All Desktop Apps|last=Grove|first=Jennifer Van|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

The new layout was revised in 2011 with a focus on continuity with the web and mobile versions, introducing "Connect" (interactions with other users such as replies) and "Discover" (further information regarding trending topics and news headlines) tabs, an updated profile design, and moving all content to the right pane (leaving the left pane dedicated to functions and the trending topics list).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/8/2621244/twitter-redesign-pictures-video|title=Twitter app and website redesign: hands-on pictures and video|last=Houston|first=Thomas|date=December 8, 2011|website=The Verge|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> In March 2012, Twitter became available in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Farsi]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Urdu]], the first right-to-left language versions of the site.

In September 2012, a new layout for profiles was introduced, with larger "covers" that could be customized with a custom header image, and a display of the user's recent photos posted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/18/twitter-redesign-photos|title=Twitter redesign makes more of photos|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|date=September 18, 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=July 17, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The "Discover" tab was discontinued in April 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/8/8371319/twitter-is-killing-off-its-discover-tab|title=Twitter is killing off its Discover tab|last=Popper|first=Ben|date=April 8, 2015|website=The Verge|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> and was succeeded on the mobile app by an "Explore" tab—which features trending topics and moments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/26/14391240/twitter-explore-tab-moments-redesign|title=Twitter replaces the Moments tab with Explore|last=Newton|first=Casey|date=January 26, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

In September 2018, Twitter began to migrate selected web users to its [[Progressive web applications|progressive web app]] (based on its Twitter Lite experience for mobile web), reducing the interface to two columns. Migrations to this iteration of Twitter increased in April 2019, with some users receiving it with a modified layout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-launches-redesigned-desktop-layout/|title=Twitter tests new desktop layouts|last=Musil|first=Steven|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/progressive-web-apps-moving-mainstream-as-twitter-makes-its-mobile-site-the-main-one/|title=Progressive Web Apps moving mainstream as Twitter makes its mobile site the main one|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=September 6, 2018|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

In July 2019, Twitter officially released this redesign, with no further option to opt-out while logged in. It is designed to further-unify Twitter's user experience between the web and application versions, adopting a three-column layout with a sidebar containing links to common areas (including Explore), and features from the mobile version (such as multi-account support, and an opt-out for the "top tweets" mode on the timeline).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/twitter-is-changing-twitter-com-to-be-more-like-mobile-app/|title=Twitter is changing Twitter.com to be more like mobile app|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|date=July 15, 2019|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/15/20695120/twitter-desktop-redesign-dark-mode-mobile-features|title=Twitter desktop redesign adopts some of its mobile app's best features|last=Lee|first=Dami|date=July 15, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

===Privacy, security and harassment===
Twitter messages are public, but users can also send private "direct messages".<ref name=Rushe /> Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to "protected" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/hide-followers-following-twitter-13288.html |title=How to Hide Your Followers & Who You Are Following on Twitter &#124; The Classroom &#124; Synonym |publisher=Classroom.synonym.com |date=November 9, 2015 |access-date=December 7, 2015}}</ref> Twitter collects [[personally identifiable information]] about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its [[privacy policy]].

A security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith.

In May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization [[Ballotpedia]] to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Twitter to add labels to U.S. political candidates|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-to-add-labels-to-u-s-political-candidates/|access-date=May 23, 2018|publisher=CBS|date=May 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Scola|first1=Nancy|title=Twitter to verify election candidates in the midterms|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/23/twitter-verify-candidates-midterms-2018-1282802|access-date=May 23, 2018|work=Politico|date=May 23, 2018}}</ref>

In December 2019, Twitter removed 5,929 accounts for violating their [[Internet manipulation|manipulation]] policies. The company investigated and attributed these accounts to a single state-run information operation, which originated in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The accounts were reported to be a part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in [[Spamming|spammy behavior]]. However, Twitter did not disclose all of them as some could possibly be legitimate accounts taken over through [[Security hacker|hacking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/18116303.twitter-facebook-remove-accounts-interference-crackdown/|title=Twitter and Facebook remove accounts in interference crackdown|access-date=December 20, 2019|website=York Press}}</ref>

===Twitter bots===
{{main|Twitter bot}}
A Twitter bot is a computer program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to tweet, retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20&nbsp;million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013. These fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase.<ref>{{cite web|last=D'onfro |first=Jillian |title=Twitter Admits 5% Of Its 'Users' Are Fake |url=http://www.businessinsider.in/Twitter-Admits-5-Of-Its-Users-Are-Fake/articleshow/23479699.cms |website=Business Insider |access-date=May 15, 2014}}</ref> Twitter's wide-open [[application programming interface]] and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots' existence within the social networking site.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dubbin |first=Rob |title=The Rise Of Twitter Bots |url= https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/11/the-rise-of-twitter-bots.html |magazine=The New Yorker |access-date=May 15, 2014}}</ref>

====Effects====
Twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture, products, and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication.<ref name="Bilton l">{{cite news|last=Bilton|first=Nick|title=Friends, and Influence, for Sale Online|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/friends-and-influence-for-sale-online/_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1&module=ArrowsNav&contentCollection=Technology&action=keypress&region=FixedLeft&pgtype=Blogs |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=May 15, 2014}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' states, "They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs."<ref>{{cite news|last=Urbina|first=Ian|title=I Flirt and Tweet.

The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, "people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating them as if they were real people or real places." The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Chad|title=Is that a bot running the social media feed? Testing the differences in perceptions of communication quality for a human agent and a bot agent on Twitter|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=33|pages=372–376|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.08.013|year=2014}}</ref> While technological advances have enabled the ability of successful [[Human-Computer Interaction]], the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Miners|first=Zach|title=Bot or Not?

In addition to content-generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets, and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a user's image through the accumulation of followers. With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Depillis|first=Lydia|title=Swenzy'|url=http://www.swenzy.net/|access-date=May 15, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523064020/http://www.swenzy.net/|archive-date=May 23, 2014}}</ref> Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability.<ref name="Depillis l">{{cite news|last=Depillis|first=Lydia|title=Click farms are the new sweatshops|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/06/click-farms-are-the-new-sweatshops/ |newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=May 15, 2014|date=January 6, 2014}}</ref> With Twitterbots, users are able to create the illusion of "buzz" on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms.<ref name="Bilton l" /><ref name="Depillis l" /> The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real.

==Developers==
Twitter is recognized for having one of the most open and powerful developer APIs of any major technology company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://webdam.com/blog/top-10-web-apis_bridging-todays-technology/|title=Top 10 Web APIs – Bridging Today's Technology|date=January 11, 2012|newspaper=WebDAM|language=en-US|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> Developer interest in Twitter began immediately following its launch, prompting the company to release the first version of its public API in September 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2006/introducing-the-twitter-api|title=Introducing the Twitter API {{!}} Twitter Blogs|website=blog.twitter.com|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> The API quickly became iconic as a reference implementation for public [[REST API]]s and is widely cited in programming tutorials.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning|title=Ruby on Rails Tutorial (Rails 5)|website=Softcover.io|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

From 2006 until 2010, Twitter's developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener. Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nordicapis.com/twitter-10-year-struggle-with-developer-relations/|title=Twitter's 10 Year Struggle with Developer Relations {{!}} Nordic APIs {{!}}|date=March 23, 2016|newspaper=Nordic APIs|language=en-US|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/04/24/twitter-oauthcalypse/|title=Twitter Launches Countdown to OAuthcalypse|last=Parr|first=Ben|website=Mashable|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL shortener, in direct competition with some of its most well-known 3rd-party developers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280092587/Twitter-to-launch-URL-shortener-and-may-block-TinyURL-and-bitly|title=Twitter to launch URL shortener and may block TinyURL and bit.ly|newspaper=ComputerWeekly|language=en-GB|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> And in 2012, Twitter introduced strict usage limits for its API, "completely crippling" some developers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/11/3631108/tweetro-user-token-limit-api|title=Tweetro says it's 'completely crippled' by Twitter's strict 100,000 user token limit|last=Streams|first=Kimber|date=November 11, 2012|website=The Verge|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/twitter-api-client-apps/|title=Twitter Handcuffs Client Apps With New API Changes|last=Ha|first=Anthony|website=TechCrunch|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

In an effort to reset its relationship with developers, Twitter acquired [[Crashlytics]] on January 28, 2013 for over US$100&nbsp;million, its largest acquisition to date.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2013/02/05/twitters-boston-acquisitions-crashlytics-tops-100m-bluefin-labs-close-behind/|title=Twitter's Boston Acquisitions: Crashlytics Tops $100M, Bluefin Labs Close Behind {{!}} Xconomy|date=February 5, 2013|newspaper=Xconomy|language=en-US|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> Twitter committed to continue supporting and expanding the service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/twitter-acquires-crash-reporting-tool-crashalytics-development-of-the-product-will-continue-unabated/|title=Twitter Acquires Mobile Crash-Reporting Tool Crashlytics, Development Of The Product Will Continue "Unabated"|last=Olanoff|first=Drew|website=TechCrunch|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

In October 2014, Twitter announced Fabric, a suite of mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/twitter-fabric-sdk/|title=Twitter's Audacious Plan to Infiltrate All Your Apps|last=Honan|first=Mat|newspaper=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular [[Software development kit|SDK]], allowing developers to pick and choose which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By building Fabric on top of Crashlytics, Twitter was able to take advantage of Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1&nbsp;billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fabric.io/blog/milestone-achieved-one-billion-devices/|title=Milestone Achieved: Over 1 Billion Devices!|website=Fabric Blog|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

In early 2016, Twitter announced that Fabric was installed on more than 2&nbsp;billion active devices and used by more than 225,000 developers. Fabric is recognized as the #1 most popular crash reporting and also the #1 mobile analytics solution among the top 200 iOS apps, beating out [[Google Analytics]], [[Flurry (company)|Flurry]], and [[Mixpanel|MixPanel]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mightysignal.com/the-state-of-mobile-sdks-in-2016-6007a13d8546#.n2uxjcxom|title=The State of Mobile SDKs in 2016|last=Lew|first=Jason|date=December 15, 2016|newspaper=MightySignal Mobile Trends|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fabric.io/blog/fabric-lands-top-spots-for-app-analytics-stability-and-monetization|title=Fabric lands top spots for app analytics, stability, and monetization|website=Fabric Blog|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

===Innovators patent agreement===
On April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an "Innovators Patent Agreement" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents {{cl-span|for defensive purposes|date=July 2020}}.

====Suppression of ''New York Post'' Hunter Biden story====
{{main|Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory}}
On October 14, 2020 the ''[[New York Post]]'' published a [[New York Post#Hunter_Biden_laptop_story|story containing allegations about Hunter Biden]], son of [[Joe Biden]]. Twitter and Facebook both implemented measures on their platforms to prevent sharing of the ''New York Post'' article, with Twitter doing so according to their Hacked Materials Policy and Facebook per a policy that "in many countries, including in the U.S., if we have signals that a piece of content is false, we temporarily reduce its distribution pending review by a third-party fact-checker."<ref name="TheHill-Rodrigo">{{Cite web|last=Rodrigo|first=Chris Mills|date=October 14, 2020|title=Twitter, Facebook clamp down on New York Post article about Hunter Biden|url=https://thehill.com/policy/technology/521072-twitter-facebook-clamp-down-on-new-york-post-article-about-hunter-biden|access-date=October 17, 2020|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|language=en}}</ref><ref name="CNET-Mihalcik">{{Cite web|last=Mihalcik|first=Carrie|date=October 16, 2020|title=Facebook, Twitter limit reach of New York Post article about Hunter Biden|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-twitter-limit-reach-of-new-york-post-article-about-hunter-biden/|access-date=October 15, 2020|website=[[CNET]]|language=en}}</ref><ref name="WaPo-Dwoskin">{{Cite news|last=Dwoskin|first=Elizabeth|date=October 15, 2020|title=Facebook and Twitter take unusual steps to limit spread of New York Post story|language=en-US|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/15/facebook-twitter-hunter-biden/|access-date=October 15, 2020|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Commentators from varied political backgrounds criticized the actions taken by Facebook and Twitter, arguing that they could have amplified disinformation due to the [[Streisand effect]].<ref name="ArsTechnica-Cox">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/facebook-twitter-limit-controversial-story-about-joe-bidens-son/ |title=Twitter, Facebook face blowback after stopping circulation of NY Post story |website=[[Ars Technica]] |first=Kate |last=Cox |access-date=October 15, 2020 |date=October 14, 2020}}</ref>

===Impact===
====Instant, short, and frequent communication====
In May 2008, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that [[social networking service]]s such as Twitter "elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their [[Diffusion (business)|early adopters]]. Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends. But some users are starting to feel ''too'' connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher [[Mobile phone|cellphone]] bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they're having for dinner."<ref>{{cite news |access-date=February 22, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB117373145818634482-ZwdoPQ0PqPrcFMDHDZLz_P6osnI_20080315.html |title=Friends Swap Twitters, and Frustration&nbsp;– New Real-Time Messaging Services Overwhelm Some Users with Mundane Updates from Friends |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=March 16, 2007 |last=Lavallee |first=Andrew |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314141935/http://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB117373145818634482-ZwdoPQ0PqPrcFMDHDZLz_P6osnI_20080315.html |archive-date=March 14, 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The following year, [[John C.

====Emergency use====
A practical use for Twitter's real-time functionality is as an effective ''[[de facto]]'' emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Alexander |last1=Mills |first2=Rui |last2=Chen |first3=JinKyu |last3=Lee |first4=H.

Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter's ability to track epidemics and how they spread.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brooke |last=Jarvis |title=Twitter becomes a tool for tracking flu epidemics and other public health issues |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/twitter-becomes-a-tool-for-tracking-flu-epidemics-and-other-public-health-issues/2013/03/04/9d4315c2-6eef-11e2-aa58-243de81040ba_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 4, 2013 |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref>

Additionally Twitter serves as sensor for natural disasters such as bush fires and earthquakes. <ref>{{cite journal |first1=Robert |last1=Power |first2=Bella |last2=Robinson |first3=David |last3=Ratcliffe |title=Finding Fires with Twitter |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U/U13/U13-1011.pdf |journal=Proceedings of Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop |year=2013 |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Earle |first2=Daniel |last2=Bowden |first3=Michelle |last3=Guy |title=Twitter earthquake detection: earthquake monitoring in a social world |url=http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/5364 |journal=Annals of Geophysics |year=2011 |volume=54 |issue=6 |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref>

Twitter has been an increasingly growing in the field of education, as an effective tool that can be used to encourage learning and idea, or knowledge sharing, in and outside the classroom.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Carrie|first1=Ross|last2=Maninger|first2=Robert|last3=LaPrairie|first3=Kimberly|last4=Sullivan|first4=Sam|date=Spring 2015|title=The Use of Twitter in the Creation of Educational Professional Learning Opportunities|url=https://dc.swosu.edu/aij/vol5/iss1/6|journal=Administrative Issues Journal: Connecting Education, Practice, and Research.|volume= 5|pages=55–76|issn=2153-7615|doi=10.5929/2015.5.1.7|id={{ERIC|EJ1062476}}}}</ref> By using or creating hashtags, students and educators are able to communicate under specific categories of their choice, to enhance and promote education. A broad example of a hashtag used in education is "edchat", to communicate with other teachers, and people using that hashtag. Once teachers find someone they want to talk to, they can either direct message the person, or narrow down the hashtag to make the topic of the conversation more specific using hashtags for scichat (science), engchat (English), sschat (social studies).<ref name=":0" />

In a 2011 study, researchers found that young peoples use of Twitter helped to improve relationships with teachers, encourage interactive learning, and ultimately lead to high grades.<ref name=":0" /> In the same study it was found that out of a group of 158 educators, 92% agreed that the reason they use Twitter is because of how user friendly it is,<ref name=":0" /> another 86% agreed that they started and continue using Twitter because of how easy it is to learn, and finally,<ref name=":0" /> 93% said they use Twitter because it is free. People found that sifting through large amounts of data is challenging, however, with the simple nature of Twitter large amount of information became easily accessible.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Greenhow|first1=Christine|last2=Gleason|first2=Benjamin|date=October 3, 2012|title=Twitteracy: Tweeting as a New Literacy Practice|journal=The Educational Forum|volume= 76|issue=4|pages=464–478|doi=10.1080/00131725.2012.709032|s2cid=145800002|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/58f577c3809044f30566f4762f40e533e02a62f8}}</ref> Much of this simplicity comes from the use of the hashtag, and the intuitive nature of how Twitter as a microblogging site operates.<ref name=":1" /> These features help to promote education outside the classroom in a global setting where students and educators are easily able to create, connect, and share knowledge. This ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the classroom, but virtually and around the world.

====Public figures====

World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing [[Twitter diplomacy]], the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, [[Michael A. McFaul]] has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy.

[[Donald Trump]] has used Twitter as a method of providing ideas and information during his [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|presidential campaign in 2016]], the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transitional period]] and as [[Presidency of Donald Trump|US President]]. A study performed at [[Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology]] showed his tweets from these different time periods and through analysis of his tweets, the professors found that President Trump uses a mode called "forensic mode" the most often in his tweets. This is described as a quick reactive usage, as they found he often used Twitter to show his judgment of the events that occurred regarding both his allies and his enemies.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Conger |first1=Kate |last2=Alba |first2=Davey |title=Twitter Refutes Inaccuracies in Trump's Tweets for First Time |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20200526&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=cta&regi_id=72995439&segment_id=29226&user_id=579ae23cfcbd75c9aac87cb571cc201c |access-date=May 27, 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=May 26, 2020}}</ref> After his election to the presidency he tweeted this "forensic-style" tweet, "Just had a very open and successful election.

In a study done at [[New York University]] in 2015, an analysis and comparison of the Twitter accounts of Donald Trump, [[Jeb Bush]], [[Bernie Sanders]], and [[Hillary Clinton]], found observations showing the goals of each candidate's Twitter during their respective primary elections. Some comparisons that were made were the use of Aristotle's theory of [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]. The research found that Donald Trump used pathos, the appeal to emotion, in his rhetoric; Bernie Sanders tended to use ethos and logos for his Twitter; Hillary Clinton tended to use logos and pathos to try to convey her values, and Jeb Bush shows that he uses a mix of all three on his account. The study also looked at the media response to the tweets during the election. The study found that the tweets became more persuasive for the candidates if the media put the tweets in front of more viewers, versus less powerful if they were only visible to those already on Twitter. In that way, presidential candidates who had their tweets covered more in the news were able to get their message to more potential voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9i5my5m7dberbn/mcconnell_thesis_final.pdf?dl=0|title=mcconnell_thesis_final.pdf|website=Dropbox|language=en|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>
