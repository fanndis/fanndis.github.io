'''Alstom SA''' is a French [[multinational corporation|multinational]] rolling stock manufacturer operating worldwide in [[rail transport]] markets, active in the fields of passenger transportation, signalling, and locomotives, with products including the [[AGV (train)|AGV]], [[TGV]], [[British Rail Class 373|Eurostar]], [[Avelia Horizon|Avelia]] and [[New Pendolino]] high-speed trains, in addition to suburban, regional and metro trains, as well as [[Alstom Citadis|Citadis]] trams.

Alsthom (originally as Als-Thom) was formed from a merger between [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] and the electric engineering division of [[Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques]] in 1928; significant acquisitions included the Constructions Electriques de France (1932), shipbuilder [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]] (1976), and parts of [[Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi|ACEC]] (Belgium, late 1980s).

A merger with parts of the [[General Electric Company]] (UK) formed GEC Alsthom in 1989. Throughout the 1990s, the company expanded its holdings in the rail sector via the acquisition of German rolling stock manufacturer [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch]] and Italian rail signalling specialist Sasib Railways. In 1998, GEC Alsthom was floated on the [[Euronext Paris|Paris Stock Exchange]]; later that year, it was rebranded as Alstom.

In 2004, Alstom was in financial crisis, largely due to massive inherited unexpected costs (€4&nbsp;billion) arising from a design flaw inherited from the acquisition of [[ABB Group]]'s turbine business, in addition to losses in other business sectors. The company required a €3.2&nbsp;billion state-backed bailout from the French government in 2003; as a result, Alstom was compelled to dispose of several of its divisions, including shipbuilding and electrical transmission to Nikhanj Power, in order to comply with [[European Union]] rules on [[state aid]]. It was able to later re-acquire its electric transmission division in 2010. The firm also became heavily involved in [[offshore wind farm]]s via its subsidiary company [[Alstom Wind]].

In 2014, Alstom and [[General Electric]] (GE) announced that a US$17&nbsp;billion (€12.4&nbsp;billion) bid for Alstom's power and [[power grid|grid]] divisions had been made and provisionally accepted. Amid controversy in France over the proposed takeover of strategic domestic interest by a foreign company, GE's bid was modified to include joint ventures in power generation and transmission, as well as GE's rail signalling business being sold to Alstom. The acquisition of the power and grid division by GE was accepted by EU and US competition authorities in 2015, subject to Alstom's heavy gas turbine business being sold. The sale of Alstom's power generation and transmission businesses to GE was finalised on 2 November 2015, after which the Alstom Group has operated solely in the rail sector.

In late 2017, Alstom announced [[#Attempted merger with Siemens Mobility|a proposed merger]] with [[Siemens Mobility]] of Germany, however, in February 2019, the [[European Commission]] prohibited the merger. Subsequently, in February 2020 the company signed a Letter of Agreement to purchase [[Bombardier Transportation]].

==History==
===Alsthom (1928–1989)===
Alsthom was founded in 1928 from the merger of French heavy engineering interests of the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] (then part of [[General Electric]]) – the ''Compagnie française pour l'exploitation des procédés Thomson Houston'' (or Compagnie Française Thomson Houston, CFTH) and [[Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques]], with the first factory in [[Belfort]]. In 1932, Alsthom expanded into transportation by acquiring [[Constructions Electriques de France]], Tarbes, a manufacturer of electric locomotives as well as electrical and hydraulic equipment.

In 1969, [[Compagnie Générale d'Electricité]] (CGE) became the majority shareholder of Alsthom. In 1976, Alsthom merged with [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]], becoming Alsthom Atlantique. Thus, the business expanded into marine. The next year, it constructed the first 1300&nbsp;MW generator set for the [[Paluel Nuclear Power Plant]], setting a world record with an output of 1500&nbsp;MW.

In 1978, Alsthom delivered its first [[TGV]] to [[SNCF]]. The TGV went on to break world rail speed records in 1981 (at {{convert|380|km/h|mi/h}}) and in 1990 (at {{convert|515.3|km/h|mi/h}}). It also set the world endurance record for high-speed train lines in 2001, travelling the {{convert|1067.2|km|mi}} from [[Calais]] to [[Marseille]] in 3 hours and 29 minutes. In 1986, Alsthom Belfort received an order from [[Électricité de France|EDF]] for the largest gas turbine in the world (212&nbsp;MW).

In 1988–89, holding company CGEE Alsthom acquired ACEC Energie (hydroturbines and electrical equipment for the nuclear industry) and ACEC Automatisme (automation) from the dissolution of Belgian electrical engineering company [[Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi|ACEC]]. Alsthom acquired 100% of ACEC's transport division, renaming it ''ACEC Transport''.<ref>Sources:

===GEC Alsthom (1989–1998)===
{{see also|General Electric Company}}
In early 1989, GEC Alsthom was formed from a 50–50 merger of Alsthom and the Power Systems Division of the British [[General Electric Company]]; for Alsthom this move was intended to allow Alsthom to more successfully sell its products to export customers outside the French market.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#idch1994|International Directory of Company Histories]] (1994)</ref> In May of that year, British rail vehicle manufacturer [[Metro-Cammell]] was acquired.<ref>GEC swallows Metro-Cammell ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' July 1989 page 457</ref>

During the early 1990s, GEC Alsthom was the principal manufacturer of the [[British Rail Class 373]], a variant of their TGV family specially designed for traversing the [[Channel Tunnel]] between the UK and France. Although collectively operated by [[Eurostar]], the type was ordered by three different railway companies: 16 by [[SNCF]], four by [[NMBS/SNCB]], and 18 by [[British Rail]], of which seven were shortened ''North of London'' sets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/about_eurostar/company_information/ownership_structure.jsp |title= Ownership & Structure |access-date= 11 May 2009 |publisher= [[Eurostar]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090508110025/http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/about_eurostar/company_information/ownership_structure.jsp |archive-date= 8 May 2009 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> The first Class 373 set was completed at GEC Alstom's Belfort facility during 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5496207_ITM |title=GEC Alsthom: a marriage a la Jack Sprat |publisher=Management Today |access-date=25 August 2009}}</ref>

In June 1998, GEC Alsthom was listed on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]]; both GEC and [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] elected to sell off part of their stakes (23.6% each). Around this time, the company was officially renamed ''Alstom''.<ref>GEC Alsthom drops the 'h' ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1167 July 1998 page 55</ref> Retained by Alstom, the former Metro-Cammell works in [[Washwood Heath]] were closed in 2005.<ref name=IRJJuly03>Alstom withdraws from train assembly in British ''[[International Railway Journal]]'' July 2003 page 4</ref>

===Alstom (1999–2014)===
In 1999, Alstom bought half of [[ABB Group|ABB's]] power systems division, forming a 50-50 joint company known as ABB Alstom Power. Alstom also bought Canada's Télécité,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} a passenger information and security solutions company, and sold its heavy-duty gas turbine business to [[General Electric]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/1999/3/ALSTOM-sells-its-heavy-duty-gas-turbine-business-to-General-Electric-19990323/| title = ALSTOM sells its heavy duty gas turbine business to General Electric| date = 23 March 1999|work = www.alstom.com| type = press release}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url=http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/1999/6/ALSTOM-completes-sale-of-its-heavy-duty-gas-turbine-business-to-General-Electric-19990625/| title = ALSTOM completes sale of its heavy duty gas turbine business to General Electric| date = 25 June 1999|work = www.alstom.com| type = press release}}</ref> The next year, it bought out ABB's share in ABB Alstom Power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_abb_sell_stake/|title=ABB to Sell Stake in ABB Alstom Power|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Transmission & Distribution World|work=tdworld.com}}</ref>

In 2000, Alstom sold its diesel engine businesses ([[Ruston (engine builder)|Ruston]], [[Paxman (engines)|Paxman]], and [[Mirrlees Blackstone]]) to [[MAN SE|MAN Group]].<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2000/2/Man-acquires-ALSTOMs-diesel-engine-operations-20000221/| title = Man acquires Alstom's diesel engine operations| date = 21 February 2000| work = www.alstom.com| type = Press release}}</ref> It also acquired a 51% stake in Italian rail manufacturer [[Fiat Ferroviaria]], a world leader in tilting technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63843730.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105071525/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63843730.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2012 |title=Article: Alstom Takes Over Fiat Ferroviaria |publisher=International Railway Journal Article |date=1 July 2000 |work=www.highbeam.com}}</ref> In April 2003, Alstom sold its industrial turbine business to [[Siemens]] for €1.1&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.power-eng.com/articles/2003/04/siemens-buys-alstom-industrial-turbines-business-for-euro11bn.html| title = Siemens buys Alstom industrial turbines business for €1.1bn| date =28 April 2003| work = www.power-eng.com}}</ref>

By 2003, Alstom was facing a financial crisis caused by a mix of poor sales and over $5&nbsp;billion of debt liabilities; it reportedly had the potential to force the company's liquidation. These heavy debts were largely due to a $4&nbsp;billion charge over a design flaw in a turbine developed by [[ABB Group]], acquired by Alstom in 2000, as well as the collapse of customer [[Renaissance Cruises]] amid a general downturn in the marine market. Alstom's share price had dropped by 90% over two years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_29/b3842135_mz034.htm| title = Can Alstom Get Back on Track?

In 2005, the former Metro-Cammell rail vehicle works in [[Washwood Heath]], closed.<ref name=IRJJuly03/>

In 2006, Alstom sold its Marine Division to the Norwegian group [[Aker Yards]], with a commitment to retain 25% of the shares until 2010; it also sold Alstom Power Conversion, which became [[Converteam]], in a leveraged buy-out deal funded by Barclays Private Equity France SAS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.converteam.com/converteam/4/doc/Finance_Room/2006/Financial_Reports/2007_05_30_Converteam_Annual_Report_2006.pdf |title=Converteam Annual Report 2006 |date=5 May 2007 |website=Converteam.com|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916100456/http://www.converteam.com/converteam/4/doc/Finance_Room/2006/Financial_Reports/2007_05_30_Converteam_Annual_Report_2006.pdf |archive-date=16 September 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> In June 2006, [[Bouygues]] acquired the French government's 21% holding in Alstom for €2 billion.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/apr/28/france.internationalnews |title = Bouygues buys Alstom stake| date = 28 April 2006 |work= The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Gow}}</ref> Later that same year, Bouygues elected to increase its shareholding in the firm to 24%.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===November 2015–present===
In November 2015, Alstom was awarded a contract by the Indian Railways to construct an electric locomotive factory in [[Madhepura]] ([[Bihar]]), receiving an initial order of 800 twin-section 9MW locomotives for use on the [[Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor]], valued at ₹190 billion (about US$2.9 billion). This factory was to be operated under a joint venture with the [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Ministry of Railways]] (26%) at a cost of ₹ 13 billion (roughly US$200 million).<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/alstom-to-supply-800-electric-locos-to-indian-railways.html| title = Alstom to supply 800 electric locos to Indian Railways | date = 10 November 2015| work = www.railwaygazette.com |access-date=11 November 2015}}</ref>

In September 2015, it was announced that [[Amtrak]] would award Alstom a contract for $2.5 billion for the next generation high-speed train sets for the [[Northeast Corridor]]. This would result in the creation of 750 jobs across upstate New York with 400 direct manufacturing jobs at Alstom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eveningtribune.com/article/20150921/NEWS/150929980 |title=400 New jobs coming to Alstom|first=Jason |last =Jordan |newspaper= The Evening Tribune | date = 21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-announces-amtrak-is-set-to-select-hornells-alstom-as-part-of-25-billion-program-to-build-safer-next-generation-high-speed-trains-senator-says-project-will-create-750-jobs-including-400-direct-manufacturing-jobs-at-alstom-in-hornell- |title=SCHUMER ANNOUNCES: AMTRAK IS SET TO SELECT HORNELL'S ALSTOM AS PART OF $2.5 BILLION PROGRAM TO BUILD SAFER, NEXT GENERATION HIGH-SPEED TRAINS; SENATOR SAYS PROJECT WILL CREATE 750 JOBS INCLUDING 400 DIRECT MANUFACTURING JOBS AT ALSTOM IN HORNELL |date = 21 September 2015| type = press release |publisher=Charles E.

In March 2016, a joint venture of Alstom and [[Gibela]] began construction of a new {{convert|60000|m2}} train building factory in [[Dunnotar]], outside of [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. Initial orders for the factory included 580 [[X'Trapolis Mega]] passenger trains for [[Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa]] under a €4 billion contract that was awarded in 2013.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.europeanrailwayreview.com/26686/rail-industry-news/alstom-jv-begins-construction-south-africa-train-manufacturing-site/ | date = 7 March 2016| title = Alstom JV begins construction on South African suburban trains manufacturing site| work = www.europeanrailwayreview.com}}</ref>

In September 2016, Alstom announced it was to cease locomotive manufacturing at its [[Belfort]] (France) site by 2018 due to low orders; remaining production activity was to be transferred to its facility in [[Reichshoffen]], [[Alsace]].<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/business/single-view/view/alstom-to-cease-locomotive-production-at-belfort.html| title = Alstom to cease locomotive production at Belfort| date = 8 September 2016| work = www.railwaygazette.com |access-date=8 September 2016}}</ref> However, during October 2016, the French state placed an order of about €650 million for 15 TGV Euroduplex trains; an order for 20 locomotives; plus an order for 30 intercity trains to be built at Reichshoffen. Together, these orders were sufficient to prevent the Belfort plant's closure in the short to medium term.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/europe/alstom-belfort-plant-rescued-with-tgv-order.html | title = Alstom Belfort plant rescued with TGV order | first = Keith| last = Barrow| date= 4 October 2016| work = www.railjournal.com}}</ref><ref name="belclose1">{{citation| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-04/france-to-order-alstom-tgv-trains-to-help-prevent-factory-halt| title = Alstom to Scrap Belfort Plan After France Pledges New TGV Orders| first =Ania| last = Nussbaum| date = 4 October 2016 | work = www.bloomberg.com}}</ref>

In June 2017 Alstom opened the largest train modernisation facility in the UK at [[Halebank]] on the outskirts of [[Liverpool]]. Initial work involved the repainting of the [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] ''Pendolino''s.<ref>{{Citation| url = http://alstom-widnes.co.uk/| title = Alstom in Widnes| access-date = 1 July 2017| publisher = Alstom| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170523104128/http://alstom-widnes.co.uk/| archive-date = 23 May 2017| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | date = 29 June 2017 | title = Alstom opens UK's largest train modernisation facility in Widnes | periodical = Rail Technology Magazine | publisher = Cognitive Publishing | url = http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/alstom-opens-uks-largest-train-modernisation-facility-in-widnes- | access-date = 1 July 2017}}</ref>

In December 2018, three executives of Alstom were found guilty of conspiracy to corrupt following an investigation by the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] into allegations of several [[Lithuania]]n politicians and officials being offered [[bribe]]s in return for securing contracts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/dec/19/alstom-executives-found-guilty-of-conspiracy-to-corrupt |title=Three Alstom executives guilty of conspiracy to corrupt |first=David |last=Pegg |date=19 December 2018 |website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>

===Attempted merger with Siemens Mobility===
On 26 September 2017, Alstom announced a proposal to merge with [[Siemens Mobility]], the rolling stock division of German conglomerate [[Siemens]]; this merger was promoted as the creation of "a new European champion in the rail industry".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2017/09/siemens-and-alstom-join-forces-to-create-a-european-champion-in-mobility/ |title=Siemens and Alstom join forces to create a European Champion in Mobility |date=26 September 2017 |website=Alstom.com}}</ref> The combined rail business, which was to have been reportedly named ''Siemens Alstom'' and headquartered in Paris, would have $18 billion U.S. in revenue and employ 62,300 people in more than 60 countries.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/09/26/european-railway-manufacturers-siemens-and-alstom-confirm-merger-deal.html |title=European railway manufacturers Siemens and Alstom confirm merger deal |last=Marowits |first=Ross |date=26 September 2017 |work=The Toronto Star |language=en-CA |issn=0319-0781}}</ref> During November 2018, the European Commission voiced its concerns surrounding the proposed merger of the two companies, particularly that the combined entity would be too dominant in the European market; alleged impacts from such dominance included potential increases in passenger fares and cargo fees. Furthermore, a series of [[Protests against Emmanuel Macron|popular protests]] concerning the financial reforms of both the French territorial railway infrastructure and [[SNCF]] occurred.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/alstom-siemens-merger-eu-slams-plans/ |title=EU slams Alstom-Siemens rail mega-merger plans |last1=Larger |first1=Thibault |date=13 November 2018 |work=Politico |last2=Oroschakoff |first2=Kalina}}</ref>

The proposed merger was viewed by some{{according to whom|date=January 2020}} as a measure to counter the rise of rival [[China|Chinese]] rail business [[CRRC]]; it reportedly received support from many figures within both the French and German governments. However, the transaction, which was originally due to close by the end of 2018, was met with opposition by French trade union officials who voiced their concerns that such a merger would have the potential for job losses.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alstom-siemens-unions/french-trade-unions-voice-opposition-to-alstom-siemens-tie-up-deal-idUSKBN1FJ1RI |title=French trade unions voice opposition to Alstom/Siemens tie-up deal |date=30 January 2018 |work=Reuters}}</ref> On 17 July 2018, Alstom shareholders overwhelmingly approved the proposed merger with Siemens.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.railwayage.com/news/alstom-shareholders-approve-siemens-merger/ |title=Alstom shareholders approve Siemens merger |last= Senese |first=Kyra |date=18 July 2018 |work=Railway Age |language=en}}</ref> However, on 6 February 2019, the planned merger between the two companies was vetoed by the European Commission.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/6e344f6a-29fd-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8/ |title=EU blocks planned Siemens-Alstom rail deal in landmark decision |last=Toplensky |first=Rochelle |date=6 February 2019 |work=Financial Times |language=en}}</ref> In response to this ruling, Alstom's Chief Executive Officer Henri Poupart-Lafarge stating that he viewed the decision to block the merger to have been a result of "ideological prejudices".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-06/alstom-and-siemens-show-how-not-to-deal-with-china-and-vestager |title=Alstom and Siemens Show How Not to Deal With China |last=Fickling |first=David |date=6 February 2019 |work=Bloomberg |language=en}}</ref>

===Planned acquisition of Bombardier Transportation===
In mid-February 2020, Alstom announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Agreement to buy [[Bombardier Transportation]], the multinational train maker headquartered in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], for between €5.8 billion and €6.2 billion. The deal requires the approval by Alstom shareholders at a meeting to be held in October 2020 and approval by European regulators. Bombardier's major shareholder, [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]], had already agreed to the sale.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bombardier-sells-train-making-division-to-french-multinational-alstom-1.5466643 |title=Bombardier sells train-making division to French multinational Alstom |date=17 February 2020 |publisher=CBC News |access-date=18 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Awards-contracts-appointments/alstom-to-take-over-bombardier |title=Alstom to take over Bombardier |date=18 February 2020 |publisher=Rail Technology |access-date=18 February 2020 }}</ref> In July 2020, it was announced that the EU competition authorities have approved the purchase deal. In order to finish the deal, Alstom will need to sell a factory based in France, a regional train division, a Bombardier facility in Germany, and a Bombardier trains division. Apart from that, the company will also need to carry out different guarantees and pass on some of Bombardier's assets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e1ef9d6f-a0cd-4c9b-a13e-525a728758ca|title= EU approves Alstom-Bombardier deal to create train-making giant |work=Financial Times|last1=Keohane|first1=David|last2=Espinoza|first2=Javier|date=31 July 2020|access-date=31 July 2020|location=Brussels}}</ref>

==Former businesses==
=== Power generation ===
Alstom power activities were collectively called Alstom Power Systems and included the design, manufacturing, services, and supply of products and systems for the power generation sector and industrial markets. The group covered most energy sources, including gas, coal, nuclear, hydro, wind. Power Systems provided components for power generation including boilers, steam turbines, and gas turbines, wind turbines, generators, air quality control systems, and monitoring and control systems for power plants, as well as related products. It had a special focus on boilers and emissions control equipment.<ref name=BizWeek />

Power Systems also provided services such as product retrofitting for nuclear and fossil steam turbines and refurbishment of existing power plants. It performed maintenance and servicing under long-term agreements for its own turbines, as well as those manufactured by GE and Siemens. In Russia, the company serviced nuclear equipment under a join agreement with [[Atomenergomash]]. In Brazil, Alstom, together with [[Bardella]], ran a joint venture called [[Indústria Metalúrgica e Mecânica da Amazônia]] to build hydroelectric power plants throughout the Amazon and Latin American regions. In India, Alstom had a joint venture with [[Bharat Forge]] to manage power production from start to finish.<ref name=BizWeek>{{cite web|title=Alstom (ALO:Euronext Paris) Company Description|work=Business Week|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot_article.asp?ticker=ALO:FP|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140625022420/http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot_article.asp?ticker=ALO:FP|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2014|access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref>
