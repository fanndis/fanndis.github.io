==Medical uses==
The primary uses of lovastatin is for the treatment of [[dyslipidemia]] and the prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name=AHFS/> It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Lovastatin|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/Lovastatin.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Lovastatin is usually well tolerated, with the most common side effects being, in approximately descending order of frequency: [[creatine phosphokinase]] elevation, [[flatulence]], abdominal pain, constipation, [[diarrhoea]], [[myalgia|muscle aches or pains]], nausea, [[dyspepsia|indigestion]], weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps.<ref name = MSR>{{cite web|title=Mevacor, Altoprev (lovastatin) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=17 March 2014|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/mevacor-altoprev-lovastatin-342458#showall}}</ref> As with all statin drugs, it can rarely cause [[myopathy]], [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage), [[dermatomyositis]] or [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name = MSR/> This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor.

===Contraindications===
[[Contraindication]]s, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with lovastatin, include pregnancy, breast feeding, and liver disease. Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X); it may cause birth defects such as skeletal deformities or learning disabilities. Due to its potential to disrupt infant lipid metabolism, lovastatin should not be taken while breastfeeding.<ref name=LactMed>{{cite web|title=Lovastatin|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~CSZXZ5:1|work=LactMed|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> Patients with liver disease should not take lovastatin.<ref name="Rxlist">{{cite web|last=Stöppler|first=Melissa|title=Mevacor Side Effects Center|url=http://www.rxlist.com/mevacor-side-effects-drug-center.htm|publisher=RxList|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.<!--
  --><ref name="Alberts98">{{cite journal | author = Alberts AW | title = Discovery, biochemistry and biology of lovastatin | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 62 | pages = 10J–15J | year = 1998| doi = 10.1016/0002-9149(88)90002-1 | pmid = 3055919 | issue = 15}}</ref>
Mevalonate is a required building block for cholesterol biosynthesis and lovastatin interferes with its production by acting as a reversible competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA, which binds to the HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin is a [[prodrug]], an inactive lactone in its native form, the gamma-lactone closed ring form in which it is administered, is hydrolysed in vivo to the β-hydroxy acid open ring form; which is the active form.

Lovastatin and other statins have been studied for their [[chemopreventive]] and [[chemotherapeutic]] effects. No such effects were seen in the early studies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz MS |title=Therapy insight: Potential of statins for cancer chemoprevention and therapy |journal=Nature Clinical Practice Oncology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=82–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16264880 |doi=10.1038/ncponc0097 |s2cid=9766310 }}</ref> More recent investigations revealed some chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, for certain types of cancer, especially in combination of statins with other anticancer drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Chae YK, Yousaf M, Malecek MK, Carneiro B, Chandra S, Kaplan J, Kalyan A, Sassano A, Platanias LC, Giles F | year = 2015 | title = Statins as anti-cancer therapy; Can we translate preclinical and epidemiologic data into clinical benefit? | journal = Discov Med. | volume = 20 | issue = 112| pages = 413–27 | pmid = 26760985 }}</ref> It is likely that these effect are mediated by the properties of statins to reduce [[proteasome]] activity, leading to an accumulation of [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] inhibitors [[p21]] and [[p27 (gene)|p27]], and to subsequent G<sub>1</sub>-phase arrest, as seen in cells of different cancer lines.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jakóbisiak M, Bruno S, Skierski J, Darzynkiewicz Z | year = 1991 | title = The cell cycle specific effects of lovastatin | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 88 | issue = 9| pages = 3628–3632 | pmid = 1673788 | pmc = 51505 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.88.9.3628 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao S, Porter DC, Chen X, Herliczek T, Lowe M, Keyomarsi K |title=Lovastatin-mediated G1 arrest is through inhibition of the proteasome, independent of hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase |journal=Proc.

In 1982, some small-scale clinical investigations of lovastatin, a polyketide-derived natural product isolated from ''Aspergillus terreus'', in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, with very few adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought to be associated with compactin, clinical studies continued.

Large-scale trials confirmed the effectiveness of lovastatin. Observed tolerability continued to be excellent, and lovastatin was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in 1987.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=019643&TABLE1=OB_Rx FDA Orange Book Detail for application N019643 showing approval for 20 mg tablets on Aug 31, 1987 and 40 mg tablets on Dec 14, 1988]</ref> It was the first statin approved by the FDA.<ref>{{cite journal|first= Akira|last= Endo|title= The origin of the statins |journal= Atheroscler.

[[Image:Lovastatin2.png|180px|thumb|right|A ball-and-stick model of lovastatin]]
The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the [[isoprene]]s that are building-blocks of [[squalene]], the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.<ref name="Alberts98"/>

HMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring.

Lovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Endo]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of [[mevastatin]], a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of ''Penicillium citrium''.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Akira|last=Endo|author2=Kuroda M. |author3=Tsujita Y. |title=ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium|journal=Journal of Antibiotics|date=December 1976|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1346–8|pmid=1010803|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.29.1346|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The six genes that encode enzymes that are essential for the biosynthesis of lovastatin are lovB, lovC, lovA, lovD, lovG, and lovF .<ref name="Campbell 2010 755–763">{{Cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Chantel D.|last2=Vederas|first2=John C.|date=2010|title=Biosynthesis of lovastatin and related metabolites formed by fungal iterative PKS enzymes|journal=Biopolymers|language=en|volume=93|issue=9|pages=755–763|doi=10.1002/bip.21428|pmid=20577995|issn=1097-0282}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=LovG: The Thioesterase Required for Dihydromonacolin L Release and Lovastatin Nonaketide Synthase Turnover in Lovastatin Biosynthesis|last1=W|first1=Xu|last2=Yh|first2=Chooi|date=2013-06-17|language=en|pmid=23653178|last3=Jw|first3=Choi|last4=S|first4=Li|last5=Jc|first5=Vederas|last6=Na|first6=Da Silva|last7=Y|first7=Tang|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|volume=52|issue=25|pages=6472–5|doi=10.1002/anie.201302406|pmc=3844545}}</ref> The synthesis of dihydromonacolin L requires a total of 9-malonyl Coa .<ref name="Campbell 2010 755–763"/> It proceeds in the PKS pathway until it reaches '''(E)''' a hexaketide, where it undergoes a Diels-Alder cycloaddition to form the fused rings. After cyclization it continues through the PKS pathway until it reaches '''(I)''' a nonaketide, which then undergoes release from LovB through the thioesterase encoded by LovG. Dihydromonacolin L, '''(J),''' then undergoes oxidation and dehydration via a cytochrome P450 oxygenase encoded by LovA to obtain monacolin J, '''(L)'''.

The MT domain from lovB is active in the conversion of ('''B)''' to ('''C)''' when it transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the tetraketide '''(C)''' .<ref name="Campbell 2010 755–763"/> Due to the fact that LovB contains an inactive ER domain, LovC is required at specific steps to obtain fully reduced products. The domain organization of LovB, LovC, LovG and LovF is shown in Figure 2. The inactive ER domain of lovB is shown with an oval and where LovC acts in trans to LovB is shown with a red box.

In a parallel pathway, the diketide side chain of lovastatin is synthesized by another highly reducing type I polyketide synthase enzyme encoded by LovF . Lastly, the side chain, 2-methylbutyrate '''(M)''' is covalently attached to C-8 hydroxy group of monacolin J '''(L)''' by a transesterase encoded by LovD to form lovastatin.

===Total synthesis===
A major bulk of work in the synthesis of lovastatin was done by M. Hirama in the 1980s.<!--

Hirama synthesized compactin and used one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence is shown in the schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in [[methanol]] and then [[silylation]] to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the [[silyl ether]]. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with [[Acetic anhydride|Ac<sub>2</sub>O]] and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in [[chlorobenzene]] for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.

Simple organic reactions were used to get to lovastatin as shown in the scheme.
