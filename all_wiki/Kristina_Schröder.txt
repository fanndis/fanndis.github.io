'''Kristina Schröder''' (née '''Köhler''', born 3 August 1977) is a [[Germany|German]] [[politician]] who served as the [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth]] in the [[Second Merkel cabinet|government]] of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] from 2009 to 2013. She served as a Member of Parliament between 2002 and 2017.

==Early life and education==
Schröder was born Kristina Köhler in [[Wiesbaden]], [[Hessen]]. After finishing her [[abitur]] in 1997, she studied [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], and [[political science]] at [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]]. She earned her [[Diplom]] in 2002, and her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 2009. Her [[doctoral thesis]] was ''{{lang|de|Gerechtigkeit als Gleichheit? Eine empirische Analyse der objektiven und subjektiven Responsivität von Bundestagsabgeordneten}}'' (English: "Justice as equality? An empirical analysis of the objective and subjective responsivity of members of parliament"), supervised by [[Jürgen W. Falter]].

Following Schröder's appointment as government minister, her doctoral research came under close scrutiny for its heavy reliance on research assistance by her party.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/779/496098/text/ Neu-Ministerin Kristina Köhler – Das schwarze Netz von Frau Doktor] (30 November 2009) {{in lang|de}}</ref> In 2011 it was reported that an assistant of Falter had been paid by Schröder for working on the statistical data on which the thesis was based. The university's president stated there was no evidence for any wrongdoing, and that legwork undertaken by aides was scientifically legitimate and accepted practice.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthias Thieme |url=http://www.fr-online.de/politik/dr--kristina-schroeder-und-ihre-helfer/-/1472596/3222244/-/index.html |title=Umstrittene Doktorarbeit: Dr. Kristina Schröder und ihre Helfer |language=de |publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref>

==Political career==
Schröder joined the [[Junge Union]] in 1991 and has been a member of the [[Bundestag (Germany)|Bundestag]] since 2002, affiliated with the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]].<ref name=btg>[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete/bio/K/koehlkr0.html Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202105512/http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete/bio/K/koehlkr0.html |date=2009-12-02 }} at Bundestag.de {{in lang|de}}</ref> Between 2002 and 2009, she served as member on the Committee on Internal Affairs. In 2005, she also joined an inquiry committee investigating the involvement of German intelligence services in the [[Iraq War]].

On November 30, 2009, Schröder was appointed [[Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth]] in the [[Cabinet Merkel II|cabinet of]] [[Angela Merkel]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,663910,00.html Spiegel.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref> During her time in office, the government approved a bill to provide parents of 1- and 2-year-old children with an allowance for keeping their toddlers out of state-run day care, a move that critics said would derail recent efforts to encourage German women to return to work after starting a family.<ref>Melissa Eddy (June 6, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/world/europe/german-lawmakers-spar-over-child-care-subsidy.html German Lawmakers Spar Over Child Care Subsidy] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Amid a conflict within her own political party over the question of setting a statutory quota for female participation in the supervisory boards of companies in Germany, Schröder backed a voluntary scheme.<ref>Quentin Peel (April 14, 2013), [https://www.ft.com/content/df39494a-a367-11e2-8f9c-00144feabdc0 Merkel faces snub over women board quotas] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

When Germany's government reduced [[Conscription in Germany|compulsory military service]] from nine months to six in 2009, Schröder took the lead on introducing the [[Federal volunteers service|Federal Volunteers Service]] (BFD), a [[Government of Germany|German government]] program which encourages [[volunteering|volunteerism]] among young adults for public welfare, to fill the gaps left by changes to the national service system.<ref>Charlotte Frank (November 22, 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/22/germany-national-service-changes-voluntary-sector Germany's scaling back of national service leaves voluntary sector confused] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>

Unlike many in her party at the time, Schröder spoke out in support of [[civil unions]] in 2012, saying that "in lesbian and gay life partnerships, people take lasting responsibility for one another and thus they live according to conservative values." <ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-government-plans-to-rewrite-laws-to-include-civil-unions-a-851502.html 'Spouse or Life Partner': Ministry Wants to Enshrine Gay Rights in Law] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', August 22, 2012.</ref>

Since the [[2013 German federal election|2013 elections]], Schröder has been the deputy chairwoman of the Committee on the Scrutiny of Elections, Immunity and the Rules of Procedure, which is chaired by [[Johann Wadephul]]. In addition, she serves as member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Energy, where she is her parliamentary group’s [[rapporteur]] on the media, food and pharmaceutical industries as well as on space technology.

In April 2016, Schröder announced that she would not stand in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal elections]] but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.<ref>Anna Reimann (April 7, 2016), [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ex-familienministerin-schroeder-will-nicht-wieder-in-bundestag-a-1085922.html Ex-Familienministerin: Kristina Schröder zieht sich aus Bundespolitik zurück] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref> By the end of the parliamentary term, she joined communication consultancy Deekeling Arndt Advisors as Senior Advisor.<ref>[http://www.prreport.de/home/aktuell/article/11813-deekeling-arndt-advisors-angelt-sich-kristina-schroeder/ Deekeling Arndt Advisors angelt sich Kristina Schröder] ''[[Haymarket Media Group|PR Report]]'', June 22, 2017.</ref>
