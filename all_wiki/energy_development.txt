'''Energy development''' is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional, [[Alternative energy|alternative]] and [[Renewable energy|renewable]] sources of energy, and for the [[Waste heat|recovery and reuse of energy]] that would otherwise be wasted. [[Energy conservation]] and [[Efficient energy use|efficiency measures]] reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to [[environmental issue]]s.

Societies use energy for transportation, manufacturing, illumination, heating and air conditioning, and communication, for industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes.  Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, where the resource can be used in substantially its original form, or as secondary resources, where the energy source must be converted into a more conveniently usable form. Non-renewable resources are significantly depleted by human use, whereas renewable resources are produced by ongoing processes that can sustain indefinite human exploitation.

Thousands of people are employed in the [[energy industry]]. The conventional industry comprises the [[petroleum industry]], the natural gas industry, the [[electrical power industry]], and the [[nuclear industry]]. New energy industries include the [[renewable energy industry]], comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture, distribution, and sale of [[alternative fuel]]s.

== Classification of resources ==

{{further|World energy resources and consumption}}
{{see also|Worldwide energy supply|Energy and society|Energy planning|Energy policy}}

[[File:Basic Open System Model.gif|thumb|right|Open System Model (basics)]]

Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, suitable for end use without conversion to another form, or secondary resources, where the usable form of energy required substantial conversion from a primary source.  Examples of primary energy resources are [[wind power]], [[solar power]], wood fuel, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, and uranium. Secondary resources are those such as electricity, [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]], or other synthetic fuels.

Another important classification is based on the time required to regenerate an energy resource.  "Renewable" resources are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs. Examples are hydroelectric power or wind power, when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands.  Non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes. An example of a non-renewable energy source is coal, which does not form naturally at a rate that would support human use.

== Fossil fuels ==

[[File:Moss Landing Power Plant p1270026.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Moss Landing Power Plant]] in California is a [[fossil-fuel power station]] that [[Natural gas power plant|burns natural gas in a turbine]] to produce electricity]]

{{Main|Fossil fuel|Peak oil}}

Fossil fuel (''primary non-renewable fossil'') sources burn [[coal]] or [[hydrocarbon]] fuels, which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. Another fossil fuel, [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), is principally derived from the production of natural gas. Heat from burning fossil fuel is used either directly for space heating and process heating, or converted to mechanical energy for vehicles, [[industrial process]]es, or [[electrical power generation]]. These fossil fuels are part of the [[carbon cycle]] and thus allow stored solar energy to be used today.

The use of fossil fuels in the 18th and 19th Century set the stage for the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Fossil fuels make up the bulk of the world's current [[primary energy]] sources. In 2005, 81% of the world's energy needs was met from fossil sources.<ref>International Energy Agency: Key World Energy Statistics 2007. S. 6</ref> The technology and infrastructure already exist for the use of fossil fuels. Liquid fuels derived from petroleum deliver a great deal of usable energy per unit of weight or volume, which is advantageous when compared with lower [[energy density]] sources such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Fossil fuels are currently economical for decentralised energy use.

Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources, which will eventually decline in production <ref>Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation, and Risk Management. Was at: www.pppl.gov/polImage.cfm?doc_Id=44&size_code=Doc</ref> and become exhausted.  While the processes that created fossil fuels are ongoing, fuels are consumed far more quickly than the natural rate of replenishment.  Extracting fuels becomes increasingly costly as society consumes the most accessible fuel deposits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/analysis/rigs/insight.asp?i_id=213 |title=Big Rig Building Boom |date=2006-04-13 |publisher=Rigzone.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021000239/http://rigzone.com/analysis/rigs/insight.asp?i_id=213 |archive-date=2007-10-21 |accessdate=2008-01-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Extraction of fossil fuels results in [[environmental degradation]], such as the [[strip mining]] and [[mountaintop removal]] of coal.

The [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle, is given as a [[ratio]] of distance travelled per unit of [[Motor fuel|fuel]] consumed. Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for [[freight]], and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger).

Conventional production of oil has [[peak oil|peaked]], conservatively, between 2007 and 2010. In 2010, it was estimated that an investment in non-renewable resources of $8 trillion would be required to maintain current levels of production for 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2010/11/101109-peak-oil-iea-world-energy-outlook/|title=Has the World Already Passed "Peak Oil"?|work=nationalgeographic.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812065328/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2010/11/101109-peak-oil-iea-world-energy-outlook/|archive-date=2014-08-12|date=2010-11-11}}</ref> In 2010, governments subsidized [[fossil fuel]]s by an estimated $500 billion a year.<ref name="sciencedaily1">''ScienceDaily.com'' (April 22, 2010) [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100421133110.htm "Fossil-Fuel Subsidies Hurting Global Environment, Security, Study Finds"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410225830/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100421133110.htm |date=2016-04-10 }}</ref>  Fossil fuels are also a source of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, leading to concerns about [[global warming]] if consumption is not reduced.

The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of [[pollution]] into the atmosphere. The fossil fuels are mainly carbon compounds.

[[Nuclear power]] is the use of [[nuclear fission]]  to generate useful [[heat]] and [[electricity]]. Fission of uranium produces nearly all economically significant nuclear power. [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s form a very small component of energy generation, mostly in specialized applications such as deep space vehicles.

[[Nuclear power plant]]s, excluding [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors]], provided about 5.7% of the world's energy and 13% of the world's electricity in 2012.<ref>

Recent experiments in extraction of uranium use polymer ropes that are coated with a substance that selectively absorbs uranium from seawater. This process could make the considerable volume of uranium dissolved in seawater exploitable for energy production.  Since ongoing geologic processes carry uranium to the sea in amounts comparable to the amount that would be extracted by this process, in a sense the sea-borne uranium becomes a sustainable resource.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/#34e87e246e2a|title=Uranium Seawater Extraction Makes Nuclear Power Completely Renewable|first=James|last=Conca|website=forbes.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424213313/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/#34e87e246e2a|archive-date=24 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/toc/iecred/55/15#UraniuminSeawater April 20, 2016 Volume 55, Issue 15 Pages 4101-4362 In this issue:Uranium in Seawater] Page 962 to 965</ref>{{Relevance inline|date=October 2020}}

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. [[Nuclear power plant]]s typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs. In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks.<ref name=kidd2011/> In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out.<ref name=kidd2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&storyCode=2058653 |title=New reactors—more or less? |author=Kidd, Steve |date=January 21, 2011 |work=Nuclear Engineering International |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212195417/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&storyCode=2058653 |archive-date=2011-12-12 }}</ref> Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.<ref name=kidd2011/>

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties.

[[Hydroelectricity]]  is electric power generated by [[hydropower]]; the force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf|access-date=2017-05-24|title=Renewables 2016: Global Status Report|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525173336/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-25}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2017}} and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the following 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.<ref name=wi2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062448/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |archive-date=2014-09-24 |access-date=2014-01-11 }}</ref>

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.<ref name=wi2012/> Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.<ref name=wi2012/> Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]] than [[fossil fuel]] powered energy plants.<ref name="REN21-2011">[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR2011.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409013321/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR2011.pdf |date=April 9, 2012 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2011, accessed 2011-11-7.</ref>

Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and [[solar thermal energy|solar thermal]] collectors to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]].

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly [[energy independence|import-independent resource]], enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[climate change]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".<ref name=ie11>{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |publisher=International Energy Agency |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/63fIHKr1S?url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> More than 100 countries use solar PV.

[[Photovoltaics]] (PV) is a method of [[Electricity generation|generating electrical power]] by converting [[solar radiation]] into [[direct current]] [[electricity]] using [[semiconductor]]s that exhibit the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Photovoltaic power generation employs [[solar panel]]s composed of a number of [[solar cell]]s containing a photovoltaic material. Materials presently used for photovoltaics include [[monocrystalline silicon]], [[polycrystalline silicon]], [[amorphous silicon]], [[cadmium telluride]], and [[copper indium gallium selenide]]/sulfide. Due to the increased demand for [[renewable energy]] sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]] has advanced considerably in recent years.

=== Biofuels ===
{{Main|Biofuel|Sustainable biofuel}}

A biofuel is a [[fuel]] that contains energy from geologically recent [[carbon fixation]]. These fuels are produced from [[living organisms]]. Examples of this [[carbon fixation]] occur in [[plants]] and [[microalgae]]. These fuels are made by a [[biomass]] conversion (biomass refers to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can be used for biofuels. Biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising [[oil prices]] and the need for [[energy security]].

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]] or [[sugarcane]]. [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. However, research is underway on producing renewable fuels from [[Renewable fuels by decarboxylation|decarboxylation]]<ref>{{cite journal|title = Continuous catalytic deoxygenation of model and algal lipids to fuel-like hydrocarbons over Ni–Al layered double hydroxide|doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2014.12.004|volume=258|pages=284–293|journal=Catalysis Today|author=Santillan-Jimenez Eduardo|year = 2015}}</ref>

=== Geothermal ===
{{Main|Geothermal energy}}
[[File:NesjavellirPowerPlant edit2.jpg|thumb|Steam rising from the [[Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station]] in [[Iceland]]]]

Geothermal energy is [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] originates from the original formation of the planet (20%) and from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals (80%).<ref name=ucsusa>[http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/how-geothermal-energy-works.html How Geothermal energy works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925080922/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/how-geothermal-energy-works.html |date=2014-09-25 }}.

From [[hot springs]], geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for [[space heating]] since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]].

Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,<ref>Glassley, William E. (2010). ''Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|9781420075700}}.</ref> but has historically been limited to areas near [[tectonic plate boundaries]]. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate [[global warming]] if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, and interest rates. Pilot programs like EWEB's customer opt in Green Power Program <ref>[http://www.eweb.org/greenpower Green Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015040912/http://www.eweb.org/greenpower |date=2014-10-15 }}. eweb.org</ref> show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal.

=== Oceanic ===
{{Main|Marine energy}}

'''Marine energy''' or '''marine power''' (also sometimes referred to as '''ocean energy''', '''ocean power''', or '''marine and hydrokinetic energy''') refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[Ocean thermal energy|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to [[Electricity generation|generate]] electricity to power homes, transport and industries.

The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]] i.e. power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]] i.e. obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water.
The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new [[renewable energy]] around the world.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]] says producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]],  and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.<ref name=enpol2011>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

{{main|Efficient energy use}}

Although increasing the efficiency of energy use is not energy development per se, it may be considered under the topic of energy development since it makes existing energy sources available to do work.<ref>Richard L. Kauffman

Efficient energy use reduces the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[fluorescent lamp]]s or natural [[Skylight (window)|skylights]] reduces the amount of energy required for illumination compared to [[incandescent light bulbs]]. [[Compact fluorescent lights]] use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.  Improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting an efficient technology or production process.<ref>[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.</ref>

Reducing energy use may save consumers money,  if the energy savings offsets the cost of an energy efficient technology.  Reducing energy use reduces emissions.  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[Energy efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[Sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234531/http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |archive-date=2007-09-26 }}</ref>

They all rely in way on the energy sources listed in the previous section.

=== Shipping and pipelines ===

{{See also|Pipeline transport}}

[[Coal]], [[petroleum]] and their derivatives are delivered by boat, [[Rail transport|rail]], or road. Petroleum and natural gas may also be delivered by [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], and coal via a [[Slurry pipeline]]. Fuels such as [[gasoline]] and [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] may also be delivered via [[aircraft]]. Natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly. The higher costs of ethanol transportation and storage are often prohibitive.<ref>

=== Wired energy transfer ===

[[File:Electricalgrid.jpg|thumb|[[Electrical grid]] – pylons and cables distribute power]]

{{main|Electrical grid}}

Electricity grids are the [[electrical network|networks]] used to [[Electric power transmission|transmit]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribute]] [[electric power|power]] from production source to end user, when the two may be hundreds of kilometres away.  Sources include electrical generation plants such as a [[nuclear reactor]], coal burning power plant, etc.  A combination of sub-stations and transmission lines are used to maintain a constant flow of electricity. Grids may suffer from transient [[Power blackout|blackouts]] and [[power outage|brownouts]], often due to weather damage. During certain extreme [[space weather]] events [[solar wind]] can interfere with transmissions. Grids also have a predefined [[carrying capacity]] or load that cannot safely be exceeded. When power requirements exceed what's available, failures are inevitable. To prevent problems, power is then rationed.

Industrialised countries such as Canada, the [[United States|US]], and Australia are among the highest per capita consumers of electricity in the world, which is possible thanks to a widespread electrical distribution network. The US grid is one of the most advanced, although [[infrastructure]] maintenance is becoming a problem. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041014214845/http://currentenergy.lbl.gov/ CurrentEnergy] provides a realtime overview of the electricity supply and demand for [[California]], [[Texas]], and the Northeast of the US. African countries with small scale electrical grids have a correspondingly low annual per capita usage of electricity. One of the most powerful power grids in the world supplies power to the state of [[Queensland]], Australia.

=== Wireless energy transfer ===

[[Wireless power transfer]] is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source, without the use of interconnecting wires. Currently available technology is limited to short distances and relatively low power level.

Orbiting solar power collectors would require wireless transmission of power to Earth. The proposed method involves creating a large beam of microwave-frequency radio waves, which would be aimed at a collector antenna site on the Earth. Formidable technical challenges exist to ensure the safety and profitability of such a scheme.

== Storage ==

[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] in [[Wales]], United Kingdom. [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] (PSH) is used for [[grid energy storage]].]]

{{Main|Energy storage|List of energy storage projects}}

Energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store [[energy]] to perform useful operation at a later time. A device that stores energy is sometimes called an [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulator]].

All forms of energy are either [[potential energy]] (e.g. [[Chemical energy|Chemical]], [[gravitation]]al, [[Electric potential energy|electrical energy]], temperature differential, [[latent heat]], etc.) or [[kinetic energy]] (e.g. [[momentum]]). Some technologies provide only short-term energy storage, and others can be very long-term such as [[power to gas]] using [[hydrogen]] or [[methane]] and the [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons]] in deep aquifers or bedrock.  A wind-up clock stores potential energy (in this case mechanical, in the spring tension), a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone, and a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dam stores [[Electrical power industry|energy]] in a [[reservoir]] as gravitational [[potential energy]]. [[Thermal energy storage#Air conditioning|Ice storage]] tanks store ice ([[thermal energy]] in the form of latent heat) at night to meet peak demand for cooling. [[Fossil fuel]]s such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. Even [[food]] (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in [[chemical]] form.

== History ==

[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Energy generators past and present at [[Doel]], Belgium: 17th-century windmill ''Scheldemolen'' and 20th-century [[Doel Nuclear Power Station]]]]

Since prehistory, when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food, through the Middle Ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat, until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom. Man has sought endlessly for energy sources.

Except nuclear, geothermal and [[tidal power|tidal]], all other energy sources are from current solar isolation or from fossil remains of plant and animal life that relied upon sunlight. Ultimately, [[solar power|solar energy]] itself is the result of the [[Sun]]'s nuclear fusion. [[Geothermal power]] from hot, hardened [[Rock (geology)|rock]] above the [[magma]] of the Earth's core is the result of the decay of radioactive materials present beneath the Earth's crust, and [[nuclear fission]] relies on man-made fission of heavy radioactive elements in the Earth's crust; in both cases these elements were produced in [[supernova]] explosions before the formation of the [[solar system]].

Since the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest. In 1865, [[William Stanley Jevons]] published ''The Coal Question'' in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement. In 1914, [[United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines]] stated that the total production was {{convert|5.7|Goilbbl|m3}}. In 1956, Geophysicist [[M. King Hubbert]] deduces that U.S. oil production would [[Hubbert peak theory|peak]] between 1965 and 1970 and that oil production will peak "within half a century" on the basis of 1956 data. In 1989, predicted peak by [[Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell]]<ref>"Oil Price Leap in the Early Nineties," Noroil, December 1989, pages 35–38.</ref> In 2004, OPEC estimated, with substantial investments, it would nearly double oil output by 2025<ref>Opec Oil Outlook to 2025 Table 4, Page 12</ref>

=== Sustainability ===

[[File:Energy-consumption-World2.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Energy consumption from 1989 to 1999]]

{{see also|Climate change mitigation|Carbon pricing}}

The [[environmental movement]] has emphasized [[sustainability]] of energy use and development.<ref>Sustainable Development and Innovation in the Energy Sector. Ulrich Steger, Wouter Achterberg, Kornelis Blok, Henning Bode, Walter Frenz, Corinna Gather, Gerd Hanekamp, Dieter Imboden, Matthias Jahnke, Michael Kost, Rudi Kurz, Hans G. Nutzinger, Thomas Ziesemer. Springer, December 5, 2005.</ref> [[Renewable energy]] is sustainable in its production; the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years.  "Sustainability" also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products, especially [[air pollution]].  Sources which have no direct waste products (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) are brought up on this point. With global demand for energy growing, the need to adopt various energy sources is growing. [[Energy conservation]] is an alternative or complementary process to energy development.  It reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently.

=== Resilience ===

{{see also|Resilience (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Energy per capita.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Energy consumption ''per capita'' (2001). Red hues indicate increase, green hues decrease of consumption during the 1990s.]]

Some observers contend that idea of "[[energy independence]]" is an unrealistic and opaque concept.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/Federal/us_fed_Election_Series_101012.pdf  |title=Energy independence and security: A reality check|website=deloitte.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405230251/http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/Federal/us_fed_Election_Series_101012.pdf  |archive-date=April 5, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The alternative offer of "energy resilience" is a goal aligned with economic, security, and energy realities. The notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book ''[[Brittle Power]]: Energy Strategy for National Security''.<ref>[http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/brittlepower.htm Brittle Power: Energy Plan for National Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702233352/http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/brittlepower.htm |date=2009-07-02 }}. [[Amory B. Lovins]] and L. Hunter Lovins (1982).</ref> The authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the often interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of a country. Key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are often centralized and easily susceptible to disruption. They conclude that a "resilient energy supply" is necessary for both national security and the environment. They recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized.<ref>[http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/FragileDomEnergy_AtlanticMonthly_Nov1983.pdf "The Fragility of Domestic Energy."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106001526/http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/FragileDomEnergy_AtlanticMonthly_Nov1983.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }} [[Amory B. Lovins]] and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Atlantic Monthly''. November 1983.</ref>

In 2008, former [[Intel Corporation]] Chairman and CEO [[Andrew Grove]] looked to energy resilience, arguing that complete independence is unfeasible given the global market for energy.<ref>[http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future "Our Electric Future."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/ |date=2014-08-25 }} [[Andrew Grove]]. ''The American''. July/August 2008.</ref> He describes energy resilience as the ability to adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy. To that end, he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future|title=An Electric Plan for Energy Resilience|author=[[Andrew Grove]] and Robert Burgelman|publisher=McKinsey Quarterly|date=December 2008|accessdate=2010-07-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/|archive-date=2014-08-25}}</ref> Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources. A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is "sticky" – meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas.  According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as [[The Reform Institute]] have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing [[smart grid]] would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles ''en masse'' connecting to it to charge their batteries.<ref>[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/16484/Electric_Car_Reform_Brief_FINAL_PDF_3-4-09.pdf?sequence=1 Resilience in Energy: Building Infrastructure Today for Tomorrow's Automotive Fuel.

Extrapolations lack plausibility, particularly when they predict a continual increase in oil consumption.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Energy production usually requires an energy investment. Drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy. The fossil fuel resources that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert. They may thus require increasingly higher energy investments. If investment is greater than the value of the energy produced by the resource, it is no longer an effective energy source.  These resources are no longer an energy source but may be exploited for value as raw materials.  New technology may lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources, although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded.

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html|title=Eating Fossil Fuels|work=Resilience|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html|archive-date=2007-06-11}}</ref> The peaking of world hydrocarbon production ([[peak oil]]) may lead to significant changes, and require sustainable methods of production.<ref>[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009 }} retrieved 28 May 2009</ref> One vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earth's surface (i.e., buildings, vehicles and roads) doing [[artificial photosynthesis]] (using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer) efficiently than plants.<ref>Faunce TA, Lubitz W, Rutherford AW, MacFarlane D, Moore, GF, Yang P, Nocera DG, Moore TA, Gregory DH, Fukuzumi S, Yoon KB, Armstrong FA, Wasielewski MR, Styring S. ‘Energy and Environment Case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis.’ Energy and Environmental Science 2013, 6 (3), 695 - 698 DOI:10.1039/C3EE00063J {{cite journal |title=Energy and environment policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis |journal=Energy & Environmental Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=695–698 |doi=10.1039/C3EE00063J |date=2013-02-20 |last1=Styring |first1=Stenbjorn |last2=Wasielewski |first2=Michael R. |last3=Armstrong |first3=Fraser A. |last4=Yoon |first4=Kyung Byung |last5=Fukuzumi |first5=Shunichi |last6=Gregory |first6=Duncan H. |last7=Moore |first7=Tom A. |last8=Nocera |first8=Daniel G. |last9=Yang |first9=Peidong |last10=Moore |first10=Gary F. |last11=MacFarlane |first11=Douglas |last12=Rutherford |first12=A.
