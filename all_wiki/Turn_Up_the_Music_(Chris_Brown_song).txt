It was written by [[Fuego (singer)|Alexander "Fuego" Palmer]], Brown, Damon Thomas, [[Harvey Mason, Jr.]], Michael "Mike J" Jimenez, [[Terence Coles]] and Agent X, while production was handled by Fuego and [[The Underdogs (duo)|The Underdogs]]. "Turn Up the Music" was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] playlists in the United States on February 7, 2012, as the [[lead single]] from Brown's fifth studio album ''[[Fortune (Chris Brown album)|Fortune]]'' (2012). It was released for [[Music download|digital download]] on February 10, 2012. "Turn Up the Music" is an [[Tempo|uptempo]] song which draws from the genres of [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] and [[House music|house]]. Instrumentation consists of pulsating [[Beat (music)|beat]]s,  [[synth]]esizers, a "throbbing bass" and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]. According to Mason, Jr., the song's inspiration came from visualizing Brown as an artist, "how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy."<ref name="masoninterview"/> The song's main synth part is a royalty free loop found in Vengeance Future House VOL. 4 and can be found in the "Toxicated" Kit.

"Turn Up the Music" garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who complimented its production and compared the song to Brown's previous singles "[[Forever (Chris Brown song)|Forever]]" (2008) and "[[Yeah 3x]]" (2010), for its similar musical direction. Critics also noted its similarities to the work of [[LMFAO (group)|LMFAO]] and [[David Guetta]]. "Turn Up the Music" achieved commercial success worldwide, becoming Brown's first number one single on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and his eleventh top ten single on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The song also reached the top ten in Australia and New Zealand, and the top twenty in Canada, Hungary, Ireland and Slovakia. It was certified double platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), and gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand]] (RIANZ).

The accompanying [[music video]] for "Turn Up the Music" was directed by Godfrey Taberez and Brown, and filmed in [[Los Angeles]], California. It features Brown at a party filled with masked people, where he performs heavily choreographed dance routines. The video garnered positive reception from critics, for its series of dance sequences which were compared to [[Michael Jackson]]. It won [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] at the [[2012 MTV Video Music Awards]], and earned Taberez and Brown a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the [[BET Awards 2012|2012 BET Awards]].
