The '''Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009''' ({{USPL|111|2}}, {{USBill|111|S|181}}) is a [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal statute]] in the [[United States]] that was the first bill signed into law by [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] on January 29, 2009. The act amends [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and states that the 180-day [[statute of limitations]] for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new paycheck affected by that discriminatory action. The law directly addressed ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.]]'' (2007), a [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal-pay lawsuit begins on the date that the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision, not at the date of the most recent paycheck.

An earlier bill seeking to supersede the ''Ledbetter'' decision, also called the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, was first introduced in the [[110th United States Congress]], but was not successfully enacted at that time, as it was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] but failed in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

During the campaign for the 2008 elections, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] criticized [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for defeating the 2007 version of the bill, citing Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]]'s opposition to the bill and candidate [[Barack Obama]]'s support.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dade|first=Corey|date=August 31, 2008|title=Obama's First Shot at Palin Focuses on Equal Pay|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/08/31/obamas-first-shot-at-palin-focuses-on-equal-pay/|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030194035/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/08/31/obamas-first-shot-at-palin-focuses-on-equal-pay/|archive-date=October 30, 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

The antecedents of the case were posed when [[Lilly Ledbetter]], a production supervisor at a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tire plant in [[Alabama]], filed an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], six months before her early retirement in 1998.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brake|first1=Deborah|last2=Grossman|first2=Joanna|date=Fall 2007|title=Title VII's Protection Against Pay Discrimination: The Impact of Ledbetter v.

The ''Ledbetter'' decision was cited by federal judges in 300 cases before the LLFPA was passed. These cases involved not only Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but also the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]], [[Fair Housing Act]], [[Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act]] and [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment to the Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pear|first=Robert|date=January 5, 2009|title=Justices' Ruling in Discrimination Case May Draw Quick Action by Obama|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/us/politics/05rights.html|url-status=live|access-date=March 21, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022130626/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/us/politics/05rights.html|archive-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref>

Among the first to criticize the Court's decision that Ledbetter's complaint was time-barred was [[Marcia Greenberger]], president of the [[National Women's Law Center]], that saw in the ruling a "setback for women and a setback for civil rights" and called Ginsburg's opinion a "clarion call to the American people that this slim majority of the court is headed in the wrong direction."<ref>{{cite news|author=Barnes|first=Robert|date=May 30, 2007|title=Over Ginsburg's Dissent, Court Limits Bias Suits|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/29/AR2007052900740.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009223120/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/29/AR2007052900740.html|archive-date=October 9, 2020}}</ref> [[Debra L.

==The bill==
[[Image:Lilly Ledbetter DNC 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Ledbetter speaks during the second day of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]].]]
The [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|House Democrats]] were fast to react, coming out on June 12 against the Supreme Court. Claiming lead from Justice Ruth Ginsburg's dissenting opinion, which invited the Congress to take action by amending the law, the Democrats announced their intention to intervene: [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Steny Hoyer]] and [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|Education and Labor Committee]] Chairman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] said that a bill was to be passed to avoid future court rulings in line with ''Ledbetter'', clearly putting that "a key provision of the legislation will make it clear that discrimination occurs not just when the decision to discriminate is made, but also when someone becomes subject to that discriminatory decision, and when they are affected by that discriminatory decision, including each time they are issued a discriminatory paycheck", as said by Rep. Miller.<ref name="Ledbetter">{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Jesse J.|date=June 12, 2007|title=House Dems Target Court's Pay Ruling|publisher=[[Associated Press]] ([[Time (magazine)|Time]])|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1632164,00.html|access-date=March 22, 2009}}</ref>

Republicans immediately opposed the bill as drafted, with Education and Labor Committee [[ranking member]] [[Howard McKeon]] raising the issue that business executives would be held liable for actions taken by managers who weren't leading the company anymore: "At the end of the day, such a loophole conceivably could allow a retiring employee to seek damages against a company now led by executives who had nothing to do with the initial act of discrimination".<ref name="Ledbetter"/>

The [[American Bar Association]] passed a resolution supporting the new bill.<ref name="RB">{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Robert|date=September 5, 2007|title=Exhibit A in Painting Court as Too Far Right|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090401900.html|url-status=live|access-date=March 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006170117/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090401900.html|archive-date=October 6, 2020}}</ref> Neal Mollen, who represented the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] in the Ledbetter case, argued that extending the term limit would put a strain on the chances of an adequate defense for the employers, as to defend themselves one "has to rely on documents and the memory of individuals, and neither of those is permanent. If a disappointed employee can wait for many years before raising a claim of discrimination ... he or she can wait out the employer, that is ensure that the employer effectively unable to offer any meaningful defense to the claim".<ref name="Ledbetter"/>

The bill was reintroduced in the 111th Congress (as {{USBill|111|H.R.|11}} and {{USBill|111|S.|181}}) in January 2009.

President Obama actively supported the bill. The [[Whitehouse.gov|official White House blog]] said:

<blockquote>President Obama has long championed this bill and Lilly Ledbetter's cause, and by signing it into law, he will ensure that women like Ms. Ledbetter and other victims of pay discrimination can effectively challenge unequal pay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Macon|date=January 25, 2009|title=Now Comes Lilly Ledbetter|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2009/01/25/now-comes-lilly-ledbetter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308030926/http://www.whitehouse.gov/now-comes-lilly-ledbetter/|archive-date=March 8, 2012|work=The President Obama White House Blog}}</ref></blockquote>

House Majority Leader [[Steny Hoyer]] announced that the House would vote on S. 181 (the bill passed by the Senate) during the week of January 26, getting the bill to President Obama's desk sooner rather than later. On January 27, the House passed S. 181 by a 250–177 margin.

On January 29, 2009, Obama signed the bill into law, which was nine days after taking office. It was the first act he signed as president, and it fulfilled his campaign pledge to nullify ''Ledbetter v. Goodyear''.<ref>{{Cite news|date=January 29, 2009|title=Obama touts equal-pay bill at signing ceremony|work=[[NBC News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna28910789|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030001426/https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna28910789|archive-date=October 30, 2020}}</ref> However, by signing it only two days after it was passed by the House, he incurred criticism by newspapers, such as the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' which mentioned his campaign promise to give the public five days of notice to comment on legislation before he signed it. The White House through a spokesman answered that they would be "implementing this policy in full soon", and that, currently they were "working through implementation procedures and some initial issues with the congressional calendar".<ref>{{cite web|date=February 4, 2009|title=Barack Obama Campaign Promise No. 234: Allow 5 Days of Public Comment Before Signing Bills|url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/234/allow-five-days-of-public-comment-before-signing-b/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006232432/https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/234/allow-five-days-of-public-comment-before-signing-b/|archive-date=October 6, 2020|work=[[PolitiFact]]}}</ref> In 2017, the Trump administration announced it was ending an Obama-era rule that required businesses with over 100 employees to collect wage data by gender, race, and ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Klein|first=Betsy|date=September 1, 2017|title=Ivanka Trump supports ending Obama-era equal pay data collection rule|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/31/politics/white-house-ivanka-trump-equal-pay-data/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102030318/https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/31/politics/white-house-ivanka-trump-equal-pay-data/|archive-date=November 2, 2020|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>
