'''Sikorsky Aircraft''' is an American [[aircraft manufacturer]] based in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. It was established by Russian–American aviator [[Igor Sikorsky]] in 1923 and was among the first companies to manufacture [[helicopter]]s for civilian and military use.

Previously owned by [[United Technologies Corporation]] (UTC), in November 2015 Sikorsky was sold to [[Lockheed Martin]].

==History==
On May 23, 1923, the "Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation" was founded near [[Roosevelt Field (airport)|Roosevelt Field]], New York, by [[Igor Sikorsky]], an immigrant to the United States who was born in [[Kyiv]].<!-- Note it was in the [[Russian Empire at the time. Please do not add either Russian- or Ukrainian- here&nbsp;— this dispute is not worth an edit war, and is better handled in Igor's bio article, not here. --><ref name="Sik_history">{{cite web |url=http://www.sikorsky.com/vgn-ext-templating-SIK/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid%3D2dd9e39d40a78110VgnVCM1000001382000aRCRD |title= About Sikorsky |access-date=June 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702104052/http://www.sikorsky.com/vgn-ext-templating-SIK/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2dd9e39d40a78110VgnVCM1000001382000aRCRD |archive-date=July 2, 2009}}</ref><ref name=winged>{{cite book |last=Sikorsky |first=Igor |title=The Story of the Winged-S |year=1944 |publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company |location=New York |isbn=9781258163556 |page=160}}</ref> In 1925, the company name was changed to "Sikorsky Manufacturing Company".<ref name=wing>{{cite book |last=Sikorsky |first=Igor |title=The Story of the Winged-S |year=1944 |publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company |location=New York |isbn=9781258163556 |page=185}}</ref> In 1929, the company moved to [[Stratford, Connecticut]], and it became a part of [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]] (later [[United Technologies Corporation]]) in July of that year.<ref name="Spenser 1998">Spenser 1998</ref>

In the United States, Igor Sikorsky originally concentrated on the development of multi-engined landplanes and then amphibious aircraft. In the late 1930s, sales declined and United Aircraft merged his division with [[Vought Aircraft]].<ref name="Spenser 1998"/> He then began work on developing a practical helicopter. After first flying the [[VS-300]] he developed the [[Sikorsky R-4]], the first stable, single-rotor, fully controllable [[helicopter]] to enter full-scale production in 1942, upon which most subsequent helicopters were based.

Sikorsky Aircraft remains a leading helicopter manufacturer, producing such well-known models as the [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] and [[SH-60 Seahawk]], and experimental types like the [[Sikorsky S-72]]. Sikorsky has supplied the [[Marine One|Presidential helicopter]] since 1957. Sikorsky's [[SH-3 Sea King#Variants |VH-3]] and [[UH-60 Black Hawk#Special purpose|VH-60]] perform this role now.

The company acquired Helicopter Support Inc. (HSI) in 1998. HSI handles non-U.S. government after-market support for parts and repair for the Sikorsky product lines.<ref>[http://hsius.com/SASC/About/AboutUs/tabid/84/Default.aspx] {{dead link|date=March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsius.com/spare.html |title=Spare Parts |website=HSI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203140602/http://www.hsius.com/spare.html |archive-date=1999-02-03 |access-date=2019-01-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>

United Technologies Corporation (UTC) acquired [[Schweizer Aircraft|Schweizer Aircraft Corp.]] in 2004,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacusa.com/Closing_Press_Release.PDF |title= Sikorsky's Acquisition of Schweizer is Complete |access-date=March 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410040550/http://www.sacusa.com/Closing_Press_Release.PDF |archive-date=April 10, 2008 }}</ref> after which it operated as a subsidiary of Sikorsky. The product lines of the two firms were complementary, and had little overlap, as Sikorsky primarily concentrates on medium and large helicopters, while Schweizer produces small helicopters, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s, [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]], and light planes. The Schweizer deal was signed on August 26, 2004, exactly one week after the death of [[Schweizer brothers|Paul Schweizer]], the company's founder and majority owner. In late 2005, Sikorsky completed the purchase of Keystone Helicopter Corporation, located in [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania]]. Keystone had been maintaining and completing Sikorsky S-76 and S-92 helicopters prior to the sale.

In 2007, Sikorsky opened the Hawk Works,<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2007/10/mil-071008-sikorsky01.htm |title=Sikorsky opens HAWK WORKS™ completion center for military helicopters |website=Globalsecurity.org |date=2007-10-05 |access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center (RPMDCC) located west of the [[Elmira-Corning Regional Airport]] in [[Big Flats (CDP), New York |Big Flats, New York]]. That same year Sikorsky purchased the [[PZL Mielec]] plant in [[Poland]]. The plant is assembling the S-70i for international customers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/06/08/342785/sikorsky-breathes-new-life-into-pzl-mielec.html |title= Sikorsky breathes new life into PZL Mielec |access-date=June 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611091515/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/06/08/342785/sikorsky-breathes-new-life-into-pzl-mielec.html |archive-date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sikorsky.com/About+Sikorsky/News/Press+Details?pressvcmid%3Dec821075c9257210VgnVCM1000004f62529fRCRD |title= First S-70iTM Helicopter Fully Assembled at Sikorsky Facility in Poland |access-date=June 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110110549/http://www.sikorsky.com/About+Sikorsky/News/Press+Details?pressvcmid=ec821075c9257210VgnVCM1000004f62529fRCRD |archive-date=January 10, 2011 }}</ref>

In February 2009, Sikorsky Global Helicopters was created as a business unit of Sikorsky Aircraft to focus on the construction and marketing of commercial helicopters.<ref name="press">Sikorsky Press Release, 23 February 2009</ref> The business unit combined the main civil helicopters that were produced by Sikorsky Aircraft and the helicopter business of [[Schweizer Aircraft]] that Sikorsky had acquired in 2004.<ref name="press" /> It is based at [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="press" />{{Update inline|Update about Sikorsky Global Helicopters brand ending|date=May 2018}}

In 2011, Sikorsky laid off 400 workers at the Hawk Works plant, and later in 2012 the remaining 570 workers and closed all Sikorsky facilities in Chemung County; moving the military completion work to their West Palm Beach, Florida, facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Sikorsky-to-close-N-Y-plant-cut-570-jobs-3892430.php |title=Sikorsky to close N.Y. plant, cut 570 jobs |work=Connecticut Post |access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref> The commercial products had already been moved to their Coatesville, Pennsylvania facility.

Sikorsky's main plant, and administrative offices are located in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], as is a large company-owned private heliport {{airport codes||KJSD|JSD}}.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=airnav.com|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/JSD|date=13 August 2002|access-date=23 August 2020|title=Sikorsky Heliport}}</ref> Other Sikorsky facilities are in [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]], [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]], and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] (with small company heliport {{airport codes|||CT37}});<ref>{{cite web|publisher=airnav.com|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/CT37|date=13 August 2002|access-date=23 August 2020|title=Sikorsky Bridgeport Heliport}}</ref> [[Fort Worth, Texas]]; [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]; and [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] and [[Troy, Alabama]]. Other Sikorsky-owned subsidiaries are in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, [[Grand Prairie, Texas]], and others around the world.

===Acquisition===
In 2015, UTC considered Sikorsky to be less profitable than its other subsidiaries, and analyzed a possible [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] rather than a tax-heavy sale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utc.com/News/Pages/United-Technologies-To-Explore-Strategic-Alternatives-For-Its-Sikorsky-Aircraft-Business.aspx |title=United Technologies To Explore Strategic Alternatives For Its Sikorsky Aircraft Business &#124; News &#124; United Technologies |website=Utc.com |date=2015-11-03 |access-date=2016-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126220955/http://www.utc.com/News/Pages/United-Technologies-To-Explore-Strategic-Alternatives-For-Its-Sikorsky-Aircraft-Business.aspx |archive-date=2016-01-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140127/DEFREG02/301270021/UTC-Weighs-Sikorsky-s-Future |title=UTC Weighs Sikorsky's Future |website=Defensenews.com |date=2014-01-27 |access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref><ref name=brun2015>{{cite news |url=http://aviationweek.com/defense/sikorsky-not-profitable-enough-united-technologies |title=Sikorsky Not Profitable Enough For United Technologies |work=[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]] |first=Michael |last=Bruno |date=12 March 2015 |access-date=14 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314215548/http://aviationweek.com/defense/sikorsky-not-profitable-enough-united-technologies |archive-date=14 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== AHS Sikorsky Prize ==
In 1980, the [[AHS International|American Helicopter Society International]] offered a prize of US$10,000 for the first human-powered helicopter flight (60-second duration, a height of 3 meters, and staying within an area of 10 x 10 m) and soon increased prize money to US$25,000. In 2010, Sikorsky Aircraft pledged to increase the prize sponsorship to US$250,000. The Canadian engineers Dr. Todd Reichert and Cameron Robertson developed the world's largest ever human powered helicopter with a team from the [[University of Toronto]]. The first flight of [[AeroVelo Atlas]] was achieved in August 2012, the 64-second, 3.3-m-flight that won the prize on June 13, 2013.<ref name="AHS_2012">{{cite web |url= http://vtol.org/news/ahs-congratulates-aerovelo-for-human-powered-helicopter-first-flight |title= AHS Congratulates AeroVelo for Human Powered Helicopter First Flight |work= AHS International – The Vertical Flight Technical Society |date= August 28, 2012 |access-date= November 9, 2016|quote= The AeroVelo Atlas human-powered helicopter made its first flight on Tuesday August 28, 2012, as part of the AHS Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition.}}</ref>

==Products==
Sikorsky designates nearly all of its models with S-numbers; numbers S-1 through S-27 were designed by [[Igor Sikorsky]] before he left the Russian Empire. Later models, especially helicopters, received multiple designations by the military services using them, often depending on purpose (UH, SH, and MH for instance), even if the physical craft had only minor variations in equipment. In some cases, the aircraft were returned to Sikorsky or to another manufacturer and additionally modified, resulting in still further variants on the same basic model number.
