"'''If I Were a Boy'''"  is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]], from her third studio album ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). "If I Were a Boy" was written by [[BC Jean]] and [[Toby Gad]], who also handled its production alongside Beyoncé. Inspired by the difficult break-up of a romantic relationship, the song was initially recorded by Jean, whose record company rejected it. Beyoncé then recorded her own version. Jean was upset when she learned that Beyoncé was releasing it as a single, but eventually, they reached an agreement. [[Columbia Records]] released "If I Were a Boy" to US radio on October 8, 2008, as a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side single]] album's alongside "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" as the [[lead single]]s. The two songs showcased the contrast between Beyoncé's personality and her aggressive onstage persona, Sasha Fierce. A Spanish version of the song, titled "'''Si Yo Fuera un Chico'''", was digitally released in Mexico and Spain.

"If I Were a Boy" is a [[pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] introspective [[Ballad (music)|ballad]] which draws influences from [[folk rock]] through its [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] of which includes [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[drum]]s and [[String instrument|strings]]. The song's lyrics lament the misunderstandings between the genders and indict the male side of relationships. "If I Were a Boy" was well received by critics, who complimented Beyoncé's tormented and emotive vocal performance and called the song her best work to date. The single was a commercial success as it placed in the top ten on twenty-five different singles charts.<ref name="pizza"/> It topped the charts in more than eight European countries, including the United Kingdom, where it is Beyoncé's best-selling single, though it only comes in third once streaming data is included.<ref name="uk units">[https://www.beyscan.com/units/united-kingdom United Kingdom Units Figures – BeyScan]</ref> "If I Were a Boy" peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and earned multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, and the US.

The accompanying music video for "If I Were a Boy" was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and shot in [[black-and-white]]. With a theme of role reversal, it is conceptually similar to the American comedy film ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (1976). A video for the Spanish version of the ballad was edited from the original clip. Beyoncé promoted "If I Were a Boy" through live performances at venues including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', the [[52nd Grammy Awards]], and the [[I Am... World Tour]] (2009–10). The song has been covered several times on televised music competitions. American singer [[Reba McEntire]] sang a [[country music|country version]] of the ballad on [[Country Music Television]] (CMT), and a studio version was released as the second single from her 2010 album, ''[[All the Women I Am]]''.

{{Quote box|width=23em|align=right|quote="Her tone is gentle, open: Instead of the snap of 'Single Ladies' and 'Irreplaceable,' there's real sadness as she shuts this door&nbsp;... In the end, Beyoncé can't resist arching her eyebrow; she's a survivor, and she won't let her pain completely unmake her. But that's the final, poignant point of this excellent song. In Beyoncé's world view, an independent woman must sacrifice the princess fantasy she was sold as a child, and keep that steely edge, even when her world is melting around her. The compassion Beyoncé's vocal conveys as 'If I Were a Boy' concludes is as much for the man who can't fulfill romance's impossible dream as it is for herself."

The music video for "If I Were a Boy" was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and was shot in [[black-and-white]] in [[New York City]] with the video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".<ref name="mtv2">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621294/story-behind-beyonces-single-ladies-video.jhtml|title=Beyoncé's VMA-Nominated 'Single Ladies' Video Began As An Afterthought|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=September 12, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

MTV Networks |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref> The music video for "If I Were a Boy" is reflective of the stance as an independent woman that Beyoncé has taken throughout her career.<ref name="china"/> In an interview with ''Billboard'' magazine, Beyoncé revealed that the concept of the video is similar to the American comedy film ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (1976); its theme is role reversal.<ref name="bill"/> She also said that it would depict things that men commonly do to hurt their partners, like not answering their phones, before adding that the video is about little things that mean a lot in relationships.<ref name="bill"/> Beyoncé explained:

<blockquote>
In the beginning of the video, my husband makes me breakfast and he's excited about it, and I kind of don't have time to eat. As a police officer, I have a male partner and the video goes through our days. My husband's at work and has attractive girls flirting with him but he declines their advances. I have a guy flirting with me, and I flirt back.<ref name="bill"/>
</blockquote>

Beyoncé said that by the end of the video, viewers would realize the husband is a police officer and Beyoncé, as the female character, has been doing things her husband has done to her.<ref name="bill">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043816/beyonce-turns-the-tables-in-boy-video |title=Beyonce Turns The Tables In 'Boy' Video |accessdate=December 17, 2011|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref> MTV News writer Jennifer Vineyard's analysis of the concept concluded, "When we first saw it from a different perspective, Beyoncé's behavior seemed more abnormal. And when it's the guy doing everything she just did in the previous scenes, it becomes all too familiar—which is Beyoncé's point."<ref name="mtv1"/>

===Synopsis===
The video begins with Beyoncé and her husband saying a few words, including "intimacy", "honesty", and "commitment", and then saying the words "you", "me", and "us" together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by [[National Football League|NFL]] player Eddie Goines<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beyonceonline.com/de/blog/keeping-eddie-goines-beyonce-truly-legend |title=Keeping Up With Eddie Goines 'Beyonce is Truly a Legend' |publisher=Beyoncé Knowles's Official Website |date=November 19, 2011 |access-date=December 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118010224/http://www.beyonceonline.com/de/blog/keeping-eddie-goines-beyonce-truly-legend |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making a big deal out of nothing. "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.

===Fake tape===
{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote="Despite the denials—and even as the original ''Today'' broadcast below shows—every time Beyoncé hits the high notes the camera jumps to a far away wide shot spotlighting the audience. So that's kind of suspicious. But it also seems evident that the fake recording simply pitch-shifts at random—not even American Idol's worst rejects sound that awful. So we're not going to throw B[eyoncé] into a club that features Britney Spears, Enrique Iglesias and Ashlee Simpson as blatant abusers of prerecorded material just yet."
|source=—''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Daniel Kreps.<ref name="rol2"/>}}
In January 2009, Matthew Zeghibe, a 26-year-old computer art student from Connecticut, used pitch-correction software to make a clip that he claimed was the [[soundboard recording]] of "If I Were a Boy" from Beyoncé's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show appearance in November 2008.<ref name="rol1">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonce-today-hoaxer-says-he-was-trying-to-make-a-point-20090423 |title=Beyonce "Today" Hoaxer Says He Was Trying To Make A Point |first=Chris |last=Harris |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Media}}</ref> In the tape, Beyoncé sang drastically off-key.<ref name="feud"/> A corresponding video was leaked onto the internet, and it went viral.<ref name="rol1"/><ref name="mtvuk1"/> It was even played on American radio stations on April 21, 2009;<ref name="mtvuk1">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/beyonce/116344-beyonce-mime-recording-fake |title=Beyonce Mime Recording 'Fake' |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |publisher=MTV UK.

MTV Networks |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref>

On April 22, [[TMZ.com]] reported that the tape was a hoax.<ref name="feud"/> They revealed that they had spoken to the person who modified the soundboard tapes, and the alleged culprit told them, "It's a little bit crazy. No one in their right mind would sound like that, and no one would cheer for someone singing like that."<ref name="rol2"/> The following day, Beyoncé spoke about the allegations to MTV News. She stated that the report was ridiculous and that the timing of the video would draw publicity to two of her upcoming television performances.<ref name="feud"/> In an interview with Chris Harris of ''Rolling Stone'', Zeghibe said that he was surprised by how much attention the clip received and by Beyoncé's reaction to it.<ref name="rol1"/> He admitted that he had previously given the same treatment to [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Britney Spears]], and that he did not feel he had to apologize for the hoax:

<blockquote>
I was just trying to make a point. I wanted to show people how easy it is to manipulate someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.<ref name="rol1"/>

     name="wreba"/>  In 2011 she commented
<blockquote>
When I got the song and the lyrics, I thought it was an incredible song&nbsp;... And, to me, it turned out to be a country song, when we got our instrumentation on it and everything. And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' I just think music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side.<ref>{{cite web

<blockquote>
We had [covered the song] for [''Unplugged'' on CMT], and the record label really wanted me to record it and put it out as a single. I didn’t feel real good about it. It wasn’t that successful. The people in the music industry, they’re professionals, and sometimes you have to go with the team. It just didn’t work out;<ref>{{cite web
