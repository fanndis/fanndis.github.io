'''Leeds City Museum''', originally established in 1819, reopened in 2008 in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]].  It is housed in the former [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]] built by [[Cuthbert Brodrick]], in Cookridge Street (now [[Millennium Square (Leeds)|Millennium Square]]), which has been redeveloped to a design by [[Austin-Smith:Lord]] architects and [[Buro Happold]] engineers. Gallery and exhibit design is provided by Redman Design. It is one of nine sites in the [[Leeds Museums & Galleries]] group.

Admission to the museum is free of charge.  Special exhibitions are hosted alongside a collection of displays from the Leeds Archive.

== History ==
In 1819, a museum was established in Philosophical Hall, Bond Street, by the [[Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society]], and in 1821 it opened to the public. In 1921, control of the museum was handed to the Corporation of Leeds which later became [[Leeds City Council]]. In 1862, Philosophical Hall was rebuilt in Park Row, where its stone portico can still be seen on the west side of the road.<ref>[https://www.leedsphilandlit.org.uk/about-the-society/ Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society: About the society]</ref> In 1941, the museum building and [[Cultural artifacts|artifacts]] were badly damaged by bombing. In 1965 the museum was closed, and a few exhibits removed to a couple of rooms in the city library in 1966. The oversized Leeds Tiger, the giant moose skeleton and the carved wooden cart took up much of the space. In 1999 the museum went into storage, though researchers and the public could view items by appointment.  In 2000, the resource centre at [[Yeadon, West Yorkshire|Yeadon]] opened, under the same appointment-to-view arrangement. In 2001, Leeds City Council bid for [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] cash, and in 2004, it was awarded £19.5&nbsp;million,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/English/MediaCentre/Archive/Leeds+City+Museum.htm |title=Heritage Lottery Fund: ''History in the Making'', 22 September 2005 |access-date=11 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427152111/http://www.hlf.org.uk/English/MediaCentre/Archive/Leeds+City+Museum.htm |archive-date=27 April 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 
so in 2005, the Leeds [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]] building began to be redesigned as Leeds City Museum, finally to reopen in 2008.<ref>[http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/art/Longawaited-new-museum-set-to.4487043.jp Yorkshirepost.co.uk article: ''Long-awaited new museum set to go down in city's history'' Chris Bond, 12 September 2008.]</ref>

== The exhibits ==

While exhibits vary, they are mainly made up of exhibits from Leeds' history.  The central hall has a large map of Leeds printed on the floor.  There is also a scale model of the [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill flats]]. The exhibits are organised among several galleries.

=== Life on Earth gallery ===
This is the [[natural history]] gallery, featuring everything from a meteorite to dinosaur poo ([[coprolite]]). In 2019, the skeleton of a [[Long-finned pilot whale|Long-finned Pilot Whale]] was hung from the ceiling just outside the gallery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/pilot-project-will-piece-together-leeds-whales-tragic-tale-633264|title=Pilot project will piece together Leeds whale's tragic tale|website=www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>

==== Leeds Tiger ====
[[File:Smuseum 002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Leeds City Museum's "Leeds Tiger". A large mounted [[Bengal tiger]]]]
A large, stuffed [[Bengal tiger]], this exhibit came to Leeds in 1862. It was shot by Colonel Charles Reid in Dehra Dun, [[Uttar Pradesh|Utta Pradesh]], [[India]] in March, 1860. It was originally exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition|London International Exhibition]] as a tiger rug - hence its odd shape - before being turned into a [[Taxidermy|taxidermy mount]] by [[Rowland Ward|Henry Ward]]. The [[Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society]] commissioned Ward to do this work and it has been on display to the people of Leeds almost continuously for over 150 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Norris|first=Adrian|date=1985|title=Notes on the Natural History Collections in the Leeds City Museum.

The tiger was one of the foremost attractions in Leeds as soon as it was exhibited. At the annual conversazione of the Leeds Philosophical Society in 1863, the Reverend T. Hincks stated that "he was afraid that the tiger ... had been too much the great lion ... and that they had neglected many other noble beasts surrounding it."<ref>{{cite news |title=Leeds Philosophical Society: the conversazione |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000076/18631209/010/0003 |accessdate=9 June 2020 |work=Leeds Mercury |agency=British Newspaper Archive |date=9 December 1863 |page=3 col 5}}</ref> This exhibit - so beloved of the [[Leeds]] populace - has a strange history.  It was a tiger skin rug when purchased for £90 and presented to the Museum by William Gott in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite news |title=Death of Wm Gott Esq |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000193/18630829/023/0005 |accessdate=9 June 2020 |work=Leeds Intelligencer |agency=British Newspaper Archive |date=29 August 1863 |page=5 col 2}}</ref><ref name="Leeds Mercury 17 Dec 1862" >{{cite news |title=Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society : Professor Owen's inaugural address |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000076/18621217/010/0003 |accessdate=9 June 2020 |work=Leeds Mercury |agency=British Newspaper Archive |date=17 December 1862 |page=3 col 2}}</ref> The present exhibit was likely constructed of more than one tiger skin because: "researcher Ebony Andrews believes that the skin might have been trimmed after it was tanned, leaving missing sections underneath the tiger's chin, neck and up all four legs."<ref name="YEP 31 Dec 2016" />

It has been said that the tiger was "saved from the curators' skip by the ''Yorkshire Post'' when it mounted a successful campaign to retain it as a popular centrepiece of the museum's collection"<ref name="chrystal" /> but the museum's curator was quoted in 1979 as saying:<ref name="Andrew">{{cite thesis | type=Ph.D.|publisher=University of Leeds |last1=Andrew |first1=Ebony Laura |title=Interpreting Nature: Shifts in the Presentation and Display of Taxidermy in Contemporary Museums in Northern England |date=2013 |page=184 |url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6637/1/Thesis%20Hard%20Copy%20with%20Figures%2015-05-14.pdf |accessdate=9 June 2020}}</ref> {{quote|The tiger has always been very popular with the public, and school parties in general, and is one of the few items in the Museum we dare not remove, or cover,  for  fear  of  being  swamped  with  complaints  from  members  of  the  public, who in some cases have travelled many hundreds of miles just to see it.}}

[[Image:Smuseum 011hellenistic greek tomb door.jpg|thumb|right|Hellenistic Greek tomb door]]
Here are [[archaeology|archaeological]] items from Leeds and around the world.
* '''[[Roman Empire|Roman]] floor [[mosaic]]''' ca 250&nbsp;CE, depicting she-wolf with [[Romulus and Remus]]. This was discovered at [[Aldborough (Yorkshire)]], known to the Romans as  ''[[Isurium Brigantum]]''.
* '''[[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greek]] tomb doors''' ca 250&nbsp;BCE. These are carved in marble, in bas [[relief]].
* '''The [[Nesyamun|Leeds Mummy]]'''.  In the 1941 bombing raids, two other [[mummy|mummies]] were destroyed, but [[Nesyamun]]'s 3000-year-old [[mummy]] survived.  It is displayed in the current museum building, alongside a rather striking reconstruction of his face.<ref>[http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2008-09-03-Sting-in-the-tale-of-Leeds-mummy 24dash.com: Sting in the tale of Leeds mummy, by Hannah Wooderson, 3 September 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403195011/http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2008-09-03-Sting-in-the-tale-of-Leeds-mummy |date=3 April 2010 }}</ref>
* '''Iron replica of [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greek]] head of [[Aphrodite]]'''. This is a cast replica of the original 1st century BCE head in the [[British Museum]]. The original was discovered in 1872 at [[Satala]] (now Sadak) in north-eastern [[Turkey]].  The eyes were once inlaid with precious stones or paste.  Apparently the top of the head was not designed to be empty, like a piece of modern art.  It seems that the farmer found it when he hit the top of the head with his axe and damaged it.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/b/bronze_head_of_a_goddess.aspx Britishmuseum.org: ''Bronze head of a goddess, probably Aphrodite''.]</ref>

=== World View gallery ===
In 2014 this gallery began hosting a long-term exhibition called 'Voices of Asia',<ref>{{cite web |title=Voices of Asia |url=https://museumsandgalleries.leeds.gov.uk/leeds-city-museum/see-and-do-at-leeds-city-museum/ |website=Leeds City Council}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest/discover-a-world-of-asian-wonders-behind-leeds-museum-s-doors-1-6568593|title=Discover a world of Asian wonders behind Leeds museum's doors|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=18 April 2014|accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref> which celebrates the sights, sounds and culture of Asian communities here in Leeds and around the world. The 'faith' element of the display regularly changes. From 2017, the focus was on Buddhism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spotlight: the Voices of Asia |url=https://religioninpublic.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/spotlight-the-voices-of-asia/ |website=Religion in Public|accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref>
