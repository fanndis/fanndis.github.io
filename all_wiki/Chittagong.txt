The city has a population of more than 8.4&nbsp;million<ref>population.city/bangladesh/chittagong/</ref> in 2016, making it the [[List of cities in Bangladesh|second-largest city]] in the country. It is the capital of an eponymous [[Chittagong District|District]] and [[Chittagong Division|Division]]. The city is located on the banks of the [[Karnaphuli River]] between the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Modern Chittagong is Bangladesh's second most significant urban center after [[Dhaka]].

Chittagong plays a vital role in the [[Economy of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi economy]]. The [[Port of Chittagong]], one of the world's oldest ports,<ref name="google1">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&q=chittagong+ptolemy&pg=PA186 |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places - Google Books |page=186 |date= 12 November 2012|isbn=9781136639791 |access-date=2017-07-24|last1=Ring |first1=Trudy |last2=Watson |first2=Noelle |last3=Schellinger |first3=Paul }}</ref> whose coast appeared on [[Ptolemy's world map]], is the principal maritime gateway to the country. The port is the busiest international seaport on the Bay of Bengal and the third busiest in [[South Asia]].<ref name="thedailystar.net">{{cite news |title=Pangaon container terminal to get a boost |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/business/pangaon-container-terminal-get-boost-196714 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=3 January 2016}}</ref> The [[Chittagong Stock Exchange]] is one of the country's two stock markets. Several Chittagong-based [[List of companies in Bangladesh|companies]] are among the largest industrial conglomerates and enterprises in Bangladesh. The port city is the largest base of the [[Bangladesh Navy]] and [[Bangladesh Coast Guard]]; while the [[Bangladesh Army]] and [[Bangladesh Air Force]] also maintains bases and contributes to the city's economy. Chittagong is the headquarters of the Eastern Zone of the [[Bangladesh Railway]], having historically been the headquarters of [[British India]]'s [[Assam Bengal Railway]] and [[East Pakistan]]'s [[Pakistan Eastern Railway]]. A controversial [[Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard|ship breaking industry]] on the outskirts of the city, which supplies local steel but causes pollution, has come under international scrutiny.

Chittagong is an ancient seaport due to its [[natural harbor]]. It was noted as one of the largest [[Eastern world|Eastern]] ports by the Roman geographer [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century. The harbor has been a gateway through southeastern [[Bengal]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] for centuries. [[Arab people|Arab]] sailors and traders, who once explored the Bay of Bengal, set up a mercantile station in the harbor during the 9th century.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Arabs,_The |title = Arabs, the - Banglapedia}}</ref> During the 14th century, the port became a "[[Mint (facility)|mint]] town" of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], with the status of an administrative center.

During the 16th century, Portuguese historian [[João de Barros]] described Chittagong as "the most famous and wealthy city of the Kingdom of Bengal".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Chittagong |title = Chittagong &#124; Bangladesh}}</ref> [[Portuguese Chittagong]] was the first European colonial settlement in Bengal. A naval battle in 1666 between the [[Mughal Empire]] and [[Arakan]] resulted in the expulsion of Portuguese pirates. [[British Empire|British colonization]] began in 1760 when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] ceded Chittagong to the [[East India Company]]. During [[World War II]], Chittagong was a base for [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] engaged in the [[Burma Campaign]]. The port city began to expand and industrialize during the 1940s, particularly after the [[Partition of British India]]. During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, Chittagong was the site of the country's [[Bangladeshi declaration of independence|declaration of independence]].

Chittagong has a high degree of religious and ethnic diversity among Bangladeshi cities, despite having an overwhelming Bengali Muslim majority. Minorities include Bengali Hindus, Bengali Christians, Bengali Buddhists, the Chakmas, the Marmas and the Bohmong.

The port city has been known by various names in history, including ''Chatigaon'', ''Chatigam'', ''Chattagrama'', ''Islamabad'', ''Chattala'', ''Chaityabhumi'' and ''Porto Grande De Bengala''.  In April 2018, the Bangladesh government decided that the English spelling would change from Chittagong to Chattogram to make the name sound similar to the Bangla spelling.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bangladesh changes English spellings of five districts |url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/04/02/bangladesh-changes-english-spellings-of-five-districts}}</ref>

Arab Muslim traders frequented Chittagong from the 9th century. In 1154, [[Al-Idrisi]] wrote of a busy shipping route between [[Basra]] and Chittagong, connecting it with the [[Abbasid]] capital of [[Baghdad]].<ref name="banglapedia.org"/>

Many [[Sufi]] missionaries settled in Chittagong and played an instrumental role in the [[spread of Islam]].<ref name=":0" />

It was the principal maritime gateway to the kingdom, which was reputed as one of the wealthiest states in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Medieval Chittagong was a hub for maritime trade with China, [[Sumatra]], the [[Maldives]], [[Sri Lanka]], the Middle East and East Africa. It was notable for its medieval trades in pearls,<ref name="Beyond Price">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leHFqMQ9mw8C&q=chittagong+baghdad+canton+pearl&pg=PA212|title=Beyond Price|isbn=9780871692245|last1=Donkin|first1=R.

Chittagong featured prominently in the military history of the Bengal Sultanate, including during the [[Reconquest of Arakan]] and the [[Bengal Sultanate–Kingdom of Mrauk U War of 1512–1516]].

During the 13th and 16th centuries, [[Arabs]] and [[Persians]] heavily colonized the port city of Chittagong, initially arriving for trade and to preach the word of [[Islam]]. Most Arab settlers arrived from the trade route between [[Iraq]] and Chittagong, and were perhaps the prime reason for the spread of Islam to [[Bangladesh]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Arabs, The - Banglapedia |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Arabs,_The |website=en.banglapedia.org |language=en}}</ref> The first Persian settlers have also hinted to arrive for trade and religious purposes, with clues of [[Persianization]] tasks as well. Persians and other [[Iranic peoples]] have deeply affected the history of the Bengal Sultanate, with Persian being one of the main languages of the Muslim state, as well as also influencing the Chittagonian language and writing scripts.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Role of the Persian Language in Bengali and the World Civilization: An Analytical Study |url=https://www.uits.edu.bd/research/journal/v1i2/7-Persian.pdf |website=www.uits.edu |access-date=4 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031134308/http://uits.edu.bd/research/journal/v1i2/7-Persian.pdf |archive-date=31 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Eaton |first1=Richard M. |title=The rise of Islam and the Bengal frontier, 1204-1760 |date=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |isbn=9780195635867}}</ref> It has been affirmed that much of the Muslim population in Chittagong are descendants of the Arab and Persian settlers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bangladesh - Ethnic groups |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangladesh/Ethnic-groups |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}</ref>

Two decades after [[Vasco Da Gama]]'s landing in [[Calicut]], the Bengal Sultanate gave permission for the Portuguese settlement in Chittagong to be established in 1528. It became the first European colonial enclave in Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate lost control of Chittagong in 1531 after Arakan declared independence and the established Kingdom of Mrauk U. This altered geopolitical landscape allowed the Portuguese unhindered control of Chittagong for over a century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Navarro-Tejero |first1=Antonia |last2=Gupta |first2=Taniya |date=2014 |chapter=Chapter Two |title=India in Canada : Canada in India |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |isbn=978-1-4438-5571-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Biplab |date=2005 |title=European trade and colonial conquest |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=1-84331-029-5}}</ref>

Portuguese ships from Goa and [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] began frequenting the port city in the 16th century. The ''[[cartaz]]'' system was introduced and required all ships in the area to purchase naval trading licenses from the Portuguese settlement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=M.N. |date=2006 |title=The Portuguese in India |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-02850-7}}</ref> [[Slave trade]] and piracy flourished. The nearby island of [[Sandwip]] was conquered in 1602. In 1615, the [[Portuguese Navy]] defeated a joint [[Dutch East India Company]] and Arakanese fleet near the coast of Chittagong.

In 1666, the Mughal government of Bengal led by viceroy [[Shaista Khan]] moved to retake Chittagong from Portuguese and Arakanese control. They launched the Mughal conquest of Chittagong. The Mughals attacked the Arakanese from the jungle with a 6,500-strong army, which was further supported by 288 Mughal naval ships blockading the Chittagong harbour.<ref name=":0">Trudy, Ring; M.

Mughal rule ushered a new era in the history of Chittagong territory to the southern bank of Kashyapnadi (Kaladan river). The port city was renamed as Islamabad. The Grand Trunk Road connected it with [[North India]] and Central Asia. Economic growth increased due to an efficient system of land grants for clearing hinterlands for cultivation. The Mughals also contributed to the architecture of the area, including the building of Fort Ander and many mosques. Chittagong was integrated into the prosperous greater Bengali economy, which also included [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Bihar]]. Shipbuilding swelled under Mughal rule and the Sultan of Turkey had many Ottoman warships built in Chittagong during this period.<ref name="Eaton"/><ref name="books.google.com.my">Chittagong, Asia and Oceania:International Dictionary of Historic Places [https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PT344&lpg=PT344&dq=french+east+india+company+chittagong&source=bl&ots=a94DdMv4_F&sig=I9AwiPawARIZIWiLMwxWbskQIVQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aW9oUfnFMIuzrAe934DoBg&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ]</ref>

In 1685, the British East India Company sent out an expedition under Admiral Nicholson with the instructions to seize and fortify Chittagong on behalf of the English; however, the expedition proved abortive. Two years later, the company's Court of Directors decided to make Chittagong the headquarters of their Bengal trade and sent out a fleet of ten or eleven ships to seize it under Captain Heath. However, after reaching Chittagong in early 1689, the fleet found the city too strongly held and abandoned their attempt at capturing it. The city remained under the possession of the Nawab of Bengal until 1793 when East India Company took complete control of the former Mughal province of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Osmany |first1=Shireen Hasan |last2=Mazid |first2=Muhammad Abdul |year=2012 |chapter=Chittagong Port |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chittagong_Port |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V10_315.gif | title=Imperial Gazetteer of India | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Hunter, William Wilson | author-link=William Wilson Hunter | year=1908 | location=Oxford, UK | pages=308, 309}}</ref>

The [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1823 threatened the British hold on Chittagong. There were a number of rebellions against British rule, notably during the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], when the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th companies of the 34th [[Bengal Army|Bengal Infantry Regiment]] revolted and released all prisoners from the city's jail. In a backlash, the rebels were suppressed by the [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles|Sylhet Light Infantry]].<ref name="banglapedia.org"/>

Railways were introduced in 1865, beginning with the [[Eastern Bengal Railway]] connecting Chittagong to [[Dacca]] and [[Calcutta]]. The Assam Bengal Railway connected the port city to its interior economic hinterland, which included the world's largest tea and [[jute]] producing regions, as well as one of the world's earliest [[Assam oil|petroleum industries]]. Chittagong was a major center of trade with [[British Burma]]. It hosted many prominent companies of the British Empire, including James Finlay, Duncan Brothers, Burmah Oil, the Indo-Burma Petroleum Company, Lloyd's, Mckenzie and Mckenzie, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Turner Morrison, James Warren, the Raleigh Brothers, Lever Brothers and the Shell Oil Company.

The [[Chittagong armoury raid]] by Bengali revolutionaries in 1930 was a major event in British India's anti-colonial history.

During World War II, Chittagong became a frontline city in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Southeast Asian Theater]]. It was a critical air, naval and military base for Allied Forces during the [[Burma Campaign]] against Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Imperial Japanese Air Force]] carried out [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] on Chittagong in April and May 1942, in the run up to the aborted Japanese invasion of Bengal.<ref>{{cite news |date=9 May 1942 |title=Nippon Bombers Raid Chittagong |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19420509&id=WP0tAAAAIBAJ&pg=4560,1489075 |newspaper=The Miami News |agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=14 December 1942 |title=Japanese Raid Chittagong: Stung By Allied Bombing |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17799625 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=2013-05-13}}</ref> British forces were forced to temporarily withdraw to Comilla and the city was evacuated. After the [[Battle of Imphal]], the tide turned in favor of the Allied Forces.

The war had major negative impacts on the city, including the growth of refugees and the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Great Famine of 1943]].<ref name="banglapedia.org"/>

Many wealthy Chittagonians profited from wartime commerce. The [[Partition of British India]] in 1947 made Chittagong the chief port of [[East Pakistan]]. In the 1950s, Chittagong witnessed increased industrial development. Among pioneering industrial establishments included those of Chittagong Jute Mills, the [[Eastern Refinery|Burmah Eastern Refinery]], the [[Karnaphuli Paper Mills]] and [[Jamuna Oil Company|Pakistan National Oil]]. However, East Pakistanis complained of a lack of investment in Chittagong in comparison to [[Karachi]] in [[West Pakistan]], even though East Pakistan generated more exports and had a larger population. The [[Awami League]] demanded that the country's naval headquarters be shifted from Karachi to Chittagong.<ref name="daily-sun.com">{{cite news |last=Mannan |first=Abdul |date=25 June 2011 |title=Rediscovering Chittagong - the gateway to Bangladesh |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_25-06-2011_Rediscovering-Chittagong---the-gateway-to-Bangladesh_261_2_5_1_0.html |newspaper=Daily Sun |location=Dhaka |type=Editorial |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201201101/http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_25-06-2011_Rediscovering-Chittagong---the-gateway-to-Bangladesh_261_2_5_1_0.html |archive-date=2014-02-01}}</ref>

During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, Chittagong witnessed heavy fighting between rebel Bengali military regiments and the Pakistan Army. It covered [[List of sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|Sector 1]] in the [[Mukti Bahini]] chain of command. The Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence was broadcast from [[Kalurghat]] Radio Station and transmitted internationally through foreign ships in Chittagong Port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Operation_Jackpot|title=Operation Jackpot - Banglapedia}}</ref> [[Ziaur Rahman]] and [[M A Hannan]] were responsible for announcing the independence declaration from Chittagong on behalf of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].

In [[free market]] reforms launched by President Ziaur Rahman in the late 1970s, the city became home to the first [[export processing zone]]s in Bangladesh. Zia was [[Assassination of Ziaur Rahman|assassinated]] during an attempted military coup in Chittagong in 1981. The [[1991 Bangladesh cyclone]] inflicted heavy damage on the city. The Japanese government financed the construction of several heavy industries and an international airport in the 1980s and 90s. Bangladeshi [[private sector]] investments increased since 1991, especially with the formation of the Chittagong Stock Exchange in 1995. The port city has been the pivot of Bangladesh's [[emerging economy]] in recent years, with the country's rising GDP growth rate.
