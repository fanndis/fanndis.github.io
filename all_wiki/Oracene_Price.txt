Her father was an automotive worker from the [[Mississippi Delta]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Venus and Serena Williams : a biography|last=1967-|first=Edmondson, Jacqueline|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0313331650|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=58831607|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/venusserenawilli0000edmo}}</ref> She graduated from Buena Vista High School in 1970 and from [[Western Michigan University]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mlive.com/sports/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/08/poll_do_you_expect_venus_and_s.html|title=Poll: Do you expect Venus and Serena Williams to return to Saginaw to support the Urban Youth Tennis Foundation?|work=MLive.com|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}</ref> She has three daughters from a previous marriage with Yusef Rasheed: [[Murder of Yetunde Price|Yetunde Price]] (1972–2003),<ref>{{cite web|date=18 January 2004|accessdate=March 11, 2009 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/01/17/price.williams.sisters|title=Arrest in killing of tennis stars' half-sister|publisher=CNN}}</ref> who was a former beauty salon owner and registered nurse; Lyndrea Price, a Web designer; and Isha Price, a lawyer. After Rasheed's death, while working as a nurse, Oracene married [[Richard Williams (tennis coach)|Richard Williams]] and had two more daughters, [[Venus Williams]] and [[Serena Williams]]. Both Venus and Serena are high-ranked professional tennis players who have won numerous [[Grand Slam (Tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments.

By the end of 2000, Price was no longer living with her husband Richard Williams, and citing irreconcilable differences, they divorced in 2002. She reverted to her maiden name of Price.<ref>Wertheim{{clarify|date=March 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_7_58/ai_100544509 Serena and Venus on the fabulous Oracene, mother of the Williams Dynasty] Retrieved March 11, 2009.</ref>

During a semifinal match between Serena  and [[Justine Henin]] at the [[2003 French Open]], Williams was booed by fans after a complaint about a line call. Price believes that the boos were motivated by race, saying "We, as black people, live with this all the time. It's all about control."<ref>{{cite news|date=26 June 2003|accessdate=March 11, 2009|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E2DB113BF935A15755C0A9659C8B63|title=Theories About Paris From Serena's Mother|author=George Vecsey|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Tennis journalist and author [[L.

==Coaching and guiding==
Price's coaching has arguably been overshadowed by her role as mother, but as a coach she has been called underappreciated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennisworld.typepad.com/string_theory/miami_2008/page/2/|title=TENNIS.com - Blogs - String Theory by Tom Perrotta|year=2008|page=2}}</ref> Price is not a coach in a traditional sense (though she did learn tennis herself to help teach her daughters the technical aspects of the game) and is instead credited, along with Richard Williams, in keeping her daughters focused and disciplined and for helping to build a solid foundation of self-esteem and outside interests for her daughters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennisworld.typepad.com/thewrap/2007_entries/|title=TENNIS.com - Blogs - Concrete Elbow by Steve Tignor|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}</ref>

"There's no such thing as pressure," says Price. "As black Americans, that's all we've ever had. It's life. So where's the pressure?"<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=March 12, 2009 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/features/williams/flashback/daddy |title=Who's Your Daddy? |agency=CNN |work=Sports Illustrated |author=S.
