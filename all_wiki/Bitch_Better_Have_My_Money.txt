The song was conceived in producer Deputy's apartment and consisted of a simple beat. Development continued when the producer had a session with writer [[Bibi Bourelly]], who went into the recording studio and began to freestyle the initial lyrics. The first lyric of her freestyle was "bitch better have my money" which later became the title of the completed song. Following the completion of the song, Deputy believed that Rihanna would be the artist for it, stating "This is definitely something that Rihanna needs to sing. We was trying to figure out who could do it because Bibi killed it. Not anyone could just sing this record." <ref name="mtv_2137551">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2137551/rihanna-bitch-better-have-my-money-producer-deputy/?xrs=_s.fb_news_c.mu_h.21|title=You Need To Hear How Rihanna's 'Bitch Better Have My Money' Was Made|publisher=MTV News|last=Tardio|first=Tardio|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>

After a certain period of time, Bourelly had a recording session with both West and Rihanna; it was the first time they heard the track and they both reacted positively to it. When they finally got a hold on the song, some changes were made to it. They were done by Scott, WondaGurl and West; all of them added an additional part by the end of the song. When Deputy was asked whether he was bothered by the adjustments that were made, he responded, "I thought it was cool. I didn't have any negative feelings to it. Rih[anna] loved it and it was really about what she wants."<ref name="mtv_2137551"/>

"Bitch Better Have My Money" is a [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]] song<ref name="billboardreview">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6516476/rihanna-bitch-better-have-my-money-review|title=Rihanna Is a Trap Queen on 'B—h Better Have My Money': Song Review|work=Billboard|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|date=March 26, 2015|accessdate=March 26, 2015|location=New York}}</ref> with a length of three minutes and thirty-nine seconds.<ref name="cadd"/> According to Jim Farber of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' the song is reminiscent of the works by West, particularly the half-sang and half-rapped vocals.<ref name="nydailyreview"/> To deliver the vocals, she uses her [[Caribbean]] accent.

Lewis Corner of [[Digital Spy]] noted that the track represents a sequel to the music material present on Rihanna 2012 seventh studio album, ''[[Unapologetic]]'', "with its swaggering [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] heartbeat and Rihanna's [[Braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]] callouts".<ref name="digital spy">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/feature/a638425/this-weeks-new-singles-reviewed-rihanna-ed-sheeran-brandon-flowers.html|title= This week's new singles reviewed: Rihanna, Ed Sheeran, Brandon Flowers|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Corner|first=Lewis|date=March 29, 2015|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Lyrically, the song features an angrier tone than "Rihanna's usual oeuvre", "Every time I drop I am the only thing y'all playing, Don't act like you forgot, I call the shots" proclaimed along with "machine-gun [[ad-libs]]".<ref name="billboardreview"/> Lipshutz noted that the lyrical content of the song sounded inspired by [[Beyoncé]]'s 2014 single "[[Flawless (Beyoncé song)|Flawless]]".<ref name="billboardreview"/>

The official trailer for the music video was released on June 28, 2015, at the [[BET Awards 2015|BET Awards]]. The trailer captured a cryptic storyline: a rich woman, identity unknown, gets herself ready in her lavish apartment, clothes on and purse gathered in her arms, kisses her partner goodbye, and enters a dimly-lit elevator. As this occurs, Rihanna, wearing dark makeup, pulls up to the apartment complex at night. She opens up her car's trunk and pulls out a large suitcase. Struggling with the suitcase, she too enters the elevator. In one scene, the elevator doors close on the two standing women. In the next, the doors open and Rihanna struts out, alone, except for her heavy suitcase. The full video, which is seven minutes long, was released on Thursday, July 2, 2015 and was [[TV parental guidelines (US)#TV-MA|rated MA]] for graphic violence, nudity, and adult language.

The video stars Rihanna, [[Mads Mikkelsen]], [[Eric Roberts]], [[Rachel Roberts (model)|Rachel Roberts]], [[Sita Abellán]] and [https://www.instagram.com/trustmedaddy/ Sanam].

The actual plot of the video involves Rihanna and friends intoxicating and then later sadistically torturing the woman (Rachel Roberts),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.style.com/trends/industry/2015/rihanna-video-model-rachel-roberts|title=Meet the Model Star of Rihanna's|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=July 3, 2015|work=[[Style.com]]}}</ref> and also her corrupt accountant husband (Mads Mikkelsen), who has been stealing money. A video was later posted on Metro.com of deleted scenes from the video, showing the torture of the accountant in greater detail. The music video was inspired by Rihanna's real life experience with an accountant who cheated her of her money.

On November 18, 2016, it surpassed the 100 million views mark, making it the 1st ever age-restricted Vevo Certified video.<ref>{{cite web|title=RIHANNA'S "BBHMM" BECOMES 1ST EVER AGE RESTRICTED VEVO CERTIFIED VIDEO|url=https://butisitnew.info/2016/11/19/rihannas-bbhmm-becomes-1st-ever-age-restricted-vevo-certified-video/|accessdate=13 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120213345/https://butisitnew.info/2016/11/19/rihannas-bbhmm-becomes-1st-ever-age-restricted-vevo-certified-video/|archive-date=20 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
