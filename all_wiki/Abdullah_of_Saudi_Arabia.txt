'''Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالله بن عبدالعزيز آل سعود}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|'Abd Allāh ibn 'Abd al-'Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd}}'', [[Najdi Arabic]] pronunciation: {{IPA-ar|ʢæbˈdɑɫ.ɫɐ ben ˈʢæbdæl ʢæˈziːz ʔæːl sæˈʢuːd|}}; 1 August 1924 – 23 January 2015) was the sixth [[King of Saudi Arabia]] and [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] from 1 August 2005 until his death.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz|url=https://www.saudiembassy.net/about/KingAbdullah.aspx|work=18 September 2015|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726154637/http://www.saudiembassy.net/about/KingAbdullah.aspx|archivedate=26 July 2015}}</ref>

Abdullah was one of the many sons of [[Ibn Saud]], the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Abdullah held important political posts throughout most of his adult life. In 1961 he became mayor of [[Mecca]], his first public office.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who's who: Senior Saudis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7068977.stm|accessdate=27 April 2012|work=BBC|date=30 October 2007}}</ref> The following year, he was appointed commander of the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]], a post he was still holding when he became king. He also served as deputy defense minister and was named crown prince when his half-brother [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]] took the throne in 1982. After King Fahd suffered a serious stroke in 1995, Abdullah became the ''de facto'' ruler of Saudi Arabia until ascending the throne a decade later.

During his reign he maintained close relations with [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and bought billions of dollars worth of defense equipment from both states.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2010/10/20101020173353178622.html  US confirms $60bn Saudi arms deal] ''Al Jazeera'' 20 October 2010</ref> He also gave women the right to vote for municipal councils and to compete in the [[Olympics]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703523 Saudi Arabia profile] ''BBC''</ref> Furthermore, Abdullah maintained the [[status quo]] when there were [[2011–present Saudi Arabian protests|waves of protest]] in the kingdom during the [[Arab Spring]].<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/rizkhan/2010/10/201010198717987944.html  Saudi Arabia: Fundamental change? ] ''Al Jazeera'' 19 October 2010</ref> In November 2013, a [[BBC]] report claimed that, due to the close relations it had with [[Pakistan]], Saudi Arabia could obtain [[nuclear weapons]] at will from that country.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24823846 Saudi nuclear weapons 'on order' from Pakistan] ''BBC''</ref> The King also had a longstanding relationship with Pakistan, and brokered a compromise between ousted Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and General [[Pervez Musharraf]], whom he had requested to be exiled to Saudi Arabia for a 10-year exile, following his ouster in the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/359991-King-Abdullah-said-Nawaz-was-his-friend-had-to-le|title=King Abdullah said Nawaz was his friend, had to let him go: Musharraf|work=Dunya News}}</ref>

The King outlived two of his crown princes, who were all among the [[Sudairi Seven]] full brothers (which had included King Fahd). Conservative Interior Minister [[Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] was named heir to the throne on the death of [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]] in October 2011, but Nayef himself died in June 2012. Abdullah then named 76-year-old Defense Minister [[Salman bin Abdulaziz]] as crown prince. According to various reports, Abdullah married up to 30 times and had more than 35 children.<ref name="MyUser_The_Daily_Telegraph_January_24_2015c">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11322271/King-Abdullah-Ibn-Abdulaziz-al-Saud-obituary.html|title=King Abdullah Ibn Abdulaziz Al Saud - Obituary|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref name="MyUser_The_Guardian_January_24_2015c">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/22/king-abdullah-of-saudi-arabia|title=King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia Obituary|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 January 2015|author=Madawi Al Rasheed|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref name="MyUser_Nypost.com_January_24_2015c">{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/04/19/a-saudi-arabian-princess-reveals-her-life-of-hell/|title='We are hostages': A Saudi princess reveals her life of hell|newspaper=New York Post|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=19 April 2014 }}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/profilesofasianleaders/p/AbdullahProfile.htm|title=King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|work=Asian History|date=1 August 2005|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> The King had a personal fortune estimated at US$18&nbsp;billion, making him the [[List of royalty by net worth|third-wealthiest head of state]] in the world.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anita Singh|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/2598278/The-worlds-richest-royals.html|title=The world's richest royals|journal=The Telegraph|date=21 August 2008|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> He died on 23 January 2015, at the age of 90,<ref>{{cite web|title=King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia dies at the age of 90|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/01/king-abdullah-saudi-arabia-dies-150122232049573.html|work=Aljazeera|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> three weeks after being hospitalized for pneumonia, and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman.<ref name="auto1">{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah dies|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30945324|work=BBC|accessdate=23 January 2015|date=23 January 2015}}</ref>

==Commander of National Guard==
[[File:King Abdullah, Commander of Saudi Arabian National Guard.jpg|thumb|King Abdullah as Commander of [[Saudi Arabian National Guard|Saudi National Guard]]]]
In 1963, Abdullah was made commander of [[Saudi National Guard]] (SANG). This post allowed him to secure his position in the [[House of Saud]]. SANG, which had been based on the [[Ikhwan]], became a modern armed force under his command. Beginning 1985, SANG also sponsored the Janadiriyah festival that institutionalized traditional folk dances, camel races and tribal heritage.<ref name="Al Rasheed 2009 587–601"/>

==Crown Prince and Regent==
[[File:Quayle desert storm.jpg|thumb|left|Abdullah with US Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] ]]
On 13 June 1982 – the day King Khalid died – Fahd bin Abdulaziz became King, Abdullah became [[Crown Prince]] the same day and also maintained his position as head of the National Guard. During his years as crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz was described as a supporter of accommodation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sherifa Zuhur|title=Saudi Arabia: Islamic Threat, Political Reform, and the Global War on Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRwONIws0FEC&pg=PA1|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-1011-9|page=17|year=2005}}</ref> He managed to group a large number of fringe and marginalized princes discontented with the prospect of the succession being passed among the Sudairi brothers one after the other.

Retrieved 29 March 2008.</ref> Crown Prince Abdullah acted as ''de facto'' [[regent]] of Saudi Arabia.

On 4 June 2000, the Al Saud Family Council was established by Crown Prince Abdullah to discuss some private issues, including the business activities of House of Saud members and the marriages of princesses to nonroyals.<ref name="washingtoninstitute.org"/> In May 2001 Crown Prince Abdullah did not accept an invitation to visit [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] due to [[US]] support for [[Israel]] in the [[Second Intifada]]. He also appeared more eager than King Fahd to cut government spending and open Saudi Arabia up economically. He pushed for Saudi membership of the [[World Trade Organization]], surprising some.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Daniel L. Byman|title=The Implications of Leadership Change in the Arab World|journal=Political Science Quarterly|date=Spring 2005|volume=120|issue=1|pages=59–83|doi=10.1002/j.1538-165x.2005.tb00538.x|jstor=20202473}}</ref>

In August 2001, he ordered then Saudi Ambassador to the US, [[Bandar bin Sultan]], to return to Washington. This reportedly occurred after Crown Prince Abdullah witnessed brutality inflicted by an Israeli soldier upon a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] woman.<ref name=ban>{{cite news|author=Elsa Walsh|title=The prince |url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/_pvw37F68B18/files/PDF/03-ST-Bandar-0324-NewYorker.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2012 |work=The New Yorker|date=24 March 2003|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126025250/http://www.saudiembassy.net/_pvw37F68B18/files/PDF/03-ST-Bandar-0324-NewYorker.pdf|archivedate=26 January 2012}}</ref> Later, he also condemned Israel for attacking families of suspects.<ref name=ban/>

In 2002, he developed the [[Arab Peace Initiative]], commonly referred to as the "Abdullah plan", to achieve a mutually agreed-on resolution of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].<ref name=bruce10>{{cite journal|author=Bruce Maddy-Weitzman|title=Arabs vs. the Abdullah Plan|journal=The Middle East Quarterly|date=Summer 2010|pages=3–12|url=http://www.meforum.org/2729/arabs-vs-abdullah-plan}}</ref> The initiative was adopted at the [[Arab League]]'s Beirut summit in March 2002.<ref name=bruce10/>

On the second anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], Crown Prince Abdullah wrote a letter to US President [[George W. Bush]], which ended with the following words:

<blockquote>
"God Almighty, in His wisdom, tests the faithful by allowing such calamities to happen. But He, in His mercy, also provides us with the will and determination, generated by faith, to enable us to transform such tragedies into great achievements, and crises that seem debilitating are transformed into opportunities for the advancement of humanity. I only hope that, with your cooperation and leadership, a new world will emerge out of the rubble of the World Trade Center: a world that is blessed by the virtues of freedom, peace, prosperity and harmony."<ref>{{cite web|title=Crown Prince sends message to America|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/archive/2002/press/page18.aspx|work=Saudi Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2013|location=Jeddah|format=Press release|date=10 September 2002}}</ref></blockquote>

By late 2003, after the Saudi Arabian branch of [[al-Qaeda]] carried out a series of bombings that threatened to destabilize the country, Crown Prince Abdullah, together with other decision-making elites began to deal with political concerns. As Toby Jones wrote in ''Middle East Report'': <blockquote>One of such moves was his project to promote more tolerance for religious diversity and rein in the forces of politico-religious extremism in the kingdom, leading to the establishment of [[King Abdulaziz Center For National Dialogue|National Dialogue]]. In the summer of 2003, Abdullah threw his considerable weight behind the creation of a national dialogue that brought leading religious figures together, including a highly publicized meeting attended by the kingdom's preeminent Shi'i scholar Hasan al-Saffar, as well as a group of [[Sunni]] clerics that had previously expressed their loathing for the Shi'i minority.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Toby Jones|title=Saudi Arabia's not so New Anti-Shi'ism|journal=Middle East Report|year=2007|volume=242|issue=242|pages=29–32|jstor=25164776}}</ref></blockquote>

==King of Saudi Arabia==
[[File:Royal Standard of Saudi Arabia.svg|thumb|Royal Standard of the King]]
Abdullah succeeded to the throne upon the death of his half-brother King [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]]. He was formally enthroned on 2 August 2005.

===Domestic affairs===
King Abdullah's administration attempted reforms in different fields.

In 2005, King Abdullah implemented a government scholarship program to send young Saudi men and women abroad for undergraduate and postgraduate studies in different universities around the world. The program offered funds for tuition and living expenses up to four years. It is estimated that more than 70,000 young Saudis studied abroad in more than 25 countries, with the United States, [[England]], and [[Australia]] as top three destinations aimed for by the students. There are more than 22,000 Saudi students studying in the United States, exceeding pre-9/11 levels. Public health engagement included [[breast cancer]] awareness and [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] cooperation to set up an advanced epidemic screening network to protect 2010's three million [[Hajj]] pilgrims.<ref name="cablegate.wikileaks.org"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saudi-arabia-sending-seventh-most-students-to-united-states-108449569.html|title=Saudi Arabia Sending Seventh Most Students to United States|location=Saudi Arabia, District of Columbia|work=PR Newswire|date=16 November 2010|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref>

In 2005 King Abdullah declared that the [[Saudi National Day|national day]] of the country, 23 September, would be a public holiday in an attempt to reduce the influence of religious figures and some of the social restrictions.<ref name="eman">{{cite journal|author=Eman Alhussein|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep21640.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search%2Fcontrol&refreqid=search%3A75fd7d9209568cbb17bd363039213727|title=Saudi First: How Hyper-Nationalism is Transforming Saudi Arabia|journal=European Council on Foreign Relations|date=1 June 2019}}</ref> It was criticized by the religious figures who argued that such celebration was not part of Islam.<ref name="eman"/>

King Abdullah implemented many reform measures. He re-shuffled the ministry of education's leadership in February 2009 by bringing in his pro-reform son-in-law, [[Faisal bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Saud|Faisal bin Abdullah]], as the new minister. He also appointed [[Nora al-Fayez|Nora Al Fayez]], a U.S.-educated former teacher, as deputy education minister in charge of a new department for female students.<ref>{{cite news|author=Julian Borger|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/16/saudi-cabinet-woman-minister|title=Woman Saudi Education Minister|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 February 2009|accessdate=23 October 2011|location=London}}</ref>

He brought about a top-to-bottom restructuring of the country's courts to introduce, among other things, review of judicial decisions and more professional training for Shari'a judges. He developed a new investment promotion agency to overhaul the once-convoluted process of starting a business in Saudi Arabia and created a regulatory body for capital markets. He also promoted the construction of the [[King Abdullah University for Science and Technology]] (the country's new flagship and controversially co-ed institution for advanced scientific research). King Abdullah invested in educating the workforce for future jobs. The Saudi government also encouraged the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors in which the Kingdom had a comparative advantage, including mining, solar energy, and religious tourism. The Kingdom's 2010 budget reflected these priorities—about 25 percent was devoted to education alone—and amounts to a significant economic stimulus package.<ref name="cablegate.wikileaks.org">[https://web.archive.org/web/20101201210210/http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2010/02/10RIYADH178.html Screensetter for Clinton's visit] ''Wikileaks'', 2010</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Ursula Lindsey|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Saudi-Arabias-Education/124771/|title=Saudi Arabia's Education Reforms Emphasize Training for Jobs|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=3 October 2010}}</ref>

In August 2010, King Abdullah decreed that only officially approved religious scholars associated with the [[Senior Council of Ulema]] would be allowed to issue [[fatwa]]s. Similar decrees since 2005 were previously seldom enforced. Individual fatwas relating to personal matters were exempt from the royal decree. The decree also instructed the Grand Mufti to identify eligible scholars.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Boucek |url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&article=41824 |title=Saudi Fatwa Restrictions|work=Carnegie Endowment|date=23 October 2010|accessdate=23 October 2011|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607175656/http://www.carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&article=41824 |archivedate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

In light of the [[Arab Spring]], Abdullah laid down a $37 billion (€32.8 billion) programme of new spending including new jobless benefits, education and housing subsidies, debt write-offs, and a new sports channel. There was also a pledge to spend a total of $400 billion by the end of 2014 to improve education, health care and the kingdom's infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/oilprices/8344421/Saudi-ruler-offers-36bn-to-stave-off-uprising-amid-warning-oil-price-could-double.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Ambrose Evans-Pritchard|title=Saudi ruler offers $36bn to stave off uprising amid warning oil price could double|date=24 February 2011}}</ref> However, Saudi police arrested 100 Shiite protesters who complained of government discrimination.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jason Benham|title=Saudi arrests 100 Shi'ite protesters – rights group|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/23/oukwd-uk-saudi-arrests-idAFTRE72M24G20110323|accessdate=16 January 2013|work=Reuters|date=23 March 2011}}</ref> Later during the [[2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests]], in September 2011, the King announced [[Women's suffrage#Saudi Arabia|women's right to vote]] in the [[2015 Saudi Arabian municipal elections|2015 municipal council elections]], a first significant reform step in the country since the protests.

In January 2012, King Abdullah dismissed the head of Saudi Arabia's powerful religious police, replacing him with a more moderate cleric, state news agency SPA reported, without giving reasons. Abdullatif Abdel Aziz al-Sheikh was named, in place of Sheikh Abdulaziz al Humain, to head the [[Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice]]. King Abdullah had appointed Humain in 2009 to head the "mutaween," which ensures the strict application of the country's ultra-conservative version of Islam, as a step towards reforming it. Humain hired consultants to restructure the organisation, met local human rights groups and consulted professional image-builders in a broad public relations campaign. Under his leadership the commission also investigated and punished some "out-of-control" officers for misbehaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hilmxu5fp7aQrM3MMylBtpkx_sKw?docId=CNG.99b68c356d880250606ce3d7cc9eb233.ac1|title=Saudi king dismisses religious police head|work=Google News|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>

In July 2012, Saudi Arabia announced that it would allow its women athletes to compete in the Olympics for the first time and that the country's Olympic Committee would "oversee participation of women athletes who can qualify". The decision ended speculation that the entire Saudi team might have been disqualified on grounds of gender discrimination. The public participation of women in sport was still fiercely opposed by many Saudi religious conservatives. There had been almost no public tradition of women participating in sport in the country. Saudi officials said that, if successful in qualifying, female competitors would be dressed "to preserve their dignity".<ref>{{cite news|author=Frank Gardner|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18571193|title=London 2012 Olympics: Saudis allow women to compete|work=BBC|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> On 11 January 2013, King Abdullah appointed thirty women to the [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Consultative Assembly]] or ''Shura'' Council and modified the related law to mandate that no less than 20 percent of 150 members would be women.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia's Timid Flirtation With Women's Rights|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/01/saudi-arabias-timid-flirtation-with-womens-rights/267245/|accessdate=16 January 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=16 January 2013}}</ref>

In August 2013, the Saudi cabinet, for the first time, approved a law making domestic violence a criminal offence.

In November 2007, King Abdullah visited [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]], being first Saudi monarch to do so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7080327.stm|title=Historic Saudi visit to Vatican|work=BBC News|date=6 November 2007|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=infmuslims>{{cite journal|title=The 500 Most Influential Muslims|journal=Center Muslim-Christian Understanding|year=2009|url=http://www.yale.edu/worldfellows/fellows/documents/500MostInfluentialMuslims.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> In March 2008, he called for a "brotherly and sincere dialogue between believers from all religions".<ref>[http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentID=200803261534 The King’s call for interfaith dialogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114111142/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentID=200803261534|date=14 January 2009}}, ''Saudi Gazette''.</ref>

He had never previously made overtures for dialogue with eastern religious leaders, such as [[Hindus]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The Mecca conference discussed a paper on dialogue with monotheists—highlighting the monotheistic religions of southeast Asia, including [[Sikhism]]—in the third axis of the fourth meeting, titled "With Whom We Talk," presented by Sheikh Badrul Hasan Al Qasimi. The session was chaired by Ezz Eddin Ibrahim, cultural adviser to the president of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The session also discussed a paper presented on coordination among Islamic institutions on Dialogue by Abdullah bin Omar Nassif, Secretary General of the World Islamic Council for Preaching and Relief and a paper on dialogue with divine messages, presented by Professor Mohammad Sammak—Secretary General of the Islamic Spiritual Summit in Lebanon.

In November 2008, he and his government arranged discussion at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to "promote dialogue among civilizations, cultures and peoples, as well as activities related to a culture of peace" and calling for "concrete action at the global, regional and subregional levels."<ref name="if-obs">Rebecca Tobias, [http://theinterfaithobserver.org/journal-articles/2014/1/15/when-a-king-and-a-pope-sit-down-to-talk-religion.html When a King and a Pope Sit Down to Talk Religion], 15 January 2014, ''The Interfaith Observer'' Retrieved 22 January 2015.</ref> It brought together Muslim and non-Muslim nations to eradicate preconceptions as to Islam and terrorism, with world leaders—including former [[UK]] Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]], US President [[George W.

===Arab common market===
King Abdullah called for the establishment of an Arab common market in January 2011. Saudi foreign minister, [[Saud bin Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz|Saud bin Faisal]], stated that the Arab Customs Union would be ready by 2015, and that by 2017 the common market would also be in place. There have been intensive efforts to link Arab countries with a railway system and an electricity power grid. Work on the power grid project has started in some Arab countries.<ref name="AN01">[http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article238363.ece "No Politics for Ben Ali in Kingdom"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121172720/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article238363.ece|date=21 January 2011}}, ''Arab News'', 19 January 2011.</ref>

===United States===
[[File:Bush-abdullah1.jpg|thumb|Abdullah visits the United States in April 2005]]
King Abdullah had long been pro-American and a longtime close ally of the United States. In October 1976, as Prince Abdullah was being trained for greater responsibility in Riyadh, he was sent to the United States to meet with [[President Gerald Ford]]. He again traveled to the United States as Crown Prince in October 1987, meeting Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]]. In September 1998, Crown Prince Abdullah made a [[state visit]] to the United States to meet in [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] with [[President Bill Clinton]]. In September 2000, he attended [[millennium]] celebrations at the United Nations in New York City. In April 2002, Crown Prince Abdullah made a state visit to the United States with [[President George W. Bush]] and he returned again in April 2005 with Bush. In April 2009, at a summit for world leaders [[President Barack Obama]] met with King Abdullah, while in June 2009 he hosted President Obama in Saudi Arabia. In turn, Obama hosted the King at the [[White House]] in the same month.

King Abdullah showed great support for Obama's presidency. "Thank God for bringing Obama to the presidency", he said, adding that Obama's election created "great hope" in the Muslim world.<ref name="nymag.com">{{cite web|author=Mike Vilensky|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/11/wikileaks_round-up.html|title=WikiLeaks: Saudi King Abdullah Encouraged U.S. to Attack Iran; Chinese Politburo Hacked into Google – Daily Intel|work=Nymag.com|date=20 April 2008|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> He stated, "We (the US and Saudi Arabia) spilled blood together" in Kuwait and Iraq, that Saudi Arabia valued this tremendously and that friendship could be a difficult issue that requires work, but that the United States and Saudi Arabia had done it for 70 years over three generations.

===Iraq===
The [[George W.

In September 2014, following the spread of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), he issued a statement, "From the cradle of revelation and the birthplace of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], I call on leaders and scholars of the Islamic nation to carry out their duty towards God Almighty, and to stand in the face of those trying to hijack Islam and present it to the world as a religion of extremism, hatred, and terrorism, and to speak the word of truth, and not fear anybody.

===Iran===
[[File:ObamaKing Abdullah.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barack Obama]] meets with King Abdullah]]
In 2006, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei had sent his adviser [[Ali Akbar Velayati]] with a letter asking for King Abdullah's agreement to establish a formal back channel of communication between the two leaders. Abdullah said he had agreed, and the channel was established, with Velayati and Saud Al Faisal as the points of contact. In the ensuing years, the King noted, the channel had never been used.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/>

In April 2008, according to a US cable released by [[WikiLeaks]], King Abdullah had told the US Ambassador to Iraq, [[Ryan Crocker]], and General [[David Petraeus]] to "cut off the head of the snake". Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to Washington, [[Adel al-Jubeir]], "recalled the King's frequent exhortations to the US to attack Iran" and to put an end to that country's [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202191033/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ghmoS0bJ_XaFC5Y9NWUF1I87_N_g?docId=CNG.050a9c8c5fd91a430d7e435fcc325b90.861 Saudi King urged US to attack Iran], 28 November 2010, Agence France-Presse, copy at Internet Archive Retrieved 23 October 2011.</ref> King Abdullah asserted that Iran was trying to set up [[Hezbollah]]-like organizations in African countries, observing that the Iranians didn't think they were doing anything wrong and didn't recognize their mistakes. He said that the Iranians "launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world". The King described his conversation with Iranian foreign minister [[Manouchehr Mottaki|Mottaki]] as "a heated exchange, frankly discussing Iran's interference in Arab affairs". When challenged by the King on Iranian meddling in [[Hamas]] affairs, Mottaki apparently protested that "these are Muslims". "No, Arabs", countered the King. "You as Persians have no business meddling in Arab matters". King Abdullah said he would favor [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Rafsanjani]] in an Iranian election.<ref name="nymag.com"/><ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/198178|location=London|work=The Guardian|title=US embassy cables: Saudi king's advice for Barack Obama|date=28 November 2010}}</ref>

He told General Jones that Iranian internal turmoil presented an opportunity to weaken the regime—which he encouraged—but he also urged that this be done covertly, stressing that public statements in support of the reformers were counterproductive. The King assessed that sanctions could help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and sustained.<ref name="cablegate.wikileaks.org"/>

===Bahrain===
Saudi Arabia, by the endorsement of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]], sent 1,200 troops to [[Bahrain]] to protect industrial facilities, resulting in strained relations with the United States. The military personnel were part of the [[Peninsula Shield Force]], which is stationed in Saudi Arabia, but not affiliated to one country alone.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113151296156152.html|title=Bahrain imposes state of emergency|work=Al Jazeera|date=15 March 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref>Doward, Jamie, and Philippa Stewart, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/28/uk-training-saudi-troops "UK Training Saudi Forces Used to Crush Arab Spring"] ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2011.</ref>

===Guantánamo Bay===
In December 2010, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked diplomatic cables]] published by [[WikiLeaks]] revealed that King Abdullah wanted all released detainees from the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] to be tracked using an implanted microchip, in a way similar to race horses. The King made the private suggestion during a meeting in Riyadh in March 2009 with [[White House]] counterterrorism adviser, [[John O. Brennan]]. Brennan replied that "horses don't have good lawyers" and that such a proposal would "face legal hurdles" in the United States.

===China===
Since King Abdullah's visit to Beijing in January 2006, Saudi-Chinese relations have focused predominantly on energy and trade. The king's visit was the first by a Saudi head of state to China since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/10/content_10796711.htm|title=Chinese president arrives in Riyadh at start of "trip of friendship, cooperation"_English_Xinhua|newspaper=Xinhuanet|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China would soon be Saudi Arabia's largest importer. Saudi Arabia also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion [[Fujian]] refinery. Based on a [[WikiLeaks]] cable, the King told the Chinese that it was willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to develop nuclear weapons.<ref name="cablegate.wikileaks.org"/>

In late March 2011, King Abdullah sent [[Bandar bin Sultan|Bandar]], Secretary General of the [[National Security Council (Saudi Arabia)|National Security Council]], to China to gain its support regarding Saudi Arabia's attitude towards the Arab Spring. In turn, lucrative arms contracts were secretly offered to China by the Kingdom. Furthermore, King Abdullah believed that China as well as [[India]] were the future markets for Saudi energy.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bruce Riedel|title=Brezhnev in the Hejaz|url=http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf|date=September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115051640/http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf|archive-date=15 November 2013|volume=115|pages=27–32|journal=The National Interest}}</ref>

In December 2011, King Abdullah called on leaders of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] to strengthen their alliance into a united "single entity" as they confront threats to national security. "I ask you today to move from a stage of cooperation to a stage of union in a single entity", King Abdullah said at the opening session of a GCC meeting in Riyadh in comments aired on Saudi state television. "No doubt, you all know we are targeted in our security and stability".<ref>{{cite news|author=Glen Carey|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-19/saudi-king-abdullah-calls-for-a-closer-arab-gulf-union-1-.html|title=Saudi King Abdullah Calls for a Closer Arab Gulf Union|work=Bloomberg L.P.|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>

===Criticism as king===
On 16 February 2003, [[Parade (magazine)|''Parade'' magazine]]'s [[David Wallechinsky]] rated King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah as the second worst dictators in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/dictators/2008/profiles/king-abdullah.html|title=The World's 10 Worst Dictators: King Abdullah|work=Parade|accessdate=5 July 2013|date=4 February 2008}}</ref> <!--

In a slight rebuff to accusations of human rights violations, Saudi inmates of [[Najran Province]] sent the King well-wishes from jail and wished him a speedy recovery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110108-saudi-inmates-send-king-wishes-jail|title=Saudi inmates send king wishes from jail|work=France 24|date=8 January 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025200546/http://www.france24.com/en/20110108-saudi-inmates-send-king-wishes-jail|archivedate=25 October 2011}}</ref>

King Abdullah has also been criticized for his policies on religious freedom and the Saudi government allegedly has arrested [[Shiite]] pilgrims on the [[Hajj]].<ref name="Asia's 5 Worst Dictators"/> On 24 January 2007, [[Human Rights Watch]] sent an open letter to King Abdullah asking him to cease religious persecution of the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] faith in Saudi Arabia. Two letters were sent in November 2006 and February 2007 asking him to remove the travel ban on critics of the Saudi government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/02/09/saudia15305.htm|title=Letter to King Abdullah|work=HRW|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> Human Rights Watch has not yet indicated whether they have received any response to these letters.

On 30 October 2007, during a state visit to the UK, King Abdullah was accused by protestors of being a "murderer" and a "torturer". Concerns were raised about the treatment of women and homosexuals by the Saudi kingdom and over alleged bribes involving arms deals between Saudi Arabia and the UK.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/30/uk.saudi/ Saudi king's royal meet draws fire], ''CNN'', 31 October 2007.

==Succession to the throne==
{{Further|Succession to the Saudi Arabian throne}}
King Abdullah's [[heir apparent]] was his half-brother [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz|Crown Prince Sultan]] until the latter's death on 22 October 2011. The title of Crown Prince then passed to Prince Sultan's full-brother, [[Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Nayef]], until his death in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], on 16 June 2012, while undergoing medical tests for an undisclosed ailment. His third heir apparent was his half-brother [[Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Salman]], who was named as Crown Prince on 18 June 2012,<ref name=tnyt1812>{{cite news|author=Neil MacFarquhar|title=Defense Minister New Heir to Throne in Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-appoints-prince-salman-as-crown-prince.html|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 June 2012}}</ref> and would succeed him in 2015.

In 2006, Abdullah set up the [[Allegiance Council]], a body that is composed of the sons and grandsons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz, to vote by a secret ballot to choose future kings and crown princes. The council's mandate was not to have started until after the reigns of both King Abdullah and late Prince Sultan were over. It was not clear what was to happen when Prince Sultan died before the end of Abdullah's reign, leaving a question as to whether the council would vote for a new crown prince, or whether Prince Nayef would automatically fill that position. Despite such concerns, Prince Nayef was appointed Crown Prince on 27 October 2011 after consultation with the Allegiance Council by Abdullah.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101121/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_saudi_king_hospitalized;_ylt=AluqiTkBwGFdWRZE3_3oGf8LewgF;_ylu=X3oDMTMxc29laW51BGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTAxMTIxL21sX3NhdWRpX2tpbmdfaG9zcGl0YWxpemVkBHBvcwMxOARzZWMDeW5fcGFnaW5hdGVfc3VtbWFyeV9saXN0BHNsawNhZ2Vkc2F1ZGlydWw- Aged Saudi ruler to fly to US over blood clot] ''AP'' 21 November 2010</ref>

King Abdullah is credited with building up the once largely ceremonial unit into a modern 260,000-strong force that is a counterweight to the army. The Guard, which was Abdullah's original power base, protects the royal family. This was suggested as an apparent sign that the elderly monarch was beginning to lessen some of his duties.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/17/AR2010111704919.html|title=Saudi king transfers National Guard duties to son|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=23 October 2011}}{{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

==Various positions==
King Abdullah was Commander of the [[Saudi National Guard]] from 1963 to 2010. He was Chairman of the Saudi Supreme Economic Council until 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clasmann|first=Anne-Beatrice|title=Discreetly, Saudis speculate about the throne succession|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/features/article_1514417.php/Discreetly-Saudis-speculate-about-the-throne-succession-Feature|accessdate=29 April 2012|work=M&C News|date=20 November 2009}}</ref>

===Illness and death===
The King had curtailed his activities from June 2010 with no clear explanation. Diplomats said there had been uncertainty about the extent of his health problems since Abdullah canceled a visit to France.{{When|date=September 2012}} In a television appearance in which he was seen to use a cane, King Abdullah said he was in good health but had something "bothering" him. In a visit by US diplomats to Saudi Arabia in April 2014 the Saudi King was seen connected to breathing tubes during talks, indicating increasing health problems.

From 2010 to 2012 King Abdullah had four back surgeries.<ref name=wp171112>{{cite news|title=Saudi King Abdullah has back surgery described as successful|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-king-abdullah-has-back-surgery-described-as-successful/2012/11/17/11d8c1ce-30c1-11e2-af17-67abba0676e2_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117203654/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-king-abdullah-has-back-surgery-described-as-successful/2012/11/17/11d8c1ce-30c1-11e2-af17-67abba0676e2_story.html|archive-date=17 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=17 November 2012|agency=AP|location=Riyadh|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first two of the surgeries were in New York, one in 2010 for a slipped disk and a blood clot pressing on nerves in his back and a second to stabilize vertebrae in 2011.<ref name=wp171112/> The third one was in Riyadh in 2011. And the last one was also in Riyadh on 17 November 2012.<ref name=wp171112/>

In November 2010, his back problems came to light in the media. He had an "accumulation of blood" around the spinal cord. He suffered from a herniated disc and was told to rest by doctors. To maintain the Kingdom's stability, Crown Prince Sultan returned from Morocco during the King's absence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saudi prince returns as king readies for US treatment|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11809963|accessdate=18 August 2013|work=BBC|date=22 November 2010}}</ref> The King was admitted to [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]] after a blood clot complicated a slipped disc and underwent successful back surgery.
