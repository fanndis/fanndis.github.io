'''Andrew Thomas Weil''' ({{IPAc-en|w|aɪ|l}}, born June 8, 1942) is an American [[celebrity doctor]] who advocates for [[alternative medicine]].<ref name=LAT2010>{{cite news|last1=Jameson|first1=Marni|title=The cult of celebrity doctors|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/14/health/la-he-celeb-docs-20100614|work=Los Angeles Times|date=14 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=CSPItrustintocash/><ref name=GumpertBloom06/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Levinovitz|first1=Alan|title=The Problem With David Perlmutter, the ''Grain Brain'' Doctor|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/problem-with-the-grain-brain-doctor.html|work=New York Magazine|date=June 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Pela |first1=Robert|title=The Path to Weilness|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200311/the-path-weilness|work=Psychology Today|date=November 1, 2013}}</ref>

Weil became interested in the ideas and practices of [[alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]], and went on to play a seminal role in codifying and establishing the emerging field of [[integrative medicine]], which aims to combine [[alternative medicine]], conventional [[evidence-based medicine]], and other practices into a higher-order "system of systems" to address human healing via action in multiple "dimensions" (biological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual). 

In 1994, Weil founded and has since directed the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, today the [Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine https://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/about/index.html] at the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson. As of 2015, Weil serves as an academician at the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]], where he is Lovell-Jones Professor of Integrative Rheumatology, Clinical Professor of Medicine, and Professor of Public Health. 

He served as founding editor of a seminal [[Oxford University Press|OUP]] series offering medical best-practice methods alongside yet-to-be-proven ones, the ''Weil Integrative Medicine Library'' (2009-2015), which includes specialty volumes in oncology, cardiology, rheumatology, pediatrics, psychology, and other specialties.

Weil has given extensive efforts to popular communication encouraging patients to incorporate [[Alternative medicine|alternative therapies]]—use of nutritional supplements, [[meditation]] and "[[Supernatural|spiritual]]" strategies, etc.—into [[evidence-based medicine|conventional]] treatment plans. His many broad, health-related books include ''Spontaneous Healing'' (1995), ''Eight Weeks to Optimum Health'' (1997), ''Eating Well for Optimum Health'' (2000), ''The Healthy Kitchen'' (2002, with chef Rosie Daley), and ''Healthy Aging'' (2005), several of which have appeared on recognized best seller lists. Weil blogs for ''The Huffington Post,'' and occasionally writes for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (and was recognized in a global 100 list of influential people by them in 2005).

In addition to his publisher-offered print, electronic, and audio products, Weil has founded several commercial enterprises (e.g., DrWeill.com and drweilproducts.com) to offer information, consulting services, and various products; in this regard, the "Dr. Andrew Weil" name represents both the individual, and a clear commercial brand. Services through Weil's businesses include vitamin advice and subscription websites paralleling his popular books. Products offered include vitamins, personal hygiene and skin care items, orthotics and footwear, medical devices, food preparation equipment, and a food product line. Registered trademarks of the brand include the ''Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins'' skin care/cosmetic and ''Dr. Andrew Weil Integrative Footwear'' lines.

Weil has been criticized for specific cases where he has appeared to reject aspects of [[evidence-based medicine]], or promote unverified beliefs; and critiques by scientific watchdog organizations for his failing to disclaim in cases of his writings that have had connections to his own commercial interests, as well as for his and his peers downplaying social, structural, and environmental factors that contribute to the etiology of disease in the [[First World|West]], and for the clear component of entrepreneurialism associated with his establishing his brand of health care services and products. He refused to be interviewed by ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' for their January 19, 2016 episode about health supplements.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/supplements-and-safety/ | title=Supplements and Safety}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
===Early years===
Andrew Thomas Weil was born in [[Philadelphia]] on June 8, 1942,<ref name=EB15/> the only child of parents who operated a [[millinery]] store,<ref name=EB15/> in a family that was Reform Jewish.<ref>[https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/books/970824weil.html By Larissa Macfarquhar, Andrew Weil, Shaman, M.D., New York Times August 24, 1997]</ref> He graduated from high school in 1959 and was awarded a scholarship from the [[American Association for the United Nations]],<ref name=EB15/> giving him the opportunity go abroad for a year, living with families in India, Thailand, and Greece.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} From this experience he became convinced that in many ways American culture and science was insular and unaware of non-American practices. He began hearing that [[mescaline]] enhanced creativity and produced visionary experiences, and finding little information on the subject, he read ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]].{{when|date=November 2015}}<ref name=lattin/>{{rp|24f}}

===Undergraduate period===
Weil entered [[Harvard University]] in 1960, majoring in biology with a concentration in [[ethnobotany]].<ref name=EB15/> He had an early curiosity regarding [[psychoactive drug]]s, and in that period, met Harvard psychologists [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Richard Alpert]], and separately engaged in organized experimentation with mescaline (along with fellow undergraduate [[Ronald H.

===Medical training===
Weil entered [[Harvard Medical School]], "not with the intention of becoming a physician but rather simply to obtain a medical education."<ref name=EB15/> He received a medical degree in 1968,<ref name=Baer03/><ref name=Baer04/><ref name=people>{{cite journal|last1=Lasswell|first1=Mark|title=Mind Opener|journal=People|date=25 September 1995|volume=45|issue=13|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20101670,00.html|access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref> although "the Harvard faculty… threatened to withhold it because of a controversial marijuana study Weil had helped conduct" in his final year.<ref name=EB15/> Weil moved to [[San Francisco]] and completed a one-year medical internship at [[UCSF Medical Center|Mount Zion Hospital]] in 1968–69.<ref name=Baer03/><ref name=Baer04/><ref name="Quackwatch10March2002">{{cite web|last1=Relman|first1=Arnold|author-link=Arnold Relman|title=A Trip to Stonesville: Some Notes on Andrew Weil, M.D.|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/weil.html|website=Quackwatch|access-date=8 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124012615/http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/weil.html|archive-date=24 January 2017|date=8 March 2002}}</ref> While there, volunteered at the [[Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Weil went on to complete one year of a two-year program at NIH, resigning due to "official opposition to his work with marijuana."<ref name=Quackwatch10March2002/>

==Career==
Following his residency, Weil took a position with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) that lasted approximately one year, to pursue his interests in research on marijuana and other drugs;<ref name=Baer03/><ref name=Baer04/> during this time he may have received formal institutional permission to acquire marijuana for the research.<ref name=lattin>{{cite book|last1=Lattin|first1=Don|title=The Harvard Psychedelic Club|url=https://archive.org/details/harvardpsychedel00latt|url-access=registration|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York, NY, USA |isbn=9780061655944|edition=Paperback}}</ref>{{rp|145f}}

Weil is reported to have experienced opposition to this line of inquiry at the NIMH, to have departed to his rural northern Virginia home (1971-1972), and to have begun his practices of vegetarianism, yoga, and meditation, and work on writing ''The Natural Mind'' (1972).<ref name=Baer03/><ref name=Baer04/> At the same time, Weil began an affiliation with the Harvard Botanical Museum that would span from 1971 to 1984, where his work included duties as a research associate investigating "the properties of medicinal and psychoactive plants."<ref name=Baer03/><ref name=Baer04/> His interests led him to explore the healing systems of indigenous people, and with this aim, Weil traveled throughout [[South America]] and other parts of the world, "collecting information about medicinal plants and healing," from 1971 to 1975, as a fellow for the [[Institute of Current World Affairs]].<ref name=Baer03/><ref name=Baer04/><ref>{{cite web| author = ICWA | year = 2015 | title = Past Fellows: Andrew T.

In 1994, Weil founded the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine at the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], where he serves as its director.<ref name=OUPbio>{{cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/integrative-oncology-9780199329724?lang=en&cc=us#|title=Integrative Oncology|date=2014-09-03|work=oup.com|access-date=21 November 2015|isbn=9780199329724|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Weil Integrative Medicine Library}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2015}}

Andrew Weil is the founder of True Food Kitchen, a restaurant chain serving meals on the premise that food should make you feel better. There are currently 32 restaurants in the chain.

==View of conventional medicine==
[[Evidence-based medicine]] is a stated central component of the higher-order "system of systems" Weil envisions [[integrative medicine]] to be.<ref name=BellWeil02/> It is clear that in both scholarly/academic and popular settings, Weil's statements suggest practices from [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]] as being something to add to conventional medical treatment plans.<ref name=BellWeil02/><ref name="publishersweekly1"/> However, Weil is also on record speaking disparagingly of conventional, evidence-based medicine, both in academic and popular contexts. For instance, he is quoted as having said to a group commencing after a month-long training program in integrative medicine at the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine that "that [[evidence-based medicine]], at its worst, 'is exactly analogous to religious fundamentalism'" (though the source leaves unclear whether any specific aspect of evidence-based medicine was given).<ref name=Econ15/>

==Influences and philosophy==
Weil acknowledges many experiences and individuals that have influenced his philosophical and spiritual ideas, and the techniques he considers valid in his approach to [[medicine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Weil has been open about his own history of experimental and [[recreational drug use]], including experiences with [[narcotic]]s and [[Psychoactive drug|mind-altering substances]].<ref name=No_Bad_Drugs>{{cite journal|url=http://www.doitnow.org/pages/weil.html|author1=Jim Parker|author2=Christina Dye|title=No Bad Drugs: Interview with Dr. Andrew Weil|publisher=Newservice|date=May–June 1983Z|pages=22–31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://www.doitnow.org/pages/weil.html|archive-date=March 3, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Among the individuals who strongly influenced his personal and professional life is the late [[osteopath]] [[Robert C.

Regarding treatment strategies, their side effects, and their efficacy, Weil advocates for the use of whole plants as a less problematic approach in comparison to synthetic pharmaceuticals.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  In addition, Weil is an advocate of incorporating specific [[medicinal mushrooms]]{{clarify|date=November 2015}} into one's daily diet.{{dubious|date=November 2015}}{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Academic works===
As of 2015, Weil was serving as series editor of an academic imprint from Oxford University Press called the ''Weil Integrative Medicine Library,'' volumes for clinicians in more than 10 medical specialties, including oncology, cardiology, rheumatology, pediatrics, and psychology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/w/weil-integrative-medicine-library-iml/?cc=us&lang=en&|title=Weil Integrative Medicine Library|work=oup.com|access-date=21 November 2015}}</ref> Weil co-edited the first volume, ''Integrative Oncology,'' with [[Donald Abrams]], which appeared in 2009.<ref name="OUPbio"/> Academic and scholarly reviews of the series and individual volumes were lacking as of 2015—in almost all cases, the publisher's "Reviews and Awards" tabs lack society or other published reviews (apart from [[Brandon–Hill list|Doody's]]).<ref>E.g., for ''Integrative Cardiology,'' note absent tab at [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/integrative-cardiology-9780195383461?lang=en&cc=us], and for ''Integrative Dermatology,'' note sole appearance of Doody's at [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/integrative-dermatology-9780199907922?lang=en&cc=us#]</ref> A cancer society review of the second edition of the series' ''Integrative Oncology'' volume, the first volume to have been published, describes the field as "an exciting new discipline" and the book as offering "best-practice methods to prevent cancer and support those affected by it on all levels: body, mind, and spirit" and as being comprehensive, and offering "meticulous, well-written chapters on proven and yet-to-be-proven methods for enhancing cancer care with integrative oncology."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Plana, Ronald | date=  October 15, 2014 | title = Integrative Oncology: Mind, Body, and More [Bookmark; Title: Integrative Oncology (Second Edition), Editors: Donald I.

-->

===Medical===
Medical professionals in particular have criticized Weil for promoting treatment claims and [[alternative medicine]] practices described as unverified or inefficacious, or for otherwise rejecting aspects of [[evidence-based medicine]]. Weil's rejection of some aspects of [[evidence-based medicine]] and his promotion of [[alternative medicine]] practices that are not verifiably efficacious were criticized in a 1998 ''New Republic'' piece by [[Arnold S. Relman]], emeritus editor-in-chief of [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] and emeritus professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.<ref name=Relman>{{cite journal | author=Relman, Arnold S. |author-link=Arnold S. Relman | date = December 14, 1998 | journal= The New Republic | url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118224/arnold-relman-reviews-andrew-weil-alternative-medicine |title=A Trip to Stonesville: Andrew Weil, the boom in alternative medicine, and the retreat from science }}</ref> The late [[Barry Beyerstein]] of [[Simon Fraser University]], writing in the journal ''Academic Medicine'' in 2001, criticized Weil and various aspects of complementary and alternative medicine, asserting that it held a "magical world-view"; he continued, saying,{{quote|
On advocating emotional criteria for truth over criteria based on empirical data and logic, New Age medical gurus such as Andrew Weil… have convinced many that 'anything goes'… By denigrating science, these detractors have enlarged the potential following for magical and pseudoscientific health products.<ref name=Bayerstein>{{cite journal|author=Beyerstein, B. L. |s2cid=41527148 |title=Alternative Medicine and Common Errors of Reasoning |journal=[[Academic Medicine (journal)|Academic Medicine]] |volume=76 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=230–237 |pmid=11242572 |doi=10.1097/00001888-200103000-00009 }}</ref>}}In 2003, [[Steven Knope]], author of ''The Body/Mind Connection'' (2000),{{Full citation needed|date=November 2015}} a physician trained at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]], and former Chair of the Department of Medicine in the Tucson, Arizona, Carondelet system, criticized Weil in a televised discussion for what he considered irresponsible advocacy of untested treatments.<ref>{{ cite episode |last=Buckmaster |first=Bill (host) | year = 2003 | series = Arizona Illustrated | title = [A discussion with Drs. Andrew Weil and Steven Knope on alternative medicine], (November 3, 2003) | url = http://uanews.org/story/arizona-illustrated-frontline-look-at-alternative-medicine | network = PBS | station = KUAT-TV | location = [[Tucson, Arizona]]  | transcript = ''YouTube'' title (July 30, 2008): Dr. Steven Knope debates Andrew Weil on the merits of Integrative Medicine (Part I) | transcript-url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11t5NXaOQI  | access-date=17 November 2015 }}</ref> [[Simon Singh]], a recognized British science writer, and [[Edzard Ernst]], a former Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, echoed Beyerstein's criticism in their 2008 book ''Trick or Treatment'', saying that while Weil correctly promotes exercise and smoke-free lifestyles, "much of his advice is nonsense."<ref>{{cite book|author =Singh, S. |author-link=Simon Singh |author2=Edzard, Ernst E. |author-link2=Edzard Ernst |name-list-style=amp | title=Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts About Alternative Medicine | page=256 | year=2008 | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = [[W. W. Norton & Company|W. W. Norton]] | isbn=9780393337785|title-link=Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts About Alternative Medicine }}</ref>

===Social===
Hans Baer of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the [[University of Arkansas]], writing in 2003, has argued that Weil's approach represents a general limitation of the holistic health/New Age movement, in its "tendenc[y] to downplay the role of social, structural, and environmental factors in the etiology of disease" in the United States, and in doing so, represents a failure to "suggest substantive remedies for improving access to health care," generally, for the "millions of people who lack any type go health insurance…"; at the same time, Baer notes (with negative connotations) that Weil instead contributes "to a long tradition of entrepreneurialism in the U.S. medical system."<ref name=Baer03/><ref name=Baer04/>{{rp|20,29,119,130ff}}

===Ethical===
Beginning in 2006, as the result of his commercial ventures, Weil—as David Gumpert has described—has placed himself in the "awkward position of... having to defend himself against charges of inappropriately exploiting his [[Celebrity doctor|medical-celebrity status]]."<ref name=GumpertBloom06>{{cite journal | author = Gumpert, David E. | date = March 27, 2006 | journal = Bloomberg | title = Small Business: Dr. Weil, Heal Thyself | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-03-27/dr-dot-weil-heal-thyself  | access-date = 25 November 2015 }}</ref> Commenting on a cover article in a recent 2006 edition of the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]'s "highly respected" ''Nutrition Action Healthletter,''<ref name=CSPItrustintocash>{{cite journal | author = CSPI | date = January–February 2006 | journal = Nutrition Action Healthletter | title = Supplementing Their Income: How Celebrities Turn Trust Into Cash | url = https://www.cspinet.org/nah/01_06/sup.pdf | access-date = 25 November 2015 | location = Washington, DC, USA | publisher = [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051515/https://www.cspinet.org/nah/01_06/sup.pdf | archive-date = 2016-03-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Gumpert called attention to:
* a $14 million deal Weil's business enterprise had made with [[drugstore.com]],<ref name=CSPItrustintocash/><ref name=GumpertBloom06/>
* the DrWeil.com personalized service of recommending supplements (purchase of which are made easy via DrWeil.com and drugstore.com),<ref name=CSPItrustintocash/><ref name="GumpertBloom06" />
* long-standing recommendations for supplements appearing despite studies questioning their efficacy,<ref name=CSPItrustintocash/><ref name=GumpertBloom06/> and to
* the clear nature of the pressures on Weil because of the deals, and the clear consanguinity of person and brand.<ref name=GumpertBloom06/>
The ''Forbes'' article noted, in particular, [[drugstore.com]]'s 2005 lawsuit against DrWeil.com for Weil's having "failed to perform any of his marketing obligations," noting that in a 2004 ''Larry King Live'' interview, Weil failed to promote this business partner, despite the program offering "reasonable opportunity for Weil to use efforts to promote drugstore.com."<ref name=GumpertBloom06/> Moreover, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest|CSPI's]] newsletter noted that their investigations into the vitamin and supplement recommendation service led them to conclude that the algorithms behind the recommendations were, by default, set to recommend purchases: regardless of how the online inquiries of the personalized service were answered, "we couldn't get the Advisor to stop recommending that we buy supplements."<ref name=CSPItrustintocash/><ref name=GumpertBloom06/> The CSPI article concludes, "Beware of doctors who sell what they recommend."<ref name=CSPItrustintocash/><ref name=GumpertBloom06/>

In 2006, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] also commented on a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine piece by Weil rebutting a recent [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] report on the failure of fish oil supplements to significantly reduce risk of serious heart arrhythmias,<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613145320/http://cspinet.org/nah/01_06/sup_can.pdf Supplementing Their Income: How Celebrities Turn Trust Into Cash]", (2006) ''Nutrition Action Newsletter'', Center for Science in the Public Interest, January/February 2016, pp 3-6. Archived from the [http://cspinet.org/nah/01_06/sup_can.pdf original] on June 13, 2010. Accessed December 28, 2019.</ref> where he emphasized the benefits of [[fish oil]] supplements without a disclaimer that he had a direct commercial interest in the sale of these supplements.<ref name=Advertorial>{{cite journal|author = CSPI|date  = June 19, 2006|journal = CSPI Newsroom: Integrity in Science Watch |title = Time Runs Andrew Weil Advertorial|url = http://www.cspinet.org/integrity/press/200606191.html|access-date = 17 November 2015|location = Washington, DC, USA|publisher = [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://www.cspinet.org/integrity/press/200606191.html|archive-date = 2009-03-03|url-status   = dead}}</ref>

Another specific criticism has been leveled with regard to the message of his ''Healthy Aging'' (2005), which argues that aging should be accepted as a natural stage in life,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} while these skin care products were being sold at [[Macy's]] with the advertising claim of the products' "optimiz[ing] skin's defense against aging"—alongside a large picture of Weil.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite web|last1=Wadler|first1=Joyce|title=What Goes With Gray?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/garden/20weil.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=20 October 2005|access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref>

Weil has also been accused by others in the alternative health movement, in particular, from individuals with less credentialed backgrounds,{{Verify source|date=November 2015}} of being involved in the "dishonest practice of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt about competitors' products, while pretending to be [an] objective 3rd [party]."<ref>Corriher, Sarah C. (2015) "Doctor Andrew Weil: Whose Side Is He Really On?," ''The Health Wyze Report,'' (online, undated), see [http://healthwyze.org/index.php/component/content/article/294-doctor-andrew-weil-whose-side-is-he-really-on.html], accessed 18 November 2015.</ref>{{better source|date=November 2015}}

===Political===
Weil's 1983 ''Chocolate to Morphine'' roused the ire of Florida senator Paula Hawkins, "who demanded that the book, a veritable encyclopaedia of various drugs and their effects on humans, be removed from schools and libraries."<ref name=EB15/><ref>{{cite book | author = Torgoff, Martin | date = 2004 | title = Can't Find My Way Home: America in the Great Stoned Age, 1945-2000 | page = 431ff | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Simon and Schuster | isbn = 978-0743258630 | url = https://archive.org/details/cantfindmywayhom00torg | url-access = registration | access-date = 18 November 2015 }}</ref>

==Formal corrective actions==
In 2009, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] sent a warning letter to Weil's Weil Lifestyle LLC, regarding "Unapproved / Uncleared / Unauthorized Products Related to the H1N1 Flu Virus" in particular, a "Notice of Potential Illegal Marketing of Products to Prevent, Treat or Cure the H1N1 Virus [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 [influenza] Virus]]."<ref name=FDALetter>{{cite web|author=FDA |date=2009 |title=Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations: Compliance Actions and Activities: Warning Letters, Weil Lifestyle LLC [October 15, 2009] |location=Washington, DC, USA |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |url=https://www.fda.gov/iceci/enforcementactions/warningletters/ucm186837.htm |quote=Unapproved/Uncleared/Unauthorized Products Related to the H1N1 Flu Virus; and Notice of Potential Illegal Marketing of Products to Prevent, Treat or Cure the H1N1 Virus. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/https://www.fda.gov/iceci/enforcementactions/warningletters/ucm186837.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |url-status=live }}{{primary source inline|date=November 2015}}{{primary source inline|date=November 2015}}{{better source|date=November 2015}}</ref> The FDA was primarily concerned with several implicit claims in Weil Lifestyle LLC's marketing literature, that certain products could help ward off such viruses.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
