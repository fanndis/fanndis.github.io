The '''University of North Texas''' ('''UNT''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[Doctoral university|research university]] in [[Denton, Texas]]. It consists of 14 colleges and schools<ref>{{Cite web|title=UNT Website|url=https://www.unt.edu/colleges-schools}}</ref>, an early admissions math and science academy, Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science<ref>{{Cite web|title=TAMS website|url=https://tams.unt.edu/}}</ref>, for exceptional high-school-age students from across the state, and a library system that comprises the university core. The university is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".<ref>{{cite web |title=Carnegie Classifications Institution Lookup |url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=227216 |publisher=Center for Postsecondary Education |website=carnegieclassifications.iu.edu |accessdate=26 July 2020}}</ref> According to the [[National Science Foundation]], UNT spent $78.4 million on research and development in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=President's Annual Report 2019|url=https://issuu.com/universityofnorthtexas/docs/northtexan-special-edition2019|accessdate=26 July 2020|website=ncsesdata.nsf.gov|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]}}</ref>

UNT was founded as a [[nonsectarian]], coeducational, private [[Normal school|teachers college]] in 1890 and was formally adopted by the state 11 years later.<ref name="DMN 1901 May 25">"Denton Normal School," [[Dallas Morning News]], May 25, 1901, pg. 2</ref> UNT is the flagship institution of the [[University of North Texas System]], which includes additional universities in [[Dallas]] and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. UNT also has a location in [[Frisco, Texas|Frisco]].

==Campus==
The Denton campus is located in the largest populated region of Texas under two categories defined by the [[U.S. Census]]: (i) [[Texas statistical areas|core based statistical area (CBSA; Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington—4th largest, nationally)]] and (ii) [[Texas statistical areas|combined statistical area (CSA; Dallas-Fort Worth—7th largest, nationally)]]. From an economic perspective, the Denton campus lies within the Dallas-Fort Worth–Arlington [[metropolitan area]], as defined by the [[U.S. Office of Management and Budget]], which {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, had the sixth highest GDP (aka [[gross metropolitan product]]) of the nation's 366 metropolitan areas.<ref>[https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/2013/pdf/gdp_metro0213.pdf ''GDP by Metropolitan Area, Advance 2011, and Revised 2001–2010''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120065339/https://bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/2013/pdf/gdp_metro0213.pdf |date=November 20, 2017 }}, [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], February 22, 2013</ref> As a state, Texas, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, had the second highest GDP in the country.<ref>''Table 1. Real GDP by State, 2008–2011'', [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], June 5, 2012</ref>

On behalf of the state, the university, in its civic advocacy for the state, prevailed with three new-location, capital-intensive expansions over the last {{cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1975|09|01}}}} years.

* The university acquired in 1975 and subsequently developed a [[University of North Texas Health Science Center|medical school]] in Fort Worth
* The university created a [[University of North Texas at Dallas|campus in South Dallas]] in 2000
* The university laid the groundwork for establishing the first [[University of North Texas at Dallas College of Law|public law school in the region]] (the 2nd is UT Dallas' law school).

In 1981, the university spun off its new [[University of North Texas Health Science Center|medical school]] as its own independent institution under the [[UNT System|UNT Board of Regents]].<ref>"Board Okays NT, TCOM Final Merger," by Joyce Hopkins, ''[[Denton Record-Chronicle]]'', December 8, 1974</ref> In 2009, the [[University of North Texas at Dallas]] became its own independent institution. That same year, the Texas legislature approved the creation of [[University of North Texas at Dallas College of Law]], opening in 2014 in [[Downtown Dallas]] as part of [[University of North Texas at Dallas|UNT Dallas]]. UNT and its three sister institutions are governed by the [[University of North Texas System]], a system established in 1980 by the board of regents and legislatively recognized in 2003 by the [[Seventy-eighth Texas Legislature|78th Texas Legislature]].

In 2004, UNT opened [[University of North Texas Discovery Park|UNT Discovery Park]] – {{convert|290|acre|km2}} – in Denton, north of the main campus with technology incubator facilities dedicated to science and engineering. In 2011, the College of Visual Arts and Design launched the Design Research Center in [[downtown Dallas]] in the Design District.<ref>[http://news.unt.edu/news-releases/unt-opens-design-research-center-dallas UNT Press Release: ''UNT opens Design Research Center in Dallas''], UNT News Service, January 31, 2011</ref>

In 2016, UNT opened a location in Hall Park in Frisco in Collin County. In 2018, UNT opened Inspire Park. UNT teaches nearly 2,000 students in Collin County each semester at Hall Park, Inspire Park and the Collin Higher Education Center in McKinney.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 1, 2018|url=https://news.unt.edu/news-releases/innovative-new-partnership-leads-university-of-north-texas-to-build-frisco-campus}}</ref> In 2020, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved UNT building a branch campus to provide upper-level and graduate courses on 100 acres donated by the city of Frisco. Classes are expected to begin in Spring 2023.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 24, 2020|url=https://news.unt.edu/news-releases/plans-unt-frisco-campus-take-next-step}}</ref>

==Official designations==
In 1985 the [[Mark White (Texas politician)|Governor's]] Select Committee on Higher Education recommended that North Texas be designated an "emerging national research university."  Nine years earlier, in 1976, the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] designated North Texas as a "Class 1 Doctorate-Granting Institution." Four decades later, in February 2016, [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie]] elevated North Texas to its top category – Doctorate-Granting Institutions with "highest research activity." At that time, Carnegie had 115 universities listed at that level.

In 1988, U.S. Secretary of Education [[William Bennett]] cited UNT for its innovative approach to undergraduate education in the Classic Learning Core,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/fipse/lessons2/northtex.html|title=Archived: Lessons Learned from FIPSE Projects II – University of North Texas|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref> an integrated liberal arts curriculum similar to those usually found only in small, private colleges. In 1992, UNT was elected to full membership in the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities]].<ref name="unt.edu"/> And, in 2011, the [[Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board]] included UNT as one of eight Emerging Research Institutions in its accountability system.

In 2020, UNT achieved designation from the Department of Education as a Title III & Title V Minority-Serving Institution (MSI) and as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI)<ref>{{Cite web|title=UNT news site|url=https://news.unt.edu/news-releases/designated-hispanic-serving-institution-unt-can-amplify-resources-growing-and-better}}</ref>.

==Enrollment==
Certified enrollment as of the fall of 2020 was 40,796,<ref>{{Cite web|website=https://news.unt.edu/news-releases/unt-enrollment-hits-all-time-high}}</ref> the [[List of largest Texas universities by enrollment|sixth largest]] in the state. For the 2019-20 academic year, the university awarded 10,270<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.unt.edu/news-releases/unt-enrollment-hits-all-time-high}}</ref> degrees, of which 8,006<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.unt.edu/news-releases/unt-enrollment-hits-all-time-high}}</ref> were at the graduate level. UNT awarded 459 Ph.D. degrees from fiscal years 2009 to 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.txhighereddata.org/index.cfm?objectid=61E12EAB-EC7D-02CF-F6ABF0792251E2CB|title=Texas Higher Education Data: 2012 Higher Education Almanac|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref>

It is primarily funded by industry members (which {{as of|2012|lc=y}} consist of 16 corporations) and universities (which {{as of|2012|lc=y}} consist of 5). The focus is developing computing models for the future—models that go beyond applications with preordained fixed capabilities—models capable of services that are dynamically created, verified, and validated [[Field research|in the field]] and {{linktext|on the fly}}.

===College of Information===
The College of Information was created in October 2008 by consolidating two existing academic units: Learning Technologies (formerly within the College of Education) and the School of Library and Information Sciences. The School of Library and Information Services was created in 1970 as an outgrowth of its former structure as the Department of Library Services.<ref>"College Adds Four Degrees to Program", ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', October 22, 1970, Sec. A, p. 8.</ref> The college sponsors three research centers, one being The Texas Center for Digital Knowledge.

===College of Health and Public Service===
Previously called the College of Public Affairs and Community Service (PACS) and before that the College of Community Service, the college adopted its current name in Fall 2017. The college is organized in seven departments: Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology; Behavior Analysis; Criminal Justice; Emergency Management and Disaster Science; Public Administration; Rehabilitation and Health Services; and Social Work.<ref>[https://hps.unt.edu/departments Departments], College of Public Affairs and Community Service.</ref>

The department of public administration is home of the nation's first comprehensive degree program in [[Emergency management|emergency and disaster management]] that launched {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1983|09|01}}}} years ago (1983). The degree incorporates interdisciplinary curricula from other colleges that include [[applied philosophy]] and [[environmental ethics]]. The degree is tailored for both management practitioners and researchers and is collaborative with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] Region VI—based in Denton—which oversees Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Denton became home to FEMA when its predecessor, the [[Office of Civil Defense|Office of Civil Defense and Mobilization]], constructed the nation's first Federal underground defense center in 1959.<ref>Georgia Caraway & Cupit, ''Images of America: Denton'', Arcadia Publishing, pg. 43 (2009) {{OCLC|429027254}} {{LCCN|2009928046}} {{ISBN|978-0-7385-7854-5}}</ref>

The college is host to five research institutes, one being the [[Turkish Institute for Police Studies]] (TIPS). The institute has, since its founding in 1999, been based at North Texas. Its institution is a collaboration between the [[Turkish National Police]] (TNP) and U.S. universities in areas of terrorism, organized crime, narcotics, administration, intelligence, and investigation.<ref>Huseyin Durmaz, Bilal Sevinc, Ahmet Sait Yayla, Siddik Ekici ''Understanding and Responding to Terrorism'', pg. 101, [[IOS Press]] (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-58603-740-6}}</ref>

===College of Visual Arts and Design===
The College of Visual Arts and Design has the 10th largest enrollment of any art and design school accredited by the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]], and the second largest of any that awards doctorates.<ref>''HEADS Data – Special Report, 2010–11'', [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]]</ref> The college name changes reflect the curricular expansion of programs. In 1992, what then had been the "Department of Art" within the College of Arts and Sciences, became "School of Visual Arts;" and in 2007, it became the "College of Visual Arts and Design."  Art classes began at UNT in 1894, four years after its founding. Master's degrees were initiated in the 1930s and the first Master of Science degree in art was awarded in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.unt.edu/news-releases/school-visual-arts-becomes-college-visual-arts-and-design|title=School of Visual Arts becomes College of Visual Arts and Design – News- University of North Texas|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref> Since 1972, the college has served as curator and custodian of the [[Texas Fashion Collection]]<ref>"NTSU Schedules Exhibition of Fashion Group Costumes," ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', September 2, 1973, pg.

===Honors College===
[[File:University of North Texas September 2015 66 (Honors Hall).jpg|thumb|350px|right|Honors Hall]]

The [[Honors College]] offers academic enrichments, including honors seminars and exclusive classes only for high-achieving undergraduates. There is no age limit. Its classes can either supplement or substitute core coursework. Its objective is to challenge exceptional students at higher levels and to promote leadership. The college is an autonomous collegiate unit on equal footing with the other collegiate units. Academically, it offers no degrees; but its courses are integrated with the [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] programs of the other ten constituent colleges and the journalism school. Graduates are awarded a special medallion. The college offers many perks, including scholarships, exchange programs, and exclusive housing—Honors Hall.

The college began as an honors program {{cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1971|09|01}}}} years ago (Fall 1971). Its initial enrollment of 50, back then, quickly grew to 400. But the program lost support under a system of borrowing faculty members.<ref>[http://northtexan.unt.edu/content/early-honors Charldean Newell, "Early Honors,"] ''North Texan'' (alumni magazine), posted online June 11, 2012</ref> The Honors Program was reconstituted in 1994 and was elevated as a college in 2005.

===Mayborn School of Journalism===
Curricular journalism at North Texas dates back to 1945. As a department, Journalism eventually became part of the College of Arts and Sciences. The Graduate Division of Journalism began in the fall of 1970 under the direction of [[Reginald Conway Westmorland]], PhD (born 1926).<ref name="NT Daily 1971 Aug 5">[http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth326578/m1/2/zoom/?q=%22journalism%20degrees%22 "Journalism Offers Two New Plans,"] ''[[North Texas Daily]]'', Vol. 54, No. 115 (ed. 1), August 5, 1971</ref> In 1999, twelve years after the death of [[Frank Mayborn|Frank W. Mayborn]], its graduate program was renamed the Frank W. Mayborn Graduate Institute of Journalism. On September 1, 2009, the entire program was elevated as its own collegiate unit and named the Frank W. and Sue Mayborn School of Journalism. Eight [[Pulitzer Prizes]] have been won by five of its alumni, among whom are [[Bill Moyers]] and [[Howard Swindle]]. Other notable alumni include [[Samir Husni]] and [[Cragg Hines]]. Since 1969, the news-editorial sequence has been accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications; and since 1986, the entire program has been accredited. The school is in its {{ordinal to word|{{age|format=raw|2004|09|01}}}} year as founding host of the annual Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference.

Virginia Ellison ''(née'' Virginia Jones Paty; 1920–2009)—a North Texas alumna (BA, English, '41) who also taught English and journalism, sponsored the Student Press Club, and served as director of publicity at North Texas from 1942 to 1944—won a [[Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship]] in 1945, the year she earned a degree from the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]].<ref name="NYS 1945 May 18">[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2018/New%20York%20NY%20Sun/New%20York%20NY%20Sun%201945/New%20York%20NY%20Sun%201945%20a%20-%203495.pdf "3 Win Scholarships,"] ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'', May 18, 1945, pg. 15</ref><ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/houstonchronicle/obituary.aspx?n=virginia-paty-ellison&pid=130153683#fbLoggedOut "Obituary: Virginia Paty Ellison,"] ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', February 25, 1913</ref><ref name="NYTs 1945 May 18">"Three Women Get Pulitzer Awards," ''[[New York Times]]'', May 18, 1945</ref>

{{Main|Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science}}

TAMS is a two-year residential early college entrance program that has, since 1987, served exceptionally qualified Texas students who otherwise would be attending high school as juniors and seniors. It was the first of its kind in the nation and, {{as of|2012|lc=y}}, the only in the state and one of five in the nation.

===Toulouse Graduate School===
The Toulouse Graduate School, founded {{cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1946|09|01}}}} years ago,<ref>"The Education Encyclopedia: Doctor Degrees, Fast Growing Campus Marked NT Development," ''[[Denton Record-Chronicle]]'', Sec. V, pg. 5, August 19, 1951</ref> is the academic custodian and administrator of all graduate programs offered by nine colleges and one school. It maintains records, administers admissions, and serves various roles in recruiting. It was renamed in 1990 in honor of Robert Bartell Toulouse, EdD (1918–2017), who joined in 1948 as a professor in the College of Education, then served dean of the Graduate School from 1954 to 1982.

===Mascot===
[[File:UNT Eagle statue.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''In High Places'']]
UNT's mascot, the American [[eagle]], was adopted on February 1, 1922, as a result of a student-faculty council debate and ensuing student election.<ref>"UNT InHouse" (faculty newsletter), December 22, 2005 (retrieved September 17, 2007) [http://inhouse.unt.edu InHouse website]</ref>

The eagle has had three nicknames, beginning with "Scrappy" in 1950.<ref>"North Texas College Plans Huge Bonfire," ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', November 14, 1950, Sec. I, pg. 8</ref> The human costumed eagle character, launched in 1963, carried the name "Scrappy" until 1974—during the throes of the [[Vietnam War]]—when students adopted the name "Eppy" because it sounded less warlike. Since then, the name has switched back and forth, from Eppy to Scrappy; but for the last {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1995|09|09}}}} years, the name "Scrappy" has endured.

In the spring of 2002, a student group attempted to make the [[Albino squirrels|albino squirrel]] the school's secondary mascot. The student body narrowly rejected the measure. In August 2006, the albino squirrel, believed to bring luck to students who spotted him before an exam, was killed by a red-tailed hawk. By May 2007, another albino squirrel had been born on campus but was hit by a car in December 2016.<ref>North Texas News Service, February 2006 (retrieved September 17, 2007) [http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/archives/f06/untnews.htm Unt.edu]</ref>

===Nickname for intercollegiate athletics===
The name "Mean Green," now in its {{ordinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1966|11|20}}}} year, was adopted by fans and media in 1966 for a North Texas football defensive squad that finished the season second in the nation against the [[Rush (American football)|rush]].<ref>"Eagles are 19-Point Favorite," ''[[Denton Record-Chronicle]]'', September 21, 1967, pg 10</ref> That season, [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]],<ref name="Mean Joe Greene">{{cite web|url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/1772/Greene-Joe--Mean-Joe-Greene.html|title="Mean" Joe Greene}}</ref> then a sophomore at North Texas, played left [[defensive tackle]] on the football team and competed in track and field ([[shot put]]). The nickname "Mean Joe Greene" caught-on during his first year with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 1969 when Pittsburgh fans wrongly assumed that "Mean Green" was derived from a nickname Joe Greene had inherited while at North Texas. The North Texas athletic department, media, and fans loved the novelty of the national use of its nickname, and its association with Joe Greene's surname and university's official school color. By 1968, "Mean Green" was branded on the backs of shirts, buttons, bumper stickers, and the cover of the North Texas football brochure.<ref name="Abilene Reporter-News 1968 Sep 1">"Mean Green Same as Nickname," by Mike Cochran ''(né'' John Michael Cochran; born 1936), ''[[Abilene Reporter-News]] ([[Associated Press|AP]])'', September 1, 1968</ref>

The song, "Fight, North Texas," has endured for {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1939|09|01}}}} years and the lyrics have changed minimally to reflect the name changes of the university.  While serving as an associate professor at the [[University of Wyoming]] from 1946 to 1950, Stroup rewrote the lyrics for the chorus to "[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]," which was adopted in 1961 as the university's fight song.  After serving as head of the Physical Education Department at [[Southern Arkansas University]] from 1950 to 1959, Stroup became Professor of Physical Education at [[Northern Illinois University]].  While there, Stroup rewrote the lyrics to the chorus of Alonzo Neil Annas' (1882–1966) NIU "Loyalty Song" (1942), which was informally adopted in 1961 and officially 1963 as the "Huskie Fight Song."<ref name="Daily Chronicle 2009 Sep 7">"Fight song composer turns 100," by Dana Herra, ''[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]]'' (Illinois), September 7, 2009</ref><ref name="Daily Chronicle 2010 Dec 3">"Stroup, 101, wrote NIU fight song," by Kate Schott, ''[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]]'' (Illinois), December 3, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/fall2008/living-knows-no-season.htm "Living Knows No Season – Composer of Fight North Texas Crafts a Life Full Of Song,"] by Jill King, ''North Texan'', Summer 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.niutoday.info/2010/12/01/niu-mourns-passing-of-francis-stroup/ "NIU mourns passing of Francis Stroup, Former men's swimming coach penned lyrics to Huskie Fight Song,"] ''NIU Today'', December 1, 2010</ref><ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=30G3FK_2M_4C&pg=PT38&lpg=PT38 College Fight Songs II: A Supplementary Anthology],'', by William E.

Three years later, the university became the first large public university in Texas to sign the "[[American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC)|American College and University President's Climate Commitment]]" (ACUPCC). {{as of|2012|September}}, twenty-four of the 658 signatory institutions of higher learning were from Texas. Of those twenty-four, five were full undergraduate-graduate institutions (2 private, 3 public). Of those five, UNT was the largest. The objectives include achieving [[carbon neutrality]] by 2040 and ensuring that all new university buildings and facilities meet a minimum [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Silver rating by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dentonrc.com/local-news/education/higher-education-headlines/20120215-unt-briefs.ece |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |title=UNT's Business Leadership Building Receives Gold LEED Certification |date=February 15, 2012 |newspaper=[[Denton Record-Chronicle]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427051735/http://www.dentonrc.com/local-news/education/higher-education-headlines/20120215-unt-briefs.ece# |archive-date=April 27, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The university continued to promote sustainability in 2017 when it purchased a year worth of renewable energy credits, to allow the University of North Texas to be powered by renewable energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntdaily.com/unt-will-be-100-percent-powered-by-renewable-energy-for-one-year/|title=UNT will be 100 percent powered by renewable energy for one year – North Texas Daily|date=April 5, 2017|website=ntdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>

'''In Facilities''' The Life Science Complex, built in 2011, became UNT's first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified structure, earning a Gold rating. The Complex is a state-of-the-art research facility that houses the university's [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], developmental [[physiology]], [[genetics]] and [[plant sciences]] programs. The building features four climate-controlled rooftop [[greenhouses]] and one of the country's most sophisticated [[Aquatic science|aquatics laboratories]] with more than 2,500 tanks.  Also in 2011, [[Apogee Stadium]], the {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|2011|09|10}}}}-year-old football stadium, became the first newly built sports stadium in the nation to earn a Platinum [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification, the highest of four certifications.<ref name="DRC 10/22/2011">{{cite news |last=Vito |first=Brett |title=Stadium Garners Ultimate Ranking |newspaper=[[Denton Record-Chronicle]] |url=http://www.dentonrc.com/sports/colleges/colleges-headlines/20111021-stadium-garners-ultimate-ranking.ece |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |date=October 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703182949/http://www.dentonrc.com/sports/colleges/colleges-headlines/20111021-stadium-garners-ultimate-ranking.ece# |archive-date=July 3, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The facility features wind turbines, eco-friendly building materials, and native landscape architecture.

'''In National Rankings''' The following year, ''The Princeton Review's Guide to 322 Green Colleges, 2012 Edition'', listed UNT for the second consecutive year, citing its top 17-percent ranking among green-compliant universities nationwide under [[American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC)|ACUPCC]]. The article stated that forty percent of the energy on campus is derived from renewable sources, and 43 percent of the buildings have undergone energy retrofits. The campus has posted strong numbers in recycling: since 2009, the university has recycled nearly 1,000 tons of waste materials. UNT offers graduate degrees in Environmental Science and Public Administration and Management.<ref>[http://www.princetonreview.com/uploadedFiles/Sitemap/Home_Page/Green_Guide_and_Green_OA/Green_Guide/Guide%20to%20Green%20Colleges.pdf ''The Princeton Review's Guide to 322 Green Colleges, 2012 Edition'', Jeremy Seltzer, lead author (2012)]</ref>
