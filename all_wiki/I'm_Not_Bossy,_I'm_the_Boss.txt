Upon release the album received positive reviews from such publications as ''[[American Songwriter]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' and ''[[Slant Magazine]]''. The [[Metacritic]] aggregate score on August 12, 2014 was 66 out of a 100.<ref name=metacritic /> Fred Thomas, writing for [[AllMusic]], gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5, with a favorable review, opening with the summary: "A decade of inconsistent, spotty, or simply confusing output from iconic Irish singer/songwriter Sinéad O'Connor was redeemed with 2012's refreshingly focused and honest effort ''[[How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?]]'' That album saw O'Connor effortlessly creating the same type of emotionally charged yet easily melodic fare that constituted her earliest, most popular work, and positioned her for a graceful return to form. Two years later, ''I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss'' follows the impassioned pop framework of its immediate predecessor, branching out into even more vivid stylistic dimensions and retaining all the energy, controversy, and fire that have come to define O'Connor as both a musician and a political figure. Taken at face value, the songs here are vibrant and multifaceted."<ref name="allmusic"/>
