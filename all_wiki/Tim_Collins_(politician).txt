'''Timothy William George Collins''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 7 May 1964) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] politician, once a prominent member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  Collins was active in the 1990s and was later the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] in north-west [[England]] from [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] until his defeat at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] by [[Tim Farron]], later leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

==Education==
Collins was educated at [[Chigwell School]], the [[London School of Economics]] (BSc) and [[King's College London]] (MA).<ref>‘COLLINS, Timothy William George’, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014</ref>

==Political career==
Collins had significant political experience before his election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. He acted as [[Press Secretary]] to the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Major]], serving in that role during the successful [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 Election]] campaign. He was a member of the [[10 Downing Street]] [[Downing Street Policy Unit|Policy Unit]] and was a speechwriter to [[Margaret Thatcher]], John Major, [[William Hague]], [[David Hunt, Baron Hunt of Wirral|David Hunt]], [[Michael Howard]], [[Chris Patten]], [[Norman Fowler]] and [[Brian Mawhinney]].

Collins was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[Birthday Honours List]] in 1996, at the age of 32. The award was given 'for political services'.

During his time in Parliament, Collins served as a [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] and later as a [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Senior Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party]]. In this role in the run up to the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 election]] Collins was a senior aide to the then Conservative leader William Hague.  Collins supported the focus on tax cuts and opposition to the [[Euro]] that characterised that campaign.

After the election the new Conservative leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]] appointed him to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Cabinet Office Minister]] later moving him to Shadow [[Transport Secretary]]. When [[Michael Howard]] became leader in 2003 he was appointed [[Secretary of State for Education|Shadow Secretary of State for Education]].

In this post he developed policies to give anonymity for accused teachers until a court trial, to allow successful schools to expand and to stop the closure of schools for children with Special Educational Needs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3734370.stm|title=Behaviour problems strain schools|date=12 October 2004|newspaper=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/dec/13/schools.uk1|title=Tories seek greater protection for accused teachers|last=Curtis|first=Polly|date=13 December 2004|website=the Guardian|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>

At the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] he lost his seat to [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Tim Farron]]. The margin was only 267 votes.

It has been suggested that this was due to a Liberal Democrat "[[decapitation]]" strategy which was aimed at unseating senior Conservative candidates.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Almanac of British Politics (8th edition) | year = 2007 | author = [[Robert Waller (pundit)|Robert Waller]] & Byron Criddle | quote = Tim Collins proved to be the only high-profile victim of the 'decapitation strategy' against leading Conservative figures | page = 15}}</ref>

In 2006 he was reported to be part of the so-called "[[A-List (Conservative)|A-List]]" of priority parliamentary candidates whom the Conservative leadership most wish to see in Parliament after the next General Election, but, in April 2008, the ConservativeHome website<ref>http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2009/04/where-are-the-original-alisters-now-those-who-are-no-longer-looking-for-a-seat.html#more</ref> reported that he left the Conservative candidate list, quoting him as saying "I firmly now do not wish to return to the House of Commons".

== Lobbyist ==
In October 2009, Collins was appointed Managing Director of [[Bell Pottinger]]<ref>Timothy William George Collins works at BELL POTTINGER LLP since 1 January 2013 currently as a LLPMEM - http://www.cbetta.com/director/timothy-william-george-collins-3</ref> Public Affairs, one of the UK's largest lobbying companies, replacing David Sowells and reporting to Chairman Peter Bingle.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.prweek.com/article/939012/bell-pottinger-top-lobbyist-david-sowells-set-usa-move | work=PR Week | date=16 September 2009 | location=London | title=Bell Pottinger Top Lobbyist David Sowells Set for USA Move}}</ref>  BPPA is part of [[Chime Communications plc]], created and chaired by [[Lord Bell]], the former advertising and communications adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s. In the December 2009 edition of ''PA News'', a magazine covering the lobbying industry, Shadow Arts Minister [[Ed Vaizey]] MP praised the hiring of Collins, saying he had "a huge brain" and would be "a huge asset" to the company. In the same issue, Charles Lewington, MD of consultancy Hanover, said it was "a smart hire by Tim Bell" while the man who beat Collins in 2005, Liberal Democrat MP [[Tim Farron]], said it was "very good news for Bell Pottinger". In December 2011, ''[[The Independent]]'' claimed<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/caught-on-camera-top-lobbyists-boasting-how-they-influence-the-pm-6272760.html | work=The Independent | first1=Melanie | last1=Newman | first2=Oliver | last2=Wright | date=6 December 2011 | location=London | title=Caught on camera: top lobbyists boasting how they influence the PM}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8937250/Conservatives-under-pressure-to-explain-links-to-lobbying-firms.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Conservatives under pressure to explain links to lobbying firms | date=6 December 2011 | location=London}}</ref> that Collins had been filmed by the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] saying that PM [[David Cameron]] had raised a copyright issue with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]] on behalf of [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Limited]] "because we asked him to".

==Television==
Collins is a [[Doctor Who fandom|fan]] of the British [[science-fiction]] television programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and has appeared on television several times to discuss the programme.

In a 2003 [[DVD documentary]] ''Putting the Shock into Earthshock'' (included as part of the [[BBC Worldwide]] DVD release of the ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[Earthshock]]''), he jokingly stated that the [[Cybermen]] were more convincing when the Conservatives were in power. He was also reported to have read ''[[The Dying Days]]'' in one sitting on the night of the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] so that he could claim to have read the whole [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventures]] series while the Conservatives were in government.<ref name="Dying Days">https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/ebooks/dyingdays/intro/page1.shtml{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, Author's Introduction, ''Dying Days'', Lance Parkin</ref>

Collins has also appeared as a guest on a number of current affairs programmes since leaving Parliament.
