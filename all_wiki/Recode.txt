[[Walt Mossberg]] and [[Kara Swisher]] founded it in January 2014, after they left [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]] and the similar website they had previously co-founded, ''[[All Things Digital]]''. [[Vox Media]] acquired ''Recode'' in May 2015, and in May 2019, ''Recode'' was integrated into ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''.

In September 2013, technology journalists [[Walt Mossberg]] and [[Kara Swisher]] left ''[[All Things Digital]]'', the technology news site they had founded and developed for [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]] and [[News Corp (2013â€“present)|News Corp]]. Mossberg left ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the end of the year, leaving behind a popular, weekly technology [[newspaper column|column]].<ref name="CNBC: launch">{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101304758 |accessdate=May 29, 2015 |title=Swisher and Mossberg launch 'Recode'; NBC & Windsor Media are minority investors |last1=Boorstin |first1=Julia |date=January 2, 2014 |publisher=[[CNBC]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529053908/http://www.cnbc.com/id/101304758 |archivedate=May 29, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The two launched their new, independent technology news website, ''Recode'', on January 2, 2014. Its holding company, Revere Digital, received minority investments from [[NBCUniversal]] and [[Terry Semel]]'s Windsor Media.<ref name="CNBC: launch" /> The total investment was estimated between {{usd|10}} and 15 million. Mossberg and Swisher held the company's majority stake and noted its comfortable financial stance.<ref name="The Verge: launch">{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/2/5264506/walt-mossberg-and-kara-swisher-launch-recode-code-conference |accessdate=May 29, 2015 |title=Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher launch Recode news site, Code Conference series |last1=Topolsky |first1=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Topolsky |date=January 2, 2014 |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Yse5Bb40?url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/2/5264506/walt-mossberg-and-kara-swisher-launch-recode-code-conference |archivedate=May 29, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> ''Recode'' also provided breaking technology coverage for NBCUniversal, and received video resources and exposure in return via a formal partnership. Mossberg saw the investment as an opportunity to implement new ways of covering the technology field, and planned to add six employees on technology policy and mobile beats. The CNBC partnership also explored new advertising efforts and shared office space.<ref name="CNBC: launch" /> At launch, the 23-person team included all former members of ''All Things Digital''. The staff also received equity in the company.<ref name="The Verge: launch" />

Mossberg and Swisher planned to continue their prominent, annual ''All Things Digital'' conference, which they renamed the "Code" conference and scheduled for the same time and location: late May at Terranea Resort in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California]]. ''Recode'' also kept plans to continue their separate mobile and media conferences. CNBC became a partner in these conferences.<ref name="CNBC: launch" /> A part-time team of 12 employees runs the conferences.<ref name="The Verge: launch" />

The site developed a reputation for breaking tech industry news but ultimately did not reach the level of popularity it expected, with just 1.5 million regular monthly visitors. [[Vox Media]] acquired the website in May 2015 in a move that ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a reflection of tumult in online [[technology journalism]].<ref name="NYT: Vox acq">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/media/vox-media-acquiring-recode.html?_r=0 |accessdate=May 29, 2015 |title=Vox Media Adds ReCode to Its Stable of Websites |last1=Ember |first1=Sydney |date=May 26, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Vox purchased all of the company's stock, but the details of the transaction were not released. At the time of the acquisition, ''Recode'' had 44 employees and three additional employees by contract. They were expected to join Vox. Mossberg and Swisher planned to stay with the website. The two were impressed with Vox Media's audience reach. Vox's technology news website, ''[[The Verge]]'', had eight times the traffic, in comparison. The scopes of the two sites were not expected to overlap with ''Recode''{{'s}} emphasis on technology industry business and ''The Verge''{{'s}} on "being a new kind of culture publication".<ref name="NYT: Vox acq" /> An internal study found a three percent overlap in content between the two sites.<ref name="NYT: Vox acq" /> Recode started publishing podcasts in July 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.recode.net/2015/7/8/11614552/hey-serial-lady-shove-over-recode-decode-podcast-debuts-with-slack |title=Hey 'Serial' Lady, Shove Over: Re/code Decode Podcast Debuts With Slack CEO Interview and More! |last=Swisher |first=Kara |date=July 8, 2015 |website=Recode|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref>

On May 8, 2016, Recode relaunched with a new design under editor-in-chief Dan Frommer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recode.net/2016/5/8/11617328/introducing-the-new-recode |title=Introducing the new Recode |website=Recode}}</ref> In May 2019, Recode was integrated into Vox Media's flagship website, ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', becoming the column ''Recode by Vox''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/05/01/vox-media-integrates-recode-with-flagship-brand-four-years-after-purchase|title=Vox Media integrates Recode with flagship brand, four years after purchase|access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref>
