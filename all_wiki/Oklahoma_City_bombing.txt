On April 19, 2000, the [[Oklahoma City National Memorial]] was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Remembrance services are held every year on April 19, at the time of the explosion.

But there were no nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and he did not have an [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] competitors' license.

The collapse of the northern half of the building took roughly 7 seconds. As the truck exploded, it first destroyed the column next to it, designated as G20, and shattered the entire glass facade of the building. The shockwave of the explosion forced the lower floors upwards, before the fourth and fifth floors collapsed onto the third floor, which housed a transfer beam that ran the length of the building and was being supported by four pillars below and was supporting the pillars that hold the upper floors. The added weight meant that the third floor gave way along with the transfer beam, which in turn caused the collapse of the building.<ref name="Seconds">"The Bomb in Oklahoma City" ("Oklahoma City").

In the wake of the bombing, the national media focused on the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100&nbsp;day-care centers in the United States in 7,900&nbsp;federal buildings.<ref name="Apocalypse578"/> McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known "...&nbsp;it might have given me pause to switch targets.

Schools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H.

Aren Almon Kok, mother of Baylee Almon, said of the photo: "It was very hard to go to stores because they are in the check out aisle. It was always there. It was devastating.

The images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who, as demonstrated by later research, showed symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name="ChildPTSD">{{cite journal|title=The impact of the Oklahoma City bombing on children in the community|last=Pfefferbaum|first=Betty|format=Fee required|journal=Military Medicine|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13422617|volume=166|issue=12|date=April 23, 2009|pages=49–50|access-date=March 3, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219163129/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13422617|archive-date=February 19, 2014|url-status=live|doi=10.1093/milmed/166.suppl_2.49|pmid=11778433|doi-access=free}}</ref> Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students who had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pfefferbaum|first=Betty|author2=Sconzo, Guy M.|author3=Flynn, Brian W.|author4=Kearns, Lauri J.|author5=Doughty, Debby E.|author6=Gurwitch, Robin H.|author7=Nixon, Sara Jo|author8=Nawaz, Shajitha|title=Case Finding and Mental Health Services for Children in the Aftermath of the Oklahoma City Bombing|journal=Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research|year=2003|volume=30|issue=2|pages=215–227|doi=10.1097/00075484-200304000-00006|pmid=12710374}}</ref>

Children were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children who lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death of one of the at least ten orphaned children.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leland|first=John|title=The orphans of Oklahoma City|journal=Newsweek|date=April 22, 1996|volume=127|issue=17|page=40|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&hid=5&sid=707c93db-5d99-4077-abc0-8b54065a360e%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN=9604167868|access-date=November 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510130442/http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&hid=5&sid=707c93db-5d99-4077-abc0-8b54065a360e%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN=9604167868|archive-date=May 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Timothy McVeigh===
{{Main|Timothy McVeigh}}
Opening statements in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading ''[[The Turner Diaries]]''. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the [[Brady Bill]], and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents.<ref name="Sympathizers"/> The prosecution called 137&nbsp;witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it.<ref name="Wright10">{{cite book|title=Patriots, Politics, and the Oklahoma City Bombing|last=Wright|first=Stuart|page=10|isbn=978-0-521-69419-3|date=June 11, 2007}}</ref> Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael Fortier revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori Fortier testified that she had created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.<ref name="TMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcveigh/mcveighaccount.html |title=The Oklahoma City Bombing & The Trial of Timothy McVeigh |last=Linder |first=Douglas O. |year=2006 |work=Famous Trials: Oklahoma City Bombing Trial |publisher=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223000407/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcveigh/mcveighaccount.html |archive-date=February 23, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

McVeigh was represented by a team of six principal attorneys, led by [[Stephen Jones (attorney)|Stephen Jones]].<ref name="Petition">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/mcveigh/front.htm |title=Petition for Writ of Mandamus of Petitioner-Defendant, Timothy James McVeigh and Brief in Support |work=Case No. 96-CR-68-M |date=March 25, 1997 |publisher=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811035049/http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/mcveigh/front.htm |archive-date=August 11, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> According to law professor [[Doug Linder|Douglas O. Linder]], McVeigh wanted Jones to present a "necessity defense"&nbsp;– which would argue that he was in "imminent danger" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents).<ref name="TMT"/> McVeigh argued that "imminent" does not mean "immediate": "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat."<ref name="AmerTerror2856">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|journal=Scientific American|volume=284|issue=6|author=Michel, Lou|author2=Dan Herbeck|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanterroris00loum/page/285 285–286]|isbn=978-0-06-039407-3|bibcode=2001SciAm.284f..28D|year=2001|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0601-28|pmid=11396336|url=https://archive.org/details/americanterroris00loum/page/285}}</ref> Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as "the designated patsy",<ref name="TMT"/> but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible.<ref name="TMT"/> In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks.<ref name="TMT"/> Jones presented 25 witnesses, including [[Frederic Whitehurst]], over a one-week period. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.<ref name="TMT"/>

A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to belong to Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing.<ref name="LakeshaLeg">{{cite news|last=Johnston |first=David |title=Leg in the Oklahoma City Rubble Was That of a Black Woman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/us/leg-in-the-oklahoma-city-rubble-was-that-of-a-black-woman.html |date=August 31, 1995 |work=The New York Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627135820/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/us/leg-in-the-oklahoma-city-rubble-was-that-of-a-black-woman.html |archive-date=June 27, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine its owner.<ref name="LeftLeg"/> Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe No. 2.<ref name="LeftLeg"/> The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.<ref name="WritingEnd100"/>

Numerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial.<ref name="TMT"/> A [[gag order]] was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.<ref name="AmerTerror3157">{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|journal=Scientific American|volume=284|issue=6|author=Michel, Lou|author2=Dan Herbeck|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanterroris00loum/page/315 315–317]|isbn=978-0-06-039407-3|bibcode=2001SciAm.284f..28D|year=2001|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0601-28|pmid=11396336|url=https://archive.org/details/americanterroris00loum/page/315}}</ref>

===Legislation===
In the wake of the bombing the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation including the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]].<ref name="AntiFAS"/> In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that "when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in."<ref name="Barbarians">{{cite journal|last=Cassell|first=Paul|title=Barbarians at the Gates?

In the years since the bombing, scientists, security experts, and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale.

====Oklahoma School Curriculum====
In the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes. ''Oklahoma History'' is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school; however, the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the [[Dust Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Alex Cameron |url=http://www.newson6.com/story/12224663/15-years-later-time-to-teach-students-the-murrah-bombing |title=15 Years Later: Time To Teach Students The Murrah Bombing? |publisher=NewsOn6 |date=March 30, 2010 |access-date=December 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512171139/http://www.newson6.com/story/12224663/15-years-later-time-to-teach-students-the-murrah-bombing |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> On April 6, 2010, House Bill 2750 was signed by Governor [[Brad Henry]], requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ed Vulliamy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/11/oklahoma-bombing-15-years-on |title=Oklahoma: the day homegrown terror hit America |work=The Guardian |date=April 11, 2010 |access-date=December 10, 2012 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100211/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/11/oklahoma-bombing-15-years-on |archive-date=April 7, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Pierce |url=http://www.news9.com/Global/story.asp?S=12264522 |title=Governor Henry Signs Bill Making Murrah Bombing Required Learning |publisher=News9 |date=April 6, 2010 |access-date=December 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406040439/http://www.news9.com/Global/story.asp?S=12264522 |archive-date=April 6, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref name="oudaily">{{cite web |author=Ricky Maranon |url=http://www.oudaily.com/news/bill-adds-okc-bombing-to-education-curriculum/article_3c71a42c-30d8-54a7-a51f-8c4053449e90.html |title=Bill adds OKC bombing to education curriculum |work=The Oklahoma Daily |date=April 7, 2010 |access-date=December 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217092228/http://oudaily.com/news/2010/apr/07/bill-adds-okc-bombing-education-curriculum/ |archive-date=December 17, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

On the signing, Governor Henry said "Although the events of April 19, 1995 may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day ... We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation."<ref name="oudaily" />

The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building.

===Conspiracy theories===
{{Main|Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theories}}
A variety of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] have been proposed about the events surrounding the bombing.

==Evacuation issues==
Several agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/pedevac/1_introduction.htm|title=Managing Pedestrians During Evacuation of Metropolitan Areas – Introduction|work=dot.gov|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616035611/http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/pedevac/1_introduction.htm|archive-date=June 16, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, and the number of response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ok.gov/OEM/documents/Bombing%20After%20Action%20Report.pdf|title=The Oklahoma Department of Civil Emergency Management – After Action Report – Alfred P.

Following the events of September 11, 2001, with consideration of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=2.2.4|title=Lessons We Don't Learn: A Study of the Lessons of Disasters, Why We Repeat Them, and How We Can Learn Them|work=hsaj.org|date=July 2006|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924171804/http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=2.2.4|archive-date=September 24, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs&nbsp;– one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the "survivor tree", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000&nbsp;personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial.<ref>White, Zachary.
