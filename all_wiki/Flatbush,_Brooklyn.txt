'''Flatbush''' is a neighborhood in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. Founded in 1651 by Dutch colonists, the neighborhood, which consists of several subsections, had a population of 105,804 as of the [[2010 United States Census]].

Flatbush was a town prior to being incorporated into the City of Brooklyn, and its former border runs through the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Generally, the township was larger than what is considered Flatbush today by the residents of Brooklyn.  The modern neighborhood includes or borders several institutions of note, including [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] and [[Brooklyn College]].

Flatbush is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 14|Brooklyn Community District 14]], and its primary [[ZIP Code]] is 11226.<ref name="NYCPlanning"/> It is patrolled by the 67th and 70th Precincts of the [[New York City Police Department]].<ref name="NYPD 67th Precinct"/><ref name="NYPD 70th Precinct"/> Politically, Flatbush is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 40th and 45th Districts.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dc/downloads/pdf/brooklyn.pdf Current City Council Districts for Kings County], [[New York City]]. Accessed May 5, 2017.</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Flatbush'' is a [[calque]] of the [[Dutch language]] ''Vlacke bos'' (''vlacke'' or ''vlak'', meaning "flat"; "Flatbush" meaning "flat woodland" or "wooded plain"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11822|title=Flatbush Malls|publisher=NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation|date=December 12, 2001|access-date=May 29, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectpark.org/history_nature/historic_places/h_lefferts|title=Lefferts Historic House|publisher=Prospect Park Alliance|access-date=May 29, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924152119/http://www.prospectpark.org/history_nature/historic_places/h_lefferts|archive-date=September 24, 2008}}</ref> so named from woods that grew on the flat country.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

==History==

===Separate town===
Flatbush was originally chartered as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[New Netherlands|Nieuw Nederland]] colony town of ''Midwout'' (or ''Midwoud'' or ''Medwoud'') — from the Dutch words, ''med'', "middle" and ''woud'', "wood"<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Flatbush |volume=10 |page=482}}</ref> — in 1651. Both names were used in the Dutch era, and Midwood was an alternative name for Flatbush into the early 20th century. In a reversal, [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]], now the area immediately south of Brooklyn College, is often alternatively called "Flatbush,"<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://urbanography.com/urban/0006/vita3.htm|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090427092853/http://urbanography.com/urban/0006/vita3.htm|url-status = dead|archive-date = April 27, 2009|title = When the Dream Was Made|year = 2000|access-date = Sep 3, 2013|website = Urbanography|last = Matus|first = Irvin Leigh|quote = [On the Vitagraph Studio lot in Brooklyn, located adjacent to the Brighton railroad, in what is now Midwood, called South Greenfield at the time]: William Shea, among the first actors in the Big V's stock company, recalled the Brighton's role after filming began in 1905: After the building of the Flatbush studio, interior scenes were taken at the Nassau Street address and exterior scenes at Flatbush. In a picture that had both interior and exterior scenes it was a case of collecting all necessary wardrobe and props and moving to Flatbush. It must have been a sight to see fifteen or twenty people get off a train, some carrying bundles and boxes with a sword or spear sticking out, a little bit of a fellow struggling along with a suit of armor, and various other bulky properties distributed among members of the party, but it was part of the game. Very few of the actors kicked and the populace became used to seeing us doing all kinds of stunts.}}</ref> especially among [[Orthodox Jews]]. Midwood's residents predominately feature a mix of the latter and [[Irish American]]s.

Flatbush and the [[List of former municipalities in New York City#Kings County|five other towns]] of what was to become Kings County, were surrendered to the English in 1664. The town was the county seat for [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] and was a center of life for what is now called [[Brooklyn]]. The compact center of the village of Flatbush was at the intersection of what are now Flatbush and Church avenues, where we still find an old [[Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church Complex|Dutch Reformed Church]] and [[Erasmus Hall High School|Erasmus Hall]], the oldest high school in New York City.

Flatbush played a key role in the [[American Revolution]].  Flatbush was where significant skirmishes and battles of the [[Battle of Long Island]] took place. As Kings County was settled largely by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and as the Dutch were prominent in the [[slave trade]], the area was somewhat sympathetic to the [[Great Britain|British]] side of the [[American Revolutionary War]] at the beginning of the conflict.  Kings County at the time had the highest concentration of slaves north of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] – according to the first federal census in 1790, one-third of the total population for the county were slaves.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Back |first1=Adina |author-link1=Adina Back |last2=Morrone |first2=Francis |author-link2=Francis Morrone |date=2008 |title=Flatbush Neighborhood History Guide}}</ref> When a [[Loyalist]] Governor of Virginia supported freedom for slaves who supported and fought on the British side, landowners in Brooklyn were concerned that a full conflict between the Colonies and the British would result in loss of their critical source of labor.<ref>''The Ordeal of Kings County'' by Edwin G.

Historian [[Craig Steven Wilder]] calculated that between 70 and 80 percent of all Flatbush families in 1800 had an enslaved person. Johannes Lott, the original owner of the [[Hendrick I. Lott House]], was one of the largest Kings County slaveowners with sixteen enslaved people in his household. For several decades after the Revolutionary War, New York merchants and farmers continued to engage in the slave trade. The Gradual Emancipation Law of 1799 emancipated people of African descent born after July 4, 1799. Women born before that date remained enslaved until the age of 25 and men to the age of 28. Men and women escaping enslavement often went to Manhattan, where they could live within the community of free blacks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Back |first1=Adina |author-link1=Adina Back |last2=Morrone |first2=Francis |author-link2=Francis Morrone |date=2008 |title=Flatbush Neighborhood History Guide}}</ref>

The influence of Dutch merchant and farming families remained strong in the area until after consolidation into the [[City of Greater New York]] in 1898, after which the development of Flatbush as a [[suburb]], and then an integral part of the larger city, proceeded apace.

Before it was incorporated into the [[Brooklyn#History|City of Brooklyn]] in 1894, ''Flatbush'' described both the [[Political subdivisions of New York State#Town|Town]] of Flatbush, incorporating a large swath of central Kings County extending east to the [[Queens|Queens County]] border, and the [[Political subdivisions of New York State#Village|Village]] of Flatbush, formerly the heart of the current community. Many of the remaining early Dutch structures are in the [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]] and [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] neighborhoods.<ref name=fednyc>{{Cite fednyc|pages=492-495}}</ref>

Flatbush remained relatively distant from the City of Brooklyn's denser "Gold Coast" districts (such as [[Brooklyn Heights]], [[Park Slope]] and [[Fort Greene]]-[[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn|Clinton Hill]], then known collectively as The Hill) following the [[consolidation of New York City]] in 1898, but the completion of direct [[New York City Subway]] routes to [[Midtown Manhattan]] via the [[BMT Brighton Line]] and [[IRT Nostrand Avenue Line]] in 1920 connected it to surrounding areas in an unprecedented way.<ref name=fednyc/>{{failed verification|date=May 2020}}

A significant portion of Flatbush residents closely followed the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], which at the time were not only the team of Brooklyn but also of Flatbush in particular. Dodgers centerfielder [[Duke Snider]] was known as "the Duke of Flatbush". By 1958, however, the Dodgers left Brooklyn, and [[Ebbets Field]] eventually was torn down. Due to shifting neighborhood boundaries, Ebbets Field would today be considered to be in neighboring [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], as the ballpark was located just north of Empire Boulevard.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, Flatbush experienced a shift in demographics due to [[white flight]] as it transitioned from a [[white ethnic]] enclave to a mostly [[Caribbean-American]] community; in an ethnographic interview with Hamid, [[Trinidadian and Tobagonian American]] drug supplier and longtime resident "Patron" asserted that the demographic shift accelerated in 1974: "The whites started moving to the outskirts, further across Nostrand Avenue, or towards Sheepshead Bay. A lot moved out to Long Island. And blacks [West Indians] started moving in from Crown Heights, where buildings were being abandoned. A lot of West Indians bought up property, and then in the late 1970s, they too would start moving to Long Island, or to the nicer houses going towards Coney Island Avenue."<ref name="Hamid 2002"/>{{rp|129}}
By now a [[working class]] milieu (according to "Patron," large apartment buildings gradually shed doormen, porters and other conveniences following the [[1975 New York City fiscal crisis]]),<ref name="Hamid 2002"/>{{rp|129}} a handful of affluent areas remained. Prospect Park South continued to attract a sizable number of more affluent homeowners, while doctors still resided and practiced on a stretch of Parkside Avenue immediately adjacent to Prospect Park. By the mid-1980s, however, the neighborhood had numerous abandoned or semi-abandoned buildings, many of which had fallen into a state of disrepair. While crime generally had long been prevalent in the community, it worsened significantly during the 1970s, '80s and '90s.<ref>{{cite web | title=If You're Thinking of Living in Flatbush | website=New York Times | date=1983-01-30 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/realestate/in-you-re-thinking-of-living-in-flatbush.html?pagewanted=all|access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref> A number of stores on Flatbush and Church Avenues fell victim to looting during the [[New York City blackout of 1977|1977 blackout]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Looters prey on the city during the blackout of 1977 | website=NY Daily News | date=2015-07-12 | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/looters-prey-city-blackout-1977-article-1.2284260 | access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref> and a subsequent drug epidemic ravaged Flatbush during the 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | last=Rohde | first=David | title=Where Has Your Neighborhood Drug Dealer Gone? | website=The New York Times | date=1997-08-17 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/nyregion/where-has-your-neighborhood-drug-dealer-gone.html | access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref>

Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Flatbush and Midwood, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively.

=== Culture ===
While Flatbush is predominantly African American and West Indian, there are sizable numbers of Caucasians, Latinos and [[Indian American]]s living within its borders.  A majority of residents are working class, but there also are middle-class and wealthier residents who call Flatbush home. The primary commercial strips are Flatbush, Church, and Coney Island Avenues. One can find [[Caribbean food]], [[Soul food]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] and [[South Asian]] restaurants.  Most of the businesses are small, with some larger businesses also present. A large part of the culture in Flatbush is the use of "[[Dollar vans in the New York metropolitan area|dollar vans]]". These "vans" are actually [[minibus]]es that provide a cheaper alternative to riding the [[MTA (NYC)|MTA]]. Residents pay $2 to travel along Flatbush Avenue from Kings Plaza to Tillary St. While many dollar vans operate illegally, they are still a major part of transportion in Flatbush.

Flatbush housing varies in character. It generally features apartment buildings, though some rowhouses also are present.  Older, Victorian-style housing can be found in [[Prospect Park South]], and [[brownstone]]s are in [[Prospect Lefferts Gardens]].

The Flatbush community has been receiving an influx of immigrants from the [[Caribbean]], mostly from [[Guyana]],  [[Haiti]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Jamaica]], [[Grenada]], [[Barbados]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Dominica]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] and [[Belize]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} since the 1980s, as well as immigrants from [[South Asia]], primarily [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] and African countries like [[Ghana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Kenya]]. Haitians are the largest ethnic group in Flatbush.  Prior to the arrival of these groups, the Flatbush community had already been diverse, with many [[Italian-Americans]], [[Irish-American]]s, [[African-Americans]] and [[Jewish-Americans]].

==Subsections and geographic boundaries==
{{maplink|frame=y|frame-align=right|zoom=12|type=shape|from=Neighbourhoods/New York City/Flatbush.map|text=Map of central Flatbush, excluding subsections}}
The former town of Flatbush coincided roughly with [[Brooklyn Community Board 14|Brooklyn Community District 14]], which runs north-south from Prospect Park to Kings Highway. The boundaries of the neighborhood today are not precisely defined, but much of the areas below have typically been considered part of the community. The portion of Flatbush that is not part of any other community is roughly bounded by Clarkson Avenue to the north, New York Avenue to the east, Long Island Rail Road's [[Bay Ridge Branch]] to the south, and [[Ocean Avenue (Brooklyn)|Ocean Avenue]] to the west.

The neighborhoods of Flatbush extend south from the old Brooklyn City Line north of the southern edges of Prospect Park, the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]] and Empire Boulevard.
