'''ACT New Zealand''', usually known as '''ACT''' ({{IPAc-en|'|æ|k|t}}), is a [[classical liberal]] and [[right-libertarian]]<ref name="Boston2003"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Party profile: ACT Party — NZ Election 2020|url=https://policy.nz/parties/ACT-Party|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Your complete guide to NZ Election 2020 — Policy|quote=The ACT Party (Rōpū ACT) is a right-wing libertarian party that advocates free market policies and reducing the role of government.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-08|title=ACT's David Seymour: 'I don’t really care what people think and I’m still quite successful'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/08/acts-david-seymour-i-dont-really-care-what-people-think-and-im-still-quite-successful|access-date=2020-09-25|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> [[political party in New Zealand]].<ref name="Norris2005"/> According to {{As of|2011|alt= former}} party leader [[Rodney Hide]], ACT stands for "individual freedom, personal responsibility, doing the best for our natural environment and for smaller, smarter government in its goals of a prosperous economy, a strong society, and a quality of life that is the envy of the world".<ref name="Rodney Hide">[http://www.act.org.nz/news-article.aspx?id=27624 Rodney Hide] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060920224737/http://www.act.org.nz/news-article.aspx?id=27624 |date=20 September 2006 }}, "Speech to ACT Auckland Regional Conference, 30 July 2006"</ref> [[Young ACT]] is its affiliated, albeit not official, student wing.<ref name="abuseJul2020">{{Cite web|date=2020-07-23|title=Young Act sexual abuse allegations|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/page/young-act-sexual-abuse-allegations|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Newsroom|language=en-AU}}</ref>

The name comes from the initials of the '''Association of Consumers and Taxpayers''', founded in 1993 by [[Roger Douglas]] and [[Derek Quigley]], from which the party grew in 1994. An associate of Douglas, [[Richard Prebble]] served as party leader from 1996 to 2004. Under Prebble's leadership the party held nine seats in Parliament. Rodney Hide served as leader from 2004 to 2011. ACT was briefly led by {{As of|2011|alt= former}} [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] leader and [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand|Reserve Bank]] Governor [[Don Brash]] for the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], after which the party [[caucus]] was reduced to one seat.

ACT gave support to the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] from {{NZ election link year|2008}} to 2017. The party's current leader is [[David Seymour (New Zealand politician)|David Seymour]]. During the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], ACT kept its sole seat in [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]] and received 0.5% of the popular vote.<ref name="2017 general election results">{{cite web|title=2017 General Election - Official Result|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> Benefiting from the collapse of the National Party vote, ACT won 7.6% of the popular vote and 10 seats in the [[2020 New Zealand general election|October 2020 election]], its best result since its founding.

== Principles ==
{{liberalism sidebar}}
ACT states that it adheres to [[classical liberal]], [[small government]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' principles coupled with what the party considers as a high regard for [[individual freedom]] and [[personal responsibility]].<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0805/S00321.htm ACT's Pledge To New Zealand], reported on 19 May 2008</ref><ref name="Norris2005"/> ACT sets out its values:
* That individuals are the rightful owners of their own [[personal life|lives]] and therefore have inherent [[Freedom (political)|freedom]]s and responsibilities.
* That the proper purpose of government is to protect such freedoms and not to assume such responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.act.org.nz/policy_ataglance.aspx|date=5 January 2007|title=ACT Policy at a Glance|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105163327/http://www.act.org.nz/policy_ataglance.aspx|archivedate=5 January 2007}}</ref>
* All people should be equal before the law regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion or political belief.<ref name="act.org.nz">{{Cite web|url=https://www.act.org.nz/principles|title=Principles|website=ACT}}</ref>
* Freedom of expression is essential to a free society and must be promoted, protected and preserved without restriction other than for incitement, criminal nuisance or defamation.<ref name="act.org.nz"/>
* Citizenship and permanent residency should be subject to applicants affirming New Zealand’s values.<ref name="act.org.nz"/>

=== Policies ===
Former leader Don Brash promised to focus the party on controlling [[government debt]], equality among all New Zealanders, and rethinking the [[New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme]].<ref name="Coup aside, bold Brash">{{cite news |title=Coup aside, bold Brash must deliver on gamble |first=Fran |last=O'Sullivan |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10722361 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 April 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> Under previous leader Rodney Hide, ACT New Zealand had primarily focused on two main policy areas: [[taxation]] and [[crime]].

At the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], ACT advocated lowering tax rates and also supported something approaching a [[flat tax]], in which tax rates would not be graduated based on wealth or income, so every taxpayer would pay the same proportion of their income in tax. The flat tax rate that ACT proposed would be approximately 15% with no tax on the first $25,000 for those who opt out of Government accident, sickness and healthcare cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.act.org.nz/taxation-policy|title=ACT Taxation Policy|accessdate=25 July 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222055801/http://www.act.org.nz/taxation-policy|archivedate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Aligned to the lower tax proposal, ACT also wants to reduce or remove some Government programmes which it sees as unnecessary and wasteful and to increase self-reliance by encouraging individuals to take responsibility to pay for services traditionally paid for by the government.

Other policies ACT canvassed include:
* Re-instating [[private prisons]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.act.org.nz/policies | title = The 20 Point Plan - Policies in summary form | accessdate = 27 October 2008 | quote = Action: Bring back private prisons - now best practice overseas. Let private firms free up cops for 'Zero Tolerance' policing. Speed up courts (eg. night courts) to reduce unfair delays.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014042025/http://www.act.org.nz/policies| archivedate= 14 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>
* [[Welfare reform]]s similar to those instituted by the United States in the mid-1990s, based primarily on the reforms first undertaken in Wisconsin.
* A greater spend on [[defense (military)|defence]] with closer strategic alliances with Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
* Re-introducing interest on student loans.

Members of ACT's [[caucus]] in parliament voted 5 to 4 in favour of the 2004 [[Civil union in New Zealand|Civil Unions]] legislation which gave the option of legal recognition to (among others) same-sex couples. A majority also supported the legalisation of brothels by the [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003]].<ref name="prostitution-reform">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3509424 |title=Barnett celebrates 'historic moment' with prostitution bill |accessdate=27 October 2008 |last=Taylor | first=Kevin |author2=NZPA |date= 26 June 2003|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref>

ACT went into the 2008 general election with a policy that in part stated "New Zealand is not warming" and that their policy goal was to ensure "That no New Zealand government will ever impose needless and unjustified taxation or regulation on its citizens in a misguided attempt to reduce global warming or become a world leader in [[carbon neutrality]]".<ref name="policy18">{{cite web|url=http://www.act.org.nz/files/plan/policy18.pdf |title=ACT Climate Change Policy |date=6 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502091242/http://www.act.org.nz/files/plan/policy18.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2014 }}</ref> In September 2008, ACT Party Leader [[Rodney Hide]] stated "that the entire climate change - global warming hypothesis is a hoax, that the data and the hypothesis do not hold together, that [[Al Gore]] is a phoney and a fraud on this issue, and that the emissions trading scheme is a worldwide scam and swindle."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hide|first=Rodney|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0809/S00042.htm |title=Hide: Emissions Trading Bill |publisher=scoop.co.nz|work=Press Release ACT Party Speech to Parliament|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> In February 2016, ACT deleted this climate change policy from their website and ACT Party Leader David Seymour attacked the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] for doing "bugger all for the environment".<ref name="ACT deletes climate change policy">{{cite news |title=Coup ACT deletes climate change policy from their website |first=Henry |last=Cooke |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/77338800/act-delete-climate-change-policy-from-their-website |work=stuff.co.nz |date=27 February 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref>

The party has shifted to a more classical liberal stance under current leader [[David Seymour (New Zealand politician)|David Seymour]], whereas it embraced a mix of liberal and [[Conservative populism|conservative populist]] policies under former leaders [[Richard Prebble]] and [[Rodney Hide]].<ref>{{cite news|title=ACT's battle for significance|date=4 October 2017|work=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]]|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/10/03/51394/acts-battle-for-significance#}}</ref>

In 2020, the party broadly listed its policies as prioritizing economic recovery, keeping national debt low, defending freedom of expression, repealing the 1983 Arms Act, taking a tougher stance on criminals who repeatedly offend, limiting funding for universities that do not uphold freedom of speech, supporting immigration while calling for compulsory measures for immigrants assimilate and adopt the values of New Zealand and signing up to a [[CANZUK]] agreement which would enable free movement of people and goods between the United Kingdom, New Zealand Canada and Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.act.org.nz/policies|title=Policies|website=ACT}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:ACT New Zealand.png|thumb|upright|Older party logo]]

=== Formation ===
The name comes from the initials of the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, founded in 1993 by [[Roger Douglas]] and [[Derek Quigley]]. From this, they formed ACT New Zealand in the following year as a political party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Curtin |first1=Jennifer |last2=Miller |first2=Raymond |title=Political parties - Small parties under MMP |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/34331/act-leader-and-founder-2008#comment-154151 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=26 July 2013 |date=16 November 2012}}</ref>

=== 1996 election ===
In the {{NZ election link|1996}}, ACT fielded 56 [[Party lists in the 2005 New Zealand general election|list candidates]].<ref name="1996 successful">{{cite web|title= Part III - Party Lists of Successful Registered Parties |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1996/pdf/3.3%20Party%20Lists%20of%20Successful%20Registered%20Parties.pdf |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate= 27 July 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130208054410/http://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1996/pdf/3.3%20Party%20Lists%20of%20Successful%20Registered%20Parties.pdf |archivedate= 8 February 2013 }}</ref> [[Richard Prebble]] won the {{NZ electorate link| Wellington Central}} electorate,<ref name="1996 successful" /> and with 6.10% of the total party vote, ACT also sent seven [[list MP]]s to the [[45th New Zealand Parliament]].<ref name=":0">

=== 1999 election ===
In the {{NZ election link|1999}}, ACT obtained 7.04% of the party vote, making it eligible for nine list MPs.<ref name=":1">{{cite web | url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1999/e9/html/e9_partI.html | title=Election Results 1999: Summary of Overall Results | publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission | work=Electionresults.govt.nz | accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>

=== 2005 election ===
In the {{NZ election link|2005}}, ACT obtained 1.51% of the party vote, and due to winning one electorate did not need to obtain the necessary 5% threshold of the Party Vote, and hence had 1 list MP and 1 electorate MP.<ref name=":2">{{cite web | url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2005/partystatus.html | title=Election Results 2005: Official Count Results -- Overall Status | publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission | work=Electionresults.govt.nz | accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>

=== 2008 election ===
In the [[2008 New Zealand general election]], ACT fielded 61 [[Party lists in the 2008 New Zealand general election|list candidates]], starting with [[Rodney Hide]], [[Heather Roy]], Sir [[Roger Douglas]], [[John Boscawen]], [[David Garrett (politician)|David Garrett]] and [[Hilary Calvert]]. The election marked an improvement in ACT's fortunes. Hide retained his Epsom seat and ACT's share of the party vote increased to 3.65% (up from the 1.5% gained in the 2005 election). The combination allowed the party five MPs in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/partystatus.html | title=Chief Electoral Office: Official Count results: Overall status.}}</ref>

In addition, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] won the most seats overall, forming a [[minority government]], the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]], with the support of ACT as well as the [[Māori Party]] and [[United Future]]. John Key offered both Hide and Roy posts as Ministers outside [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Cabinet]]: Hide became Minister of Local Government, Minister for Regulatory Reform and Associate Minister of Commerce, while Roy became Minister of Consumer Affairs, Associate [[Minister of Defence (New Zealand)|Minister of Defence]] and Associate [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]].<ref name="NZ_Herald_10543509">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10543509 |title=Key's Government |date=17 November 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>

==== 2008–2011 ====
{{see also|Tea tape scandal}}
After 2008, some caucus MPs and organisational members became dissatisfied with ACT's coalition partner status and argued at ACT's national conference (27 February 2010) that there were insufficient fiscal responsibility policy gains for their party and that the National Party had slid from its earlier commitment to the politics of fiscal responsibility over the course of the previous decade. Throughout 2009, there had been at least one reported ACT caucus coup attempt against Hide's leadership, believed to have been led by Deputy Leader Heather Roy and Roger Douglas. However, it faltered when Prime Minister Key supported Hide's retention and threatened a snap election. In addition, the party's polling of a lowly one to two percent in most opinion polls meant only Heather Roy might accompany Hide after any forthcoming general election, if Hide retained ACT's Epsom pivotal electorate seat.<ref>{{Cite news|first= Martin |last= Kay |title=Leader warns ACT's hardliners |work= Dominion Post |date=27 February 2010 |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3382781/Leader-warns-Acts-hardliners}}</ref>

On 28 April 2011, Hide announced that he was resigning the ACT leadership in favour of former National Party leader and [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand|Reserve Bank]] Governor [[Don Brash]] who joined the party that morning. Brash's leadership was unanimously approved by the party board and parliamentary caucus on 30 April.<ref>{{cite news |title=Act accepts Brash as leader |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10722553 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 April 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> Brash promised to focus the party on controlling [[government debt]], equality between Māori and non-Māori, and rethinking the [[Emissions Trading Scheme]], with a target of getting 15 percent of the party vote in the next election.<ref name="Coup aside, bold Brash" />

In November 2011, a recording of a conversation held between [[John Key]] and the former National Party member and former [[Mayor of Auckland City]] [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]], who had been selected as the new ACT candidate in Epsom, was leaked to [[The New Zealand Herald#Herald on Sunday|''Herald on Sunday'']].<ref name="3 News">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-may-face-more-teapot-tape-accusations/tabid/419/articleID/232874/Default.aspx |title=Key may face more teapot tape accusations |author=Wilson, Peter |date=16 November 2011 |work=[[3 News]] |location=New Zealand |accessdate=16 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201110834/http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-may-face-more-teapot-tape-accusations/tabid/419/articleID/232874/Default.aspx |archive-date=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10766303 |title='Teapot tape' could nail lid to ACT coffin |author=Armstrong, John |date=16 November 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |location=New Zealand  |accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> [[3 News]] also obtained copies of the recording suggesting the two politicians were discussing issues related to ACT New Zealand's leadership.<ref name="3 News"/>

=== 2011 election ===
In the [[2011 New Zealand general election]], ACT fielded 55 [[Party lists in the 2011 New Zealand general election|list candidates]], starting with new leader [[Don Brash]], [[Catherine Isaac]], [[Don Nicolson]], [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]], David Seymour and Chris Simmons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.act.org.nz/candidates |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014041050/http://www.act.org.nz/candidates |archivedate=14 October 2011 }}</ref> The election was a disappointment for ACT, with the party's worst election result since it began in 1996. John Banks retained the Epsom seat for ACT, however the 34.2% majority held by Rodney Hide was severely cut back to 6.3% as large numbers of Labour and Green voters in Epsom tactically split their vote and gave their electorate vote to the National candidate Paul Goldsmith. Nationwide, ACT received only 1.07% of the party vote, placing eighth out of 13 on party vote percentage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electionresults.org.nz/electionresults_2011/|title=Chief Electoral Office: Official Count results: Overall status.}}</ref> As a result, ACT were only entitled to one seat in the new Parliament, filled by John Banks.

Their previous partners, the [[New Zealand National Party]], again won the most seats overall, and formed a [[minority government]]. The [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]] had ACT support as well as that of [[United Future]] and the [[Māori Party]], providing the coalition with [[confidence and supply]].

=== 2014 election ===

At the ACT Board meeting of 2 February 2014, [[Jamie Whyte]] became the party's leader-elect, and [[David Seymour (New Zealand politician)|David Seymour]] was made the ACT candidate for [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]].
