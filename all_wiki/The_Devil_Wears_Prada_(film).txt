'''''The Devil Wears Prada''''' is a 2006 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[David Frankel]] and produced by [[Wendy Finerman]]. The screenplay, written by [[Aline Brosh McKenna]], is based on [[Lauren Weisberger]]'s 2003 [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The [[film adaptation]] stars [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Miranda Priestly]], a powerful [[Fashion journalism|fashion magazine editor]], and [[Anne Hathaway]] as Andrea "Andy" Sachs, a college graduate who goes to New York City and lands a job as Priestly's co-assistant. [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] co-star as co-assistant Emily Charlton and art director Nigel Kipling, respectively. [[Adrian Grenier]], [[Simon Baker]], and [[Tracie Thoms]] play key supporting roles.

In 2003, [[20th Century Fox]] bought the rights to a film adaptation of Weisberger's novel before it was completed for publication. However, the project was not greenlit until Streep was cast in the lead role. [[Principal photography]] lasted 57 days, primarily taking place in New York City from October to December 2005. Additional filming also occurred in Paris.

After premiering at the [[LA Film Festival]] on June 22, 2006, the film was theatrically released in the United States on June 30. The film received positive reviews from critics, with Streep's performance being singled out for acclaim. This earned her many award nominations, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], as well as a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical]]. Hathaway and Blunt also drew favorable reviews and nominations for their performances. The film grossed over $300&nbsp;million worldwide, against its $41&nbsp;million budget, and was the 12th highest-grossing film worldwide in 2006.

Although the film is set in the fashion world, and mentions many real-life references to well-known establishments and people within the industry,<ref>Aline Brosh McKenna. The Devil Wears Prada. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.2005.p 18.https://johnaugust.com/Assets/DEVIL_WEARS_PRADA_Full_Script.pdf</ref> most designers and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing US ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor [[Anna Wintour]], who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories to be used in the film, making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history.<ref name="NYPost wardrobe story">{{cite news|last=French|first=Serena|title=The $1 Million Wardrobe|url=https://nypost.com/2006/06/21/the-1-million-wardrobe-of-the-devil-wears-prada/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=June 21, 2006}}</ref> Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.<ref name="Barbara Walters">{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2716887&page=3 |title=The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006 |last=Walters |first=Barbara |date=December 12, 2006 |work=[[ABC News]] |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

==Plot==
Andrea "Andy" Sachs is an aspiring journalist fresh out of [[Northwestern University]]. Despite her ridicule for the shallowness of the fashion industry, she lands a job as junior personal assistant to [[Miranda Priestly]], the editor-in-chief of ''Runway'' magazine, a job that "millions of girls would kill for". Andy plans to put up with Miranda's excessive demands and humiliating treatment for one year in the hopes of getting a job as a reporter or writer somewhere else.

At first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her gossipy, fashion-conscious co-workers, especially Miranda's senior assistant, Emily Charlton. After a disastrous dress trial meeting in which Miranda berates her in front of the entire team, she approaches art director Nigel to help her learn the ropes in the world of fashion. She begins to dress stylishly and starts showing effort for the position, accommodating all of Miranda's whims and fancies. Problems arise in her relationship with her chef boyfriend, Nate, who increasingly finds her spending all her time at her new boss's beck and call.

Miranda starts to notice Andy's changed appearance and commitment and begins to give her more responsibility and complicated tasks to handle. Slowly but surely, Andy becomes more glamorous and begins aligning herself, unwittingly at first, to the ''Runway'' philosophy. She gradually begins to outperform Emily at her job. Emily, meanwhile, is consumed with the thought of attending [[Paris Fashion Week]] as Miranda's assistant, and starts to lose her health by attempting extreme diets. At a charity benefit, she fails to provide information about a guest making his way to meet Miranda. Andy manages to save Miranda from embarrassment and is rewarded by being asked to replace Emily as Miranda's assistant at Fashion Week. Miranda tells Andy to inform Emily that she won't be going to Paris, but when Andy calls Emily, Emily is hit by a car and ends up in the hospital. Andy then tells the recovering Emily the news and Emily is infuriated. When Andy tells Nate she is going to Paris, he is angered by her refusal to admit that she has become what she once ridiculed, and they break up.

In Paris, Andy learns from Miranda herself about her impending divorce. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that he has accepted a job as creative director with rising designer James Holt. Further, Andy spends the night with an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who reveals to her that Miranda is set to be replaced by Jacqueline Follet as editor of ''Runway''. Feeling bad for Miranda in her current situation, Andy attempts to warn her but does not manage to get through.

At a luncheon later that day, however, Miranda announces Jacqueline as the new creative director to Holt, leaving Andy and Nigel stunned. Later in the car, Miranda explains to Andy that she already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel instead to keep her own job. When Andy seems repulsed, Miranda points out that Andy did the same with Emily by stepping over her and agreeing to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the [[Place de la Concorde]], leaving Miranda, ''Runway'', and fashion behind.

Sometime later, Andy meets up with Nate and apologizes, though it is unclear if they eventually reconcile as Nate found a new job as a sous chef in Boston. The same day, Andy is interviewed and accepted to work at a major New York publication company. The editor recounts how he called ''Runway'' for a reference, and was told by Miranda herself that he would be an idiot not to hire Andy. While passing the ''Runway'' office building in the evening, Andy sees Miranda get into a car and waves. Miranda does not acknowledge or wave back, but smiles to herself once she is seated in the car.

Director [[David Frankel]] and producer [[Wendy Finerman]] had originally read ''The Devil Wears Prada'' in book proposal form.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{cite web|last=Grove|first=Martin A.|title=Oscar-Worthy 'Devil Wears Prada' Most Enjoyable Film in Long Time|url=http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/hollywood/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002763479|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 28, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708134342/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/hollywood/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002763479|archive-date=July 8, 2006|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> It would be Frankel's second theatrical feature, and his first in over a decade. He, cinematographer [[Florian Ballhaus]] and costume designer [[Patricia Field]], drew heavily on their experience in making ''[[Sex and the City]]''.

Frankel recalls the whole experience as having high stakes for those involved, since for himself and the others behind the camera it was the biggest project they had yet attempted, with barely adequate resources. "We knew we were on very thin ice," he told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' for a 2016 article on the film's 10th anniversary. "It was possible this could be the end of the road for us."<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story">{{cite news|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title='The Devil Wears Prada' Turns 10: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt Tell All|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/features/the-devil-wears-prada-turns-10-meryl-streep-anne-hathaway-and-emily-blunt-tell-all-1201802311/#respond|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}</ref>

=== Pre-production ===
Fox bought the rights to Weisberger's novel before it was not only published in 2003, but even finished. Carla Hecken, then the studio's executive vice president, had only seen the first hundred pages of manuscript and an outline for how the rest of the plot was to go. But for her that was enough. "I thought Miranda Priestly was one of the greatest villains ever," she recalled in 2016. "I remember we aggressively went in and scooped it up."<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

====Writing====
Work on a screenplay started promptly, before Weisberger had even finished her work. When it became a bestseller upon publication, elements of the plot were incorporated into the screenplay in progress. Most took their inspiration from the 2001 [[Ben Stiller]] film ''[[Zoolander]]'' and primarily satirized the fashion industry. But it was still not ready to film. Elizabeth Gabler, later head of production at Fox, noted that the finished novel did not have a strong narrative. "Since there wasn't a strong third act in the book," she said later, "we needed to invent that."<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

In the meantime, the studio and producer [[Wendy Finerman]] sought a director. Out of many candidates with experience in comedy, [[David Frankel]] was hired despite his limited experience, having only made one feature, ''[[Miami Rhapsody]]'', along with some episodes of ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''. He was unsure about the property, calling it "undirectable ... a satire rather than a love story."<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 1" /> Later, he cited ''[[Unzipped (film)|Unzipped]]'', the 1995 documentary about designer [[Isaac Mizrahi]], as his model for the film's attitude towards fashion: "[It] revels in some of the silliness of the fashion world, but is also very serious."<ref name="NY Press interview">{{cite news|last=Merin|first=Jennifer|title=Jennifer Merin interviews David Frankel re 'The Devil Wears Prada'|url=http://awfj.org/blog/2006/12/13/jennifer-merin-interviews-david-frankel-re-the-devil-wears-prada/|newspaper=[[New York Press]]|via=[[Alliance of Women Film Journalists]]|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}</ref>

At a meeting with Finerman, Frankel told her that he thought the story unnecessarily punished Miranda. "My view was that we should be grateful for excellence. Why do the excellent people have to be nice?"<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> He prepared to move on and consider more scripts. Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he liked that he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 1" />

Four [[screenwriter]]s worked on the property. [[Peter Hedges]] wrote the first draft, but did not think he could do more; another writer passed. [[Paul Rudnick]] did some work on Miranda's scenes, followed by a [[Don Roos]] rewrite.<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 1">{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/devil-wears-prada-10-year-meryl-streep-oral-history-anne-hathaway-emily-blunt-1201701683/ |title='The Devil Wears Prada' At 10: Meryl Streep and More on How Their Risky Project Became a Massive Hit |last=Thompson |first=Anne |date=July 1, 2016 |website=[[IndieWire]] |page=1 |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> After that, [[Aline Brosh McKenna]], who was able to relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story,<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 1" /><ref name="McKenna WGA interview">{{cite web|last=Callaghan|first=Dylan|title=Clothes Encounters|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage.aspx?id=2064|publisher=[[Writers Guild of America]], West|date=2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527190713/http://www.wga.org/subpage.aspx?id=2064|archive-date=May 27, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> produced a draft after a month's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version,<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda.<ref name="Trip to the Big Screen">{{cite video | people = Finerman, Wendy | title = "Trip to the Big Screen" on The Devil Wears Prada | medium = DVD | publisher = [[20th Century Fox]] | location = USA  | date = 2006 }}</ref> She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship "very liberating ... I felt I was allowed to do what the movie wanted to be, a Faust story, a ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' for ladies."<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 1" />

McKenna also initially toned down Miranda's meanness at the request of Finerman and Frankel, only to restore it later for Streep.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter"/> She later cited [[Don Rickles]] as her main influence for the insults in the dialogue; before even starting work on the screenplay she had come up with Miranda's "Take a chance. Hire the smart fat girl" line, which she felt summed up the disparity between Andy and the world she found herself in.<ref name="Vanity Fair McKenna anniversary piece">{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Julie|title=How Meryl Streep Terrified The Devil Wears Prada's Screenwriter|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/the-devil-wears-prada-meryl-streep|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

In a 2017 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', McKenna revealed that the character she and Frankel had the most discussions about was Andrea's boyfriend Nate. She likened his role in the story to that usually played by a male protagonist's girlfriend or wife who regularly reminds him of responsibilities at home that he has neglected. "[W]e wanted to make sure he wasn't a pain in the ass, but he is the person who is trying to say, 'Is this who you want to be morally?'"<ref name="EW McKenna story">{{cite news|last=Schwarts|first=Dana|title=The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter knows everyone hates Nate|url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/09/28/the-devil-wears-prada-nate-aline-brosh-mckenna/|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>

McKenna consulted with acquaintances who worked in fashion to make her screenplay more realistic. In a 2010 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] lecture, she told of a scene that was changed after one of these reviews, where Nigel told Andy not to complain so much about her job. Originally, she had made his speech more of a supportive [[motivational speaker|pep talk]]; however one of those acquaintances said that would not happen: "[N]o-one in that world is nice to each other ... There's no reason to be, and they don't have time." she quoted him as saying.<ref name="McKenna BAFTA lecture">{{cite web|last=McKenna|first=Aline Brosh|author-link=Aline Brosh McKenna|title=Aline Brosh McKenna: Screenwriters|url=http://guru.bafta.org/aline-brosh-mckenna-screenwriters-lecture-video|publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904021707/http://guru.bafta.org/aline-brosh-mckenna-screenwriters-lecture-video|archive-date=September 4, 2013}}</ref>

====Cerulean sweater speech====
[[File:Cerulean sweater speech from The Devil Wears Prada.webm|thumb|right|The cerulean sweater speech]]
The "[[cerulean]] speech",<ref name="Ringer 2016 article">{{cite news|last=Herman|first=Alison|title=Everybody Wants to Be Us|url=https://theringer.com/the-rehabilitation-of-anna-wintour-2e7cce5a3c80#.b4voovokh|newspaper=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> where Miranda draws the connection between the designer fashion in ''Runway''{{'}}s pages and Andy's cerulean sweater, criticizing Andy's snobbishness about fashion and explaining the [[trickle-down effect]], had its origins in a scene cut from earlier drafts that Streep had asked to have restored. It slowly grew from a few lines where the editor disparaged her assistant's fashion sense to a speech about "why she thought fashion was important ... She is so aware that she is affecting billions of people, and what they pick off the floor and what they are putting on their bodies in the morning."<ref name="Vanity Fair McKenna anniversary piece" /> Streep said in 2016 she was interested in "the responsibility lying on the shoulders of a woman who was the head of a global brand ... That scene wasn't about the fun of fashion, it was about marketing and business."<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 2" />{{efn|In a paper comparing the film's plot to the [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche myth]], Janet Brennan Croft of the [[University of Oklahoma]] says the speech "subverts the idea that fashion, the ultimate in feminine work, is trivial", a presupposition of Andy's it is Miranda's role to correct, as it is for [[Aphrodite]] in the original myth and similar mother-mentor characters in other "heroine's journey" narratives: "Miranda's monologue on the color of Andy’s 'lumpy blue sweater and its place in a vast economic web (which she is quite frank about personally controlling) celebrates feminine power."<ref name="Psyche myth paper">{{cite journal |last1=Croft |first1=Janet Beecher |title=Psyche in New York: ''The Devil Wears Prada'' Updates the Myth |journal=[[Mythlore]] |date=2012 |volume=30 |issue=3/4 |pages=55–69 |url=https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/7985/Croft_Psyche_in_New_York.pdf?sequence=2 |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>}}

McKenna recalls that she kept expanding it to suit Streep and Frankel, but even a few days before it was scheduled to be filmed she was unsure if it would be used or even shot. She was revising it at a nearby [[Starbucks]] when she realized that Miranda would describe something not as just blue—chosen as the color for Andy's sweater since it would work best on screen<ref name="Vanity Fair McKenna anniversary piece" />—but would instead use an exact shade. From a list of shades McKenna sent, Streep picked cerulean; the final speech takes up almost a page of the script, long for a mainstream film. "I was like, it'd be cool if half of that ended up in the movie," the writer says. "Every word is in the movie."<ref name="NY Post cerulean story">{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Kase|title=The most iconic 'Devil Wears Prada' scene almost didn't make it into the movie|url=https://nypost.com/2016/06/23/the-most-infamous-devil-wears-prada-scene-almost-didnt-make-it-into-the-movie/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> The references to past designer collections are entirely fictional, McKenna explains, since the speech was written around the sweater's color<ref name="Vanity Fair McKenna anniversary piece" /> (however, the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' later pointed out, designers often take their fashion inspiration from the streets<ref name="HuffPost video piece">{{cite news|last=Krupnick|first=Ellie|title=What That Famous 'Devil Wears Prada' Scene Actually Gets Wrong|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/devil-wears-prada-scene-famous_n_4659819.html|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=January 24, 2014|accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref>).

The speech has become one of the film's most memorable moments; "Miranda's signature monologue" to ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]''.<ref name="Ringer 2016 article" /> "'Cerulean' [has never] sounded more sinister," the ''Huffington Post'' wrote in 2016,<ref name="HuffPost video piece" /> In 2018 ''New York Times'' chief fashion critic [[Vanessa Friedman]] invoked the speech in her defense of the importance of covering ''haute couture'':
{{quote|And it's not the "Devil Wears Prada" argument, though that does hold true: In a world where everything goes into the Instagram soup and from there seeps into the cultural digestive system, what might appear on a runway in the Musée Rodin (where Dior holds its shows) in July will affect what H&M does in August.<ref>{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Vanessa|title=Why We Cover High Fashion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/insider/covering-high-fashion-haute-couture.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 30, 2018|accessdate=September 24, 2020}}</ref>}}

Morwenna Ferrier, a fashion reporter for ''[[The Guardian]]'' agreed despite the speech's references to fictional collections. "As a fashion journalist I can vouch for its gist: that regardless of how immune you think you are to fashion, if you buy clothes, you are indebted to someone else's choice", she wrote in an article about how the fashion industry continues to embrace the speech's argument. "Arguing that you are oblivious to trends is a fashion choice in itself." As an example of how that had happened in reality since the film she cited the yellow [[Guo Pei]] dress [[Rihanna]] wore to the 2015 [[Met Gala]], greatly popularizing that color for clothing over the next two years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferrier|first=Morwenna|title=Why is everyone still talking about this cerulean blue jumper?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/aug/14/colour-fashion-influence-science|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 14, 2018|accessdate=September 24, 2020}}</ref>

In 2016, on the film's 10th anniversary, ''[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]'' wrote that the speech's logic also functioned as a critique of [[cultural appropriation]]. "In many ways, Priestly's monologue nailed the real problem with cultural appropriation: people not understanding the history or meaning behind something like cornrows or headdresses, but treating it like a new trend or accessory anyway."<ref>{{cite news|last=Lubitz|first=Rachel|title=How, In One Monologue, 'The Devil Wears Prada' Nailed the Cultural Appropriation Issue|url=https://www.mic.com/articles/147179/how-in-one-monologue-the-devil-wears-prada-nailed-the-cultural-appropriation-issue|newspaper=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=September 24, 2020}}</ref>

====Casting====
Once the script was finished, the filmmakers and Fox focused on getting [[Meryl Streep]] to play Miranda; Hacken recalled she was seen as so perfect for the part that no one had discussed any alternatives (although McKenna recalls writing provisional dialogue should the producers have had to settle for another actress).<ref name="NY Post cerulean story" /> Weisberger, who initially could not imagine Streep playing the part, recalled that after seeing her on set it was "crystal clear" that she was perfect for the role.<ref name="Weisberger anniversary piece">{{cite news|last=Young|first=Sage|title=What Meryl Streep Was Like On 'The Devil Wears Prada' Set, According To Author Lauren Weisberger|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/169842-what-meryl-streep-was-like-on-the-devil-wears-prada-set-according-to-author-lauren-weisberger|newspaper=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

The news that Streep would meet with Frankel was celebrated at Fox. But while Streep, for her part, knew the movie could be very successful, she felt the pay she was being offered for playing Miranda was "slightly, if not insulting, not perhaps reflective of my actual value to the project." The producers doubled it to around $4&nbsp;million,<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 2" /> and she signed on, allowing Fox to [[green-light|greenlight]] the film.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> According to Frankel, Streep saw the film as a chance to "skewer the doyennes of the fashion world." She has three daughters, and as an ardent [[feminism|feminist]], felt that fashion magazines "twisted the minds of young women around the world and their priorities. This was an interesting way to get back at them." Also, she said, the film passed the [[Bechdel test]].<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 2" />

She insisted on the scenes where she explains to Andy the connection between the blue sweater she is wearing and the ''[[haute couture]]'' industry,<ref name="NY Post cerulean story" /> and the scene where Miranda briefly opens up to Andy, without makeup, about her divorce. "I wanted", she explained, "to see that face without its protective glaze, to glimpse the woman in the businesswoman."<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

Casting Andy was less clear-cut. Fox wanted an [[A-list]] younger actress, and felt [[Rachel McAdams]], then coming off successes in ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]'' and ''[[Mean Girls]]'', would help the film's commercial prospects. However, she declined several offers to play Andy, telling the studio she was trying to avoid mainstream projects for a while.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

Hathaway, by contrast, actively sought the part, tracing "Hire me" in the sand of the [[Japanese rock garden|zen garden]] on Hacken's desk when she talked about the project with the executive. While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to [[audition]], she knew she was not the studio's first choice and had to be patient<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> (other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead).<ref name="Hollywood Reporter" /> Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|Princess Diaries]]'' movies.<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 2" /> She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects.<ref name="Ledger07">Whitty, Stephen; July 29, 2007; "Growing up in public"; ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', Section 4, page 2. "I wanted to illustrate how dangerous it was to not make your own choices ...

Over a hundred actresses had been considered for Emily before one of the casting agents taped [[Emily Blunt]] reading some of the lines elsewhere on the Fox lot as she was leaving for her flight to London following her audition for ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]''. Although she read them in her native [[Regional accents of English#British Isles|British accent]] despite the character being written as American as she is in the novel, Frankel was interested;<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> Finerman liked her for her sense of humor.<ref name="Trip to the Big Screen" /> After the makers of ''Eragon'' cast [[Sienna Guillory]], Frankel called her in the bathroom of "some dive club" in London, where she was consoling herself with her sister.

Colleen and Suzanne Dengel, the twins who played Miranda's daughters, were cast two weeks after auditioning for Frankel and Finerman. The director and producer laughed, which the sisters believed help them get the part. They recalled in 2017 that they were excited both by being able to work together on camera for the first time, as well as the chance to act opposite Hathaway since they were big fans of the ''Princess Diaries'' movies as well.<ref name="Buzzfeed Dengel twins story">{{cite news|last=Blackmon|first=Michael|title=12 Things You Need To Know About The Twins From "The Devil Wears Prada"|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/michaelblackmon/12-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-twins-from-the-devil|newspaper=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=May 11, 2017|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref>

Tucci was one of the last actors cast; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before shooting started.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned [[Barney's]] creative director [[Simon Doonan]] and [[E!]]'s [[Robert Verdi]], both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators, for the part; the [[BBC]]'s [[Graham Norton]] also auditioned.<ref name="Stanley Tucci on Graham Norton">Stanley Tucci on Graham Norton; "{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmvAYOyCm_c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313080652/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmvAYOyCm_c |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}"; retrieved March 9, 2017.</ref> Verdi would later say there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character (he would end up with a walk-on part as a fashion journalist in Paris).

Weisberger is widely believed to have based Miranda on [[Anna Wintour]], the powerful editor of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Wintour reportedly warned major [[fashion designer]]s who had been invited to make [[cameo appearance]]s as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the [[magazine]]'s pages if they did so.<ref name="Radar">{{cite web|url=http://www.radarmagazine.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/11/09/index.php#report_004079|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506172615/http://www.radarmagazine.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/11/09/index.php|archive-date=2006-05-06|title=The Devil You Know, On Line One|accessdate=2006-07-01|work=Fresh Intelligence|date=2005-11-09}}</ref> ''Vogue'' and other major [[List of women's magazines|women's]] and [[fashion]] magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages.

=== Filming ===
[[Image:Anne Hathaway shooting DWP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anne Hathaway|Hathaway]] between takes while shooting a scene in [[Midtown Manhattan]]]]
[[Principal photography]] took place over 57 days in New York and Paris between October and December 2005.<ref name="DVD commentary Frankel"/> The film's budget was $41&nbsp;million.<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 2" /> It was originally lower, which caused problems with some locations—the crew could not get permission to shoot at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] or [[Bryant Park]].<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

Ballhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, composed as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to at least partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background, to convey the excitement of working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld [[movie camera|camera]] during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few [[process shot]]s were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are having their climactic conversation.<ref name="DVD commentary Frankel"/>

Fox originally refused permission to let Frankel shoot some scenes from the third act in [[Paris]], where it is set, due to the low budget. But after six "nightmarish"<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 2" /> weeks of shooting, he had an editor cut a "[[trailer (promotion)|sizzle reel]]" of highlights. That convinced the studio to increase the budget to allow for limited shooting overseas (Streep did not go as Fox believed it would be too expensive).<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

==== Acting ====
Several weeks after all the major parts had been cast, the actors gathered in New York for a [[Read-through|table read]]. Hathaway was nervous and goofy, she recalls, since she still had not developed her idea of the part; she described her performance at that point as "[nothing] particularly impressive." Blunt, by contrast, found Streep's laugh relaxed her enough to keep her focused on playing a nervous, distracted Emily. The highlight of the session was Streep's first line as Miranda. Instead of the "strident, bossy, barking voice" everyone expected, Hathaway says, Streep silenced the room by speaking in a near whisper. "It was so unexpected and brilliant." At the reading Streep also changed Miranda's last line to "everybody wants to be ''us''" from the original "me".<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

Streep made a conscious decision not to play the part as a direct impression of Wintour,<ref name="Who interview">{{cite magazine|last=Streep|first=Meryl|subject-link=Meryl Streep|title=Exclusive Interview: Meryl Streep|url=http://www.who.com/who/magazine/article/0%2C19636%2C7401070219-1583696%2C00.html|publisher=[[Pacific Magazines]]|date=January 31, 2007|work=[[Who (magazine)|Who]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830012928/http://www.who.com/who/magazine/article/0%2C19636%2C7401070219-1583696%2C00.html|archive-date=August 30, 2007|access-date=April 30, 2017|quote=I wanted the freedom to make this person up}}</ref> right down to not using an accent and making the character American rather than English ("I felt it was too restricting").<ref name="Hugh Davies in Telegraph" /> "I think she wanted people not to confuse the character of Miranda Priestly with Anna Wintour at all," said Frankel. "And that's why early on in the process she decided on a very different look for her and a different approach to the character."<ref name="Hollywood Reporter" /> The "that's all,"{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=80}} "please bore someone else {{nbsp}}..."{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=204}} [[catchphrase]]s; her coat-tossing on Andrea's desk{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=201}} and discarded [[steak]] lunch{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=150–51}} are retained from the novel. Streep prepared by reading a book by Wintour protégé [[Liz Tilberis]] and the memoirs of ''Vogue'' editor [[Diana Vreeland]]. She lost so much weight during shooting that the clothes had to be taken in.<ref name="Who interview" />

During the movie's press tour she also said her performance as Miranda was inspired by different men she knew, but did not say which ones. In 2016 she disclosed to ''Variety'' that she took Miranda's soft speaking style from [[Clint Eastwood]]: "He never, ever, ever raises his voice and everyone has to lean in to listen, and he is automatically the most powerful person in the room." However, she said, Eastwood does not make jokes, so instead she modeled that aspect of the character on theatrical and film director [[Mike Nichols]], whose delivery of a cutting remark, she said, made everyone laugh, including the target. "The walk, I'm afraid, is mine," Streep added.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

For Miranda's actual look, Streep looked to two women. The [[bouffant]] hairstyle was inspired by model and actress [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]] ,{{efn|[[Helen Mirren]]'s hair has also been cited as an inspiration<ref name="Vanity Fair McKenna anniversary piece" />}} which Streep said she wanted to blend with "the unassailable elegance and authority of [French politician] [[Christine Lagarde]]." The costumes Field designed for that look resulted in numerous blown [[Take#film|takes]] during the [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] where Miranda repeatedly throws her overcoat on Andrea's desk when she arrives in the morning.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> When McKenna saw Streep as Miranda for the first time on set, she recalls being so terrified she threw her arm in front of Frankel "like we were in a car wreck."<ref name="Vanity Fair McKenna anniversary piece" />

Hathaway prepared for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an [[auction house]] where she was "put through the wringer" according to Weisberger, who adds that Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour.<ref name="Weisberger anniversary piece" /> Frankel recalls that she was nervous through most of the shooting, particularly when working late, since [[Vati-Con scandal|Raffaello Follieri]], her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so;<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> she was also having health issues due to a [[cyst]].<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 2" /> The director said she was "terrified" before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" then warning her that was the last nice thing she would say.<ref name="Hathaway/Streep story">Hill, Amelia; October 8, 2006; "[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1890311,00.html The secret of success? Kindness]"; ''[[The Observer]]''; retrieved January 10, 2007.</ref> Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.<ref name="DVD commentary Frankel" /><ref name="Buzzfeed Dengel twins story" />

That scene, where Andi delivers the Book, the mockup of the magazine in progress, to Miranda's apartment, was, according to the Dengels, who played Miranda's twin daughters, totally [[Improvisation#Performing arts|improvised]]. "That was just something we did with Anne and it made the cut," Colleen Dengel told ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' in 2017. Nevertheless, it took three more days of filming to get the shot of the girls up in the stairwell the way Frankel wanted it, a look she believes was inspired by a similar scene with twin girls in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.<ref name="Buzzfeed Dengel twins story" />

Streep is the one who suggested the editorial meeting scene, which does not advance the plot but shows Miranda at work without Andrea present.<ref name="DVD commentary McKenna">McKenna, Aline Brosh (2006). Commentary track on ''The Devil Wears Prada'' [DVD]. USA: 20th Century Fox.</ref> It was also her idea that Miranda not wear makeup in the scene where she opens up to Andrea and worries about the effect on her daughters of her divorce becoming public knowledge.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter"/> Blunt, for her part, contributed the line where she tells Andy "I'm hearing this", while opening and closing her hand, "and I want to hear this" keeping it closed. In 2015 she told [[Howard Stern]] that she had overheard a mother saying that to a child in a supermarket during production.<ref name="Blunt hearing this line">{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Judy|title=Emily Blunt Stole Her Most Vicious Devil Wears Prada Insult from an Awful Mom|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/devil-wears-prada-emily-blunt-quote|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=September 30, 2015|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}</ref>

==== Costuming ====
Frankel, who had worked with [[Patricia Field]] on his feature-film debut ''[[Miami Rhapsody]]'' as well as ''[[Sex and the City]]'', knew that what the cast wore would be of utmost importance in a movie set in the fashion industry. "My approach was to hire her and then leave the room," he joked later.<ref name="NYC and Fashion Frankel">{{cite video | people = Frankel, David | title = "NYC and Fashion" ''on'' The Devil Wears Prada | medium = DVD | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] | location = USA | date = 2006 }}</ref> While only [[Valentino Garavani]] appeared onscreen, many other designers were helpful to Field. Her $100,000 budget for the film's costumes was supplemented by help from friends throughout the industry. Ultimately, she believes, at least $1&nbsp;million worth of clothing was used in the film, making it one of the most expensively costumed movies in cinema history.<ref name="NYPost wardrobe story" /> The single priciest item was a $100,000 Fred Leighton [[necklace]] on Streep.<ref name="Observer fashion story">{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1806322,00.html |title=Meet the acid queen of New York fashion |date=June 25, 2006 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

When Hathaway enters the office after Nigel gives her access to ''Runway''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s closet, she is dressed entirely in [[Chanel]]. Field explained in 2016 that "I felt Annie Hathaway was a Chanel girl organically, as opposed to let's say a [[Versace]] [or [[Roberto Cavalli]]] girl." When she called the company to ask for assistance, they were delighted because "they wanted to see Chanel on a young girl to give it another point of view," showing it as a brand for "not just middle-aged women in suits, but youthful and funky."<ref name="EW anniversary style piece">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=C.

"I know her character was originally based on Anna Wintour," Field said, "but I didn't want to copy someone's style."<ref name="Field Racked interview">{{cite web|last=Fields|first=Patricia|subject-link=Patricia Field|interviewer=Elana Fishman|title=10 Years After 'The Devil Wears Prada,' Patricia Field Explains How the Costumes Came Together|url=https://www.racked.com/2016/6/28/12044896/the-devil-wears-prada-costumes-patricia-field|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=June 28, 2016|work=[[Racked.com]]|access-date=May 9, 2017}}</ref> But, like Wintour and her ''Vogue'' predecessor [[Diana Vreeland]], the two realized that Miranda needed a signature look, which was provided primarily by the white wig and [[forelock]] she wore as well as the clothes the two spent much time poring over look-books for.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter" /> "[I]n choosing her wardrobe my idea was that she's a chief fashion editor, she has her own style," Fields told ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' in 2016. "We're creating an original character."<ref name="Fields WWD anniversary">{{cite news|last=Nordstrom|first=Leigh|title='The Devil Wears Prada' Turns Ten: Talking With Costumer Patricia Field|url=http://wwd.com/eye/fashion/the-devil-wears-prada-tenth-anniversary-patricia-field-costumes-10360848/|newspaper=[[Women's Wear Daily]]|date=February 22, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

Field said she avoided prevailing fashion trends for Miranda during production in favor of a more timeless look based on [[Donna Karan]] archives and pieces by [[Michaele Vollbracht]] for [[Bill Blass Limited|Bill Blass]].<ref name="NYPost wardrobe story" /> She did not want people to easily recognize what Miranda was wearing.<ref name="DVD commentary Field">[[Patricia Field|Field, Patricia]] (2006). Commentary track on ''The Devil Wears Prada'' [DVD]. USA: 20th Century Fox.</ref>
[[Image:Emily Blunt in DWP.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Emily Blunt]] in the outfit Field created for her character.]]
She contrasted Andrea and Emily by giving Andrea a sense of style, without much risk-taking, that would suggest clothing a fashion magazine would have on hand for shoots, clothing a recent college graduate with little sense of style would feel comfortable wearing in a fashion-conscious workplace.<ref name="NYPost wardrobe story" /> Blunt, on the other hand was "so on the edge she's almost falling off."<ref name="NYC and Fashion Field">{{cite video | people = Field, Patricia | title = "NYC and Fashion" on The Devil Wears Prada | medium = DVD | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] | location = USA | date = 2006 }}</ref> For her, Field chose pieces by [[Vivienne Westwood]] and [[Rick Owens]] to suggest a taste for funkier, more "underground" clothing.<ref name="DVD commentary Field"/> After the film's release, some of the looks Field chose became popular, to the filmmakers' amusement.<ref name="DVD commentary Finerman"/><ref name="DVD commentary McKenna"/>

Tucci praised Field's skill in putting ensembles together that were not only stylish but helped him develop his character:

<blockquote>She just sort of sits there with her cigarette and her hair, and she would pull stuff&nbsp;— these very disparate elements&nbsp;— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." She'd say, "Eh, just try it on." So you'd put it on, and not only did it work, but it works on so many different levels&nbsp;— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" But it works.<ref name="Tucci in Out"/></blockquote>

He found one [[Dries van Noten]] tie he wore during the film to his liking and kept it.<ref name="Tucci in Out"/>

==== Production design ====
After touring some offices of real fashion magazines, [[Jess Gonchor]] gave the ''Runway'' offices a clean, white look meant to suggest a makeup compact<ref name="DVD commentary Frankel" /> ("the chaste beiges and whites of impervious authority," [[David Denby (film critic)|Denby]] called it<ref name="Denby" />). Miranda's office bears some strong similarities to the real office of Anna Wintour, down to an octagonal mirror on the wall, photographs and a floral arrangement on the desk<ref name="desk photos">[http://www.oficinadeestilo.com.br/blog/wp-content/office.jpg See photos here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125203351/http://www.oficinadeestilo.com.br/blog/wp-content/office.jpg |date=November 25, 2006 }}</ref> Gonchor later told ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' that he had based the set on a photo of Wintour's office he found online; the similarity led Wintour to have her office redecorated after the movie's release.<ref name="Sassybella office story">{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Helen|title=Anna Wintour Redecorates Her Office Because of ''The Devil Wears Prada''|url=http://www.sassybella.com/2006/08/anna-wintour-redecorates-her-office-because-of-the-devil-wears-prada/|newspaper=Sassybella.com|date=August 6, 2006|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}</ref>

She even chose separate computer wallpaper to highlight different aspects of Blunt's and Hathaway's character: Paris's [[Arc de Triomphe]] on Blunt's suggests her aspirations to accompany Miranda to the shows there, while the floral image on Andy's suggests the natural, unassuming qualities she displays at the outset of her tenure with the magazine. For the photo of Andrea with her parents, Hathaway posed with her own mother and [[David Marshall Grant]].<ref name="DVD commentary Frankel" /> The Dengel twins recalled being asked every day for three years straight if the Harry Potter advance copies were real; to their great disappointment they were not and in fact were "all gibberish". They eventually auctioned them<ref name="Buzzfeed Dengel twins story" /> for $586 on [[eBay]], along with various clothing used in the film, to benefit Dress for Success, a charity which provides business clothing to help women transition into the workforce.<ref name="Dress for Success auction">{{cite web|url=http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=200003242289#ebayphotohosting |title=DEVIL WEARS PRADA Hero Faux "Harry Potter Book 7"! |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lNFHKU81?url=http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem |archive-date=November 18, 2009 |url-status=dead }}; retrieved from [[eBay]].com January 18, 2007.</ref>

=== Post-production ===

==== Editing ====
[[Mark Livolsi]] realized, as McKenna had on the other end, that the film worked best when it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline. Accordingly, he cut a number of primarily transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the ''Runway'' staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't even seen them before, since Livolsi didn't include them in any prints he sent to the director.<ref name="DVD commentary on deleted scenes" />

Frankel praised Livolsi for making the film's four key [[Montage (film)|montages]]—the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introduction—work. The third was particularly challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the reception at the museum, where Livolsi wove [[B-roll]] footage in to keep the action flowing.<ref name="DVD commentary Frankel"/>

==== Music ====
{{further|The Devil Wears Prada (soundtrack)}}
Composer [[Theodore Shapiro (composer)|Theodore Shapiro]] relied heavily on guitar and percussion, with the backing of a full [[orchestra]], to capture a contemporary urban sound. He ultimately wrote 35 minutes of music for the film, which were performed and recorded by the Hollywood Studio Symphony, [[Conductor (music)|conducted]] by Pete Anthony.<ref name="Shapiro">{{cite web |url=http://scoringsessions.com/2006/05/03/theodore-shapiro-scores-the-devil-wears-prada/ |title=Theodore Shapiro scores The Devil Wears Prada |last=Goldwasser |first=Dan |date=May 3, 2006 |website=Scoring-sessions.net |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> His work was balanced with songs by [[U2]] ("[[City of Blinding Lights]]", Miranda and Andrea in Paris), [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] ("[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" & "[[Jump (Madonna song)|Jump]]", Andrea's fashion montage & her first day on the job, respectively), [[KT Tunstall]] ("[[Suddenly I See]]", female montage during [[opening credits]]), [[Alanis Morissette]] ("[[Crazy (Seal song)|Crazy]]", [[Central Park]] photo shoot), [[Bitter:Sweet]] ("Our Remains," Andrea picks up James Holt's sketches for Miranda; Bittersweet Faith, Lily's art show), [[Azure Ray]] ("Sleep," following the breakdown of her relationship with Nate), [[Jamiroquai]] ("Seven Days in Sunny June," Andrea and Christian meet at James Holt's party) among others. Frankel had wanted to use "City of Blinding Lights" in the film after he had used it as a soundtrack to a video montage of Paris scenes he had put together after scouting locations there.<ref name="DVD commentary Frankel" /> Likewise, Field had advocated just as strongly for "Vogue."<ref name="DVD commentary Field" />

The soundtrack album was released on July 11 by [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]]. It includes all the songs mentioned above (except Madonna's "Jump") as well as a suite of Shapiro's themes. Among the tracks not included is "Suddenly I See," which disappointed many fans.<ref name="Amazon reviews">Customer reviews, as of December 12, 2006; ''[https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Wears-Prada-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000FZESR6 The Devil Wears Prada]'' soundtrack; amazon.com; retrieved December 18, 2006.</ref> It became popular as a result of the film.

== Pre-release and marketing ==

Originally intended just to convince Fox to fund some shooting in Paris, Frankel's sizzle reel led the studio to put a stronger [[marketing]] push behind the movie. It moved the release date from February to summer, scheduling it as a lighter alternative audiences could consider to ''[[Superman Returns]]'' at the end of June 2006, and began to position it as an event movie in and of itself.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

Two decisions by the studio's marketing department that were meant to be preliminary wound up being integral to promoting the film. The first was the creation of the red [[stiletto heel]] ending in a [[pitchfork]] as the film's teaser [[movie poster|poster]]. It was so successful and effective, becoming almost "[[icon]]ic" (in Finerman's words), that it was used for the actual release poster as well. It became a brand, and was eventually used on every medium related to the film—the tie-in reprinting of the novel and the [[soundtrack album|soundtrack]] and DVD covers as well.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter"/>

The studio also put together a [[trailer (film)|trailer]] of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film, in which Andrea meets Miranda for the first time, to be used at previews and [[film festival]]s until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film. But, again, this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation for the rest of the film without giving anything away.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter" />

Gabler credits the studio's marketing team for being "really creative". Fox saw the film as "counterprogramming" on the weekend ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was released. While they knew that the material and Hathaway would help draw a younger female audience that would not be as interested in seeing that film, "[w]e didn't want it to just seem like a [[chick flick]] coming out."<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 3" />

=== Critical response ===
''The Devil Wears Prada'' received positive reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a rating of 75% based on 195 reviews, along with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A rare film that surpasses the quality of its source novel, this ''Devil'' is a witty expose of New York's fashion scene, with Meryl Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_devil_wears_prada|title=The Devil Wears Prada|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/devilwearsprada|title=The Devil Wears Prada : Reviews|accessdate=February 21, 2008|publisher=Amazon.com | work=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>

Initial reviews of the film focused primarily on Streep's performance, praising her for making an extremely unsympathetic character far more complex than she had been in the novel. "With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Ms. Streep's Miranda inspires both terror and a measure of awe," wrote [[A. O. Scott]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''. "No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace."<ref name="NYTreview">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/30/movies/30devi.html |title=In 'The Devil Wears Prada,' Meryl Streep Plays the Terror of the Fashion World |last=Scott |first=A.

[[Kyle Smith (critic)|Kyle Smith]] agreed at the ''[[New York Post]]'': "The snaky Streep wisely chooses not to imitate ''Vogue'' editrix Anna Wintour, the inspiration for the book, but creates her own surprisingly believable character."<ref name="Postreview">{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2006/06/29/wintour-wonderland-it-may-not-be-in-vogue-but-its-in-fashion-for-fashion-a-model-movie/ |title=Wintour Wonderland – It May Not Be in Vogue, but It's in Fashion; For Fashion, a Model Movie |last=Smith |first=Kyle |date=June 29, 2006 |website=[[New York Post]] |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

[[David Edelstein]], in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, criticized the film as "thin", but praised Streep for her "fabulous [[minimalism|minimalist]] performance."<ref name="NYMagReview">{{cite web |url=https://nymag.com/movies/listings/rv_52489.htm |title=The Devil Wears Prada |last=Edelstein |first=David |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref> J. Hoberman, Edelstein's onetime colleague at ''[[The Village Voice]]'', called the movie an improvement on the book and said Streep was "the scariest, most nuanced, funniest movie villainess since [[Tilda Swinton]]'s [[nazi]]fied [[White Witch]] [in [[2005 in film|2005's]] ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'']."<ref name="VillageVoice">Hoberman, J.; June 27, 2006; [http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0626,hoberman,73669,20.html Myths American]; ''[[The Village Voice]]''; retrieved June 30, 2006. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705042921/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0626,hoberman,73669,20.html |date=July 5, 2006 }}</ref>

Blunt, too, earned some favorable notice.

Reviewers familiar with Weisberger's novel assented to her judgment that McKenna's script greatly improved upon it.<ref name="Denby" /><ref name="NYTreview" /> An exception was Angela Baldassare at [[MSN|The Microsoft Network]] Canada, who felt the film needed more of the nastiness others had told her was abundant in the novel.<ref name="Baldassare">{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.sympatico.msn.ca/movies/articles/1375850.armx |title=The Devil Wears Predictability |last=Baldassare |first=Angela |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614182736/http://entertainment.sympatico.msn.ca/movies/articles/1375850.armx |archive-date=June 14, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] summed up this response in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' review: "''The Devil Wears Prada'' tells a familiar story, and it never goes much below the surface of what it has to tell. Still, what a surface!"<ref name="Denby">{{cite magazine |last=Denby |first=David |date=July 3, 2006 |title=Dressed to Kill "The Devil Wears Prada" |url=https://www.newyorker.com/critics/cinema/articles/060710crci_cinema |url-status=dead |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125020520/http://www.newyorker.com/critics/cinema/articles/060710crci_cinema |archive-date=November 25, 2006 |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref> Reactions to Hathaway's performance were not as unanimous as for many of her costars. Denby said "she suggests, with no more than a panicky sidelong glance, what Weisberger takes pages to describe."<ref name="Denby" /> Whereas, Baldassare said she "barely carrie[d] the load."<ref name="Baldassare" />

==== Depiction of fashion industry ====
Some media outlets allowed their present or former fashion reporters to weigh in on how realistic the movie was. Their responses varied widely. Booth Moore at ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' chided Field for creating a "fine fashion fantasy with little to do with reality," a world that reflects what outsiders think fashion is like rather than what the industry actually is. Unlike the movie, in her experience fashionistas were less likely to wear makeup and more likely to value edgier dressing styles (that would not include [[toe ring]]s).<ref name="BoothMoore">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/30/entertainment/et-stylenotebook30 |title=This fashion world exists only in the movies |last=Moore |first=Booth |date=June 30, 2006 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>
"If they want a documentary, they can watch the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]", retorted Field.<ref name="Ruth La Ferla">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/fashion/thursdaystyles/29PRADA.html |title=The Duds of 'The Devil Wears Prada' |last=La Ferla |first=Ruth |date=June 29, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref> Another newspaper fashion writer, [[Hadley Freeman]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'', likewise complained the film was awash in the [[sexism]] and [[cliché]]s that, to her, beset movies about fashion in general.<ref name="Hadley Freeman">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/06/film.comment |title=Prada and prejudice |last=Freeman |first=Hadley |date=September 5, 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>

Charla Krupp, the executive editor of SHOP, Inc., says "It's the first film I've seen that got it right ... [It] has the nuances of the politics and the tension better than any film—and the backstabbing and sucking-up."<ref name="Observer fashion story"/> Joanna Coles, the editor of the U.S. edition of ''[[Marie Claire]]'', agreed:

<blockquote>The film brilliantly skewers a particular kind of young woman who lives, breathes, thinks fashion above all else ... those young women who are prepared to die rather than go without the latest Muse bag from [[Yves Saint-Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] that costs three times their monthly salary. It's also accurate in its understanding of the relationship between the editor-in-chief and the assistant.<ref name="Observer fashion story"/>
</blockquote>

Ginia Bellefante, former fashion reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "easily the truest portrayal of fashion culture since ''[[Unzipped (film)|Unzipped]]''" and giving it credit for depicting the way fashion had changed in the early 21st century.<ref name="Bellefante">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/movies/18bell.html |title=In 'The Devil Wears Prada,' It's Not Couture, It's Business (With Accessories) |last=Bellafante |first=Ginia |date=June 18, 2006 |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref> Her colleague Ruth La Ferla found a different opinion from industry insiders after a special preview screening. Most found the fashion in the movie too safe and the beauty too overstated, more in tune with the 1980s than the 2000s. "My job is to present an entertainment, a world people can visit and take a little trip," responded Field.<ref name="Ruth La Ferla" />

During its first week it added $13&nbsp;million. This success led Fox to add 35 more screens the next weekend, the widest domestic distribution the film enjoyed.

"The core marketing was definitely to women," Gabler recalls, "but the men didn't resist going to the movie." She felt that male viewers responded favorably to the movie because they sought a glimpse inside fashion, and because Miranda "was enjoyable to watch." The release date helped generate [[word of mouth]] when people who had seen it discussed it at holiday gatherings. "They were talking about it, like a summer reading book," said Gabler.<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 3" />

It had a very successful run in theaters, making nearly $125&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada and over $325&nbsp;million worldwide,<ref name="boxofficemojo"/> a career high for all three top-billed actresses at that time.

Weisberger's novel had been translated into 37 different languages, giving the movie a strong potential foreign audience. The international box office would ultimately deliver 60% of the film's gross.

Most reviews from the international press echoed the domestic response, heaping praise on Streep and the other actors, but calling the whole film "predictable."<ref name="Observer review">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/08/merylstreep.comedy |title=The Devil Wears Prada |last=French |first=Philip |date=October 8, 2006 |website=The Guardian |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>''s [[Peter Bradshaw]], who found the film "moderately entertaining," took Blunt to task, calling her a "real disappointment ... strained and awkward."<ref name="Guardian review">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/drama |title=The Devil Wears Prada |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |date=October 5, 2006 |website=The Guardian |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref> In ''[[The Independent]]'', Anthony Quinn said Streep "may just have given us a classic here" and concluded that the film as a whole was "as snappy and juicy as fresh bubblegum."<ref name="Independent review">{{cite web |url=https://puzzles.independent.co.uk/film/reviews/article1808686.ece |title=The Devil Wears Prada (PG) Claws out, dressed to kill |last=Quinn |first=Anthony |date=October 6, 2006 |website=[[The Independent]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108015222/http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/reviews/article1808686.ece |archive-date=November 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>

In most markets the title remained unchanged; either the English was used or a translation into the local language. The only exceptions were Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela, where it was ''El diablo que viste Prada'' and ''El diablo se viste a la moda''. In Poland, the title was ''Diabeł ubiera się u Prady'' which roughly means "The Devil dresses (itself) at Prada" rather than "The Devil Wears Prada." In Italian the title was ″Il diavolo veste Prada" which roughly means "The devil wears Prada". In Turkey, the title was "Şeytan Marka Giyer," roughly translated as "The Devil Wears Brand-Names." In Romania, the title was "Diavolul se îmbracă de la Prada," which roughly means "The Devil Dresses itself from Prada", the same construction being found in the French title, "Le Diable s'habille en Prada". The Japanese version is titled "プラダを着た悪魔", which translates as "The devil wearing Prada".

{{Anchor|Accolades|Awards}}
Three months after the film's North American release (October 2006), Frankel and Weisberger jointly accepted the first [[Quill Awards|Quill]] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' Blockbuster Book to Film Award. A committee of staffers at the magazine made the nominations and chose the award winner. Editor [[Peter Bart]] praised both works.

<blockquote>'The Devil Wears Prada' is an energetically directed, perfect-fit of a film that has surprised some in the industry with its box-office legs. It has delighted the country, much as did Lauren Weisberger's book, which is still going strong on several national bestseller lists.<ref name="Quill press release">{{cite press release |title=The Quill Awards Announce The Devil Wears Prada as First Recipient of Its Variety Blockbuster Book to Film Award |date=September 26, 2006 |publisher=The Quills Literacy Foundation |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/devilwearsprada/quills.html |access-date=June 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217013933/http://www.randomhouse.com/features/devilwearsprada/quills.html |archive-date=December 17, 2007}}</ref>

The film was [[National Board of Review Awards 2006|honored]] by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the year's ten best.<ref name="National Board">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/2006/ |title=2006 Archives |publisher=[[National Board of Review]] |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref> The [[American Film Institute]] gave the film [[American Film Institute Awards 2006|similar recognition]].<ref name="AFI">{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/afiawards/AFIAwards06.aspx |title=AFI Awards 2006 |website=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>

The film received ample attention from the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] when its [[Golden Globe Award]] [[64th Golden Globe Awards|nominations]] were announced in December. The film itself was in the running for Best Picture (Comedy/Musical) and Supporting Actress (for Blunt).

When the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] announced its [[60th British Academy Film Awards|2006 nominations]], Blunt, Field, McKenna and Streep were all among the nominees.

The success of the film led to a proposed, but unrealized, American [[dramedy]] series that was in contention to air for the 2007–08 television season on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It was to be produced by [[Fox Television Studios]], with the premise adjusted for the confines of a traditional half-hour or one-hour [[dramedy]] with a [[single camera]] set-up. However, it never reached the point of even producing a [[Television pilot|pilot episode]].<ref name="TV series proposal">{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=upsell_article&articleID=VR1117951748&categoryID=14&cs=1 |title=(October 11, 2006); subscrpition req |publisher="Variety" |date=October 11, 2006|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>

The DVD was released on December 12, 2006 and has, in addition to the film, the following extras:<ref name="DVD review">{{cite web |url=http://www.currentfilm.com/dvdreviews8/devilwearspradadvd.html |title=DVD Review: The Devil Wears Prada |website=Current Film |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212143553/http://www.currentfilm.com/dvdreviews8/devilwearspradadvd.html |archive-date=February 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>
* [[Audio commentary]] from Frankel, [[film editor|editor]] Mark Livolsi, Field, screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, producer Wendy Finerman and cinematographer [[Florian Ballhaus]].
* A five-minute [[blooper reel]] featuring, among other shots, unintentional pratfalls by Hathaway due to the high [[stiletto heel]]s she had to wear. It also includes gag shots such as a chubby crewmember in loose-fitting clothing walking along the [[catwalk|runway]] at the fashion show, and Streep announcing "I have some nude photographs to show you" at the Paris brunch scene.<ref name="blooper reel">Blooper reel. (2006). ''The Devil Wears Prada'' [DVD]. USA: 20th Century Fox.</ref> Unlike most blooper reels, it is not a collection of sequential takes but rather a fast-paced montage set to music from the film with many backstage shots and a [[Split screen (film)|split screenshot]] allowing the viewer to compare the actual shot with the blooper. The many shots of actors touching their noses are, [[Rich Sommer]] says, a game played to assign blame for ruined takes.<ref name="Sommmer Fun">{{cite web |url=http://richsommer.vox.com/library/post/fun.html |title=Fun. |last=Sommer |first=Rich |date=January 3, 2007 |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118071708/http://richsommer.vox.com/library/post/fun.html |archive-date=January 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>
* Five [[featurette]]s
** "Trip to the Big Screen", a 12-minute look at the film's [[pre-production]], discussing the changes made from the novel, how Frankel was chosen to direct and other issues.
** "NYC and Fashion", a look at the real New York fashion scene and how it is portrayed in the film.
** "Fashion Visionary Patricia Field", a profile of the film's costume designer.
** "Getting Valentino", covering how the designer was persuaded to appear as himself in the film.
** "Boss from Hell", a short segment on difficult, nightmarish superiors like Priestly.
* Fifteen [[deleted scene]]s, with commentary from Frankel and Livolsi available (see below).
* The theatrical [[trailer (film)|trailer]], and promotional spots for the soundtrack album and other releases.

[[Closed captions]] in French and Spanish are also available. The DVD is available in both full screen and widescreen versions. Pictures of the cast and the [[tagline]] "Hell on Heels" were added to the red-heel image for the cover. It was released in the UK on February 5, 2007.

A [[Blu-ray Disc]] of the film was released simultaneously with the DVD. The Blu-ray maintains the same features as the DVD; however, the featurettes were dropped and replaced with a [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] pop-up trivia track that can be watched by itself or along with the audio commentary.<ref name="Blu-Ray review">{{cite web |url=https://bluray.highdefdigest.com/475/devilwearsprada.html |title=The Devil Wears Prada Blu-ray Review |last=Bracke |first=Peter |date=December 11, 2006 |website=Highdef Digest |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>

=== Reception ===
Immediately upon its December 12 release, it became the top rental in the United States. It held that spot through the end of the year, adding another $26.5&nbsp;million to the film's grosses; it dropped out of the top 50 at the end of March, with its grosses almost doubling.<ref name="boxofficemojo DVD rentals">{{cite web|title=The Devil Wears Prada (2006) – DVD/Home Video rentals|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&id=devilwearsprada.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> The following week it made its debut on the DVD sales charts in third position. By the end of 2007 it had sold nearly 5.6&nbsp;million units, for a total of $94.4&nbsp;million in sales.<ref name="DVD sales">{{cite web|title=The Devil Wears Prada: Weekly US DVD Sales|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Devil-Wears-Prada-The#tab=video-sales|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>

=== Deleted scenes ===
Among the deleted scenes are some that added more background information to the story, with commentary available by the editor and director. Most were deleted by Livolsi in favor of keeping the plot focused on the conflict between Miranda and Andrea, often without consulting Frankel.<ref name="DVD commentary on deleted scenes"/>

Frankel generally approved of his editor's choices, but differed on one scene, showing more of Andrea on her errand to the [[Calvin Klein]] showroom. He felt that scene showed Andrea's job was about more than running personal errands for Miranda.<ref name="DVD commentary on deleted scenes"/>

A different version of the scene at the gala was the subject of a 2017 discussion on [[Twitter]] when it was rediscovered by Spencer Althouse, ''[[Buzzfeed]]''{{'}}s community manager. In it, instead of Andy reminding Miranda of a guest's name after the sickened Emily cannot, Miranda's husband shows up and makes rude comments to not only his wife but Ravitz, the head of Elias-Clark. Andrea earns a silent "thank you" from Miranda when she helps prevent the confrontation from escalating by diverting Raviz with a question of her own.<ref name="2017 Glamour deleted scene article">{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=Zoe|title=This 'Devil Wears Prada' Deleted Scene Tells a Completely Different Story|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/devil-wears-prada-deleted-scene|newspaper=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]|date=August 30, 2017|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>

Althouse and many of the other participants on the thread disagreed as to whether it should have been used; those who said it was properly cut believed that it would have been out of character for Miranda at that point in the film. All agreed, as ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' wrote, that "[t]his one, brief exchange would have completely changed the movie."<ref name="2017 Glamour deleted scene article" />

==Cultural impact and legacy==

In 2016, around the 10th anniversary of the film's release, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' did a rundown of some [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend movie box results from the previous 15 years, noting how some better-remembered films had been bested by films that have not stood the test of time. It called ''[[Superman Returns]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> win over ''The Devil Wears Prada'' the "most ironic" of these victories. "[T]he degree to which ''The Devil Wears Prada'' has penetrated pop culture needs no explanation–as does the degree to which ''Superman Returns'' didn't."<ref name="VF Independence Day weekends">{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=Laura|title=Independence Day Weekend Is for Blockbusters, Except When It Isn't|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/july-4-weekend-box-office-flops-and-surprises|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=July 1, 2016|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>

The cast's opinions on why the movie has endured differ. Hathaway told ''Variety'' that she thinks many people relate to Andy's predicament of working for someone who seems impossible to please. "Everybody has had an experience like this." Tucci did not believe specific explanations were necessary. "It's a fucking brilliant movie ... The brilliant movies become influential, no matter what they are about."<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

===Cast===

The cast members bonded tightly on the set, and remained close afterwards. Blunt invited them to her wedding to [[John Krasinski]] in 2010. There, Tucci met her sister Felicity, whom he later married. "Ten years after ''The Devil Wears Prada'', Stanley is in my actual family," she told ''Variety''. "How frightening is that?"<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

In its anniversary story, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' argued that it had benefited all three of its lead actresses. In addition to Streep's record-setting Oscar nomination, the magazine observed, it had proven that she could be a box-office draw by herself, opening doors up for her to be cast as a lead in later summer movies such as ''[[Julie & Julia]]'' and ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' For Hathaway, it was her first leading role in a film intended for an adult audience. Subsequent producers were impressed that she had held her own playing opposite Streep, which led eventually to her being cast in more serious roles like ''[[Rachel Getting Married]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]'', for which she won an Oscar. "I think what people saw was promising—it made people want to see more."<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

Hathaway believes that Blunt's career took off because of her role. "I've never witnessed a star being born before," Hathaway says. "That's the first time I watched it happen." Blunt agrees that it was "a night and day change" for her—the day after the film was released, she told ''Variety'', the staff at the coffee shop she had been going to for breakfast every morning in Los Angeles suddenly recognized her. Even ten years later, people still quote her lines from the film back to her at least once a week, she says.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

===Audience demographics===

"[The film] definitely paved the way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as ''Mamma Mia!'', ''[[27 Dresses]]'' (written by McKenna) and ''[[Me Before You (film)|Me Before You]]'', that appeared to her to be trying to replicate ''The Devil Wears Prada''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. "''Prada'' reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film."<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 3" />

For Streep, the most significant thing about the film was that "[t]his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men came up to me and said, 'I know what you felt like, this is kind of like my life.' That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about ''Devil Wears Prada''—it engaged men on a visceral level," she told ''[[Indiewire]]''.<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 3" />

===Popular culture and society===

The film has made a lasting impact on [[popular culture]]. Although a TV series based on it was not picked up, in the years after its release ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled an episode "[[The Devil Wears Nada]]" and parodied some scenes. [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The American version]] of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' began [[Money (The Office)|an episode]] with [[Steve Carell]] as [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] imitating Miranda after watching the film on [[Netflix]]. On episode 18 of season 14 of ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'', [[Kris Jenner]] dressed as Miranda, channeling her 'Boss Lady' persona.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-season-14-episode-18-recap.html|title=The Kardashian Sisters Take a Break From Fertility Concerns by Playing Dress-Up|date=February 26, 2018 |work=[[New York (magazine)|Thecut.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nqIuUFCA28&list=PLX_Icid-tSv9EADw-3QGA_1-ZklKvwkC4&index=4|title=Too Many Miranda Priestlys!KUWTK}}</ref> In 2019, reports that [[Minnesota]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Amy Klobuchar]], then [[Amy Klobuchar 2020 presidential campaign|seeking]] the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nomination for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]], mistreated her staff and made unreasonable demands of them led some writers to invoke Miranda as a point of reference.<ref name="Toronto Star Klobuchar column">{{cite news|last=Timson|first=Judith|title=Maybe Amy Klobuchar needs to treat staffers better, but she can handle it|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/opinion/2019/02/25/maybe-amy-klobuchar-needs-to-treat-staffers-better-but-she-can-handle-it.html|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=February 25, 2019|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref><ref name="HuffPo Klobuchar story">{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Monica|title=How to Tell When Your 'Tough Boss' Is Really A Toxic Boss|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tough-boss-trope_l_5c644fb3e4b08da0ec815084|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 15, 2019|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref>

In 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the movie had defined the image of a [[personal assistant]] in the public mind.<ref name="NYT on personal assistants">{{cite news|last=Rozhon|first=Tracie|title=Upstairs, Downstairs and Above the Garage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/business/businessspecial3/18SERVICE.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 18, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2016|quote="The term 'personal assistant' has been degraded over the years and is now almost synonymous with the overworked, underpaid heroine of the movie and book ''The Devil Wears Prada.''"}}</ref> Seven years later, ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Francesca Mari wrote about "the assistant economy" by which many creative professionals rely on workers so titled to do menial personal and professional tasks for them; she pointed to ''The Devil Wears Prada'' as the best-known narrative of assistantship.<ref name="Dissent article">{{cite journal|last1=Mari|first1=Francesca|title=The Assistant Economy|journal=[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]|date=Spring 2015|url=https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-assistant-economy|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref> The next year, writing about a proposed change in U.S. federal [[overtime]] regulations that was seen as threatening to that practice, the ''Times'' called it the <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Devil Wears Prada''<nowiki>'</nowiki> economy",<ref name="NYT DWP economy story">{{cite news|last=Scheiber|first=Noam|title=President Obama's Overtime Pay Plan Threatens the 'Prada' Economy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/business/for-harried-assistants-overtime-rule-may-have-its-downside.html?emc=edit_th_20160531&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=70003082&_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 30, 2016|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> a term other news outlets also used.<ref name="Salon DWP economy article">{{cite news|last=Timberg|first=Scott|title=Good riddance to the 'Devil Wears Prada' economy: It's not just exploitative, it's a diversity killer|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/31/good_riddance_to_the_devil_wears_prada_economy_its_not_just_exploitative_its_a_diversity_killer/|newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>

On the film's 10th anniversary, Alyssa Rosenberg wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Miranda anticipated female [[antihero]]ines of popular television series of the later 2000s and 2010s such as ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Olivia Pope]] and [[Cersei Lannister]] in ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Like them, she observes, Miranda competently assumes a position of authority often held by male characters, despite her moral failings, that she must defend against attempts to use her personal life to remove her from it, to "prov[e], as a creature of sentiment, that she never belonged there in the first place." In doing so, however successfully to herself and others, "she has zipped herself into a life as regimented and limited as a skintight [[pencil skirt]]."<ref name="Washington Post antiheroines">{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|title=How 'The Devil Wears Prada' foreshadowed an age of antiheroines|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/06/30/how-the-devil-wears-prada-foreshadowed-an-age-of-antiheroines/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

Another character from the film has provoked a negative reaction from viewers, particularly those who have watched the film several times: Nate. "He mocks her for her new interest in fashion, he trivializes the magazine she works at, and dismisses her hard work", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote in 2017, collecting  some tweets and other posts from social media critical of the character. Many, like the writer, found it particularly upsetting that he berated Andrea for missing his birthday party even though she had a good work-related reason for her absence.<ref name="EW McKenna story" />

McKenna defended the character. "[W]hat people focus on is that he's trying to restrict her ambition,"
she told ''EW''. "But her ambition is going towards something that she doesn't really believe in, so he has a point." While she admitted he seemed "whiney" about his birthday, McKenna also pointed out that he tells Andrea later that that really wasn't what he was upset about. She gave Grenier credit for what she admitted was a "thankless" role, saying he captured "that actual college boyfriend, that guy who’s a drummer in a cool band, and plays intramural rugby, and plays guitar, and maybe took a ceramics class."<ref name="EW McKenna story" />

"Like many instant classics, ''Prada'' benefited from perfect timing", ''Variety''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2016 article observed, attempting to explain the film's enduring appeal. "It marked the beginning of the democratization of the fashion industry—when the masses started to pay attention to the business of what they wore." It credited the movie with helping stir interest in the American adaptation of the Colombian television series ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', which debuted months after its release.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

The film also has been credited with increasing interest in [[R.J. Cutler]]'s [[documentary]] ''[[The September Issue]]'', which followed [[Anna Wintour|Wintour]] and other ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editors as they prepared the issue for that month of 2007.<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" /> Writing in ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' on the tenth anniversary, Alison Herman observed that "''The Devil Wears Prada'' transformed Wintour's image from that of a mere public figure into that of a cultural icon." Once known primarily as a fashion editor, she was now "every overlord you'd ever bitched about three drinks deep at [[happy hour]], only to dutifully fetch her coffee the next day." Ultimately, the film had effected a positive change in Wintour's image, Herman argued, "from a tyrant in [[chinchilla]] to an idol for the post-[[Sheryl Sandberg|Sandberg]] age."<ref name="Ringer 2016 article" />

As the film turned 10, ''Variety''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2016 article stated, '[The characterization] showed Hollywood that it was never wise to underestimate a strong woman's worth.'<ref>{{cite news|title='The Devil Wears Prada' Turns 10: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt Tell All|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/features/the-devil-wears-prada-turns-10-meryl-streep-anne-hathaway-and-emily-blunt-tell-all-1201802311/#respond|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 23, 2016}}</ref>

==Possible sequel==

In 2013, Weisberger wrote a sequel, ''Revenge Wears Prada''. However, it does not seem likely that a film version of it, or any sequel, will be made, as two of the film's stars are not eager to do so. Streep has reportedly said that she is not interested in making a sequel for this film in particular. And while Hathaway admits she'd be interested in working with the same people, it would have to be "something totally different." ''The Devil Wears Prada'', she told ''Variety'' "might have just hit the right note. It's good to leave it as it is."<ref name="2016 Variety anniversary story" />

==Musical adaptation==

In 2015, it was reported that [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Theatrical producer|producer]] [[Kevin McCollum]] had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the films from its back catalog into [[Musical theatre|musicals]] for the stage. Two he expressed particular interest in were ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' and ''The Devil Wears Prada''. Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of ''The Devil Wears Prada'' (based on both the film and the book). [[Elton John|Sir Elton John]] and [[Shaina Taub]] will be writing the score and lyrics for the project with playwright [[Paul Rudnick]], who had written some early scenes for the screenplay,<ref name="Indiewire anniversary piece 1" /> writing the [[book (musical theatre)|book]] and lyrics. McCollum did not say when he expected it to premiere but hoped it would eventually play on Broadway.<ref name="NYTimes musical announcement">{{cite news|last=Paulson|first=Michael|title='The Devil Wears Prada' Is Aiming for Broadway, as a Musical|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/theater/the-devil-wears-prada-aims-for-broadway-as-musical.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 26, 2017|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}</ref>

In July 2019, the show held its first industry-only presentation of the initial reading for the show. It featured [[Emily Skinner (actress, born 1970)|Emily Skinner]] as Miranda, [[Krystina Alabado]] as Andy, [[Heléne Yorke]] as Emily and [[Mario Cantone]] as Nigel.<ref>{{cite news|last=MacPhee|first=Ryan|title=Emily Skinner and Krystina Alabado Starring in The Devil Wears Prada Musical Reading|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/emily-skinner-and-krystina-alabado-starring-in-the-devil-wears-prada-musical-reading|newspaper=[[Playbill]]|date=July 2, 2019|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> There has been no announcement about future workshops or tryouts before the anticipated Broadway run.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marine|first=Brooke|title=''The Devil Wears Prada'' Musical Casts Its First Reading|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/devil-wears-prada-musical-reading|newspaper=[[W (magazine)|W]]|date=July 2, 2019|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>

In late September a premiere run was announced for July and August 2020 at the [[Nederlander Theatre (Chicago)|James M. Nederlander Theatre]] in Chicago. According to producer [[Kevin McCollum]], it was important to director [[Anna D. Shapiro]], artistic director of the [[Steppenwolf Theater Company]], also located in Chicago, to have the show premiere there. Afterwards the show is expected to make its Broadway debut; where and when have not been announced.<ref name="Chicago Tribune musical story">{{Cite news|last=Jones|first=Chris|title='The Devil Wears Prada' musical will premiere in Chicago, with a score by Elton John|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/chris-jones/ct-ent-devil-wears-prada-elton-john-chicago-0917-20190917-w4ry4oqd6vbnrgvvmglch2lo6u-story.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=September 17, 2019|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>
