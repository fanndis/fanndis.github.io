'''Big Bird''' is a character on the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]''. An eight-foot two-inch (249&nbsp;cm) tall bright yellow [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Domestic canary|canary]],<ref>{{Cite news|first=Bill|last=Bradley|title=Cookie Monster Finally Tells Us How To Get To 'Sesame Street'|date=November 2, 2016|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cookie-monster-finally-answers-the-biggest-sesame-street-mystery_us_581a304ae4b01a82df6448fa|newspaper=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref name="G_Growing">{{Cite book|first1=Shalom M.|last1=Fisch|first2=Rosemarie T.|last2=Truglio|title="G" Is for Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street|year=2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-1356-6495-4|pages=39–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMiQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39}}</ref> he can [[Roller skates|roller skate]], [[ice skate]], [[dance]], [[Aquatic locomotion|swim]], [[Singing|sing]], write [[poetry]], [[Art|draw]], and ride a [[unicycle]]. Despite this wide array of talents, he is prone to frequent misunderstandings, on one occasion even singing the [[English alphabet|alphabet]] as one long word (from the song called "[[List of songs from Sesame Street|ABC-DEF-GHI]]," pronounced /æbkədɛfgi:dʒɛkəlmɪnɒpkwɜrstu:vwɪksɪz/), pondering what it could mean. He would refer to grocer [[Mr. Hooper]] as "Mr. Looper", among other mispronunciations. He lives in a large [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#Big Bird's Nest|nest]] behind the [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#123 Sesame Street|123 Sesame Street]] brownstone and right next to [[Oscar the Grouch]]'s [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#Oscar the Grouch's Trash Can|trash can]] and he has a teddy bear named Radar. In Season 46, Big Bird's large nest is now sitting within a small, furnished maple tree, and is no longer hidden by used construction doors.

Big Bird was originally performed by [[Caroll Spinney]] from 1969 to 2018.  As of 2020, the character is performed by [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] who began in 1998 as an understudy before becoming his full-time performer in 2018.

In 2000, Big Bird was named a [[Library of Congress Living Legend|Living Legend]] by the [[United States]] [[Library of Congress]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/awards-and-honors/living-legends/big-bird/|title=Awards & Honors &#124; About the Library &#124; Library of Congress|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>

==Performing Big Bird==
Big Bird was originally performed by Caroll Spinney starting in 1969. In the later years of Spinney's career, the show gradually started training new performers to play Big Bird. The apprentices included both [[Rick Lyon]] in the opening theme song of the show's 33rd season, and later [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] in the show's "Journey to Ernie" segment. Vogel became Big Bird's primary performer after Spinney's retirement.

Spinney was sick during the taping of a few first-season episodes, so Daniel Seagren performed Big Bird in those episodes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He also performed Big Bird when he appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969 and on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' in the 1970s. According to ''The Story of Jim Henson'' by Stephanie St. Pierre, the costume was built for [[Jim Henson]] to perform, but when Henson tried it on, [[Kermit Love]], who had built the costume, did not think that Henson was walking like a bird is supposed to walk, and so Henson decided not to perform Big Bird. [[Frank Oz]] was offered the part, but since he disliked performing full-body characters, he turned down the job.<ref>Stephanie St. Pierre. ''The Story of Jim Henson, Creator of the Muppets''. New York: Dell Publishing, 1991. {{ISBN|0-440-40453-3}}.</ref>

Director Jon Stone, in the 1994 documentary ''The World of Jim Henson'', revealed that the Big Bird costume actually did not have any openings that would allow the actor to see; a small television was strapped to the actor's chest to allow him to navigate.<ref>Jon Stone, Director/Writer. ''The World of Jim Henson'' (1994)</ref> The camera was set up for Spinney by technician Walt Rauffer, on the suggestion of director Bob Myhrum. Rauffer rigged the camera to a harness strapped to Spinney's chest; Spinney reported that they called the camera "the electronic bra".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gikow|first=Louise A.|title=Sesame Street: A Celebration— Forty Years of Life on the Street|publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers|year=2009|location=New York|page=36|isbn=978-1-57912-638-4}}</ref>

When Big Bird's performer is performing on location and cannot get a video feed, a small hole is made in the costume to allow him to see. In such cases, Big Bird must wear a [[necktie]] to cover the hole. This can also be seen in the ''[[Sesame Street Live]]'' shows. When Big Bird and [[Oscar the Grouch]] (both were performed by Spinney) were in a scene together with Spinney performing Big Bird, [[Jim Martin (puppeteer)|Jim Martin]] operated Oscar. When Vogel was operating Big Bird, Oscar was performed by Spinney as usual until 2015, when [[Eric Jacobson]] replaced Spinney as Oscar.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
In 2015, due to being diagnosed with [[dystonia]], Spinney no longer puppeteered the bird suit full-time, with Vogel taking over the bird suit on-set the majority of the time, with Spinney looping the dialogue later or having Vogel do the voice himself.  Vogel also performs Big Bird (voice and puppetry) in live appearances, ''[[Chrysler]]'' commercials, ''[[The Furchester Hotel]]'', and started voicing Big Bird in new material in Season 48 of ''Sesame Street'' after Spinney's semi-retirement. On October 17, 2018, Spinney announced his full retirement from the character beginning the very same week as he planned to finish his final recordings on the following day. His final performance as Big Bird (and Oscar the Grouch) aired in 2019 for the series' landmark 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|last=Itzoff|first=Dave|title=Original Big Bird, Caroll Spinney, Leaves 'Sesame Street' After Nearly 50 Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/arts/television/sesame-street-big-bird.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 17, 2018|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

==Costume and portrayal==

Big Bird was originally designed by a drawing from [[Jim Henson]] and built by [[Kermit Love]] in 1969. The design was based on a previous Henson creation, a seven-foot-tall dragon that the puppeteer created for a La Choy advertising campaign.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|date=2000|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=0316346624|edition=1st|location=Boston|oclc=42397965}}</ref> The Big Bird performer is completely enclosed within the costume, and extends his right hand over his head to operate the head and neck of the puppet. The Muppeteer's left hand serves as the Bird's left wing, while the right wing is stuffed and hangs loosely from a fishing line that runs through a loop under the neck and attaches to the wrist of the left hand. The right hand thus does the opposite of the left hand: as the left hand goes down, the right hand is pulled up by the fishing line. [[File:Big Bird (original design sketch).webp|right|thumb|Henson's original sketch for Big Bird. Left: the puppet's exterior appearance. Right: Cutaway image showing how the puppet is operated.]]

For some of the "Journey to Ernie" segments, a second puppeteer (usually Jim Martin) controls Big Bird's right wing. He is concealed by dressing in a body suit the same color as their [[chroma key]] background (which cannot be done on the main, non-chroma-key ''Sesame Street'' set).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Big Bird's body suit weighs ten pounds, and his head weighs four pounds. According to writer Louise Gikow, the heat inside the suit is "unbearable, and it's extraordinarily difficult to hold Big Bird's head."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gikow|first=Louise A.|title=Sesame Street: A Celebration— Forty Years of Life on the Street|publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers|year=2009|location=New York|page=37|isbn=978-1-57912-638-4}}</ref>

Different versions of Big Bird are portrayed in some international versions of ''Sesame Street''. For example, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] version has a blue bird named Pino. In the Latin American version (Plaza Sésamo), Big Bird's parrot cousin, Abelardo Montoya, is featured. He appears similar to Big Bird, but he is green.<ref>{{cite web|title=Did You Know That 'Sesame Street's Big Bird & 'Plaza Sésamo's Abelardo Are Cousins?|url=https://remezcla.com/lists/film/sesame-street-big-bird-plaza-sesamo-abelardo-cousins-reunite/|website=Remezcla|date=August 5, 2019}}</ref>

Big Bird's appearance has changed over the years, as has his personality. He originally had very few feathers on top of his head; his body feathers were also more shaggy and unkempt, and his body was not as rounded and full as it is now. His personality was more dopey and "bird-brained" than it later became. He gradually got more feathers on top, giving his head a more rounded appearance, and developed a blaze-like crest of lighter yellow feathers above his eyes. His body got fluffier, rounder and more well groomed as well. His personality developed over time from being a dim, slow-witted character into the childlike innocence he is known for today. Although all the ''Sesame Street'' Muppet characters are technically ageless, Big Bird is psychologically written to represent a six-year-old.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Borgenicht|first=David|title=Sesame Street Unpaved: Scripts, Stories, Secrets, and Songs|publisher=Children's Television Workshop (CTW)|year=1998|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetunpa0000borg/page/34 34]|isbn=0-7868-6460-5|url=https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetunpa0000borg/page/34}}</ref>

The costume is partially assembled by company American & Fancy Feather, using the tail feathers from [[Domesticated turkey|turkeys]]; as the feathers are rarely clean, company owner Anthony Trento calls the Big Bird costume his "toughest customer". [[Sesame Workshop]] is said to reject roughly 90 percent of all the feathers selected for use on the costume.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/04/03/smbusiness/Birds_feathers.fsb/index.htm?postversion=2008040415|title=The man who feathers Big Bird|last=Trento|first=Anthony|work=[[CNNMoney.com]]|date=April 4, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208220303/https://money.cnn.com/2008/04/03/smbusiness/birds_feathers.fsb/index.htm?postversion=2008040415|archive-date=December 8, 2008|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref>

==Species==
The book ''“G” is for Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street'' cites a producer of ''Sesame Street'' who refers to Big Bird as a [[Domestic Canary|canary]].<ref name="G_Growing" /> In an episode of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', Big Bird was asked if he was related to the [[cassowary]]; he replied, "I'm more of a [[condor]]." On the January 23, 1976 episode of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', Big Bird was asked what kind of bird he is and said he was a [[lark]], causing host [[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]] to crack up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCIeAJ5hRfE|title=Big Bird on Hollywood Squares 1976|website=YouTube|date=September 6, 2006|access-date=February 5, 2013}}</ref> In the film ''[[Don't Eat the Pictures]]'', Osiris calls Big Bird an [[ibis]]. Big Bird appeared in a [[List of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood episodes (series 11)|series 11]] episode of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', in which he declares he is a "golden condor". Zoologist Mike Dickison suggested in his popular [[Pechakucha]] talk that Big Bird represents a unique species that evolved from the [[whooping crane]].<ref name=Dickison>{{cite web|last1=Dickison|first1=Michael|authorlink=Mike Dickison|title=What, if anything, is Big Bird?|url=http://www.pechakucha.org/presentations/what-if-anything-is-big-bird|website=PechaKucha|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Big Bird is always described as being flightless.

==Use of Big Bird in the 2012 US presidential election==
During the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|first presidential debate]] on October 3, 2012, [[Mitt Romney]] used Big Bird as an example of spending cuts he would make to reduce the federal budget deficit. Romney told the moderator, [[Jim Lehrer]], "I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I'm not going to – I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That's number one."<ref>{{cite news|title=Transcript of Wednesday's presidential debate|date=October 4, 2012|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/03/politics/debate-transcript/index.html|work=CNN Politics|accessdate=October 10, 2012}}</ref>

[[Barack Obama]]’s campaign later released a satirical advertisement in which Romney described Big Bird as an "evil genius" and "a menace to our economy", and depicted Romney as more concerned with cracking down on Big Bird than on white collar criminals such as [[Bernard Madoff|Bernie Madoff]] and [[Ken Lay]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Beth|last=Fouhy|title=Big Bird flies high in 2012 presidential campaign|date=October 10, 2012|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20121010/NEWS15/121010013/Big-Bird-flies-high-2012-presidential-campaign|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006143437/http://www.freep.com/article/20121010/NEWS15/121010013/Big-Bird-flies-high-2012-presidential-campaign|archivedate=October 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Sesame Workshop]] subsequently asked that both campaigns remove ''Sesame Street'' characters from campaign materials, stating on their website: "Sesame Workshop is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization and we do not endorse candidates or participate in political campaigns."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sesame Workshop Response to Campaign Ads|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/our-blog/2012/10/09/sesame-workshop-response-to-campaign-ads/|website=Sesame Workshop|date=October 9, 2012}}</ref>

Big Bird did, however, appear on the October 7, 2012 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' during the show's ''Weekend Update'' sketch. During his appearance, he made light of the situation with the segment's host, [[Seth Meyers]], including bird-related jokes such as, when asked how he found out that his name had been mentioned in the debate, Big Bird replied, "I got a million [[Twitter|Tweets]]". When asked if he had any political statement he would like to make, Big Bird replied, "No. I don't want to 'ruffle any feathers'".

===''Follow That Bird'' (1985)===
In 1985, Big Bird was the star of his own film, ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird]]'', alongside the cast of ''Sesame Street''. The plot focused on him being moved away to live with a family of dodos by a meddling social-worker (voiced by [[Sally Kellerman]]). He is not happy with his new home and he runs away and embarks on a cross-country adventure. Along the way, he finds help from a friendly truck driver ([[Waylon Jennings]]) and two farmer kids ([[Alyson Court]] and Benjamin Barrett). But on the bad side, there are two unscrupulous carnival-owning brothers ([[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] and [[Joe Flaherty]]) who want to kidnap him and make him perform in their carnival for their own profit. In the meantime, his friends [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]], [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[Grover]], [[Count von Count]], [[Telly Monster|Telly]] and [[Oscar the Grouch]] are in pursuit of him to find him and bring him back home safely. Also joining them are their human friends, [[The Robinson family (Sesame Street)|Gordon]], [[Maria Figueroa Rodriguez|Maria]], [[The Robinson family (Sesame Street)|Olivia]] and [[Linda (Sesame Street)|Linda]] with Bob aiding them from Sesame Street.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the mid-late 1970s, Big Bird made several appearances on ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''. As with [[Mr. Hooper]], Big Bird frequently mispronounced host [[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]]'s name, calling him "Mr. Marshmallow" or "Mr. Masher". In another episode, when asked by Marshall what kind of bird he was, Big Bird replied "I'm a lark", which broke Marshall up.

[[File:Barbara Bush and Big Bird.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Barbara Bush]] participates with Big Bird in a taping of the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'' at United Studios, 1989.]]
He appeared in a [[List of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood episodes (series 11)|series 11]] episode of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe segment, in which he enters the "Draw the Neighborhood" contest.

He made an appearance as a guest star on the third season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. A portrait of Big Bird also appeared in the pilot ''[[The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence]]''.

Big Bird also made brief appearances in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]''.

He appeared in ''[[A Muppet Family Christmas]]'' holiday special, in which he dissuades the [[Swedish Chef]] from cooking him for Christmas dinner by offering him a gift of homemade chocolate covered birdseed. They then sing a duet of "The Christmas Song".

===Henson memorial service (1990)===
On May 21, 1990, Big Bird appeared at Jim Henson's memorial service at [[the Cathedral of St. John the Divine]] in [[New York City]], singing [[Kermit the Frog]]'s signature song, "[[Bein' Green]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=Barry |first=Chris |title=Saying "Goodbye" to Jim |date=September 7, 2005 |work=JimHillMedia.com |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/guest_writers1/b/chris_barry/archive/2005/09/08/1722.aspx#.Unj7m_lON8E |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> Performer Spinney nearly broke down several times during the deeply touching performance, which was later described by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' as "an epic and almost unbearably moving event".

===21st century===
Big Bird made a non-speaking appearance in ''[[The West Wing]]'' Season 5 episode "[[Eppur Si Muove (The West Wing)|Eppur Si Muove]]". During a visit by [[The Muppets]] to the White House, Big Bird sat down on a bench next to [[C. J. Cregg]], who had complained during the episode of past comparisons to Big Bird due to her height.

He appeared briefly at Qualcomm's [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] Keynote on January 7, 2013 to show off [[Sesame Workshop]]'s newest app, 'Big Bird's Words', due in Summer 2013.<ref>Shara Tibken [http://live.cnet.com/Event/CES_2013_Qualcomm_keynote_live_blog CES 2013: Qualcomm keynote live blog]. [[CNET]]</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2020|reason=}}

He appeared in the final episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' along with [[Cookie Monster]] and dozens of other celebrities singing "[[We'll Meet Again]]".
