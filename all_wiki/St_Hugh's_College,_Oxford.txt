'''St Hugh's College''' is one of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|constituent colleges]] of the [[University of Oxford]]. It is located on a {{convert|14.5|acre|ha|abbr=off|adj=on}} site on [[St Margaret's Road]], to the north of the city centre.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/senior-members/oucc-at-st-hughs |title=St Hugh's College &#124; University of Oxford China Centre |publisher=St-hughs.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> It was founded in 1886 by [[Elizabeth Wordsworth]] as a women's college, and accepted its first male students in its centenary year in 1986.

It enjoys a reputation as one of the most attractive colleges because of its extensive, pleasant gardens.<ref>Wintle, Justin (2008) ''Perfect Hostage''.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
St Hugh's was founded in 1886 by [[Elizabeth Wordsworth]] (great-niece of the famous poet [[William Wordsworth]]) to help the growing number of women "who find the charges of the present Halls at Oxford and Cambridge (even the most moderate) beyond their means".<ref>''St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2010''; p. 2</ref> Using money left to her by her father, who had been Bishop of Lincoln, she established the college at 25 [[Norham Road]] in North Oxford.<ref>Judy G. Batson, ''Her Oxford'', [[Vanderbilt University Press]], 2008. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_stU5CyTGKEC&pg=PA51 St. Hugh's: Life on a Shoestring, pp. 51–56]. {{ISBN|978-0-8265-1610-7}}.</ref> She named the college after one of her father's 13th-century predecessors, [[Hugh of Avalon]], who was canonised in 1220, and in whose diocese Oxford had been.

The college was initially accommodated in properties in Norham Road, [[Norham Gardens]] and Fyfield Road.<ref name="nl2011p9">''St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011''; p. 9</ref> Its first six students were Annie Moberly, Jessie Annie Emmerson, Charlotte Jourdain, Constance E. Ashburner, Wilhelmina J. de Lorna Mitchell and Grace J. Parsons.<ref name="nl2011p13"/> Students were required to ask the principal before accepting invitations to visit friends, and the college gates were locked at 9pm.<ref name="nl2011p13"/> Records show that rent was between £18 and £21 a term depending on the size of the room, with fires being charged extra.<ref name="nl2011p14">''St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011''; p. 14</ref>

The college began to move to its present site in 1913, when it purchased the lease of a house called "The Mount" from the Rev Robert Hartley for £2,500. This house was situated on the corner of St Margaret's Road and Banbury Road, and was owned by University College.<ref name="nl2011p9"/> The house was demolished to make way for the Main Building of the college, which was constructed between 1914 and 1916 thanks to a gift from [[Clara Mordan|Clara Evelyn Mordan]]; the college's new library was named Mordan Hall in her honour.<ref name="nl2011p13">''St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011''; p. 13</ref> The first book was a copy of [[George Sale|Sale's]] translation of the [[Koran]], which was given to the college by the then Bishop of Tokyo.<ref name="nl2011p12">St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011 at page 12</ref>

The college soon took over other properties nearby. The leasehold of 4 St Margaret's Road was acquired in 1919; it became the first "College house".<ref name="nl2011p9"/> The leasehold of 82 Woodstock Road was donated to the college by [[Joan Evans (art historian)|Joan Evans]] in 1924 and 89 Banbury Road was purchased from Lincoln College for £7,000 in 1927.<ref name="nl2011p9"/> The college obtained the freehold to the main site in 1927 and a year later the first stage of the Mary Gray Allen building was constructed by building over the tennis courts.<ref name="nl2011p9"/> The freeholds of 1–4 St Margaret's Road and 74–82 Woodstock Road were purchased from St John's College in 1931 and 1932 respectively.<ref name="nl2011p9"/> The college received a Royal Charter in 1926.<ref>[http://d307gmaoxpdmsg.cloudfront.net/collegeaccounts0910/St_Hughs.pdf at page 2]</ref>

Between 1935 and 1936 1 St Margaret's Road was demolished and a new library was built in the Mary Gray Allen building; it was named the Moberly Library after the first principal of the college<ref name="nl2011p9"/> (the library was extensively renovated between 1999 and 2000 and renamed the Howard Piper Library after a St Hugh's alumnus, after his parents made a large donation to the college).

=== Second World War ===
At the outbreak of the Second World War the college site was requisitioned by the military for use as the Hospital for Head Injuries under the directorship of [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Hugh Cairns]], the first Nuffield Professor of Surgery.<ref name="nl2011p20">St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011 at page 20</ref> Brick huts were constructed in the college grounds with space for 300 beds. Between 1940 and 1945, over 13,000 servicemen and women were treated at the college.<ref name="nl2011p20"/> Advances in medicine discovered at the hospital meant the mortality rate for brain-penetrating injuries fell from 90% to 9%.<ref name="nl2011p20"/> Staff and students were relocated to Holywell Manor, Savile House and St Hilda's College for the duration of the war.<ref name="nl2011p10">St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011 at page 10</ref>

In 1943 the college acquired the leasehold of 72 Woodstock Road (known as The Shrubbery) from Dame Gertrude Whitehead for £1,500. It was used as a club for American soldiers during the war.<ref name="nl2011p10"/> In 1946, it was leased to the University of Paris as the [[Maison française d'Oxford]], an Anglo-French educational establishment. One of the cottages in the grounds of number 72 was later leased by Barbara Gwyer after her retirement as principal.<ref name="nl2011p10"/>

=== 1945 onwards ===
The college buildings were de-requisitioned in 1945. The hospital huts were initially leased as offices to university departments, including the Bureau of Animal Population, the Department of Zoological Field Studies and the Institute of Statistics, before being demolished in 1952.<ref name="nl2011p10"/> [[Agnes Headlam-Morley]], a fellow of St Hugh's, became the first woman to hold a chair at the University of Oxford in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women at Oxford|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-people/women-at-oxford|website=University of Oxford|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref>

In 1951 the college purchased the freeholds to 85 and 87 Banbury Road and 9 to 13 Canterbury Road from St John's College. In addition, the freehold of The Shrubbery was acquired; this meant the college now owned the freehold of the entire {{frac|14|1|2}}-acre site.<ref name="nl2011p10"/> The college extended the Main Building in 1958.<ref name="nl2011p11">St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011 at page 11</ref>

The 1960s saw an extensive programme of building work at St Hugh's. The Shrubbery was converted into the principal's lodgings in 1963.<ref name="nl2011p11"/> Between 1964 and 1965 the Kenyon Building was constructed to provide accommodation for students<ref name="nl2011p11"/> (designed by modern architect [[David Wyn Roberts|David Roberts]], the building has already been given a [[Listed building|heritage listing]]).<ref>{{NHLE|desc=St Hugh’s College Kenyon Building |num=1392941 |accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> This was followed shortly after by the Wolfson Building, which was constructed between 1966 and 1967 and opened by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] in his role as chancellor of the university.<ref name="nl2011p11"/>

The chapel was renovated in 1980; a new organ was installed.<ref name="nl2011p11"/> The following year, 78, 80 and 82 Woodstock Road were also renovated. The houses are now named SH Ho House, Ho Tim House and KK Leung House in recognition of the gifts from the three Hong Kong benefactors that funded the renovations.<ref name="nl2011p11"/>

[[File:Oxford boathouse 1.jpg|thumb|St Hugh's boathouse (far left)]]
A new boathouse was constructed for the [[St Hugh's Boat Club]] (jointly with St Anne's and Wadham Colleges) between 1989 and 1990. This was followed by the construction of the Rachel Trickett Building between 1991 and 1992 at a cost of £3.4 million.<ref name="nl2011p12"/>

=== Present day ===
[[File:North side of St Hugh's College, Oxford.JPG|thumb|North side from St Margaret's Road]]
Between 1998 and 2000 the Maplethorpe Building was constructed; the building contains conference facilities on the ground floor and student accommodation on the upper three floors.<ref name="nl2011p12"/> The building missed its planned opening date of summer 2000, meaning students had to be accommodated in B&Bs throughout Michaelmas term. In addition, a new main entrance was constructed at the back of the college on Canterbury Road.<ref name="nl2011p12"/>

Between 1999 and 2000 the library was extensively renovated.<ref name="nl2011p12"/> It was reopened by [[Betty Boothroyd]] and was renamed after Howard Piper, a Maths student of the college who, shortly after graduating, died in a rafting accident. A major refurbishment of Mordan Hall, the old library, took place in 2007.<ref name="nl2011p12"/>

There are statues of both St Hugh and Elizabeth Wordsworth on the library stairs. These were presented to the college as gifts for its Jubilee in 1936. St Hugh carries a model of Lincoln Cathedral, which would have been very familiar to Elizabeth Wordsworth, and has his other hand resting on the head of a swan, probably the famous swan of [[Stow, Lincolnshire|Stow]], although the swan is also a symbol of purity. Elizabeth Wordsworth is depicted wearing her doctoral robes.

St Hugh's College celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2011; a summer garden party was attended by over 1,200 guests.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/senior-members/news ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723100154/http://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/senior-members/news |date=23 July 2012 }}</ref> [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] sent a message to the college, saying "Happy moments are one of the pillars that keep the spirit uplifted during hard times. St Hugh’s and Oxford are inextricable from my happiest memories, those that I could draw on when the beauty of the world seemed dim. I so wish I could be with you at this very moment to relive old joys and to stir up new ones for the future. I would like to thank all my friends for the happiness we shared. To the present students of St Hugh’s I would simply like to say: Make the most of your time in this wonderful place."<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

In 2012 the college was sued for allegedly discriminating against the poor by requiring evidence of funds for living costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9814000/Oxford-college-sued-for-discriminating-against-the-poor.html|title=Oxford college 'sued for discriminating against the poor'|date=20 January 2013|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> St Hugh's, which filed defence papers to the court, accepted barring the student on financial grounds, but claimed the measure was necessary to ensure students can complete their studies. The college eventually settled the claim, with the university promising to conduct a review of the Financial Guarantee policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/mar/23/oxford-university-settles-selection-wealth-case|title=Oxford University settles 'selection by wealth' case|author=Daniel Boffey|work=The Guardian}}</ref> In September 2013, it was revealed that the university had decided to abolish the Financial Guarantee policy and replace it with a less restrictive 'Financial Declaration'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/08/oxford-university-wealth-tax|title=Oxford University axes 'wealth test' for post-grads|author=Daniel Boffey|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

=== Recent development ===
In 2008, the college began a fundraising drive for a new building on the college site. In November 2010, it was confirmed that Hong Kong businessman [[Dickson Poon]] had made a £10 million donation to the college for the construction of the Dickson Poon China Centre. The centre houses the university's China Studies department, as well as providing accommodation for St Hugh's postgraduate students.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The Dickson Poon building was opened by Prince William in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/11460207.Oh_baby__Royal_fans_pass_on_best_to_Kate/|title=Oh baby!

== Buildings and location ==
St Hugh's occupies a rectangular site in [[North Oxford]]. It is bordered by Banbury Road to the east, Woodstock Road to the west, St Margaret's Road to the north (the front entrance) and Canterbury Road to the south (the back gate). The gardens of the college cover about ten and a half acres.<ref>''Alden's Oxford Guide'. Oxford: Alden  & Co., 1958; p. 123</ref><ref>"Of the women's colleges S. Hugh's has indisputably the best garden, and for many years now it has been under the loving care of Miss Rogers. It is a well-planned garden, and ... full of interest all the year round."--Rohde, Eleanour Sinclair (1932) ''Oxford's College Gardens''. London: Herbert Jenkins; pp. 173-78</ref>

The main entrance of the college leads straight to the Main Building, which usually accommodates first year students,<ref name="altprosp6">{{cite web|url=http://jcr.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/3979/Alternitive-Prospectus.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818213132/http://jcr.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/3979/Alternitive-Prospectus.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 August 2011|title=St Hugh's College Alternative Prospectus|publisher=St Hugh's JCR|page=6|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref> and also houses the chapel and the dining hall. Other first year students may be accommodated in the 1960s Kenyon Building,<ref name="altprosp6" /> named for [[Kathleen Kenyon|Dame Kathleen Kenyon]]. Second years live in either the [[Rachel Trickett]] Building, named after a past principal of the college, or the [[Mary Gray Allen]] Building. Wolfson Building consists of nine staircases. Finalists usually live in the newer Maplethorpe Building,<ref name="altprosp7" /> whose rooms have en-suite facilities; clusters of eight rooms share a kitchen on each of the three floors, with four staircases altogether. All the rooms have views of gardens.

== Finances ==
In its 125th anniversary year, the college became a registered charity under the name 'The Principal and Fellows of St Hugh's College in the University of Oxford'.<ref name="charity-commission.gov.uk" /> As of July 2018, the college's [[financial endowment]] was £37.6 million.<<ref name="sthughs1718">{{cite web|url=http://d307gmaoxpdmsg.cloudfront.net/collegeaccounts1718/St_Hughs.pdf|title=St Hugh's College : Annual Report and Financial Statements : Year ended 31 July 2018|website= ox.ac.uk|page=25|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref> This was amongst the lowest of the Oxford colleges; by comparison, St John's college had a financial endowment of  £551.5 million.<ref name="stjohns1718">{{cite web|url=http://d307gmaoxpdmsg.cloudfront.net/collegeaccounts1718/St_Johns.pdf|title=Saint John Baptist College in the University of Oxford : Annual Report and Financial Statements : Year ended 31 July 2018|website= ox.ac.uk|page=18|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref>

== Student life ==
[[File:St Hugh's Front.jpg|The front entrance of the college|thumb]]
The college is big enough to accommodate all its undergraduates for the duration of their studies.<ref>[https://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/prospectivestudents/undergraduate/ "Your Academic Home"]. www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2018-08-09.</ref> There are three large lawns for the use of students all year round. The gardens are also the venue for [[croquet]]. There are a wide range of clubs and societies – sporting, academic, and those supporting niche interests, such as horticulture.

Like other more recently founded Oxford and Cambridge colleges, the college has Formal Hall—a formal three or four course dinner served with wine—once a week. Grace is said by the presiding fellow, usually the principal, immediately prior to the meal: ''Benedic nobis, Domine Deus, et his donis, quae ex liberalitate Tua sumpturi sumus, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.''

=== Junior Common Room ===
As is the practice at all Oxford Colleges that offer undergraduate degrees, the undergraduate body is represented by a committee, known as the JCR Committee. The committee is made up of 16 representatives and seeks to ensure that the undergraduates are provided for in academic, welfare and social matters.

Otherwise, 'JCR' refers to the physical common room in the college. The JCR was previously known as the Aung San Suu Kyi Junior Common Room, but in 2017 the student body voted to remove her name from the room's title.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aung San Suu Kyi common room 'unnamed' by Oxford students |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-41691704 |accessdate=27 April 2020 |publisher=BBC Oxford |date=20 October 2017}}</ref>

''The Swan'' is a weekly student-managed newspaper.<ref>[http://jcr.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/sports-clubs/the-swan-newspaper The Swan on the official JCR website]</ref> It was founded in 2010.

=== Middle Common Room ===
The college is also home to a Middle Common Room (MCR) Committee. The committee, elected every year, regularly hosts social events for the graduate students.

The MCR building is located on 87 Banbury Road.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mcr.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/|title=About St Hugh's MCR {{!}} MCR - St Hugh's College, Oxford|last=http://mcr.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/|work=MCR - St Hugh's College, Oxford|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Choir ===
St. Hugh's has a choir which sings weekly [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|evensong]] on Sundays. The choir draws its members from all three common rooms, and has performed for a wide variety of different guests.

The present organ was constructed by the Italian organ-builder Tamburini<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jcr.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/extras/FreshersGuide2009.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818213508/http://jcr.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/extras/FreshersGuide2009.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 August 2011|title=St Hugh's Freshers Guide 2009|page=91|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref> in 1980. The college offers [[organ scholar]]ships along with four choral exhibitions each year, and employs a professional organist to oversee the chapel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/about-sthughs/college-life/college-chapel/chapel-music|title=St Hugh's College - Chapel Music|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>
