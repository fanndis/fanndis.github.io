Perhaps most significantly, the Apple II was a catalyst for personal computers across many industries; it opened the doors to software marketed at consumers.<ref name=":0" />

==Overview==
In the May 1977 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|''Byte'']], [[Steve Wozniak]] published a detailed description of his design; the article began, "To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive."<ref name="wozniak197705">{{cite news |url = https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1977-05/1977_05_BYTE_02-05_Interfacing#page/n35/mode/2up |title = System Description / The Apple-II |work = BYTE |date = May 1977 |accessdate = October 17, 2013 |last = Wozniak |first = Steve |pages = 34–43 }}</ref>

The Apple II used peculiar engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs, such as:

* Taking advantage of the way the 6502 processor accesses memory: occurs only on alternate phases of the clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused phase avoids memory contention issues and interruptions of the video stream. 
* This arrangement simultaneously eliminated the need for a separate [[Memory refresh|refresh]] circuit for the [[DRAM]] chips, as the video transfer accessed each row of the dynamic memory within the [[Memory refresh#Refresh interval|timeout]] period. In addition, it did not require separate RAM chips for the video RAM, while the PET and TRS-80 had SRAMs for the video.
* Rather than use a complex [[analog-to-digital]] circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.
* A single 14.31818&nbsp;MHz master oscillator (f<sub>M</sub>) was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies, including the microprocessor clock signals (f<sub>M</sub>/14), the video transfer counters, and the color-burst samples (f<sub>M</sub>/4).

The text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement. For instance, the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory. This complexity was reportedly due to Wozniak's realization that the method would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect (as described above). This method had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color is determined by pixel position and thus can be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for [[subpixel]] font rendering, since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title = The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher = Gibson Research Corporation |last = Gibson |first = Steve |accessdate = August 4, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |archive-date = July 21, 2006  |url-status = live }}</ref>

The Apple II at first used [[data cassette]] storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978, the company introduced an external {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's [[expansion slot]]s (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web |title = 5-The Disk II |url = http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |publisher = Apple II History |first = Steven |last = Weyhrich |date = December 28, 2001 |accessdate = November 16, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061201122002/http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |archive-date = December 1, 2006 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1 = Freiberger |first1 = Paul |author-link1 = Paul Freiberger |first2 = Michael |last2 = Swaine |author-link2 = Michael Swaine (technical author) |title = Fire In The Valley, Part Two |work = A+ Magazine |type = Book excerpt |date = January 1985 |page = 45 }}</ref>

The approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM ([[programmable read-only memory]]), he created a functional floppy disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.

==Case design==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}

Steve Jobs extensively pushed to give the Apple II a case that looked visually appealing and sellable to people outside of electronics hobbyists, rather than the generic wood and metal boxes typical of early microcomputers. The result was a futuristic-looking molded white plastic case. Jobs also paid close attention to the keyboard design and decided to use dark brown keycaps as it contrasted well with the case.

The first production Apple II's had hand-molded cases; these had visible bubbles and other lumps in them from the imperfect plastic molding process, which was soon switched to machine molding. In addition, the initial case design had no vent openings, causing high heat buildup from the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] and resulting in the plastic softening and sagging. Apple added vent holes to the case within three months of production; customers with the original case could have them replaced at no charge.

==PCB revisions==
The Apple II's [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) underwent several revisions as Steve Wozniak made modifications to it. The earliest version was known as Revision 0, and the first 6,000 units shipped used it. Later revisions added a color killer circuit to prevent color fringing when the computer was in text mode, as well as modifications to improve the reliability of cassette I/O. Revision 0 Apple IIs powered up in an undefined mode and had garbage on-screen, requiring the user to press Reset. This was eliminated on the later board revisions. Revision 0 Apple IIs could display only 4 colors in hi-res mode, but Wozniak was able to increase this to 6 hi-res colors on later board revisions.

The PCB had three [[RAM]] banks for a total of 24 RAM chips. Original Apple IIs had jumper switches to adjust the RAM size, and RAM configurations could be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, or 48&nbsp;KiB. The three smallest memory configurations used 4kx1 [[DRAM]]s, with larger ones using 16kx1 DRAMs, or mix of 4-kilobyte and 16-kilobyte banks (the chips in any one bank have to be the same size). The early [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]] models retained this feature, but after a drop in DRAM prices, Apple redesigned the circuit boards without the jumpers so that only 16kx1 chips were supported. A few months later they started shipping all machines with a full 48&nbsp;KiB complement of DRAM.

Unlike most machines, all [[integrated circuit]]s on the Apple II PCB were socketed; although this cost more to manufacture and created the possibility of loose chips causing a system malfunction, it was considered preferable to make servicing and replacement of bad chips easier.

The Apple II PCB lacks any means of generating an [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]], although expansion cards may generate one. Program code had to stop everything to perform any [[Input/output|I/O]] task; like many of the computer's other idiosyncrasies, this was due to cost reasons and Steve Wozniak assuming interrupts were not needed for gaming or using the computer as a teaching tool.

==Display and graphics==
{{Main|Apple II graphics}}
Color on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the [[NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black and white. Color was added later by adding a 3.58-megahertz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by black-and-white TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting [[composite artifact colors]].

The Apple II display provides two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Blue and orange are available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors by compressing more (and narrower) pixels into each subcarrier cycle.

The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replace the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode use the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both.

A single HGR page occupied 8&nbsp;KiB of RAM; in practice this meant that the user had to have at least 12&nbsp;KiB of total RAM to use HGR mode and 20&nbsp;KiB to use two pages. Early Apple II games from the 1977 to 79 period often ran only in text or low resolution mode to support users with small memory configurations; HGR not being near universally supported by games until 1980.

==Sound==
Rather than a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II has a toggle circuit that can only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two-, three- and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) are generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Similar techniques are used for cassette storage: the cassette output works the same as the speaker, and the input is a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that serves as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.

==Programming languages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}

Initially, the Apple II was shipped with Integer BASIC encoded in the motherboard [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips. Written by Wozniak, the interpreter enabled users to write software applications without needing to purchase additional development utilities. Written with game programmers and hobbyists in mind, the language only supported the encoding of numbers in 16-bit integer format. Since it only supported integers between -32768 and +32767 (signed 16-bit integer), it was less suitable to business software and Apple soon received complaints from customers. Because Steve Wozniak was busy developing the Disk II hardware, he did not have time to modify Integer BASIC for floating point support. Apple instead licensed Microsoft's 6502 BASIC to create [[Applesoft BASIC]]. 

Disk users normally purchased a so-called Language Card which had Applesoft in ROM and sat below the Integer BASIC ROM in system memory. The user could switch between either BASIC by typing FP or INT at the BASIC prompt. Apple also offered a different version of Applesoft for cassette users which occupied low memory and was started by using the LOAD command in Integer BASIC.

As shipped, the Apple II incorporated a [[machine code monitor]] with commands for displaying and altering the computer's RAM, either one byte at a time or in blocks of 256 bytes at once. This enabled programmers to write and debug machine code programs without further development software. The computer powers on into the monitor ROM displaying a * prompt. From there, Ctrl+B enters BASIC or a machine language program can be loaded from cassette. Disk software can be booted with Ctrl+P followed by 6, referring to Slot 6 which normally contained the Disk II controller.

A 6502 assembler was soon offered on disk, and later the [[UCSD]] compiler and operating system for the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] language were made available. The Pascal system requires a 16&nbsp;KiB RAM card to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) in addition to the full 48&nbsp;KiB of motherboard memory.

==Manual==
The first 1,000 or so Apple IIs shipped in 1977 with a 68-page [[mimeograph]]ed "Apple II Mini Manual", hand-bound with brass paper fasteners. This was the basis for the ''Apple II Reference Manual,'' which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book. The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the "Monitor" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]].

==Third-party devices and applications==
When the Apple II initially shipped in June 1977, no expansion cards were available for the slots. This meant that the user did not have any way of connecting a modem or a printer. One popular hack involved connecting a teletype machine to the cassette output.

Wozniak's [[open architecture|open-architecture]] design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and [[Apple II system clocks|realtime clocks]]. There were plug-in [[Apple II processor cards|expansion cards]]—such as the [[Z-80 SoftCard]]—that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run programs for the [[CP/M]] operating system,<ref name=z80>{{cite magazine |magazine = [[InfoWorld]] |date = February 6, 1984 |volume = 6 |issue = 6 |quote = Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II. |page = 64 |title = Review: Premium Softcard IIe |last = Petersen |first = Marty }}</ref> including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. The Z80 card also allowed the connection to a modem and thereby to any networks that the user might have access to. In the early days, such networks were scarce. But they expanded significantly with the development of bulletin board systems in later years. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that allowed [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. Third-party [[Apple II sound cards|sound cards]] greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] doubled or quadrupled the computer's speed.

Early Apple IIs were often sold with a [[Sup'R'Mod]], which allowed the composite video signal to be viewed on a television.

The Soviet Union electronics industry designed Apple II mostly compatible computer Agat 7, producing a similar computer known as the [[Agat (computer)|Agat]]. Roughly 12,000 were produced and it was widely used in Soviet schools.<ref>http://www.computer-museum.ru/histsoft/informatika_sorucom_2011.htm</ref>

==Reception==
[[File:Apple II advertisement Dec 1977 page 2.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Apple II (1977)]]
Jesse Adams Stein wrote, "As the first company to release a 'consumer appliance' micro-computer, Apple Computer offers us a clear view of this shift from a ''machine'' to an ''appliance''." But the company also had "to negotiate the attitudes of its potential buyers, bearing in mind social anxieties about the uptake of new technologies in multiple contexts.

''[[Personal Computer World]]'' in August 1978 also cited the color capability as a strength, stating that "the prime reason that anyone buys an Apple II must surely be for the colour graphics". While mentioning the "oddity" of the artifact colors that produced output "that is not always what one wishes to do", it noted that "no-one has colour graphics like this at this sort of price". The magazine praised the sophisticated monitor software, user expandability, and comprehensive documentation. The author concluded that "the Apple II is a very promising machine" which "would be even more of a temptation were its price slightly lower ... for the moment, colour is an Apple II".<ref name="pcw197808">{{cite news |url = https://archive.org/stream/Personal_Computer_World_1978-08_Apple_II_Review#page/n0/mode/2up |title = Colour is an Apple II |work = Personal Computer World |date = August 1978 |accessdate = 18 August 2014 |last1 = Coll |first1 = John |last2 = Sweeten |first2 = Charles |pages = 50 }}</ref>

Although it sold well from the launch, the initial market was to hobbyists and computer enthusiasts. Sales expanded exponentially into the business and professional market when the spreadsheet program [[VisiCalc]] was launched in mid-1979. VisiCalc is credited as the defining [[killer app]] in the microcomputer industry.

During the first five years of operations, revenues doubled about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, annual sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=Infinite Loop |last= Malone |first=Michael S. |page=157 |date=1999 |publisher=Doubleday Business |isbn=0-385-48684-7}}</ref> During this period the sole products of the company were the Apple II and its peripherals, accessories, and software.
