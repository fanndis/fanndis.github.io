==Congressional career==

===House of Representatives (1998–2007)===
Aquino became [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives]] on November 8, 2004, but relinquished the post on February 21, 2006, when Aquino joined his [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] members in calling for the resignation of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] at the height of the [[Hello Garci scandal]].<ref name=r12 /><ref name=resumeofsenatoraquino>{{cite web|title=Resume of Senator Aquino – Senate of the Philippines|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/aquino_noynoy_resume.asp|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614192915/http://senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/aquino_noynoy_resume.asp|archivedate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

Aquino was also [[Chairman of the Board]] of the Central Luzon Congressional Caucus.<ref name=resumeofsenatoraquino/>

===Senate (2007–10)===
Barred from running for re-election to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], to represent the [[Legislative districts of Tarlac|2nd district of Tarlac]], due to [[term limits]], Aquino was elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] in the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 Philippine midterm election]] on May 15, 2007, under the banner of the [[Genuine Opposition]] (GO), a coalition comprising a number of parties, including Aquino's own [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], seeking to curb attempts by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to amend the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1986 Philippine Constitution]]. In Aquino's political ads, he was endorsed by his younger sister, TV host [[Kris Aquino]], and his mother, the late former President Corazon Aquino.

During the campaign, Aquino reached out to his former enemy, Senator [[Gregorio Honasan]], supporting his application for bail. Aquino told Job Tabada of Cebu Daily News, on March 5, 2007;

{{quote|"I endorse Honasan's request for bail ''para parehas ang laban'' [to even out the playing field]. I was hit by bullets from Honasan's men in the neck and hips but that's past now.

Aquino was referring to an unsuccessful coup attempt staged by rebel soldiers led by Gregorio Honasan on August 28, 1987, in which Aquino was seriously injured.

====Senate bills====
{{BLP sources section|date=April 2016}}
The Budget Impoundment and Control Act (SB 3121), wherein "impoundment" refers to the power of the president to refuse the release of funds appropriated by the [[Congress of the Philippines]], is another bill Aquino is proud of;<ref name="lilanoy2">from an interview with freelance writer Lila Shahani for ''Philippines Graphic'', later posted on the writer's blog as [http://lilashahani.blogspot.com/2010/03/conversation-with-noynoy.html "A Conversation with Noynoy"] (March 2010){{Unreliable source?|date=April 2016}}</ref> he regretted,<ref name="lilanoy2"/> however, that such power has been used and abused by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], a result of which abuse has been the significant emasculation of Congress' ability to check the president's authority. Aquino filed this bill so the president would have to pass through Congress every time the president decides to impound part of the budget.

Another significant Aquino contribution to the Philippines' corruption problem was Senate Bill 2035, which is the ''Preservation of Public Infrastructures'' bill, seeking to raise standards in the construction of all public infrastructures by penalizing contractors of defective infrastructures. The bill also requires the Bureau of Maintenance under the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] to conduct periodic inspections of public infrastructures.

Aquino also pushed for the passage of the Amending the Government Procurement Act (SB 2160), which applies to all government procurement activities regardless of source of funds whether local or foreign; only treaties or international/executive agreements entered into by the government prior to its enactment shall be exempt from coverage. The bill was filed in light of the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] declaration regarding the validity of the controversial [[NBN-ZTE scandal]], wherein its international aspect, as well as the fact that it was an executive agreement, was cited as one reason for its exemption from the procurement process stipulated in Republic Act 9184.

Focusing further on accountability in government appropriations and spending, Aquino filed other reform-oriented bills, among which were [[Philippine National Police]] reform; an increase in penalties for corporations and work establishments not compliant with minimum wage; the banning of reappointment to the [[Judicial and Bar Council]]; the prevention of reappointment and bypassing of the [[Commission on Appointments]]; real property valuation based on international standards; and superior responsibility for senior military officers, who are ultimately responsible for their own subordinates. However, none of these bills were passed into law.

===Criticisms===
====Manila hostage crisis====
On August 23, 2010, in front of the [[Quirino Grandstand]] in [[Rizal Park]], [[Manila]], the site of Aquino's presidential inauguration, the [[Manila hostage crisis]] occurred. Aquino expressed concern over the matter and gave his condolences to the victims. Aquino defended the actions of the police at the scene, stating that the gunman had not shown any signs of wanting to kill the hostages. Aquino ordered a "thorough investigation" into the incident, and would wait until it is completed before deciding whether anyone should lose his or her job.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong warns against Philippines travel after deaths|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11067310 | work=BBC News | date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> Aquino declared that the media may have worsened the situation by giving the gunman "a bird's-eye view of the entire situation".<ref>{{cite news|title=Gunman in the Philippines ends standoff by killing 8, wounding 7|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/08/23/philippines.bus.hostages/index.html?hpt=T1#fbid=Zn5zrYu1rwk&wom=true | work=CNN | date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> Aquino also made reference to the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], which, according to Aquino, resulted in "more severe" casualties despite Russia's "resources and sophistication".<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/273922/aquino-explains-his-stand-mondays-hostage-crisis Aquino explains his stand on Monday's hostage crisis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827130039/http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/273922/aquino-explains-his-stand-mondays-hostage-crisis |date=August 27, 2010 }}.

A play on the term [[planking (fad)|planking]] and Aquino's nickname, Noynoying involves posing in a lazy manner, such as sitting idly while resting his head on one hand, and doing nothing.

==Legal charges==

In July 2017, criminal charges were filed against Aquino for usurpation of authority under the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines|Revised Penal Code]] and violating anti-graft and corruption laws. Ombudsman [[Conchita Carpio-Morales]] cited the involvement of then suspended [[Philippine National Police]] chief [[Alan Purisima]] in the [[Mamasapano clash|2015 Mamasapano police operation]] against the [[Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters]] and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] in [[Mamasapano, Maguindanao]], where 44 [[Special Action Force]] members were killed. Under the Revised Penal Code, suspended public officials cannot perform their duties or interfere in government affairs. Aquino's former Deputy [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Spokesman|Presidential Spokesperson]] [[Abigail Valte]] said that Aquino plans to file a motion for reconsideration to appeal the charges.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Eimor|title=Ex-President Aquino faces criminal raps over Mamasapano encounter, cleared of homicide|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/07/14/Noynoy-Aquino-Mamasapano-SAF-44-Ombudsman-criminal-charges-no-homicide.html|access-date=July 16, 2017|publisher=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=July 15, 2017}}</ref>
