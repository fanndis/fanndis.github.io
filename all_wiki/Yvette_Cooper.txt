[[File:Yvette Cooper Ministerial portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Cooper as Minister for Housing in 2007]]

The Labour government under Brown had identified affordable housing as one of its core objectives. In July 2007, Cooper announced in the House of Commons that "unless we act now, by 2026 first-time buyers will find average house prices are ten times their salary. That could lead to real social inequality and injustice. Every part of the country needs more affordable homes â€“ in the North and the South, in urban and rural communities".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Â£8 Billion investment and reforms announced to tackle housing shortages |date=23 July 2007 |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |location=[[London]] |url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/8-million-investment |access-date=17 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610235116/http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/8-million-investment |archive-date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2008, Cooper became the first woman to serve as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]]. As her husband, [[Ed Balls]], was already a cabinet minister, her promotion meant that the two became the first married couple ever to sit in the cabinet together.

In 2009, Cooper was appointed as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] and took over leading on the [[Welfare Reform Act 2009]] which included measures to extend the use of benefit sanctions to force unemployed people to seek work.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Osborne |first=Simon |date=April 2010 |title=Welfare Reform Act 2009 â€“ a quick guide |url=http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/welfare-reform-act-2009-%E2%80%93-quick-guide |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402101825/http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/welfare-reform-act-2009-%E2%80%93-quick-guide |archive-date=2 April 2018 |access-date=7 November 2020 |website=Child Poverty Action Group}}</ref> Many campaigners â€“ including the [[Child Poverty Action Group]] (CPAG) â€“ urged Cooper to rethink Labour's approach, arguing instead that increasing support for job seekers was vital to eradicating child poverty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2009/06/10/cpag-urges-yvette-cooper-to-change-tack-on-welfare-reform/|title=CPAG urges Yvette Cooper to change tack on welfare reform {{!}} Community Care|website=www.communitycare.co.uk|access-date=2 April 2018|date=10 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402102148/http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2009/06/10/cpag-urges-yvette-cooper-to-change-tack-on-welfare-reform/|archive-date=2 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/jun/13/letters-welfare-reform-bill|title=Welfare bill won't reduce poverty {{!}} Letters|date=12 June 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402163328/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/jun/13/letters-welfare-reform-bill|archive-date=2 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Cquote
| quote = Towns are the backbone of Britain but our towns aren't getting a fair deal. In the slowest economic recovery in modern times, towns are seeing their jobs and businesses grow at only around half the rate of cities under the Tories. There is a very real and widening economic gap which isnâ€™t good for the country. And Tory policies are making it worse â€“ as key services have been lost from towns altogether under austerity. Towns donâ€™t want to be patronised, we want a fair deal. That's why councillors, MPs and party members have set up Labour Towns to champion our towns and expose the damage the Tories are doing. Britain needs both our towns and our cities to prosper â€“ the growing economic gap is bad for all of us.
