The '''Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation''' ('''BIMSTEC''') is an international organisation of seven nations of [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], housing 1.5 billion people and having a combined gross domestic product of $3.5 trillion (2018).<ref name=lead1/><ref name=lead3>[http://bimstec.org/ BIMSTEC]</ref> The BIMSTEC member states – [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]]<ref>http://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/economics/regional-economic-integration-the-bay-bengal-660181</ref> – are among the [[countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal]].

Fourteen priority sectors of cooperation have been identified and several BIMSTEC centres have been established to focus on those sectors.<ref name="lead1" /><ref name="lead5" /> A BIMSTEC free trade agreement is under negotiation (c. 2018), also referred to as the mini [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]].

Leadership is rotated in alphabetical order of country names. The permanent secretariat is in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].

== Background ==
On 6 June 1997, a new sub-regional grouping was formed in [[Bangkok]] under the name BIST-EC ([[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]] Economic Cooperation).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Haidar|first1=Suhasini|title=BIMSTEC a sunny prospect in BRICS summit at Goa|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/bimstec-outreach-likely-to-pep-up-rocky-brics-summit-at-goa/article9224549.ece|accessdate=16 October 2016|work=The Hindu|date=15 October 2016|language=en-IN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BRICS Summit 2016: BIMSTEC members have economic opportunities to share, said Narendra Modi |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/brics-summit-2016-bimstec-members-have-economic-opportunities-to-share-said-narendra-modi/articleshow/54883267.cms|website=The Economic Times|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref> Following the inclusion of Myanmar on 22 December 1997 during a special Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok, the [https://thekootneeti.in/2017/10/12/bimstec-a-desirable-alternative-to-saarc-and-an-extra-feather-to-indias-act-east-policy/ Group was renamed ‘BIMST-EC]’ (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand Economic Cooperation). In 1998, Nepal became an observer. In February 2004, Nepal and [[Bhutan]]  become full members.

On 31 July 2004, in the first Summit the grouping was renamed as BIMSTEC or the [[Bay of Bengal]] Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation.<ref>See for a detailed historical account of the founding and evolution of BIST-EC and BIMST-EC e.g. Michael, Arndt (2013). India's Foreign Policy and Regional Multilateralism (Palgrave Macmillan), pp. 145–163.</ref>

== Objective ==

# Tourism
# Technology
# Fisheries
# Agriculture
# Public Health
# Poverty Alleviation
# Counter-Terrorism & Transnational Crime
# Environment & Disaster Management

== BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement ==
The '''BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement (BFTAFA)''' has been signed by all member nations to stimulate trade and investment in the parties, and attract outsiders to trade with and invest in the BIMSTEC countries at a higher level. Subsequently, the ''"Trade Negotiating Committee"'' (TNC) was set up, with Thailand as the permanent chair, to negotiate in areas of trade in goods and services, investment, economic co-operation, trade facilitations and technical assistance for LDCs. Once negotiation on trade in goods is completed, the TNC would then proceed with negotiation on trade in services and investment.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://asianews.eu/content/bimstec-committee-mulls-free-trade-deal-dhaka-85786 | title=Bimstec committee mulls free trade deal in Dhaka| date=13 November 2018}}</ref>

The '''BIMSTEC Coastal Shipping Agreement''' draft was discussed on 1 December 2017 in [[New Delhi]], to facilitate coastal shipping within 20 nautical miles of the coastline in the region to boost trade between the member countries. Compared to the deep sea shipping, coastal ship require smaller vessels with lesser draft and involve lower costs. Once the agreement becomes operational after it is ratified, a lot of cargo movement between the member countries can be done through the cost effective, environment friendly and faster coastal shipping routes.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=174036 |title = BIMSTEC Member States discuss draft text of Coastal Shipping Agreement}}</ref>
