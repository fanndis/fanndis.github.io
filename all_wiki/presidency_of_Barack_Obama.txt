{{Barack Obama sidebar}}
The '''presidency of Barack Obama''' began at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2009, when [[Barack Obama]] was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] as the [[List of presidents of the United States|44th]] [[President of the United States]], and ended on January 20, 2017. Obama, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Illinois]], took office following a decisive victory over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. Four years later, in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]], he defeated Republican [[Mitt Romney]] to win re-election. He was the [[List of United States Presidential firsts#Barack Obama|first]] [[African American]] president, the first [[multiracial]] president, the first non-white president, and the first president to have been born in [[Hawaii]]. Obama was succeeded by Republican [[Donald Trump]], who won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

Obama's first-term actions addressed the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]] and included a [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|major stimulus package]], a partial extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]], legislation to [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|reform health care]], a major [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|financial regulation reform bill]], and the end of a major US [[Iraq War|military presence]] in [[Iraq]]. Obama also appointed [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justices [[Elena Kagan]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]], the latter of whom became the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] on the Supreme Court. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[2010 United States elections|2010 elections]]. Following the elections, Obama and Congressional Republicans engaged in a protracted stand-off over government spending levels and the [[United States debt ceiling|debt ceiling]]. The Obama administration's policy against terrorism downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces and encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. The Obama administration orchestrated the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|military operation]] that resulted in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] on May 2, 2011.

In his second term, Obama took steps to combat [[climate change]], signing a major [[Paris Agreement|international climate agreement]] and an [[executive order]] to limit [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]]. Obama also presided over the implementation of the [[Affordable Care Act]] and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated rapprochements with Iran and Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|continue to as of 2020]]. Republicans took control of the Senate after the [[2014 United States elections|2014 elections]], and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.

Obama's presidency saw an extended battle over taxes that ultimately led to the permanent extension of most of the [[Bush tax cuts]], which had been enacted between 2001 and 2003. Those tax cuts were set to expire during Obama's presidency since they were originally passed using a Congressional maneuver known as [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]], and had to fulfill the long-term deficit requirements of the "Byrd rule." During the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] session of the [[111th Congress]], Obama and Republicans wrangled over the ultimate fate of the cuts. Obama wanted to extend the tax cuts for taxpayers making less than $250,000 a year, while Congressional Republicans wanted a total extension of the tax cuts, and refused to support any bill that did not extend tax cuts for top earners.<ref>{{cite news | title = Senate Republicans block 9/11 health bill|work=Reuters| date = December 9, 2010| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/10/us-usa-congress-firefighters-idUSTRE6B903120101210| access-date = May 14, 2012| first=Donna| last=Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last = Stirewalt| first = Chris| title = Today's Power Play: Republicans and Democrats Play Chicken With Lame Duck| publisher = [[Fox News Channel]]| date = December 1, 2010| url = http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/12/01/todays-power-play-republicans-and-democrats-play-chicken-lame-duck| access-date = December 20, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101204115222/http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/12/01/todays-power-play-republicans-and-democrats-play-chicken-lame-duck| archive-date = December 4, 2010| url-status = dead}}</ref> Obama and the Republican Congressional leadership reached a deal that included a two-year extension of all the tax cuts, a 13-month extension of [[unemployment insurance]], a one-year reduction in the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA payroll tax]], and other measures.<ref name=2013deal>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/us/politics/08cong.html | title=Democrats Skeptical of Obama on New Tax Plan |author=Herszenhorn, David M. | author2=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 7, 2010}}</ref> Obama ultimately persuaded many wary Democrats to support the bill, though many liberals such as [[Bernie Sanders]] continued to oppose it.<ref name="cnn-signs"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Wing |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/10/bernie-sanders-filibuster_n_795087.html |title=Bernie Sanders Filibuster: Senator Stalls Tax Cut Deal |date=December 10, 2010 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] }}</ref> The $858 billion [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress and was signed into law by Obama on December 17, 2010.<ref name="cnn-signs">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/12/17/tax.deal/index.html | title=Obama signs tax deal into law | publisher=CNN | date=December 17, 2010 | access-date=December 17, 2010}}</ref><ref name="wapo-deal">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/16/AR2010121606672.html |title=Congress votes to extend Bush-era tax cuts until '12 |work=The Washington Post |date= December 17, 2010|access-date=December 17, 2010}}</ref>

===Education===
{{see also|Education in the United States}}
The Great Recession of 2008-09 caused a sharp decline in tax revenues in all cities and states. The response was to cut education budgets.  Obama's $800 billion stimulus package included $100 billion for public schools, which every state used to protect its educational budget.  However, in terms of sponsoring innovation, Obama and his Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] pursued K-12 education reform through the [[Race to the Top]] grant program.  With over $15 billion of grants at stake, 34 states quickly revised their education laws according to the proposals of advanced educational reformers. In the competition points were awarded for allowing charter schools to multiply, for compensating teachers on a merit basis including student test scores, and for adopting higher educational standards. There were incentives for states to establish college and career-ready standards, which in practice meant adopting the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] that had been developed on a bipartisan basis by the [[National Governors Association]], and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]]. The criteria were not mandatory, they were incentives to improve opportunities to get a grant. Most states revised their laws accordingly,  even though they realized it was unlikely they would when a highly competitive new grant.  Race to the Top had strong bipartisan support, with centrist elements from both parties.  It was opposed by the left wing of the Democratic Party, and by the right wing of the Republican Party, and criticized for centralizing too much power in Washington.  Complaints also came from middle-class families, who were annoyed at the increasing emphasis on teaching to the test, rather than encouraging teachers to show creativity and stimulating students' imagination.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Zimmerman |chapter=Education in the Age of Obama: The Paradox of Consensus |editor=Zelizer |title=The Presidency of Barack Obama |pages=111–126 |jstor=j.ctvc777dh.12 |year=2018 |isbn=9780691160283 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0895904811425911 |title=Stimulating Reform |journal=Educational Policy |volume=26 |pages=136–159 |year=2012 |last1=McGuinn |first1=Patrick |s2cid=154566214 }}</ref>

''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' wrote that 

<blockquote>[''Parks and Rec''] exemplified a kind of American optimism about the idea that public service is an ultimate good. But the series was also laced with the progressiveness that would cause many to turn against Obama. Though protagonist Leslie Knope believes she’s doing the best for her constituents, they see her as out of touch with their real needs—no matter how ridiculous those "real needs" might be.</blockquote>

# {{note|fiscalyear}} The income, outlay, and deficit numbers reflect [[fiscal year]]s which last from October to September; for example, the 2014 fiscal year lasted from October 2013 to September 2014.
# {{note|Clintontaxes}} Numbers reflect post-[[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|OBRA 93]] tax brackets.
