'''Ruth Elizabeth Davidson''' (born 10 November 1978) is a Scottish politician who has served as [[Scottish Conservatives#Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party|Leader of the Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament]] since 2020. She served as [[Scottish Conservatives#Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party|Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party]] from [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]] to 2019. She has been a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) since [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]], first as an [[additional member system|additional member]] for the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow]] region and later for the [[Edinburgh Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Central]] constituency since [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016]].

Born in [[Edinburgh]], Davidson was raised in [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]] and later attended [[Buckhaven High School]] in [[Fife]]. After graduating from the [[University of Edinburgh]], she worked as a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] journalist and served in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a [[signaller]]. After leaving the BBC in 2009 to study at the [[University of Glasgow]], she joined the [[Scottish Conservatives|Conservative Party]]. She was the party's candidate in the [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]] constituency at a [[2009 Glasgow North East by-election|2009 by-election]] and at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], finishing in third then fourth place, on each occasion with approximately 5% of the vote.

At the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]], Davidson stood in the [[Glasgow Kelvin (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvin]] constituency, where she finished fourth, and on the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow]] regional list, from which she was elected. Following party leader [[Annabel Goldie]]'s resignation in May 2011, Davidson stood in the subsequent [[2011 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]]. She won the contest and was declared party leader on 4 November 2011. In [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016]], the Conservatives replaced the Labour Party as the [[Shadow Cabinet (Scottish Parliament)|second-largest party]] in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. As Scottish Conservative leader, she was considered by some to be a potential candidate for [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leadership]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] although ruled herself out of running for the position.

Davidson resigned the leadership in August 2019, shortly after [[Boris Johnson]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. She was succeeded by her deputy leader of eight years, [[Jackson Carlaw]]. After Carlaw resigned in July 2020, she nominated [[Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)|Douglas Ross]] to succeed him. Ross [[August 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election|became leader]] after running unopposed. Since he serves in the [[British House of Commons]] and is not an MSP, Davidson will lead the party in Holyrood. After the [[2021 Scottish Parliament election]], Davidson will become a [[life peer]] and enter the [[House of Lords]].

==Political career==

===Westminster candidate and aide===
In 2009, after having left the BBC to study at the [[University of Glasgow]], Davidson joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. She said she was inspired by a call by [[David Cameron]], the then [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], in the wake of the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal]], for people to get involved in politics who had never previously been political. She was encouraged by the Scottish Conservative Party's Director of Media, Ramsay Jones,<ref name=HeraldScotland20111009>{{cite news |first1=Paul |last1=Hutcheon |first2=Tom |last2=Gordon |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/tory-leadership-campaign-mired-by-party-split-and-allegations-of-bias-1.1128231 |title=Tory leadership campaign mired by party split and allegations of bias |newspaper=The Herald |location=Glasgow |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=9 October 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019055950/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/tory-leadership-campaign-mired-by-party-split-and-allegations-of-bias-1.1128231 |archive-date=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> to join the party and stand for the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] seat of [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]] at the [[2009 Glasgow North East by-election|2009 by-election]], which was triggered by the resignation of Labour MP and Speaker of the House, [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]]. She finished in third place, with 1,075 votes (5.2% share of the vote).

In February 2010, she tried to seek the Conservative party [[Prospective parliamentary candidate|candidacy]] for [[Bromsgrove (UK Parliament constituency)|Bromsgrove]] in Worcestershire, England. She made the shortlist but in the end lost out to [[Sajid Javid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/|title=ConservativeHome's Seats & Candidates blog|website=ConservativeHome's Seats & Candidates blog}}</ref>

From early 2010 to March 2011, she worked as the head of the private office of the then Scottish Conservative leader [[Annabel Goldie]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/local-headlines/lamont_welcomes_tory_leadership_result_and_hits_back_at_twit_claim_1_1956164 |title=Lamont welcomes Tory leadership result and hits back at 'twit' claim |newspaper=The Southern Reporter |publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd |date=13 November 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604103137/http://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/local-headlines/lamont_welcomes_tory_leadership_result_and_hits_back_at_twit_claim_1_1956164 |archive-date=4 June 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> She played a large part in the organisation of campaign media events in the run-up to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], at which she ran again in Glasgow North East, finishing in fourth place with 1,569 votes (a 5.3% share of the vote).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8199189.stm |title=UK &#124; Tories choose by-election hopeful |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=13 August 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/831.stm |title=Election 2010 &#124; Glasgow North East |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>

===Scottish Parliament===
For the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 Scottish parliament election]], Davidson was selected in September 2010<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2010/09/two-new-candidates-adopted-to-contest-holyrood-seats.html |title=ConservativeHome's Seats & Candidates blog: Two new candidates adopted to contest Holyrood seats |publisher=Conservativehome.blogs.com |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192321/http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2010/09/two-new-candidates-adopted-to-contest-holyrood-seats.html |archive-date=3 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> to contest the [[Glasgow Kelvin (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvin]] constituency, and was initially placed second on the Conservatives' [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow region]] list, behind Malcolm Macaskill, a Glasgow businessman and party member for over 30 years. This made it very unlikely that Davidson would gain election to the Scottish Parliament, for the Glasgow regional list typically returned only one Conservative member.<ref name="wounds"/>

However, with only a couple of months to go, newspaper stories appeared in March 2011 that questioned Macaskill's business history.<ref name="wounds"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cochrane |first1=Alan |last2=Cramb |first2=Auslan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/8406040/Scottish-Tories-in-turmoil-after-top-candidate-sacked.html |title=Scottish Tories in turmoil after top candidate sacked |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430145134/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/8406040/Scottish-Tories-in-turmoil-after-top-candidate-sacked.html |archive-date=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was revealed that, ahead of a 2010 internal party selection contest, he had failed to fully disclose his business career to party members.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/turmoil-as-tory-candidate-dropped-over-cv-1.1092632 |title=Turmoil as Tory candidate dropped over CV – Evening Times |work=Evening Times |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620130422/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/turmoil-as-tory-candidate-dropped-over-cv-1.1092632 |archive-date=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Paul |last1=Hutcheon |first2=Tom |last2=Gordon |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/chequered-business-career-costs-tory-his-holyrood-hope-1.1092533 |title=Chequered business career costs Tory his Holyrood hope |newspaper=The Herald |location=Glasgow |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608015522/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/chequered-business-career-costs-tory-his-holyrood-hope-1.1092533 |archive-date=8 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 24 March, [[Andrew Fulton (Party chairman)|Party chairman Andrew Fulton]] decided that Macaskill was to be deselected, thereby promoting Davidson to the first position in the Glasgow regional list.<ref name="wounds">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/wounds_from_scottish_tory_battle_will_not_heal_quickly_1_1926655 |title=Wounds from Scottish Tory battle will not heal quickly |work=[[The Scotsman]] |publisher=Johnston Press |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025074731/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/wounds_from_scottish_tory_battle_will_not_heal_quickly_1_1926655 |archive-date=25 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This led to loud protests from the supporters of Macaskill, and some major donors withdrew their financial support for the party.<ref>Alan Cochrane, Auslane Cramb, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/8406040/Scottish-Tories-in-turmoil-after-top-candidate-sacked.html Scottish Tories in turmoil after top candidate sacked] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' dated 25 March 2011, accessed 27 April 2018</ref> In the event, after coming a distant fourth in Glasgow Kelvin, Davidson was elected to the Scottish Parliament from the Glasgow region list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-13307893 |title=Scottish Election: Labour crashes in Scottish heartland |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164937/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-13307893 |archive-date=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> After the election she was appointed by Goldie as the Conservative spokesperson for Culture, Europe and External Relations.<ref name="parliament1"/>

===Leadership of the Scottish Conservative Party===
Following the resignation of Annabel Goldie as Scottish Conservative leader on 9 May 2011, Davidson became a contender in the [[2011 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]].<ref>{{cite news |first1=Paul |last1=Hutcheon |first2=Tom |last2=Gordon |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/gay-msp-in-running-to-lead-scots-tories-1.1109978 |title=Gay MSP in running to lead Scots Tories |newspaper=The Herald |location=Glasgow |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=3 July 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> Her rivals later claimed that Davidson received assistance from Party headquarters,<ref name="wounds"/> though her supporters stated that these claims were part of a smear campaign.<ref name = "wounds"/> She stood against three other candidates – [[Murdo Fraser]], [[Jackson Carlaw]] and [[Margaret Mitchell (Scottish politician)|Margaret Mitchell]]. Fraser stood on a platform of separating the Scottish Conservatives from the UK-wide party and establishing a new Scottish centre-right party. Davidson announced her candidacy on 4 September and vehemently opposed Fraser's proposals to separate the party, calling it a "distraction" which would "tie the party in knots".<ref name=Guardian20110908>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/08/scotland-tory-rejects-economic-powers |title=Scottish Tory leadership candidate rejects call for greater economic powers |date=8 September 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Severin |last=Carrell |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203132532/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/08/scotland-tory-rejects-economic-powers |archive-date=3 December 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Despite being a List MSP for Glasgow, she failed to gain the endorsement of a single chairperson of any of the five Conservative Constituency Associations in Glasgow<ref name=HeraldScotland20111009 /> and over half the MSP group had supported Murdo Fraser.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.murdo2011.com/supporters |title=Supporters |work=Murdo 2011.com |publisher=Elizabeth Smith |location=Perth |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011023441/http://www.murdo2011.com/supporters |archive-date=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 11 September 2011, Davidson sacked her election agent and parliamentary assistant Ross McFarlane after he was filmed trying to burn a [[European Union flag]] in a Glasgow street following a University Conservative Association ([[GUCA]]), St. Andrews Day dinner in November 2010.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Hutcheon |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13036188.Burning_the_EU_flag_amid_sectarian_abuse_Meet_the_election_agent_of_the_Tories____moderate_face/ |title=Burning the EU flag amid sectarian abuse Meet the election agent of the Tories' moderate face |newspaper=The Herald |location=Glasgow |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=11 September 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421003346/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13036188.Burning_the_EU_flag_amid_sectarian_abuse_Meet_the_election_agent_of_the_Tories____moderate_face/ |archive-date=21 April 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 5 October 2011, the Scottish Conservative media director Ramsay Jones was suspended from his duties during the leadership contest, after it was revealed that he had met Davidson and her campaign team in her flat on Sunday, 18 September.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15192368 |title=Scottish Tory chief spin doctor Ramsay Jones suspended |publisher=BBC News |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114182127/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15192368 |archive-date=14 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Paul |last1=Hutcheon |first2=Tom |last2=Gordon |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/top-tory-spin-doctor-accused-of-favouritism-in-leadership-campaign-1.1127085 |title=Top Tory spin doctor accused of favouritism in leadership campaign – Herald Scotland &#124; Home News |newspaper=The Herald |location=Glasgow |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref>

Davidson subsequently won [[2011 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election|the leadership election]] and was made the leader of the Scottish Conservatives on 4 November 2011. She gained 2,278 first preference votes out of the 5,676 votes cast, after second preference votes were counted, she won by 2,983 votes to second-placed [[Murdo Fraser]]'s 2,417.<ref name="BBC20111104">{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Black|date=4 November 2011|title=Ruth Davidson elected new Scottish Conservative leader|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15580663|url-status=live|accessdate=20 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119131539/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15580663|archive-date=19 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This sparked some discontent within the party, with prominent party supporter [[Paul McBride]] resigning from the party<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/paul_mcbride_resigns_from_tory_party_1_1950916 |newspaper=Scotland on Sunday |title=Paul McBride resigns from Tory party |date=6 November 2011 |first=Lorraine |last=Davidson |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108215215/http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/paul_mcbride_resigns_from_tory_party_1_1950916 |archive-date=8 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and party donor John McGlynn criticised her election, saying that she was elected through 'interference'.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15635686 |title=Tory donor John McGlynn's concern over new leader |publisher=BBC News |date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120105108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15635686 |archive-date=20 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

When [[Alex Salmond]] resigned as First Minister, Davidson nominated herself to succeed him. She knew that the SNP's majority virtually assured that Salmond's successor as SNP leader, [[Nicola Sturgeon]], would become First Minister. Nevertheless, she felt the need to offer "an alternative vision of Scotland".  Davidson received 15 votes to Sturgeon's 66.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nicola Sturgeon is elected first minister of Scotland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30118626 |publisher=BBC News |date=19 November 2014 |access-date=28 January 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220125708/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30118626 |archive-date=20 February 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Davidson led the Scottish Conservatives into the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 Scottish election]], where the party doubled its number of Scottish Parliament seats to 31, replacing [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] as the second largest party at Holyrood behind the Scottish National Party.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36224344 |title=Scottish Conservatives to be second largest party at Holyrood |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=8 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818030523/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36224344 |archive-date=18 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The election also saw Davidson, who had previously been a list MSP, win the constituency of [[Edinburgh Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Central]] from the SNP with 10,399 votes. Reacting to the result Davidson said, "I am under no illusion that everybody who voted for me in that seat is a true-blue, dyed-in-the wool Tory, and neither are they in places up and down Scotland. They are people who want us to do a very specific job, and that it is to hold the SNP to account."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36219380 |title=Holyrood 2016: Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson wins Edinburgh Central |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=8 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811024637/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36219380 |archive-date=11 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Later career ==
Post resignation, Davidson praised [[Amber Rudd]]'s decision to leave the cabinet over the "act of political vandalism". She also criticised Boris Johnson for suspending 21 Conservative MPs in September 2019 and said he was doing so to make sure that the moderates in his cabinet were replaced by "more compliant Conservatives".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ruth Davidson says Boris Johnson taking 'big risk' with Tory party by kicking out 21 MPs|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/boris-johnson/news/106381/ruth-davidson-says-boris|accessdate=9 September 2019|website=Politics Home}}</ref>

In October 2019, Davidson accepted a public relations role for lobbying firm Tulchan Communications while retaining her job as an MSP. Her employment drew into question potential conflicts of interest and the size of her salary, £50,000 for 25 days' work, in addition to her £63,000-a-year MSP's salary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17989092.conflict-interest-row-appointment-ruth-davidson-adviser-pr-firm/|title='Conflict of interest' row over Ruth Davidson's PR role|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50193926|title=Ruth Davidson hits back at criticism over PR job|date=2019-10-26|access-date=2019-10-28|language=en-GB}}</ref> A week later, she abandoned her taking up of the role after meeting with parliamentary officials, although she insisted no conflict would have emerged had she still taken up the role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityam.com/ruth-davidson-says-she-wont-take-lobbying-role-at-tulchan/|title=Ruth Davidson says she won't take lobbying role at Tulchan Communications|date=2019-10-29|website=CityAM|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> Prior to the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] Davidson said that she would swim naked in [[Loch Ness]] if the Scottish National Party won 50 seats, but avoided the ordeal as the SNP won only 48.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/ruth-davidson-narrowly-avoids-skinny-dipping-in-loch-ness-1-5061950|title=Ruth Davidson narrowly avoids skinny dipping in Loch Ness|website=www.scotsman.com}}</ref>

In July 2020, Davidson lobbied for the leadership bid of [[Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)|Douglas Ross]] after the resignation of Jackson Carlaw who resigned due to Scottish Conservative support falling in polls, pressure from backbenchers and support for Scottish Independence on the rise.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Andrews|first=Kieran|title=Ruth Davidson returns as top Tories oust Jackson Carlaw|language=en|work=The Times|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ruth-davidson-returns-as-top-tories-oust-jackson-carlaw-57fg25hn9|access-date=2020-08-01|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> Later that month, she was appointed to the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/full-list-the-36-new-peers|title=From Evgeny Lebedev to Philip Hammond – the 36 new peers|website=The Spectator|date=31 July 2020}}</ref> She agreed to serve as Leader of the Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament until the [[Next Scottish Parliament election]], while Ross was yet to be elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Douglas Ross and Ruth Davidson set out joint ticket to 'take on the SNP'|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18626991.douglas-ross-ruth-davidson-set-joint-ticket-take-snp/|access-date=2020-08-05|website=Herald Scotland|language=en}}</ref> Ross was announced as leader five days later after running unopposed.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-08-05|title=Douglas Ross confirmed as new Scottish Tory leader|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-53655975|access-date=2020-08-05}}</ref>

==Policies and views==
Davidson belongs to the relatively [[social liberalism|socially liberal]], [[centrist]] wing of the Conservative Party. She supports [[LGBT rights]] and favours extending [[Same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland|same-sex marriage equality to Northern Ireland]]. She advocated a "Remain" vote at the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]] and after the UK voted to leave the EU said she wanted the UK to remain part of the [[European Single Market]] and Customs Union with reciprocal freedom of movement rights, though she subsequently fell into line with the Westminster party position of leaving the Customs Union and ending free movement. Following the result of the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]], in which the Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, she said that [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]] lacked a mandate to take the UK out of the EU Single Market and Customs Union.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/ruth-davidson-planning-scottish-tory-breakaway-challenges-theresa/ |title=Ruth Davidson planning Scottish Tory breakaway as she challenges Theresa May's Brexit plan |first1=Alan |last1=Cochrane |first2=Simon |last2=Johnson |date=9 June 2017 |via=www.telegraph.co.uk |newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>

===Immigration===
At the 2016 Conservative Party Conference, Davidson warned her party that "immigrants should be made to feel welcome in the UK" and the "party should not lurch to the [[right-wing politics|right]] in the wake of Labour's implosion". She argued that Britain should seek access to the [[European Single Market]] even if that means accepting [[Free Movement of Citizens Directive|reciprocal freedom of movement]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/05/ruth-davidson-challenges-hard-brexit-tories-by-arguing-immigrant/ |title=Ruth Davidson challenges 'hard' Brexit Tories by arguing immigrants must be welcomed |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144157/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/05/ruth-davidson-challenges-hard-brexit-tories-by-arguing-immigrant/ |archive-date=6 October 2016 |df=dmy-all |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=2016-10-05 |last1=Johnson |first1=Simon}}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'', she refused to commit herself to saying that, in the [[aftermath of Brexit]], Scotland should gain responsibility for agriculture policy. She suggested that Westminster would take responsibility instead.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/mar/03/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-2-march |title=Politics Live – readers' edition: Friday 3 March |first1=Guardian |last1=readers |first2=James |last2=Walsh |first3=Henry |last3=McDonald |date=3 March 2017 |via=www.theguardian.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124521/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/mar/03/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-2-march |archive-date=3 March 2017 |df=dmy-all |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Justice and devolution===
She supports judges being given the ability to effectively sentence perpetrators of "the most heinous, cruel and vile" crimes with a life sentence, with the intent that they are never released.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.stv.tv/politics/282077-conservatives-call-for-whole-life-jail-sentences/ |title=Conservatives call for whole-life jail sentences |date=24 November 2011 |publisher=STV |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201201335/http://news.stv.tv/politics/282077-conservatives-call-for-whole-life-jail-sentences/ |archive-date=1 December 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Davidson also calls for an end to the automatic release of prisoners, and believes that alcohol and drug consumption should not grant more lenient sentencing to people who have committed crimes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/09/20/davidson-calls-sentencing/ |title=Davidson calls for sentencing changes |date=20 September 2011 |work=Ruth Davidson |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408083120/http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/09/20/davidson-calls-sentencing/ |archive-date=8 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Davidson has stated she wanted the Scottish Parliament to be accountable for up to 40% of what it spends. This was a reversal of a previous view she expressed, as she was elected on a platform that there should be a "line drawn in the sand", as she opposed any further devolution. She later said "Conservatives were wrong to oppose the idea of a Scottish Parliament during the campaign for devolution, which was delivered in 1999."<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21933791 |title=Ruth Davidson supports more Holyrood financial powers |publisher=BBC News |date=26 March 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410000153/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21933791 |archive-date=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Business and infrastructure===
Davidson has proposed that any start-up company whose rateable value was below £18,000, should be incentivised by being given an initial two-year ability to avoid paying [[Business rates in Scotland|business rates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/09/28/davidson-calls-two-year-rates-holiday-small-businesses/ |title=Davidson calls for a two-year Rates 'Holiday' for new small businesses |date=28 September 2011 |work=Ruth Davidson |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025071243/http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/09/28/davidson-calls-two-year-rates-holiday-small-businesses/ |archive-date=25 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> She also emphasises the necessity for proper infrastructure in rural areas, particularly with regard to ferry links.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/10/14/ruth-champion-highlands-islands/ |title=Ruth: I will be a champion for the Highlands and Islands |date=14 October 2011 |work=Ruth Davidson |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015163516/http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/10/14/ruth-champion-highlands-islands/ |archive-date=15 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Education and early learning===
During her leadership campaign, Davidson stated that in the 0–5 age category, children should be granted more hours in early years centres, so as to meet the needs of "hard-working families".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/09/27/davidson-support-families-investment-children-top-priorities/|title=Davidson: Support for families and investment in Children are top priorities|date=27 September 2011|work=Ruth Davidson|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910095402/http://www.ruthdavidson.co.uk/2011/09/27/davidson-support-families-investment-children-top-priorities/|archive-date=10 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> She supports state-funded [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Roman Catholic schooling]] in Scotland, and believes the [[Church of Scotland]] should open its own faith schools as well.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/20/lesbian-would-be-tory-leader-ruth-davidson-wants-more-faith-schools |title=Lesbian would-be Tory leader Ruth Davidson wants more faith schools |first=Jessica |last=Geen |date=20 September 2011 |newspaper=Pink News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228200742/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/20/lesbian-would-be-tory-leader-ruth-davidson-wants-more-faith-schools |archive-date=28 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== European Union ===
Before the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] held on 23 June 2016, she campaigned against British withdrawal from the European Union.<ref>theguardian.com: [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/ruth-davidson-eu-debate-nicola-sturgeon-david-cameron-scottish-tory Ruth Davidson enjoys her Nicola Sturgeon moment in EU debate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114152355/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/ruth-davidson-eu-debate-nicola-sturgeon-david-cameron-scottish-tory |date=14 November 2016}}</ref><ref>the guardian.com / Susie Boniface: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/ruth-davidson-star-wembley-nicola-sturgeon-kezia-dugdale Ruth Davidson was the star at Wembley.

She also called on the UK and Scottish Governments to work together and put "stability" first.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/politics/scottish-politics/212859/ruth-davidson-calls-stability-uk-votes-brexit/ |title=Ruth Davidson calls for 'stability' after UK votes for Brexit |newspaper=The Courier |publisher=D.C.

Ruth Davidson is willing to support a legal challenge in the supreme court on the basis of the [[Scottish Parliament|Scottish parliament]] voting to protect what it argued were its existing powers over [[Brexit]]. She asserts that the importance of legal action is to test the complex situation in the court.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/02/ruth-davidson-backs-legal-action-against-scottish-brexit-bill |title=Ruth Davidson backs legal action against Scottish Brexit bill |last=Carrell |first=Severin |date=2018-03-02 |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en |access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>

===Social issues===
Davidson has stated that she supports [[same-sex marriage]], but believes religious institutions should not be forced to carry out the ceremonies should it conflict with their views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://defendmarriageinscotland.org/2011/11/06/msp-response-ruth-davidson-conservative|title=MSP Response: Ruth Davidson (Conservative)|work=Defend Marriage in Scotland|date=6 November 2011}}</ref> She urged Ireland to vote "Yes" in the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|2015 constitutional vote]] to enable same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lyell|first1=Carrie|title=Ruth Davidson urges Ireland to vote Yes to marriage equality|url=http://www.divamag.co.uk/category/news/ruth-davidson-urges-ireland-to-vote-yes-to-marriage-equality.aspx|accessdate=16 November 2015|work=Diva Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117105212/http://www.divamag.co.uk/category/news/ruth-davidson-urges-ireland-to-vote-yes-to-marriage-equality.aspx|archive-date=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===2016 Conservative leadership election===
Following the success of the Scottish Conservatives at the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 Scottish election]], in which the party doubled its number of MSPs, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article noted that "some in Westminster see her as a potential future leader, who could broaden the party's appeal and help tackle perceptions it is on the side of the privileged".<ref name="auto">{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Heather|date=23 May 2016|title=Ruth Davidson: I don't want to be prime minister|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/ruth-davidson-conservative-party-prime-minister|url-status=live|accessdate=7 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628091228/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/ruth-davidson-conservative-party-prime-minister|archive-date=28 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, Davidson dismissed the suggestion in an interview with ''[[The House (magazine)|The House]]'' magazine, describing the role of Prime Minister as "the loneliest job in the world".<ref name="auto"/> But she did not rule out the prospect of becoming an MP, saying she would only do so "for now".<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Stone |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scottish-tories-leader-ruth-davidson-wont-rule-out-standing-as-westminster-mp-amid-leadership-a7044626.html |title=Scottish Tories leader Ruth Davidson won't rule out standing as Westminster MP amid leadership speculation |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=7 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629062054/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scottish-tories-leader-ruth-davidson-wont-rule-out-standing-as-westminster-mp-amid-leadership-a7044626.html |archive-date=29 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the [[2016 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|Conservative leadership contest]] triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], Davidson gave her backing to [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] to succeed him as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister, describing May as a "proper grown up [who is] best placed to navigate the stormy waters ahead".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14605774.Ruth_Davidson_backs_Theresa_May_to_become_next_prime_minister/?commentSort=oldest |title=Ruth Davidson backs Theresa May to become next prime minister |newspaper=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate=7 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817145258/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14605774.Ruth_Davidson_backs_Theresa_May_to_become_next_prime_minister/?commentSort=oldest |archive-date=17 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Saudi Arabia===
After Saudi King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] died in 2015, the UK government decided to hang British flags at half-mast as a sign of mourning. In response, Davidson tweeted: "Flying flags at half-mast on government buildings for the death of a Saudi king is a steaming pile of nonsense. That is all." This tweet was in the context of recent outrage caused by the Saudi state publicly beheading a woman and sentencing a blogger to 1,000 lashes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30953346 |title=Tory slams Saudi flags 'nonsense' |date=1 October 2017 |publisher=BBC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228025717/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30953346 |archive-date=28 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In a 2015 interview with [[BBC Radio Scotland]], Davidson spoke about struggling with her sexuality: "I struggled with it for a number of years actually before I would admit it to myself, never mind to anybody else.
