===Member of parliament and state minister===
Alamgir ran in the [[1991 Bangladeshi general election|5th parliamentary election]] in 1991 from Thakurgaon-1 constituency on the BNP ticket but lost to [[Awami League]] candidate [[Khademul Islam]].<ref>Ahmed, Burhan Uddin.

Alamgir's motorcade came under a violent attack by an armed mob in [[Lakshmipur District|Lakshmipur]] on 2 August 2011 as it was approaching the main town where Alamgir was about to attend a party meeting. The attackers were not identified, but Alamgir and his companions alleged that they were members of the ruling party, the Awami League.
