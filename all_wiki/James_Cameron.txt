=== 1978–1983: Early work ===
Cameron's directing career began in 1978. After borrowing money from a consortium of dentists, he learned to direct, write and produce his first short film, ''[[Xenogenesis (film)|Xenogenesis]]'' (1978) with a friend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/james-cameron/33928/the-unmade-films-of-james-cameron|title=James Cameron and his unmade films|date=February 4, 2015|website=Den of Geek|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019133823/https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/james-cameron/33928/james-cameron-and-his-unmade-films|archive-date=October 19, 2019|access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref> Learning as they went, Cameron said he felt like a doctor doing his first surgical procedure.<ref name="Syd Field" /> He then served as a production assistant for ''[[Rock and Roll High School]]'' (1979). While educating himself about filmmaking techniques, Cameron started a job as a miniature [[model maker]] at [[Roger Corman]] Studios.<ref name="filmmakers.com" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/james-cameron/#interview|title=James Cameron Biography and Interview|website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228102929/https://www.achievement.org/achiever/james-cameron/|archive-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref> He was soon employed as an art director for the science-fiction film ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980). He carried out the special effects for [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), served as production designer for ''[[Galaxy of Terror]]'' (1981), and consulted on the design for ''[[Android (film)|Android]]'' (1982).

Cameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel to ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'' (1978), titled ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'' in 1982. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer [[Ovidio Assonitis]]. Shot in Rome, Italy and on [[Grand Cayman Island]], the film gave Cameron the opportunity to become director for a major film for the first time. However, Cameron later said that it did not feel like his first film due to power-struggles with Assonitis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/cameron_005.htm|title=US: James Cameron Interview|website=www.terminatorfiles.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190809150400/http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/cameron_005.htm|archive-date=August 9, 2019|access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref> Disillusioned from being in Rome and suffering from a fever, Cameron had a nightmare about an invincible robot hit-man sent from the future to assassinate him, which later led to the inspiration of ''[[The Terminator]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/james-cameron-came-up-terminator-during-dream-2015-6|title=James Cameron came up with the idea for 'Terminator' during a fever dream|last=Phillips|first=Ian|website=Business Insider|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717154023/https://www.businessinsider.com/james-cameron-came-up-terminator-during-dream-2015-6|archive-date=July 17, 2019|access-date=October 23, 2019}}</ref> Upon release of ''Piranha II: The Spawning'', critics were not impressed; author Tim Healey called it "a marvellously bad movie which splices cliches from every conceivable source".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world's worst movies|last=Healey, Tim.|date=1986|publisher=Octopus|isbn=0706425057|location=London|pages=7|oclc=59676875}}</ref>

=== 1984–1992: Breakthrough ===
Inspired by [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) and other science fiction work, Cameron in 1982 wrote the script for ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984), which is a thriller about a [[cyborg]] sent from the future to carry out a lethal mission. Cameron wanted to sell the script so that he could direct the movie. Whilst some film studios expressed interest in the project, many executives were unwilling to let a new and unfamiliar director make the movie. [[Gale Anne Hurd]], a colleague and founder of [[Valhalla Entertainment|Pacific Western Productions]], to whom Cameron was married from 1984–89, agreed to buy Cameron's script for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. He convinced the president of [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale Pictures]] to make the film, with Cameron as director and Hurd as a producer. [[Lance Henriksen]], who starred in ''Piranha II: The Spawning'', was considered for the lead role, but Cameron decided that [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was more suitable as the cyborg villain due to his [[bodybuilder]] appearance.<ref name="Futurist" /> Henriksen was given a smaller role instead. [[Michael Biehn]] and Cameron's future wife, [[Linda Hamilton]] also joined the cast. ''The Terminator'' was a box office success, exceeding expectations set by [[Orion Pictures]].<ref name="Futurist" /> The film proved popular with audiences and earned over $78&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator.htm|title=The Terminator (1984)|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=December 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018020109/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator.htm|archive-date=October 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> George Perry of the [[BBC]] praised Cameron's direction, writing "Cameron laces the action with ironic jokes, but never lets up on hinting that the terror may strike at any moment".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/05/the_terminator_1984_review.shtml|title=BBC - Films - review - The Terminator|last=Perry|first=George|date=2001-03-05|website=www.bbc.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530091149/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/05/the_terminator_1984_review.shtml|archive-date=May 30, 2019|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> In 2008, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]], being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7804404.stm|title=Terminator joins movie archive|date=December 30, 2008|access-date=October 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019183424/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7804404.stm|archive-date=October 19, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 1984, Cameron co-wrote the screenplay to ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' with [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/22/movies/screen-sylvester-stallone-returns-as-rambo.html|title=Screen: Sylvester Stallone Returns as Rambo|last=Canby|first=Vincent|date=May 22, 1985|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920055754/https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/22/movies/screen-sylvester-stallone-returns-as-rambo.html|archive-date=September 20, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Cameron moved onto his next directorial feature, which was the sequel to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), a science fiction horror by [[Ridley Scott]]. After titling the sequel ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), Cameron recast [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]], who first appeared in ''Alien''. ''Aliens'' follows the protagonist, Ripley, as she helps a group of marines fight off [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. Despite conflicts with cast and crew during production, and having to replace one of the lead actors—[[James Remar]] with [[Michael Biehn]]—''Aliens'' was a box office success, generating over $130&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3309340161/weekend/|title=Aliens|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=October 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024170514/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3309340161/weekend/|archive-date=October 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The film was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] in 1987; [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].

After ''Aliens'', Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd decided to make ''[[The Abyss]]'', a story about oil-rig workers who discover strange intelligent life in the ocean. Based on an idea which Cameron had conceived of during high school, the film was initially budgeted at $41&nbsp;million, although it ran considerably over this amount. It starred [[Ed Harris]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] and [[Michael Biehn]]. The production process began in the Cayman Islands and in [[South Carolina]], inside the building of an unfinished [[nuclear power]] plant with two huge water tanks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/11/james-cameron-best-movies.php |title=Flashback Five – James Cameron's Best Movies |publisher=Amctv.com |date=October 5, 2010 |access-date=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107071253/http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/11/james-cameron-best-movies.php |archive-date=November 7, 2010}}</ref> The cast and crew recall Cameron's dictatorial behavior, and the filming of water scenes which were mentally and physically exhausting.<ref name=":4" /> Upon the film's release, ''The Abyss'' was praised for its special effects, and earned $90&nbsp;million at the worldwide box office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl205555201/weekend/|title=The Abyss|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=October 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025003645/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl205555201/weekend/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> ''The Abyss'' received four Academy Award nominations and won Best Visual Effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1990|title=The 62nd Academy Awards {{!}} 1990|website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411113423/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1990|archive-date=April 11, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1990, Cameron co-founded the firm [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] with partner [[Lawrence Kasanoff]]. In 1991, Cameron served as executive producer for ''[[Point Break]]'' (1991), directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]], to whom he was married to between 1989 and 1991. After the success of ''The Terminator'', there were discussions for a sequel. In the late 1980s, [[Mario Kassar]] of [[Carolco Pictures]] secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to begin production of the film, ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991). Written by [[William Wisher Jr.]] and himself, Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles. The story follows on from ''Terminator'', depicting a new villain ([[T-1000]]), possessing [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifting]] ability and hunting for [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]'s son, John ([[Edward Furlong]]). Cameron cast [[Robert Patrick]] as T-1000 because of his lean and thin appearance—a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained, "I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the [[T-800]] is a human [[Panzer tank]], then the T-1000 is a [[Porsche]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/t2_008.htm|title=The Story About Making T2|website=www.terminatorfiles.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228001539/http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/t2_008.htm|archive-date=February 28, 2019|access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref> ''Terminator 2'' was one of the most expensive films to be produced, costing at least $94&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/conan-humanitarian-205026|title=Conan The Humanitarian|author=David Ansen|date=July 7, 1991|website=Newsweek|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726112104/http://www.newsweek.com/conan-humanitarian-205026|archive-date=July 26, 2014|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> Despite the challenging use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), the film was completed on time and released on July 3, 1991.

=== 1993–2001: Continued efforts and ''Titanic'' ===
In subsequent years, Cameron planned to do a third ''Terminator'' film but plans never materialized. The rights to the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]] were eventually purchased by Kassar from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/article/VR1117964592.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=More 'Terminator' on the way|author=Michael Fleming|date=May 9, 2007|work=Variety|access-date=May 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324083906/http://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/more-terminator-on-the-way-1117964592/|archive-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref> He moved onto other projects and in 1993, Cameron co-founded [[Digital Domain]], a visual effects production company. In 1994, Cameron and Schwarzenegger reunited for their third collaboration, ''[[True Lies]],'' a remake of the 1991 French comedy ''[[La Totale!]]'' The story depicts an American secret agent who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman.

| quote = He was very nice to me, because I could afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people.

==Frequent collaborators==
Cameron has frequently cast the same actors in films that he has directed, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Biehn. Bill Paxton appeared in five of Cameron's films before Paxton's death in 2017. Lance Henriksen and Jenette Goldstein have appeared in four and three of Cameron's films, respectively. For the ''Avatar'' sequels, much of the original cast will be reuniting with Cameron: C.C.H. Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang and Zoe Saldana.
