According to the prosecution's indictment, a well-known businessman [[Marián Kočner|Marian Kočner]] tasked Alena Zsuzsová with arranging Kuciak's murder, with which she in turn tasked Zoltán Andruskó, who ordered Tomáš Szabó and Miroslav Marček to carry out the murder.

== Background ==
[[File:Jan Kuciak portrait.jpg|left|thumb|Murdered journalist Ján Kuciak]]
Ján Kuciak was born on 17 May 1990 in the village of [[Štiavnik]] in [[Bytča District]]. He studied and graduated with a master's degree in [[journalism]] at the [[University of Constantine the Philosopher]] in [[Nitra]], where he continued his studies as a postgraduate student in the field of [[Mass media|mass media communication]]. While working on his [[PhD]], he also held a teaching position at the same faculty.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Čunderlíková|first1=Jana|title=Skromný, pracovitý, čestný. Ján Kuciak očami jeho študentov|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/568283/skromny-pracovity-cestny-jan-kuciak-ocami-jeho-studentov/?AT=wgt.article_clanok-podclankom.c.x...B.|accessdate=8 March 2018|website=Aktuality.sk|date=28 February 2018}}</ref>

He later started to work for the newspaper ''[[Hospodárske noviny]]'', before taking up a position in the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, primarily as an investigative journalist. He particularly focused on cases of [[tax evasion]], including ones related to the then-ruling party [[Direction - Social Democracy]] headed by PM Robert Fico. He had previously written about companies with unclear ownership as well as suspected systemic embezzlement from [[European Union]] funds.<ref name="muckrack">{{cite news|last1=Editorial Board|title=A muckraking journalist is murdered in Slovakia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-muckraking-journalist-is-murdered-in-slovakia/2018/03/07/96a42c32-2174-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|date=7 March 2018}}</ref>

The most prominent subject of his articles was businessman Marian Kočner, who first became known in Slovakia in 1998 due to his unsuccessful attempt to take over the private television news network [[TV Markíza]] with the help of the [[Slovenská informačná služba|Slovak Intelligence Service]] (SIS). In his June 2017 articles, Kuciak described several discrepancies in the halted investigation of a case involving Kočner and the suspicious transfers of his hotels in [[Donovaly]], which resulted in a €8 million VAT refund in 2010-2012.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=26 June 2017|title=Kočner sa v daňovej kauze preriekol.

Two days later Kuciak filed a complaint against Kočner, but was not spoken to about the issue by police until over a month later.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=21 July 2020|title=Telefonát medzi Kočnerom a Kuciakom: Vy ste zlý človek, pán Kuciak (autentická nahrávka)|work=Aktuality.sk|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/666053/telefonat-medzi-kocnerom-a-kuciakom-vy-ste-zly-clovek-pan-kuciak-autenticka-nahravka/|url-status=live|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> Kočner was accused of tax and insurance premiums evasion in the Donovaly case in late September 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=28 September 2017|title=Mariána Kočnera obvinili za neodvedenie dane v kauze Donovaly|work=Aktuality.sk|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/525169/mariana-kocnera-obvinili-za-neodvedenie-dane-v-kauze-donovaly/|url-status=live|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> 

In a December 2017 article, Kuciak described suspicious activity in a legal case in which Kočner’s firm IIDH was suing pharmaceutical distribution company Unipharma and its subsidiary for €45 million. In response, the [[Ministry of Justice (Slovakia)|Ministry of Justice]] launched an investigation into the actions of the judge involved in the case.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=14 December 2017|title=Kočnerovi pomáhajú aj súdy.

According to the article, 19 apartments were sold to and from five different firms fully or partially controlled by Kočner at least twice, raising questions about possible tax-related criminal activity.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=9 February 2018|title=Ďalšie zvláštne prevody okolo Kočnera.

At the time of his death, Kuciak was 27 years old. He lived in the village of Veľká Mača, about 65&nbsp;km (40 miles) east of the capital [[Bratislava]]. On the morning of 26 February 2018, police were called to his home by family members after the couple had not answered phone calls for more than four days.<ref name="shock">{{cite news|title=Slovakia shocked by killing of journalist and partner|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43202124|accessdate=1 March 2018|agency=BBC News}}</ref> Kuciak's fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, usually spoke with her mother on a daily basis. Her mother stated that she last spoke with her daughter in the afternoon of 21 February. When she tried to contact her again that evening, there was no reply. The family stated that Kušnírová's cellphone appeared to switch off three days later, probably due to a dead battery.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cermakova|first1=Judita|title=Bratia zastrelenej Martiny: Namiesto svadby vybavujeme pohreb|url=https://presov.korzar.sme.sk/c/20769263/bratia-zastrelenej-martiny-namiesto-svadby-vybavujeme-pohreb.html|accessdate=14 March 2018|agency=Korzar}}</ref>

Police entering the house found Kuciak and Kušnírová shot dead. Kuciak had been shot twice in the chest, while Kušnírová had been shot once in the head from the front. Both were shot at close range with a [[9 mm caliber]] handgun. There was no evidence of a struggle and nothing appeared to have been stolen.

Candles were lit at the [[SNP Square (Bratislava)|Slovak National Uprising Square]] in Bratislava and in front of the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, where Kuciak worked. Similar gatherings were also organised in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] cities of [[Prague]] and [[Brno]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Slovaks and Czechs pay tribute to the murdered journalist|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20769513/slovaks-and-czechs-pay-tribute-to-the-murdered-journalist.html|accessdate=1 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}</ref> President Andrej Kiska stated that he was "shocked and horrified that something like this happened in Slovakia".<ref name=First/> [[Antonio Tajani]], President of the European Parliament, called on Slovakia to launch a thorough investigation, offering international support if needed, adding that "the [[European Parliament]] will not rest until justice is done".<ref name="Jason">{{cite news|last1=Rezaian|first1=Jason|title=Police believe a journalist was killed for reporting on fraud in the heart of Europe|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/26/police-believe-a-journalist-was-killed-for-reporting-on-fraud-in-the-heart-of-europe/|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|date=26 February 2018}}</ref> [[Ringier AG|Ringier Axel Springer]], the parent company of Aktuality.sk, called the murders a "cruel assassination", vowing to redouble their journalistic efforts.<ref name=shock/>[[File:Brno, Nechceme zpět 90. léta, pochod za Jána a Martinu 2018-03-02 (4467).jpg|300px|thumb|A march for Ján and Martina in [[Brno]]|alt=]]
=== Protests ===
[[File:Bratislava protest.jpg|thumb|For Decent Slovakia protest in [[Bratislava]], 16 March 2018|alt=|left|298x298px]]
On Friday 2 March, up to 25,000 people gathered in Bratislava to commemorate the murdered couple.<ref>{{cite news|title=Deloire: Bratislava is the capital of press freedom today|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20772206/deloire-bratislava-is-today-the-capital-of-press-freedom.html|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}</ref> On 9 March, protests were held in 48 towns and cities in Slovakia as well as 17 other cities around the world. In Bratislava alone, about 60,000 people held a protest march, the biggest turnout of any demonstration since the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zažili sme najväčšie protesty od roku 1989|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/571169/online-protesty-po-vrazde-jana-kuciaka-a-martiny-kusnirovej/|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=Aktuality.sk|date=9 March 2018|language=Slovak}}</ref> The protests were endorsed by several universities in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, teachers, school associations, artists and non-governmental organizations. 21 universities cancelled afternoon lectures to allow students and employees to attend the protests.<ref>{{cite news|title=Enough of Fico, thousands of people shouted at gatherings across Slovakia|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20777059/enough-of-fico-thousands-of-people-shouted-at-gatherings-across-slovakia.html|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk|ref=2march}}</ref>

Two days after Prime Minister Fico's resignation, an even larger demonstration was held in Bratislava with over 65,000 people participating under slogans such as "Enough of [[Direction – Social Democracy|Smer]]" and "Early elections". Former Speaker of Parliament and ex-presidential candidate [[František Mikloško]] made an impassioned speech during the protest saying that "the revolution started by the parents has to be finished by their children". He argued that only twice in the history of post-war [[Czechoslovakia]] have popular protests managed to make the government resign: in November 1989 and now, adding that "when somebody tries to abuse their power in the future, they should remember March 2018 and the mass protests". Mikloško's speech was accompanied by the ringing of keys, reminiscent of the Velvet Revolution in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|title=Enough of Smer, people chanted in streets|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20782425/enough-of-smer-people-chanted-in-streets.html|accessdate=17 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk|date=16 March 2018}}</ref>

The prosecutor added that the murder had been carried out by professionals as a contract killing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teraz.sk/slovensko/brief-zverejnili-identikit-muza-ktor/349145-clanok.html|title=FOTO VO VNÚTRI: Tento muž by mal mať informácie o Kuciakovej vražde|first=|last=Teraz.sk|website=Teraz.sk|accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref> A man from Veľká Mača named Marek claiming to know the person from the image was subsequently questioned by police. He said it was his former colleague Miroslav Č., then living in [[Ostrava]], who told the media that he did not understand why he was on the identikit.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=25 September 2018|title=Prehovoril Miroslav, ktorého spoznali na identikite: Príbuzní z toho zostali hotoví|work=HNonline.sk|url=https://slovensko.hnonline.sk/1814344-prehovoril-miroslav-ktoreho-spoznali-na-identikite-pribuzni-z-toho-zostali-hotovi|url-status=live|access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite web|url=https://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/485764-velky-zasah-protizlocineckej-jednotky-naka-maju-vraha-kuciaka/|title=NAKA zadržala podozrivých z vraždy Kuciaka a Kušnírovej|date=27 September 2018|website=Pravda.sk|accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref>

On 27 September 2018, heavily-armed elite forces from the National Crime Agency (NAKA) arrested eight suspects in [[Kolárovo]]. Three of them, Tomáš Szabó, Miroslav Marček, and Zoltán Andruskó, were charged with the murder and other crimes, and the others were released. Minister Denisa Saková announced that around 200 individuals had been questioned in relation to the murder. The attorney of Ján Kuciak's family, [[Daniel Lipšic]], commented that "the scale of the investigation, even with help of [[Europol]] and other foreign investigative organisations, was unprecedented".<ref name="auto2"/>

On Friday 28 September 2018, Alena Zsuzsová was also arrested in relation to the murder, and became the fourth person to be charged with the murder.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=29 September 2018|title=V prípade vraždy Jána Kuciaka obvinili ďalšiu osobu, potvrdila prokuratúra|work=HNonline.sk|url=https://slovensko.hnonline.sk/1816938-v-pripade-vrazdy-jana-kuciaka-obvinili-dalsiu-osobu|url-status=live|access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref> It became clear that releasing the identikit was a tactical move by the police. The man pictured was related to one of the accused and after the identikit was released the suspects started to communicate more intensively.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=28 September 2018|title=Na policajnom identikite bol blízky obvineného z vraždy Kuciaka|work=Aktuality.sk|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/627737/na-policajnom-identikite-bol-blizky-obvineneho-z-vrazdy-kuciaka/|url-status=live|access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

On 30 September 2018 the prosecution's motion to take all four accused into custody was approved by the Specialized Criminal Court in [[Banská Bystrica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/488932-kocner-dal-udajne-pred-vrazdou-sledovat-kuciaka/|title=Tóth údajne špehoval novinárov pre Kočnera|date=22 October 2018|website=Pravda.sk|accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Subsequent investigation ===
On 4 October 2018, Lívia Kňažíková, the attorney of Zoltán Andruskó, confirmed that he was cooperating with police, and had named [[Marián Kočner|Marian Kočner]] as the individual ordering the killing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/629321/obhajkyna-potvrdila-andrusko-oznacil-kocnera-za-objednavatela-vrazdy/|title=Obhajkyňa potvrdila: Andruskó označil Kočnera za objednávateľa vraždy|website=Aktuality.sk|accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref>

On 14 March 2019, Kočner was charged with ordering the murder. At the time, Kočner was already in custody in relation to the case of forging of promissory notes involving TV Markíza.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=14 March 2019|title=Marian Kočner has been charged in the case of Kuciak's murder|work=The Slovak Spectator|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22074905/kuciak-kusnirova-murder-kocner-charges.html|url-status=live|access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

On 11 April 2019, Miroslav Marček told police that he was the one who shot Kuciak and Kušnírová, which disproved an earlier theory that Szabó was the shooter and Marček the driver.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=11 April 2019|title=Miroslav Marček sa priznal, že strieľal na Kuciaka|work=SME|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/22097399/miroslav-marcek-sa-priznal-ze-strielal-na-kuciaka.html|url-status=live|access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

== Political crisis ==
The same day the murder was announced, Prime Minister Fico called on the political opposition not to "exploit" the situation.<ref name=First/> Meanwhile, a number of opposition politicians accused the ruling Smer-SD party of indirect involvement. Member of Parliament Veronika Remišová, from the opposition [[Ordinary People (Slovakia)|OĽaNO]] party, compared the killings to the infamous murder of [[Róbert Remiáš]], a police officer who was assassinated in 1996, in an act widely believed to have been a contract killing by the [[Slovak mafia]] on the orders of Prime Minister [[Vladimír Mečiar]].<ref name="remias">{{cite news|title=Fico odmieta zneužívanie tragickej vraždy Kuciaka na politický boj|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20768892/politici-odsudili-vrazdu-investigativneho-novinara-kuciaka.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Sme.sk}}</ref> On 27 February, [[Freedom and Solidarity]] and OL'aNO demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Robert Kaliňák and Police President Tibor Gašpar.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opozícia spúšťa petíciu za odstúpenie Kaliňáka a policajného šéfa|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20769995/olano-a-sas-obvinuju-politikov-smeru-z-napojenie-na-taliansku-mafiu.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=SME.sk}}</ref>

The crisis escalated on 4 March when President Kiska made a live broadcast on state television, warning the government against further polarising the country. He called for either a "radical cabinet reshuffle" or a [[snap election]].<ref name="early">{{cite news|title=UPDATED: Fico won't step down, accuses Kiska of joining opposition|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20773344/kiska-government-reshuffle-or-early-elections.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}</ref> Kiska's speech infuriated Fico, who accused him of "joining the opposition".<ref name=early/> Furthermore, he accused the president of conspiring with Hungarian-American billionaire [[George Soros]] in the planning of a [[coup d'etat]], based on the fact that President Kiska met with Soros at Soros' apartment in [[New York City]] in September 2017, ostensibly to discuss issues related to the [[Romani people|Roma minority]].<ref name="soros">{{cite news|title=Fico steers conversation to Soros, saying he will deal with politics later|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20774275/fico-mentions-soros-says-he-will-deal-with-politics-later.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}</ref>

On 28 February, two days after the news of Kuciak's murder broke, Minister of Culture [[Marek Maďarič]] announced his resignation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vražda Kuciaka: Jasaň a Trošková opustí úřad vlády, ministr kultury Maďarič odstoupil|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/svet/2404909-slovensky-ministr-kultury-madaric-odstoupil-k-demisi-se-rozhodl-kvuli-vrazde-kuciaka|website=Ceskatelevize.cz|language=Czech}}</ref> Announcing his decision to the press, Madaric stated that "as a culture minister, I can't cope with the fact that a journalist was killed during my tenure."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Balogova|first1=Beata|title=Maďarič zrušil Fica aj jeho refrén|url=https://komentare.sme.sk/c/20770729/madaric-zrusil-fica-a-jeho-refren-ze-niet-dovodov-na-zodpovednost.html|accessdate=28 February 2018|agency=SME}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Culture Minister Maďarič resigns|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20770743/culture-minister-madaric-resigns.html|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref> [[Robert Kaliňák]], Minister of the Interior and Deputy Prime Minister, resigned on 12 March 2018 after weeks of mounting pressure.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dedinský|first1=Matej|title=Minister Kaliňák podáva demisiu|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/571728/minister-kalinak-podava-demisiu/|website=Aktuality.sk|language=Slovak}}</ref> The [[Most–Híd|Most-Híd]] party, the junior coalition partner in the government, had demanded the resignation of Kaliňák in exchange for continued support of Smer-SD.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slovakia journalist murder: Interior minister resigns|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43371821|accessdate=12 March 2018|agency=BBC News}}</ref> The next day, Most-Híd joined the calls for snap elections, announcing that it would leave the government if it failed to reach a deal with its two coalition partners, Smer-SD and the [[Slovak National Party]] (SNS). Most-Híd Chairman, [[Béla Bugár]], announced the decision after an eight-hour session of the Most-Hid Republican Council, the party's decision-making body.<ref>{{cite news|title=Most-Híd calls for early elections|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20779611/most-hid-calls-for-early-elections.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sme.sk}}</ref>

=== Fico resigns ===
On 14 March, following a meeting with President Kiska, Prime Minister Fico announced that he would resign to avoid [[Next Slovak parliamentary election|early elections]] and "solve the political crisis".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Terenzani|first1=Michaela|title=UPDATED: Fico is ready to resign tomorrow|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20781295/fico-is-ready-to-resign-tomorrow.html|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> During the meeting, Fico laid out a number of specific conditions to be met by the President in order for him to resign, including that the result of the [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2016|2016 Slovak parliamentary election]] be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and that Smer-SD, as the largest party in parliament, would name the next prime minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind, widely reported in Slovak media as Deputy Prime Minister [[Peter Pellegrini]].<ref name="Pellegrini">{{cite news|title=Minúta po minúte: Fico podá demisiu, novým premiérom môže byť Pellegrini |url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20780574/online-vladna-kriza-pokracuje.html?ref=st-bno-1|accessdate=14 March 2018|agency=Sme.sk}}</ref> On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignation of Fico and his cabinet, and tasked Pellegrini with the forming of a new government.<ref name=Newpm/>

=== Continued protests ===
On 22 March 2018, President Andrej Kiska appointed a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.etrend.sk/ekonomika/fico-dovladol-na-poslednej-schodzi-odvolali-andreu-kalavsku.html|title=etrend.sk|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Tomáš Drucker, former Minister of Health, was appointed Minister of Interior. Protest organisers announced on the same day via Facebook that they were cancelling the upcoming "For a Decent Slovakia" protest, and that they were forming a civic platform while closely watching the new government's next steps. 

Three days later they announced that if Drucker did not remove Police President Tibor Gašpar from office, protests would start again.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20789113/ak-drucker-neodvola-gaspara-zhromazdenia-za-slusne-slovensko-budu-pokracovat.html|title=sme.sk|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> On 28 March, they announced further protests. Around 30,000 people protested in Bratislava on 5 April. Drucker resigned on 16 April, saying that after a three-week assessment he did not agree with dismissing Gašpar, and would not remain as minister if it polarized society. The next day, Pellegrini and Gašpar announced that they agreed that Gašpar would step down at the end of May in order to calm the tensions.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.dw.com/en/slovakia-police-chief-resigns-after-public-outcry-over-investigative-journalists-death/a-43429791|title=dw.com|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Trials and sentencing ==

On 30 December 2019, one of the accused, Zoltán Andruskó, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after striking a deal with prosecutors. Andruskó pleaded guilty to all charges against him, and agreed to be a witness for the prosecution in the trials of the other defendants. Due to his cooperation with the murder investigation, the prosecutor proposed a reduction in his sentence from a possible 25 years to life in prison to 10 years, though this was rejected by the court. The court requested a sentence of 15 years in prison, which Andruskó accepted. His prison sentence began the same day.<ref>[https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/752401/rozsudok-nad-zoltanom-andruskoom/ Rozsudok nad Zoltánom Andruskóom (zvukový záznam)]</ref>

The trial of Marian Kočner, Alena Zsuzsová, Tomáš Szabó and Miroslav Marček began on 13 January 2020.<ref>[https://dennikn.sk/1691971/minuta-po-minute-zacina-sa-proces-s-obvinenymi-z-vrazdy-kuciaka-a-kusnirovej/?ref=tema Vražda Jána Kuciaka a Martiny Kušnírovej: Súd prijal obžalobu, hlavné pojednávanie sa začne 13. januára]</ref> The 2016 murder of Peter Molnár, a businessman from [[Kolárovo]], was included in the case. On the first day of the trial, Marček confessed to killing Kuciak and Kušnírová,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5424644|title=Ex-soldier admits pulling trigger in killing of Slovak journalist and fiancée that rocked country|publisher=CBC|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> and also admitted to killing Molnár during a violent burglary in 2016. On the second day of the trial, Andruskó testified against all four defendants. On 6 April 2020, Marček was sentenced to 23 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news |title=Killer of investigative journalist sentenced to 23 years in jail |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/killer-investigative-journalist-sentenced-23-years-jail-200406161350049.html |accessdate=6 April 2020 |work=Al Jazeera}}</ref> The prosecutor appealed against the sentence.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=6 April 2020|title=Slovak court sentences journalist's killer to 23 years in prison|work=Reuters|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-slovakia-crime/slovak-court-sentences-journalists-killer-to-23-years-in-prison-idUKKBN21O1MD|url-status=live|access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref> The Supreme Court increased Marček's sentence to 25 years.<ref name=":2" />

In a verdict delivered on 3 September 2020, Tomáš Szabó was found guilty of involvement in the murder of Kuciak and Kušnírová, the murder of Peter Molnár, and of unauthorised carrying of weapons. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Marian Kočner was found guilty of unauthorised carrying of weapons and given a fine of €5,000. Kočner and Alena Zsuzsová were acquitted of charges related to the murders of Kuciak and Kušnírová.<ref name=":1" /> The court stated that their involvement in the murders was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. The court explained its verdict by stating that not a single piece of direct evidence was put forward against Kočner, with the indictment being built on a series of circumstantial evidence; the only direct evidence against Zsuzsová was the testimony of Zoltán Andruskó.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=3 September 2020|title=Kočnera a Zsuzsovú oslobodili, prípad putuje na Najvyšší súd (minúta po minúte)|work=SME|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/22460470/kocner-rozsudok-vrazda-kuciaka-sud-minuta-po-minute-23-den.html?ref=terazbox_sme&ref=tab|url-status=live|access-date=3 September 2020}}</ref> The prosecutor appealed against the court's ruling to acquit Kočner and Zsuzsová.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=3 September 2020|title=Kuciak murder verdict: Kočner and Zsuzsová not guilty|work=The Slovak Spectator|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22460393/kuciak-murder-case-trial-verdict.html#storm_gallery_167497|url-status=live|access-date=3 September 2020}}</ref> Kočner remains in prison, having been sentenced by a first-degree court to 19 years in a case of forging of promissory notes involving TV Markíza. Zsuzsová was released and immediately arrested, as she is charged with involvement in the attempted murders of prosecutor Maroš Žilinka, prosecutor Peter Šufliarsky and Daniel Lipšic. On 5 September 2020, the Specialized Criminal Court in Banská Bystrica ordered custody for Zsuzsová.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=5 September 2020|title=Alena Zsuzsová, obvinená z prípravy troch vrážd, zostáva vo väzbe, rozhodol súd|work=Aktuality.sk|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/819634/alena-zsuzsova-priprava-vrazd-daniel-lipsic-maros-zilinka-peter-sufliarsky/|url-status=live|access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

Various public officials (domestic and international), media representatives, and organizations reacted negatively to this ruling. President [[Zuzana Čaputová]] said on Facebook that she was shocked by the verdict and needed to understand its explanation, and that she respects it but expects that the case will not end and will continue to the Supreme Court. Prime Minister [[Igor Matovič]] stated on Facebook: "It seems that for now the apparent instigators of the murder would like to slip out of the clutches of justice… Let’s believe that justice will wait for them both."<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=3 September 2020|title=Shock and shame.

Kušnírová's mother and her attorney Roman Kvasnica also appealed against the verdict, asking the Supreme Court to order the case to be reconsidered by the Specialized Criminal Court, this time by a different three-judge panel.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=2 November 2020|title=Vražda Kuciaka: Súd použil nepravdy, kľúčové dôkazy odignoroval, tvrdí advokát Kvasnica|work=Aktuality.sk|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/836400/vrazda-kuciaka-sud-pouzil-nepravdy-klucove-dokazy-odignoroval-tvrdi-kvasnica-v-odvolani/|url-status=live|access-date=2 November 2020}}</ref>
