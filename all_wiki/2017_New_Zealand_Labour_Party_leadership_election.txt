The '''2017 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election''' was held on 1 August 2017 to choose the next [[leader of the New Zealand Labour Party|Leader]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]. The election was won by Deputy Leader and [[Mount Albert (New Zealand electorate)|Mount Albert]] MP [[Jacinda Ardern]].

== Background ==
Labour leader [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] had led Labour since 2014 and, after several poor results, announced his intention to retire from the leadership following intense media speculation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11897500 |title=Andrew Little's full statement on resignation |date=1 August 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> According to Ardern, Little had previously approached her on 26 July 2017 and stated he thought she should take over as party leader, as he was of the opinion he could not turn things around for Labour. Ardern said she had refused, telling him to "stick it out".<ref name="Little asked Ardern">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11922098 |title=Little asked Ardern to lead six days before he resigned |date=14 September 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref>

==Result==
As Ardern was the only officially nominated candidate, she was universally elected as party leader and took over Little's role as [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] as well. [[Kelvin Davis (politician)|Kelvin Davis]] was then elected unopposed as deputy leader filling the vacancy caused by Ardern's elevation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11897537 |title=Jacinda Ardern elected as new Labour leader |author=Trevett, Claire |date=1 August 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> At 37, Ardern became the youngest leader of the Labour Party. She is also the second woman to lead the party after [[Helen Clark]]. Ardern's tenure as leader began just eight weeks before the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], and at a press conference following her election as leader, she said that the forthcoming election campaign would be one of "relentless positivity".<ref>{{cite web|author=Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/01/andrew-little-resigns-as-new-zealand-opposition-leader-weeks-from-election |title=Jacinda Ardern becomes youngest New Zealand Labour leader after Andrew Little quits  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>

==Outcome==
Immediately following the announcement that Ardern had been elected leader, Labour was inundated with donations by the public, at their peak reaching NZ$700 per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11897857 |title=Donations to Labour surge as Jacinda Ardern named new leader |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2 August 2017 |accessdate=7 September 2017}}</ref> Ardern's election was followed by a spate of positive coverage from many sections of the media, including international outlets such as CNN,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/01/asia/new-zealand-labour-jacinda-ardern/index.html|accessdate=1 September 2017|title='All bets are off' in New Zealand vote as 'Jacindamania' boosts Labour|date=1 September 2017|publisher=CNN – CNN}}</ref> with commentators referring to a 'Jacinda effect' and '[[Jacindamania]]'.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peacock|first1=Colin|title='Jacinda effect' in full effect in the media|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/mediawatch/audio/201853439/jacinda-effect-in-full-effect-in-the-media|accessdate=16 August 2017|work=Radio New Zealand|date=3 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/10/new-zealand-gripped-by-jacindamania-as-new-labour-leader-soars-in-polls|title=New Zealand gripped by 'Jacindamania' as new Labour leader soars in polls|last=Roy|first=Eleanor Ainge|date=10 August 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=13 September 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Labour also rose dramatically upon Ardern's elevation to the leadership; by late August they had risen to 43 per cent in the [[Colmar Brunton]] poll (having been 24 per cent before the leadership change) as well as managing to overtake [[New Zealand National Party|National]] in opinion polls for the first time in over a decade.<ref name="Little asked Ardern"/> In the last week of the campaign, the party dropped in the polls, and achieved second place behind National in the preliminary results of the 23 September election. However National did not secure a majority, leaving [[New Zealand First]] as kingmaker, which negotiated with both parties about a coalition agreement. On 19 October 2017, it was announced that Labour had formed a government with New Zealand First and [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|the Greens]], and making Ardern Prime Minister.

Andrew Little was later lauded by Labour supporters for putting aside his personal ambition to allow Ardern to lead Labour, which saw a swift reversal of fortunes. His decision was labelled a "selfless masterstroke" and he was praised for his integrity and selflessness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11935044|accessdate=20 October 2017|title=Andrew Little – he is the real hero say supporters|date=20 October 2017|work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref> Little acknowledged later that the decision to stand aside was a painful one but got over it quickly knowing that his move had paid off for Labour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/105909730/andrew-little-one-year-on-from-resigning-as-labour-party-leader|accessdate=27 May 2020|title=Andrew Little one year on from resigning as Labour Party leader|date=1 August 2018|work=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref> He was then elected as a Cabinet Minister by the Labour caucus following Labour's formation of a government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/342022/video-who-s-in-who-s-out|accessdate=20 October 2017|title=Who's in?
