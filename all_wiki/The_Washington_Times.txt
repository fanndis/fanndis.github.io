At the time of founding of ''The Washington Times'', Washington had only one major newspaper, ''[[The Washington Post]]''. [[Massimo Introvigne]], in his 2000 book ''The Unification Church'', said that the ''Post'' had been "the most anti-Unificationist paper in the United States."<ref>[http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm excerpt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513174704/http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }} The Unification Church Studies in Contemporary Religion, Massimo Introvigne, 2000, Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}} p. 25</ref> In 2002, at an event held to celebrate the ''Times''{{'}} 20th anniversary, Moon said: "''The Washington Times'' is responsible to let the American people know about God" and "''The Washington Times'' will become the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world."<ref name="Moon Speech">{{cite news|last=Ahrens|first=Frank|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/05/23/moon-speech-raises-old-ghosts-as-the-times-turns-20/505334e8-8ce6-44eb-a767-ee7895107cae/|title=Moon Speech Raises Old Ghosts as the Times Turns 20|date=May 23, 2002|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=August 16, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200428224258/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/05/23/moon-speech-raises-old-ghosts-as-the-times-turns-20/505334e8-8ce6-44eb-a767-ee7895107cae/|archive-date=April 28, 2020|url-access=limited}}</ref>

''The Washington Times'' was founded the year after the ''[[Washington Star]]'', the previous "second paper" of D.C., went out of business. A large percentage of the staff came from the ''Star''. When it launched, it was unusual among American [[broadsheet]]s in publishing a full color front page, along with full color front pages in all its sections and color elements throughout. It also used ink that it advertised as being less likely to come off on the reader's hands than the type used by the ''Post''.<ref name="'70s 146">{{cite book|last=Frum|first=David|url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/146|title=How We Got Here: The 70's|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-465-04195-4|location=New York City|page=146|chapter=God Moves to Dallas|lccn=00271770|authorlink=David Frum|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/146|url-access=registration}}</ref> At its start, it had 125 reporters, 25 percent of whom were members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bumiller|first=Elisabeth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/wtimes.htm|title=The Nation's Capital Gets A New Daily Newspaper|date=May 17, 1982|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906184720/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/wtimes.htm|archive-date=September 6, 2008|page=C01|author-link=Elisabeth Bumiller}}</ref>

U.S. President [[George H. W.

The ''Report'' suggested that these newspapers, being owned by religious institutions, were less influenced by pro-Israel pressure groups in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/1297/9712060.html As U.S. Media Ownership Shrinks, Who Covers Islam?] {{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050421165328/http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/1297/9712060.html |date=April 21, 2005 }}, ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', December 1997</ref>

In 2004, ''Post'' columnist [[David Ignatius]] reported that [[Chung Hwan Kwak]], an important leader in the Unification movement, wanted ''The Washington Times'' to "support international organizations such as the [[United Nations]] and to campaign for world peace and interfaith understanding." This, Ignatius wrote, created difficulties for Pruden and some of the ''Times''{{'}} columnists. Ignatius also mentioned the Unification movement's reconciliatory attitude towards North Korea, which at the time included joint business ventures, and Kwak's advocacy for greater understanding between the U.S. and the [[Islamic world]] as issues of contention. Ignatius predicted that conservatives in Congress and the [[George W. Bush]] administration would support Pruden's position over Kwak's.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ignatius|first=David|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50909-2004Jun17.html|title=Tension of the Times|date=June 18, 2004|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106154418/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50909-2004Jun17.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|page=A29|quote=Insiders say the church's new line is that with the end of the Cold War, it's important to support international organizations such as the United Nations and to campaign for world peace and interfaith understanding.

In 2006, Moon's son [[Hyun Jin Moon]], president and CEO of News World Communications, dismissed managing editor Francis "Fran" Coombs because of accusations of racist editorializing. Coombs had made some racist and [[sexism|sexist]] comments, for which he was sued by other employees of ''The Washington Times''.<ref name=":7"/>

==== Ozone depletion denial====
In the 1990s, ''The Washington Times'' published columns which cast doubt on the scientific consensus on the causes of [[ozone depletion]] (which had led to an "ozone hole"). It published columns disputing the science as late as 2000.<ref name="handful"/> In 1991, NASA scientists warned of the potential of a major Arctic ozone hole developing in the spring of 1992 due to elevated levels of [[chlorine monoxide]] in the Arctic [[stratosphere]]. However, as the Arctic winter was unusually warm, the chemical reactions needed for ozone depletion did not occur. Even though the science was not incorrect, the ''Times'', along with other conservative media, subsequently created a "[[The boy who cried wolf|crying wolf]]" narrative, where scientists were portrayed as political activists who were following an environmental agenda rather than the science. In 1992, it published an editorial saying: "This is not the disinterested, objective, just-the-facts tone one ordinarily expects from scientists... This is the cry of the apocalyptic, laying the groundwork for a decidedly non-scientific end: public policy... it would be nice if the next time NASA cries 'wolf,' fewer journalists, politicians and citizens heed the warning like sheep."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brysse|first1=Keynyn|last2=Oreskes|first2=Naomi|author-link2=Naomi Oreskes|last3=o'Reilly|first3=Jessica|last4=Oppenheimer|first4=Michael|author-link4=Michael Oppenheimer|date=February 2013|title=Climate change prediction: Erring on the side of least drama?|url=http://www.phys.uri.edu/nigh/FFRI/LeastDrama.pdf|url-status=live|journal=[[Global Environmental Change]]|volume=23|issue=1|pages=327–337|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.10.008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809005641/http://www.phys.uri.edu/nigh/FFRI/LeastDrama.pdf|archive-date=August 9, 2017|via=the [[University of Rhode Island]]}}</ref>

==== Second-hand smoke denial====
In 1995, ''The Washington Times'' published a column by [[Fred Singer]], who is known for promoting views contrary to mainstream science on a number of issues, where Singer referred to the science on the adverse health impact of [[second-hand smoke]] as the "second-hand smoke scare" and accused the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] of distorting data when it classified second-hand smoke as harmful.<ref name="myths"/><ref name="inq climate"/> In 1995, it published an editorial titled "How not to spend science dollars" condemning a grant to the National Cancer Institute to study how political contributions from tobacco companies shape policy-making and the voting behavior of politicians.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landman|first=Anne|last2=Glantz|first2=Stanton A.|author-link2=Stanton Glantz|date=January 2009|title=Tobacco Industry Efforts to Undermine Policy-Relevant Research|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=99|issue=1|pages=45–58|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.130740|pmc=2600597|pmid=19008508}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=xkyk0101|title=How not to spend science dollars|date=May 28, 1995|work=The Washington Times|page=B2|via=the [[University of California, San Francisco]]|access-date=December 29, 2018|archive-date=October 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028200232/https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=xkyk0101|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Misreporting on the COVID-19 pandemic====
In January 2020, ''The Washington Times'' published two widely shared articles about the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] that suggested that the virus was created by the Chinese government as a [[biological weapon]].

=== White nationalism, neo-Confederatism, and racism===
Under Pruden's editorship (1992–2008), ''The Washington Times'' regularly printed excerpts from racist hard-right publications including [[VDARE]] and ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', and from [[Bill White (neo-Nazi)|Bill White]], leader of the American [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] Workers' Party, in its Culture Briefs section.<ref name=":4" /> [[Robert Stacy McCain]], a member of the [[neo-Confederate]] white-supremacist group [[League of the South]], was hired and promoted to edit the Culture Briefs section, which became, according to [[Max Blumenthal]], "a bulletin board for the racialist far right." Blumenthal also wrote that ''The Washington Times'' was: "characterized by extreme racial animus and connections to nativist and neo-Confederate organizations... from its earliest days the ''Times'' has been a hothouse for hard-line racialists and neo-Confederates."<ref name=":7">{{Cite news|last=Blumenthal|first=Max|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/hell-times/|title=Hell of a Times|date=September 20, 2006|work=[[The Nation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428214516/http://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hell-times/|archive-date=April 28, 2020|author-link=Max Blumenthal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Blumenthal|first=Max|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/palins-noxious-ghostwriter|title=Palin's Noxious Ghostwriter|date=November 16, 2009|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200429070452/https://www.thedailybeast.com/palins-noxious-ghostwriter|archive-date=April 29, 2020|author-link=Max Blumenthal|access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref>

In a February 2013 article, the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' reported that under Pruden's editorship ''The Washington Times'' was: "a forum for the racialist hard right, including [[white nationalism|white nationalists]], neo-Confederates, and anti-immigrant scare mongers."<ref name=":4" /> Between 1998 and 2004, the ''Times'' covered every biennial American Renaissance conference, hosted by the [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] [[New Century Foundation]]. According to the ''Columbia Journalism Review'', "the paper's coverage of these events—which are hotbeds for [[Holocaust denial|holocaust deniers]], [[neo-Nazi]]s, and [[eugenics|eugenicists]]—was stunningly one sided", and favorably depicted the conference and attendees.<ref name=":4" /> In 2009, journalist [[David Neiwert]] wrote that it championed, "various white-nationalist causes emanating from the neo-Confederate movement (with which, until a recent housecleaning, two senior editors had long associations.)"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neiwert|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdlqCwAAQBAJ|title=The Eliminationists: How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right|publisher=Paradigm Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9781317260615|edition=2016 Routledge|page=80|chapter=The Transmitters|author-link=David Neiwert|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819205400/https://books.google.com/books?id=RdlqCwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) noted that ''The Washington Times'' had, by 2005, published at least 35 articles by Marian Kester Coombs, who was married to managing editor Francis Coombs.

==== Coverage of Barack Obama ====

In 2008, ''The Washington Times'' published a column by Frank Gaffney that promoted the false [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories which asserted that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya]] and was courting the "[[Jihadism|jihadist]] vote." Gaffney also published pieces in 2009 and 2010 promoting the false assertion that [[Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories|Obama is a Muslim]].<ref name="Obama"/> In a 2009 column entitled "'Inner Muslim' at work in Cairo", Pruden wrote that President Obama was the: "first president without an instinctive appreciation of the culture, history, tradition, common law and literature whence America sprang. The genetic imprint writ large in his 43 predecessors is missing from the Obama DNA."<ref name=":4" /> In another 2009 column, Pruden wrote that Obama had "no natural instinct or blood impulse” for what America was about because he was “sired by a [[Kenya]]n father” and “born to a mother attracted to men of the [[Third World]]."<ref name=":4" /> These columns stirred controversy, leading ''The Washington Times'' to assign David Mastio, its deputy editor, to edit Pruden's work.<ref name=":4" />
