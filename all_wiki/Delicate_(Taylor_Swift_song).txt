===Synopsis===
Swift is seen looking vacant on the red carpet, snapping to attention as hordes of reporters shove microphones at her. A mysterious figure slips a piece of paper into her hands. In a hotel lobby, people turn and stare as she walks by surrounded by four bodyguards. As she tries to take a photo with fans, a man dressed as a bellhop tries to grab her and security drag him away. Swift rolls her eyes and continues to walk with her security team, testing how they mimic her every move.

In a dressing room she makes silly faces in the mirror before being interrupted by a group of women (Junko Cheng): turning back to the mirror, the piece of paper glows on the counter and she can't see her reflection anymore, and she realizes that she's invisible. Delighted to have freedom, she breaks out into joyful dance all over the hotel, although she gets sad when she realizes she cannot engage in close conversation with a stranger. Swift moves from the hotel into the Los Angeles subway and onto rain-drenched streets. Soaked but happy, she arrives at the dive bar she references in the song, opening the glowing note, seemingly removing her invisibility as she is choosing to reveal herself to some. People turn to look as she comes in, drenched, and she realizes she is no longer invisible - but she smiles as she seems to recognize someone there.

===Vertical video===
