'''Carly Elisabeth Simon''' (born June 25, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and children's author. She first rose to fame in the 1970s with a string of hit records; her 13 [[Billboard Hot 100|Top 40]] U.S. hits include "[[Anticipation (song)|Anticipation]]" (No. 13), "[[Haven't Got Time for the Pain]]" (No. 14), "[[You Belong to Me (Carly Simon song)|You Belong to Me]]" (No. 6), "[[Coming Around Again (Carly Simon song)|Coming Around Again]]" (No. 18), and her four [[Music recording certification|Gold]]-certified singles "[[You're So Vain]]" (No. 1), "[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)#1970s: Carly Simon and James Taylor|Mockingbird]]" (No. 5, a duet with [[James Taylor]]), "[[Nobody Does It Better]]" (No. 2) from the 1977 [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', and "[[Jesse (Carly Simon song)|Jesse]]" (No. 11).

After a brief stint with her sister [[Lucy Simon]] as duo group the [[The Simon Sisters|Simon Sisters]], she found great success as a solo artist with her 1971 self-titled debut album ''[[Carly Simon (album)|Carly Simon]]'', which won her the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], and spawned her first Top 10 single, "[[That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be]]" (No. 10).

===The Simon Sisters===
Simon's career began with a short-lived music group with her sister Lucy, as [[the Simon Sisters]]. They were signed to [[Kapp Records]] in 1964, and released two albums for the label that year, beginning with their debut album, ''[[Meet The Simon Sisters]]''. They had a minor hit with the lead single, "Winkin', Blinkin' and Nod",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/298710/carly-simon/biography |title=Carly Simon Biography |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=July 17, 2014}}</ref> a children's poem by [[Eugene Field]] that Lucy had put to music. Their second album, ''[[Cuddlebug]]'', quickly followed. The duo made one more album together, 1969's ''[[The Simon Sisters Sing the Lobster Quadrille and Other Songs for Children]]'', before Lucy left to get married and start a family. Later, Simon collaborated with eclectic New York rockers [[Elephant's Memory]] for about six months. She also appeared in the 1971 [[Miloš Forman]] film ''[[Taking Off (film)|Taking Off]]'', playing an auditioning singer, and sang "Long Term  physical Effects", which was included in the 1971 [[Taking Off (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film.

===Going solo===
Simon was signed by [[Jac Holzman]] to [[Elektra Records]] in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/timeline/HerWords1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901020944/http://www.carlysimon.com/timeline/HerWords1.htm |archive-date=September 1, 2007 |title=Carly Simon Official Website – Timeline |access-date=March 18, 2015}}</ref> She released her self-titled debut album, ''[[Carly Simon (album)|Carly Simon]]'', in March 1971. The album contained her breakthrough top-ten hit "[[That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be]]", which peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, and earned Simon a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[14th Annual Grammy Awards]]. The album itself peaked at No. 30, and Simon won [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] at the same ceremony.

Her second album, ''[[Anticipation (Carly Simon album)|Anticipation]]'', came in November of that same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/anticipation/ |title=Anticipation |access-date=February 17, 2014 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref> Like its predecessor, the album peaked at No. 30, and its lead single, also titled "[[Anticipation (song)|Anticipation]]", became a significant hit. It reached No. 3 at Easy Listening radio and No. 13 on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's Pop singles]] chart, and earned Simon a second nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, at the [[15th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It subsequently became notable in popular culture for its use in a variety of commercials to market the ketchup of the [[H. J. Heinz Company]].<ref>{{cite web |author=94.5 Kool FM |url=http://kool.cbslocal.com/2011/05/09/carly-simon-had-a-hard-time-living-this-down/ |title=Carly Simon Had a Hard Time Living This Down |access-date=August 14, 2014}}</ref> The single was written in 15 minutes while Simon waited for [[Cat Stevens]] to pick her up for a date.<ref>{{cite web |author=Weller, Sheila |url=http://www.girlslikeusthemusic.com/2010/08/chapter-12.html |title=(Page 353) – Carly Simon's late date |publisher=Girls Like Us (The Music) |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> The pair had become romantically involved shortly after Simon had opened for Stevens at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|L.A.'s Troubadour]] around the time her debut album was released.

The next single release, "[[Legend in Your Own Time]]", made a more modest impact on the charts, peaking at No. 50 on the Pop singles and No. 11 on the Easy Listening.<ref name="CatStevens songs">{{cite web |url=http://www.majicat.com/photos/Carly_Cat.htm |title=Lyrics from the songs which were written for Cat Stevens by Carly Simon- with photo |website=Majicat.com |access-date=March 21, 2010}}</ref>

==Success==
[[File:Carly Simon (1972) press photo.jpg|thumb|left | alt=Simon smiling b&w |1972 press photo]]
Simon scored the biggest success of her career in 1972–73, with "[[You're So Vain]]". It hit No. 1 on the U.S. Pop and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and sold over a million copies in the United States alone. It was one of the decade's biggest hits and propelled Simon's breakthrough album ''[[No Secrets (Carly Simon album)|No Secrets]]'' to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts, where it stayed for five consecutive weeks. The album achieved Gold status that year, and by its 25th anniversary in 1997 it had been certified Platinum.<ref name="riaa.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=%22Simon,%20Carly%22&format=Album&go=Search&perPage=25# |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – July 15, 2015 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906075140/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archive-date=September 6, 2014 }}</ref> "You're So Vain" received [[Grammy Award]] [[nominate|nominations]] for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1974-223.html |title=Grammy Awards 1974 |website=Awards&Shows.com |access-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDRLXxFgOcQ |title=16th 1973 Grammy Awards Song of the Year|via=YouTube|access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> Additionally, in 2008, it was listed at No. 72 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'s list of the top 100 songs from the chart's first 50 years, August 1958 through July 2008. On August 23, 2014, the [[Official Charts Company|UK Official Charts Company]] gave it the accolade of 'ultimate song of the 1970s'.<ref>{{cite web |author=Myers, Justin |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/features/official-charts-pop-gem-70-carly-simon-youre-so-vain-3071/ |title=Official Charts Pop Gem No. 70 |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref>

The subject of the "You're So Vain" song itself became one of the biggest mysteries in popular music, with the famous lyric "You're so vain/I bet you think this song is about you". For more than 40 years, Simon has not publicly revealed the name of the subject.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/youre-so-vain/ |title=You're So Vain |access-date=February 17, 2016 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref> She hinted that it could be a composite of several people, with most press speculation considering [[Mick Jagger]], who sings backup vocals on the recording,<ref>{{cite web |author=Wilkening, Matthew |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/mick-jagger-songs-with-secret-guests/ |title=Secret Guests in Rock Songs |website=UltimateClassicRock.com |access-date=August 29, 2014}}</ref> and [[Warren Beatty]]. Simon hinted the identity to a variety of talk shows and publications over the years, and, on August 5, 2003, auctioned off the information to the winner of a charity function for US$50,000, with the condition that the winner, television executive [[Dick Ebersol]], not reveal it.<ref name="You'resoVain">{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/vain/vain.html |title=Billboard Magazine's Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs |last=Simon |first=Carly |author2=Billboard Magazine |date=July 2008 |work=Carly Simon Official Website |access-date=February 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209193126/http://carlysimon.com/vain/vain.html |archive-date=February 9, 2009}}</ref> Finally, in November 2015, Simon, promoting her about-to-be-published memoir, said, "I have confirmed that the second verse is Warren" and added that while "Warren thinks the whole thing is about him", he is the subject only of that verse, with the remainder of the song referring to two other, still unnamed men.<ref name=people-11-2015>{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/article/carly-simon-confirms-youre |title=''People'' Exclusive: Carly Simon Says 'You're So Vain' Is About Warren Beatty – Well, Only the Second Verse: 'He Thinks the Whole Thing Is About Him!' |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |first1=Kathy Erich |last1=Dowd |first2=Kim |last2=Hubbard |date=November 18, 2015 |access-date=November 18, 2015}}</ref>

The follow-up single, "[[The Right Thing to Do]]", was another sizable hit later in 1973, reaching No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No. 17 on the Pop chart. That same year, Simon performed on [[Lee Clayton (musician)|Lee Clayton]]'s album ''Lee Clayton'' and co-sang on the song "New York Suite 409" and on [[Livingston Taylor]]'s album ''[[Over the Rainbow (Livingston Taylor album)|Over the Rainbow]]'' and sang with both Livingston and his famous brother, [[James Taylor]] (who was, by then, her husband) on the songs "Loving Be My New Horizon" and "[[Oh, Pretty Woman|Pretty Woman]]".

In 1974, Simon followed the smash ''[[No Secrets (Carly Simon album)|No Secrets]]'' album with ''[[Hotcakes (album)|Hotcakes]]'', which became an instant hit, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard's'' Album Chart and was certified Gold. ''Hotcakes'' included two top ten singles, "[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)#1970s: Carly Simon and James Taylor|Mockingbird]]", a duet with James Taylor that peaked at No. 5 on ''Billboard's'' Pop Singles chart, and "[[Haven't Got Time for the Pain]]", which hit No. 2 on ''Billboard's'' Adult Contemporary chart.<ref name="HotcakesHits">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5430/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Billboard Singles Chart, Carly Simon|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 30, 2010}}</ref> The same year, Simon provided vocals on [[Tom Rush]]'s album ''[[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|Ladies Love Outlaws]]'' and co-sang with Rush on "No Regrets" and as backup on "Claim on Me".

Simon's ''[[Playing Possum]]'' (1975) and ''[[Another Passenger]]'' (1976) continued her run of high-profile and generally well-received album releases. ''Playing Possum'' was a Top Ten album, and garnered a successful Top 40 single "[[Attitude Dancing]]" and two other charting singles,<ref name="PlayingPossum">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17985|pure_url=yes}} |title=Playing Possum Overview |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 30, 2010}}</ref> but its racy album cover, which depicts Simon wearing only a black negligee and knee-high black boots, generated controversy.<ref>{{cite web |author=Weller, Sheila |url=http://www.girlslikeusthemusic.com/2010/08/girls-like-us-chapter-fifteen.html |title=(Page 446) Carly and James record in L.A. |publisher=Girls Like Us (The Music) |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> In 1991, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it No. 20 on their list of the 100 greatest album covers.<ref name="rateyourmusic.com">{{cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/fedderedder/rolling_stones_100_greatest_album_covers/ |title=Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Album Covers |publisher=Rate Your Music |date=November 14, 1991 |access-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715074737/http://rateyourmusic.com/list/fedderedder/rolling_stones_100_greatest_album_covers/ |archive-date=July 15, 2012 }}</ref> ''Another Passenger'' produced only one charting single on the ''Billboard'' Pop singles chart, "[[It Keeps You Runnin'#Carly Simon version|It Keeps You Runnin']]", written by Michael McDonald of [[the Doobie Brothers]], which peaked just outside the Top 40, at No. 46,<ref name="AnotherPassenger">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5430/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=Carly Simon Billboard Singles |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 30, 2010}}</ref> and the second single, "Half A Chance", only charted on the Adult Contemporary chart.

In the appearance, she sang two songs: "Half A Chance" and her [[signature song]], "You're So Vain".<ref>{{cite web |author=Night Live|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/saturday-night-live/madeline-kahn-carly-simon-112164/ |title=Madeline Kahn/Carly Simon |website=[[TV.com]] |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>

In 1977, Simon had an international hit with the million-selling gold single "[[Nobody Does It Better]]", the theme to the [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''. The song, her second-biggest U.S. hit after "You're So Vain", was 1977's biggest Adult Contemporary hit, where it held No. 1 for seven straight weeks. The single peaked one step behind [[Debby Boone]]'s mega-hit "[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]" on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Pop Singles chart from October 22 to November 5, 1977, and received Grammy nominations for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female. In 2012, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it the third-greatest ''[[James Bond]]'' theme song.<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked it No. 2 on its list that same year. Also in 1977, Simon [[Record producer|co-produced]] [[Libby Titus]]'s album ''Libby Titus'' and sang backup on two songs: "Can This Be Our Love Affair?" and "Darkness 'Til Dawn", the later which comes from Simon's ''Another Passenger''.

Simon's career took another upward swing in 1978 with the hit album ''[[Boys in the Trees]]''. The album produced two Top 40 singles; the jazzy and sensual "[[You Belong to Me (Carly Simon song)|You Belong to Me]]", which hit the Top 10 on both the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts, and "[[Devoted to You (song)#Carly Simon and James Taylor version|Devoted to You]]", a duet with James Taylor. ''Boys in the Trees'' was a major success, and returned Simon to Platinum album status in the U.S. "You Belong to Me" later earned Simon yet another Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female. She was featured on the front covers of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazines that spring. Also in 1978, Simon and Taylor sang backing vocals on two songs for Taylor's sister [[Kate Taylor|Kate]]'s album ''[[Kate Taylor (album)|Kate Taylor]]'': "Happy Birthday Sweet Darling" and "Jason & Ida". They sang backup on three songs on [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]]'s debut solo album ''John Hall'', "The Fault", "Good Enough" and "Voyagers". They also sing backup on one song, "Power", from Hall's next album, also titled ''Power'' (1979).

On November 2, 1978, Simon guested on the song "I Live in the Woods" at a live, four-hour concert by [[Burt Bacharach]] and the [[Houston Symphony|Houston Symphony Orchestra]] at Jones Hall in [[Houston]], Texas. All the songs at that concert became Bacharach's album ''[[Woman (Burt Bacharach album)|Woman]]'', which was released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |author=Woman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/woman-mw0000564487 |title=AllMusic review |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> That year, shortly after the [[Three Mile Island]] nuclear accident, from September 19 to 22, a series of concerts were held at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]] and sponsored by [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE), a group of musicians against nuclear power, co-founded by John Hall. Always politically active, Simon and James Taylor were part of the concerts which later became a documentary and [[concert film]], ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]'' (1980),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081242/|title=No Nukes |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=June 22, 2014}}</ref> as well as a live album [[No Nukes: The Muse Concerts for a Non-Nuclear Future|of the same name]] (1979).<ref>{{cite web |website=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/no-nukes-mw0000024631 |title=AllMusic review |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>

In 1979, Simon released her last album for Elektra, entitled ''[[Spy (Carly Simon album)|Spy]]''. The albums sales were a disappointment, peaking at only No. 45 on the [[Billboard 200|Pop albums chart]], although a hard-edged single from the album, "[[Vengeance (Carly Simon song)|Vengeance]]", became a modest hit and received airplay on U.S. album rock stations, and peaked at No. 48 on the Pop singles chart.<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/298710/carly-simon/chart |title=Carly Simon – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> "Vengeance" earned Simon a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] in early 1980—the first year to feature the new category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/rockfemale.htm |title=GRAMMY: Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female |publisher=Rock on the Net |access-date=June 16, 2014}}</ref> The album also features a track entitled "Never Been Gone", which became a fan favorite, as well as one of her personal favorites.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=CarlySimon.com/Wayback Machine |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/askcarly/archives/archive-042007.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704124855/http://www.carlysimon.com/askcarly/archives/archive-042007.htm |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |title=Ask Carly archives |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> In 2009, she released ''[[Never Been Gone]]'', a newly recorded greatest hits album entitled after the track.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/never-been-gone/ |title=Never Been Gone |access-date=February 17, 2016 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref>

From 1972 to 1979, Simon sang backup vocals on the following James Taylor songs and albums (not counting compilations): "One Man Parade" from 1972's ''[[One Man Dog]]'', "Rock 'n' Roll Is Music Now", "Let It All Fall Down", "Me and My Guitar", "Daddy's Baby" and "Ain't No Song" from 1974's ''[[Walking Man]]'', "[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)|How Sweet It Is]]" from 1975's ''[[Gorilla (James Taylor album)|Gorilla]]'', "[[Shower the People]]", "A Junkie's Lament", "Slow Burning Love" and "Family Man" from 1976's ''[[In the Pocket (James Taylor album)|In the Pocket]]'', and "B.S.U.R." from 1979's ''[[Flag (James Taylor album)|Flag]]''.

==1980s==
In 1980, Simon signed with Elektra's sibling label [[Warner Bros. Records]] and released her ninth studio album, ''[[Come Upstairs]]''. In [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, during a show to promote the album, Simon collapsed onstage from exhaustion.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Hall, Jane |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20096901,00.html |title=After An Onstage Collapse and a Six-Year Battle with Stage Fright, Carly Simon Braves a Comeback |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=August 17, 1987 |access-date=November 9, 2014}}</ref> She subsequently performed considerably less throughout the 1980s. From that album, Simon scored another million-selling U.S. Gold single with the hit "[[Jesse (Carly Simon song)|Jesse]]", which peaked at No. 11 and remained on the charts for nearly six months.<ref name="billboard.com"/> After the major chart success of "Jesse", Simon's singles became generally less successful in the mid 1980s, although most of them did well on [[Adult Contemporary music|Adult Contemporary]] radio formats. Simon also contributed the song "Be With Me" to the 1980 album ''[[In Harmony (compilation albums)|In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record]]'',<ref>{{cite web |author=In Harmony |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-harmony-mw0000203141 |title=AllMusic review |access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> which was produced by her sister [[Lucy Simon|Lucy]] and Lucy's husband, David Levine. Simon can also be heard on the song "In Harmony", along with other members of the Simon/Taylor families.

''[[Torch (Carly Simon album)|Torch]]'' (1981) was an album of melancholy jazz standards, recorded long before it became fashionable for rock artists to delve into the "great American songbook". It peaked outside the top 40 on album charts (at No. 50) but remained on the charts for nearly six months and subsequently became one of her best-selling catalogue albums.<ref>Steve Morse, "Singing Against the Grain", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', April 15, 1990</ref> The album was well-received critically,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/torch-mw0000193526 |title=AllMusic Review|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 30, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author=Holden, Stephen|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/torch-19811210|title=Torch review|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date= December 10, 1981|access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> and featured one original song by Simon, "From The Heart",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.carlysimon.com/music/Lyrics/From_The_Heart.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163610/http://www.carlysimon.com/music/Lyrics/From_The_Heart.html| archive-date=May 9, 2008| title=From The Heart lyrics| access-date=August 30, 2014 | website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref> as well as a cover of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s "Not a Day Goes By" from his musical ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]''. Also in 1981, Carly Simon was the second female solo artist to be featured on MTV's first day of the air in her video for "Vengeance" ([[Pat Benatar]] was the first female solo artist to appear on MTV, and [[Juice Newton]] was the third).

In 1982, she sang the [[Nile Rodgers]] & [[Bernard Edwards]]-produced single "[[Why (Carly Simon song)|Why]]", from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Soup for One (film)|Soup for One]]''. It was a top ten hit in the U.K., and successful throughout Europe.<ref name="the official charts">{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/carly%20simon/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204002945/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/carly%20simon/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title=UK Charts > Carly Simon |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=February 20, 2012}}</ref> Although "Why" stalled at No. 74 in the U.S., the song became a mellow classic in the aftermath of its being picked up to be covered and sampled by different artists from around 1989 onward. She had another UK success with the single "[[Kissing with Confidence]]", a song from the 1983 album ''Dancing For Mental Health'' by [[Will Powers]] (a pseudonym for photographer [[Lynn Goldsmith]]). Simon was the uncredited singer of the song co-written and mixed by [[Todd Rundgren]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/ai/Kissing.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622151804/http://www.carlysimon.com/ai/Kissing.htm| archive-date=June 22, 2008| title=Kissing With Confidence |access-date=August 30, 2014 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref>

In 1983, she made her last album for Warner, ''[[Hello Big Man]]'', but this also suffered from disappointing sales; it did receive positive critical recognition.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hello-big-man-mw0000650771 |title=Hell Big man : AllMusic review |access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |author=Shewey, Don |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hello-big-man-19831124 |title=Hello Big Man review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 24, 1983 |access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> The lead single from the album, "[[You Know What to Do (Carly Simon song)|You Know What to Do]]", peaked at No. 83 on the Pop singles chart,<ref name="billboard.com"/> and Simon filmed a music video for it at her home on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts|MA]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=CarlySimon.com/Wayback Machine|url=http://www.carlysimon.com/music/Hello_Big_Man.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223120814/http://www.carlysimon.com/music/Hello_Big_Man.html#.VAEtc8VdViM|archive-date=February 23, 2014|title=Hello Big Man|access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> That same year, Simon performed on two albums, ''The Perfect Stranger'' by [[Jesse Colin Young]] (singing on the track "Fight For It" with Young) and ''Wonderland'' by [[Nils Lofgren]] (singing on the track "Lonesome Ranger" with Lofgren). By this time, her contract with Warner Bros. had ended. In 1985, she signed with [[Epic Records]] and made one album for them, ''[[Spoiled Girl]]''. The album yielded two singles, "[[Tired of Being Blonde]]" and "[[My New Boyfriend]]", with only the former charting. The album was commercially unsuccessful and her contract with Epic was cancelled.

In 1986, Simon signed with [[Arista Records]] and soon rebounded from her career slump. Her first album for Arista, ''[[Coming Around Again (album)|Coming Around Again]]'' (1987), gave Simon another international hit with the title track (which was featured in the film ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]''), returning her to the Billboard Pop Top 20 and the UK Top 10 (it also garnered her a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]).

The ''Coming Around Again'' album also featured the Top 10 Adult Contemporary hits "[[Give Me All Night]]", "[[The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of]]", "[[All I Want Is You (Carly Simon song)|All I Want Is You]]" (which featured [[Roberta Flack]] on backing vocals), and a cover of "[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]" (featuring [[Stevie Wonder]] on harmonica).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/as-time-goes-by/ |title=Coming Around Again |access-date=February 17, 2016 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref> The album itself was her first [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] release in nine years, and went [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] in 1988.

Most of these songs were compiled for her 1988 album, ''[[Greatest Hits Live (Carly Simon album)|Greatest Hits Live]]''. The album continued her mounting comeback, quickly going Gold, and was later certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]] in 1996. From ''Live'' a recording of Simon's evergreen "You're So Vain" was released as a single in the UK.

[[File:Carly Simon (1989).jpg|thumb|Simon, with her Oscar in hand, at the [[61st Academy Awards]] (March 1989).]]

Throughout the 1980s, Simon successfully contributed to several film and television scores,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.carlysimon.com/catalogue/| title=Soundtracks| access-date=August 21, 2014 | website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref> including the songs:
*"[[Why (Carly Simon song)|Why]]" for the film ''[[Soup for One (film)|Soup For One]]'' (1982)
*"Something More" for the film ''[[Love Child (1982 film)|Love Child]]'' (1982)
*"Someone Waits for You" for the film ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'' (1984)
*"All the Love in the World" for the film ''Torchlight'' (1985)
*"It's Hard To Be Tender" for the television [[miniseries]] ''[[Sins (miniseries)|Sins]]'' (1986)
*"If It Wasn't Love" for the film ''[[Nothing in Common]]'' (1986)
*"Two Looking at One" for the film ''[[The Karate Kid, Part II]]'' (1986)
*"[[Coming Around Again (Carly Simon song)|Coming Around Again]]"/"[[Itsy Bitsy Spider]]" for the film ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' (1986)
*"[[Let the River Run]]" for the film ''[[Working Girl]]'' (1988) (for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (1988); the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] (1988); and the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]] (1990).

Simon is the first artist to win all three major awards ([[Academy Awards|Oscar]], [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]) for a song that is composed and written, as well as performed, entirely by a single artist (the only other such artist being [[Bruce Springsteen]] for "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]", from the 1993 film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''). The [[Working Girl (Original Soundtrack Album)|''Working Girl'' soundtrack]] album was released in August 1989, and featured more music from Simon. That same year, Simon released her first children's book, ''Amy the Dancing Bear''.

As a tribute to [[Christa McAuliffe]], who was slated to be the first teacher in space and who died in the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], Simon wrote and recorded a song entitled "You're Where I Go". McAuliffe was a Simon fan and had taken a cassette of her music on board the shuttle. In 1987, Simon also sang the theme for the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]], "The Turn of the Tide", for a [[Marlo Thomas]] television special ''[[Free to Be... a Family]]''. The song was later included on the 1988 soundtrack album of the same name on [[A&M Records]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Free to Be a Family| url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-to-be-a-family-mw0000197757| publisher=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=August 30, 2014 }}</ref>

==1990s==
In 1990, Simon released two albums: her second [[standard (music)|standards]] album ''[[My Romance (Carly Simon album)|My Romance]]'', and an album of original material ''[[Have You Seen Me Lately]]'', featuring a title track that was supposed to have been the main theme for ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]''; the entire title sequence – including the song – was deleted by producers, although a great deal of Simon's underscore compositions and thematic interludes remain in the film, eventually earning her a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nomination for Best Film Score.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0800089/awards |title=Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=August 17, 2014}}</ref> In addition to the title track, the album also featured a major (No. 4) Adult Contemporary chart hit with "[[Better Not Tell Her]]"—Simon's biggest hit of the 1990s.

Her second children's book, ''The Boy of the Bells'' was also published in 1990. In 1991, Simon wrote her third children's book, ''The Fisherman's Song'', which was based on the song of the same name from her 1990 album ''Have You Seen Me Lately''. The same year, she performed a duet with [[Plácido Domingo]] on the song "The Last Night of the World" (from the ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' musical) on Domingo's album ''The Broadway I Love''.

In 1992, Simon wrote the music for the [[Nora Ephron]] film ''[[This Is My Life (1992 film)|This Is My Life]]'', which included the song "[[Love of My Life (Carly Simon song)|Love of My Life]]", a No. 16 Adult Contemporary hit. In 1993, she contributed the song "[[In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning]]" to the film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' and recorded the same song in combination with "[[I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry|Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry]]" with [[Frank Sinatra]] for his album ''[[Duets (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets]]''. By this point, Sinatra's health was too poor for him to record, so the feat was accomplished by producers lifting an isolated prerecorded vocal track from an earlier performance and laying a new background – and Simon – behind it.

In 1993, Simon was commissioned by the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera Association]] and the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] to record a contemporary opera that would appeal to younger people.

==2000s==
On May 16, 2000, Simon released the album ''[[The Bedroom Tapes]]'', largely written and recorded at home in her bedroom while she was recuperating from her health problems of the previous couple of years. ''The Bedroom Tapes'' was Simon's first album of original songs in almost six years; despite this, it was a commercial disappointment, peaking at No. 90 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''. The album was acclaimed by critics, with [[AllMusic]] writing "She is as a raw as she was on 1975's ''Playing Possum'' and just as sweet as 1987's ''Coming Around Again'', but Simon is fresh. Although in her mid-fifties, she is still a charmer."<ref>{{cite web |author=The Bedroom Tapes |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bedroom-tapes-mw0000061788 |title=Album review |access-date=May 26, 2014 |work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called the album "A feast for fans of intelligent, richly crafted pop music"<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Baltin, Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&q=carly%20simon%20the%20bedroom%20tapes%20billboard%20review |title=Reviews & Previews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= June 3, 2000|access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref> and ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' wrote that the album "unfolds like a one-woman show," calling it a "Boffo performance."<ref>{{cite magazine |author=The Bedroom Tapes |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131475,00.html| title=Picks and Pans review| access-date=May 18, 2015 | magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> The album's opening track, "Our Affair", was remixed by [[Richard Perry]] and featured on the [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack]] of the [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]/[[Ben Affleck]] film ''[[Bounce (film)|Bounce]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web |author=Bounce [Original Soundtrack] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bounce-original-soundtrack-mw0000103753/credits| title=Album credits| access-date=April 20, 2020 | publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

She also contributed back-up vocals on two songs, "Don't Turn Away" and "East of Eden", for Mindy Jostyn's 2001 album ''[[Blue Stories]]''. In November 2001, Simon's Oscar-winning song "Let the River Run" was used in a [[public service ad]] for the [[United States Postal Service]]. Entitled "Pride", it was produced to boost public confidence and postal worker morale in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/tv-commercials/postal-services-pride-3686455/ |title=United States Postal Service: "PRIDE" TV Commercial by Grey New York, Elma Garcia Films |website=Coloribus.com |access-date=July 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210145635/https://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/tv-commercials/postal-services-pride-3686455/ |archive-date=February 10, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Several of her songs were also featured in the 2004 film ''[[Little Black Book]]'' which starred [[Brittany Murphy]] and [[Holly Hunter]], with Simon appearing as herself in a cameo role at the end of the film. In spring of 2004, Simon released her fourth greatest hits album, the single disc ''[[Reflections: Carly Simon's Greatest Hits]]''. The album was a great commercial success, peaking at No. 22 on the Billboard charts (No. 25 in the UK), and remaining on the chart for 19 weeks. On March 2, 2007, the album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

In 2005, she released her fourth album of standards, titled ''[[Moonlight Serenade (Carly Simon album)|Moonlight Serenade]]''. A surprise hit, it reached No. 7 on the Billboard Album charts, her highest-charting album since ''[[Boys in the Trees]]'', and she was nominated for the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]]. To promote ''Moonlight Serenade'', Simon performed two concerts on board the ''[[RMS Queen Mary 2]]'' which were recorded and released on DVD in 2005 as ''[[Moonlight Serenade (Carly Simon album)#Transatlantic concert|A Moonlight Serenade on the Queen Mary 2]]''.

The album was released several months after Jostyn's death on March 10, 2005. One of Simon's closest friends, Jostyn was married to [[Jacob Brackman]], Simon's long-time friend and musical collaborator. In 2005, Simon became involved in the legal defense of musician and family friend [[John Forté]] with his struggle against a federal incarceration.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Simon, Carly |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/05/carly-simon-john-forte-brooklyn-nets |title=Brooklyn Bard |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 2013 |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref>

In March 2008, it was announced that Simon had signed to the [[Starbucks]] label, [[Hear Music]]. She released a new album entitled ''[[This Kind of Love]]'' with them in the spring of 2008. The album was her first collection of original songs since 2000's ''[[The Bedroom Tapes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreps | first= Daniel| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/carly-simon-signs-with-starbucks-hear-music-20080229 |title=Carly Simon Signs with Starbucks' Hear Music |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=November 6, 2013}}</ref> However, in October 2009, it was reported that Simon was suing Starbucks, saying they did not adequately promote the album—even though it made the US Top 20 (No. 15) and sold nearly 150,000 copies. Simon's lawsuit stated that Starbucks publicly announced it was backing out of participation in Hear Music just days before the album came out—a decision that she claimed doomed the record before it was even released.<ref>{{cite web|first=Carly |last= Simon |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267086/carly-simon-sues-starbucks-over-album-deal |title=Carly Simon Sues Starbucks over Album Deal |work =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=September 14, 2009|access-date=March 21, 2010}}</ref>

Simon underwent a [[mastectomy]], [[chemotherapy]] and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer during 1997 and 1998. There had been a lump in her breast for several years, but her doctors had advised against surgery. Simon later recounted: "Then one doctor said, 'You know what, I'd rather see it in a jar than in your breast.'" She also said that she felt "a little angry with myself" that she did not insist on taking it out sooner.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/carly-simon-boho-queen-509978.html | location=London | newspaper =[[The Independent]] | title=Carly Simon: Boho Queen | date=October 9, 2005}}</ref> Simon's surgery came at the same time as the death of her long-time friend [[Linda McCartney]], who had also struggled with breast cancer.

In an interview published on May 1, 2008, with the ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', an [[LGBT]] news service, Simon was asked about the possibility of a performance in the [[True Colors (concert tour)|True Colors Tour]]. She responded, "The part that I could be involved in is the gay and lesbian part. The part that would be hard for me is to commit to a tour, because I'm not very comfortable being onstage. But the part that would be easiest for me would be singing on behalf of all of us. I don't consider myself to be ''not'' gay... I've enlarged all of my possibilities. I have a lot of extremely personal stories to tell about that, but we won't go into that right now.
