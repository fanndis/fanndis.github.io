'''''Six''''' is a British [[Musical theatre|musical]] with book, music, and lyrics by [[Toby Marlow]] and Lucy Moss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/marking-story-six-announces-uk-tour-111409052/|title=Marking her-story: SIX announces UK tour and West End run|website=Official London Theatre|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> The musical is a modern retelling of the lives of the [[List of wives of King Henry VIII|six wives of Henry VIII]] presented as a pop concert, as the wives take turns singing and telling their story to see who suffered the most due to Henry and should, therefore, become the group's lead singer.

The musical was first presented by Cambridge University students at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in 2017. It has since gone on to professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and internationally.

== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:PLOTSUMMARIZE, plot summaries for feature-length works should be from 400 to 700 words. -->
The six Queens introduce themselves performing at a pop concert, telling the audience that the position of lead singer will be the prize for whoever they determine had the worst experience at the hands of their common husband, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. [[Catherine of Aragon]] recounts how Henry wished to annul their marriage and place her in a nunnery when he began lusting after [[Anne Boleyn]]. In turn, Anne tells of her marriage and eventual beheading. [[Jane Seymour]] is mocked for having had an easy time but, while admitting she may have been the only one Henry truly loved, claimed the love was conditional on her having produced a male heir and that she had stood by him despite his many faults.

Themes relating to ideas of female beauty are explored in [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s painting studio, where the Queens parody a [[dating app]] site by presenting a choice of three women for Henry. He chooses [[Anne of Cleves|Anna of Cleves]]{{efn|In the musical, the character Anna of Cleves goes by the German spelling "Anna" instead of the traditionally anglicized "Anne". This distinguishing spelling leaves 'Anne' for Anne Boleyn.|name=|group=}} but soon rejects her and annuls the marriage. She makes a show of complaining about living in a beautiful [[Richmond Palace|palace in Richmond]] with an enormous fortune and no man to tell her what to do. The Queens belittle [[Catherine Howard|Katherine Howard]]{{efn|The character Katherine Howard spells her name with a 'K' in the musical, though the historical figure is usually spelled as Catherine. This distinguishing spelling leaves "Catherine" maintained for the two other wives with that name.|name=|group=}} for being "the least relevant Catherine". She mentions flaws in the other Queens' reasons for winning before recounting her romantic history, at first relishing her attractiveness but revealing a string of abusive relationships.

[[Catherine Parr]] questions the point of the competition which defines them by their connection to Henry rather than as individuals. She tells of her accomplishments independent of Henry. The other Queens abandon the contest and declare that they do not need his love to feel validated as people. They use their remaining moments on stage to rewrite their stories, singing together as a group rather than as solo artists and writing their own “happily ever afters.”

=== Development ===
Toby Marlow was selected in late 2016 by Cambridge University Arts Society to write a new musical to be performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] the next summer. The idea for what became ''Six'' came to Marlow while studying in his final year at Cambridge University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/culture/theatre/six-the-musical-steps-from-fringe-to-the-west-end-1.469323|title=We wrote a musical during our finals...now it's on in the West End|website= The JC|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> The initial six wives' concert concept occurred to him in a poetry class, and he decided to get his friend Lucy Moss involved. Despite uncertainties from his collaborator, the pair wrote part of the show while studying for their final exams. Marlow researched by reading [[Antonia Fraser]]'s "The Six Wives of Henry VIII", while Moss viewed a documentary series, "Six Wives" by [[Lucy Worsley]].  At their first writing session together, they watched a 2011 [[Beyoncé]] concert and story-telling performance,  ''[[Live at Roseland: Elements of 4]]''.<ref name="Paulson"/>  

The writers thought of various popular singers in fashioning their characters. [[Catherine of Aragon]] is modeled off a mixture of Lemonade-era Beyoncé, [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[Jennifer Hudson]].<ref name="vogue">{{cite news |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/six-playwrights-lucy-moss-toby-marlow |title=With SIX, Playwrights Lucy Moss and Toby Marlow Dramatize the Tudor Dynasty - One Power Ballad at a Time |last=Crompton |first=Sarah |date=16 January 2020 |work=Vogue}}</ref> <ref name="vulture">{{cite news |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/six-broadway-musical-henry-viii-queens.html |title=Henry VIII’s Discarded Queens Get Their Revenge in Broadway’s Six |last=McHenry |first=Jackson |date=4 March 2020 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}</ref> <ref name="times">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/theater/six-broadway.htmll |title=The Making of ‘Six’: How Tudor Queens Turned Into Pop Stars |last=Paulson |first=Michael |date=27 February 2020 |work=New York Times}}</ref> Her solo "No Way" incorporates components of real-life Catherine’s Blackfriars speech.<ref name="times" /> [[Anne Boleyn]] features elements of [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Miley Cyrus]], and [[Lily Allen]].<ref name="times" /><ref name="vulture" /> In full-fledged productions, the actor portraying Boleyn typically wears space buns, which signals character roots in Miley Cyrus.<ref name="times" /> Boleyn also sports green to pay homage to "[[Greensleeves]]," referring to the myth that states that Henry VIII composed the song for Anne.<ref name="times" /> Marlow and Moss weave in the "Greensleeves" musical motif throughout the score.<ref name="playbill">{{cite news |url=https://www.playbill.com/article/toby-marlow-and-lucy-moss-designed-their-global-sensation-six-for-viral-success |title=Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss Designed Their Global Sensation SIX for Viral Success |last=Fierberg |first=Ruthie |date=3 March 2020 |work=Playbill}}</ref> Additionally, [[Jane Seymour]] emulates pop balladeers such as [[Adele]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Celine Dion]].<ref name="vulture" /> Seymour's costume design consists of a black and white corset design which eludes to half-timbered houses.<ref name="times" /> [[Anne of Cleves|Anna of Cleves]] radiates [[Nicki Minaj]], Beyoncé's "Feeling Myself," [[Lorde]]'s "Royals," and [[Iggy Azalea]] and [[Charli XCX]]'s "Fancy."<ref name="vulture" /> [[Katherine Howard]]'s story is recontextualized through her depiction which parallels young, sexualized pop stars like [[Britney Spears]] and [[Ariana Grande]].<ref name="vulture" /> Katherine's costume design also features a choker, serving as a representation of her being beheaded.<ref name="times" /> Lastly, [[Catherine Parr]]'s characterization draws inspiration from [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Emeli Sandé]].<ref name="vulture" />

=== Edinburgh Fringe ===
The world premiere production of ''Six'' took place at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2017, presented by Cambridge University Musical Theatre Society. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilcock|first=Tim|url=http://fringereview.co.uk/review/edinburgh-fringe/2017/six/|title=Edinburgh Fringe 2017 – SiX|website=[[Fringe Review]]|date=2017-08-25}}</ref> The cast was composed of student actors, and Moss served as choreographer.<ref name="times" /> <ref name="vogue" /> Although the production didn’t win any big awards, it was well-received and sold out of tickets at the festival.<ref name="times" /> Its popularity led to ''Six'' being invited back to Edinburgh Fringe the next summer, this time in one of the festival’s larger venues.<ref name="times" />

=== Professional debut and UK tour (2018)===
The Edinburgh production and a subsequent showing back in Cambridge attracted the attention of producers Kenny Wax and Global Musicals, and they gave the show its professional debut on 18 December 2017, performing initially on four Monday nights although this was increased to six performances at the [[Arts Theatre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/casting-announced-for-six-henry-viii-arts-theatre_45251.html|title=New musical about Henry VIII's wives finds its West End cast|website=WhatsOnStage|date=2017-11-30|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref><ref name="Paulson">{{Cite news |last=Paulson |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/theater/six-broadway.html |title=The Making of 'Six': How Tudor Queens Turned Into Pop Stars |date=2020-02-27 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2020-03-03 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A studio recording was released on 13 September 2018, featuring the original Arts Theatre cast.

== Reception ==
In a review of the Arts Theatre production, Dominic Cavendish of ''The Telegraph'' called the show "gloriously – persuasively – coherent, confident and inventive".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/six-review-arts-theatre-gloriously-musical-meeting-henry-viiis/|title=Six review, Arts Theatre: gloriously musical meeting with all Henry VIII's wives|last=Cavendish|first=Dominic|date=2018-08-28|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-08-18|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Lyn Gardner of ''The Guardian'' wrote, "It may be cloaked in silliness, but ''Six'' makes some serious points about female victimhood and survival."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/10/six-review-henry-viii-wives-arts-theatre-london|title=Six review – Henry VIII's wives form girl band to take a pop at history|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2018-01-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-18|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In a review of the Chicago production, [[Chris Jones (drama critic)|Chris Jones]] of ''The Chicago Tribune'' praised the show as "dynamic" and a "blast", with a "sense of humor and spirited radicalism." Marlow and Moss are "gifted comic writers," he said, and he praised the "musical force of the intensely committed and talented actresses" in the Chicago cast. Jones suggests the show could use 10 more minutes of material that gets away from the plot's singing contest conceit, and toward the emotional center of the characters. He also thinks the orchestration of the songs could be more substantial.  Jones believes ''Six'' has an audience that is ready for it, in part because it gets to a complex historical paradox and treats it with verve, the memories of women in history being tied to the life of a man.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-ent-six-chicago-shakes-review-ttd-0524-story.html |title=Now at Chicago Shakes, 'Six' gives these Tudor wives a voice and could be a huge hit |last=Jones |first=Chris |date=2019-05-23|work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> 

Hedy Weiss of ''WTTW'' praises the musical as "sensational", singling out each performer in the Chicago cast. Weiss also thinks the show makes a convincing case for each character, and in addition to praising the writers, notes the "dynamite direction by Moss and Jamie Armitage, and powerhouse music direction by Roberta Duchak" as well as, "Gabriella Slade’s glittering costumes . . . and Tim Deiling’s arena-style lighting".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.wttw.com/2019/05/23/six-chicago-shakespeare-theater-review |title=In Knockout Musical 'Six,' King Henry VIII's Wives Have Their #MeToo Moment |last=Weiss |first=Hedy |date=2019-05-23|work=WTTW |access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> According to Rachel Weinberg of ''Broadway World'', "''Six'' carries out [a] joyful and anachronistic takedown of the patriarchy" through the performances of a "brilliant" cast and a book and score with an inventive and sensational compositional method.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/chicago/article/BWW-Review-SIX-at-Chicago-Shakespeare-Theater-20190525 |title=BWW Review: SIX at Chicago Shakespeare Theater |last=Weinberg|first=Rachel|date=2019-05-25|work=BroadwayWorld.com |access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> Jesse Green of ''The New York Times'' wrote that the musical is "pure entertainment", the writing is "wickedly smart", the "terrific singers" of the Chicago cast sell the show "unstintingly", and the production values "befit a splashy North American premiere with Broadway backing."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/theater/six-musical-chicago-next-to-normal.html|title=On Chicago's Stages, Women With Problems |last=Green |first=Jesse|date=2019-06-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-18|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
