BP's origins date back to the founding of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1908, established as a subsidiary of [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]] to exploit oil discoveries in [[Iran]]. In 1935, it became the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] and in 1954, adopted the name '''British Petroleum'''.<ref name="BPhistory-postwar"/><ref name=time020610/> In 1959, the company expanded beyond the Middle East to [[Alaska]] and it was one of the first companies to strike oil in the [[North Sea]]. British Petroleum acquired majority control of [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] in 1978. Formerly majority state-owned, the British government privatised the company in stages between 1979 and 1987. British Petroleum merged with [[Amoco]] in 1998, becoming '''BP Amoco plc''', and acquired [[ARCO]] and [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Castrol]] in 2000, becoming '''BP plc''' in 2001. From 2003 to 2013, BP was a partner in the [[TNK-BP]] joint venture in Russia.

BP has been directly involved in several major environmental and safety incidents. Among them were the 2005 [[Texas City Refinery explosion]], which caused the death of 15&nbsp;workers and which resulted in a record-setting [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] fine; Britain's largest oil spill, the wreck of [[SS Torrey Canyon|''Torrey Canyon'']] in 1967; and the 2006 [[Prudhoe Bay oil spill]], the largest oil spill on [[Alaska North Slope|Alaska's North Slope]], which resulted in a US$25&nbsp;million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill.<ref name="Roach2006"/>

In May 1908, a group of British geologists discovered a large amount of oil at [[Masjed Soleyman]] located in the [[Khuzestan Province]] in southwest of nowadays [[Iran]]. It was the first commercially significant find of oil in the [[Middle East]]. [[William Knox D'Arcy]], by contract with Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari, obtained permission to explore for oil for the first time in the Middle East,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry|last=Vassiliou|first=M. S|publisher=Lanham, MD: Scarecrow|year=2009}}</ref> an event which changed the history of the entire region. The oil discovery led to [[petrochemical industry]] development and also the establishment of industries that strongly depended on oil. On 14 April 1909, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC) was incorporated as a subsidiary of [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]]. Some of the shares were sold to the public.<ref name=Gasson/> The first chairman and minority shareholder of the company became [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]].<ref name=masjid/>

Immediately after establishing the company, the British government asked [[Percy Cox]], British resident to [[Bushehr Province|Bushehr]], to negotiate an agreement with [[Khaz’al Khan Ibn Haji Jabir Khan|Sheikh Khaz’al Ibn Jabir]] of [[Emirate of Arabistan|Arabistan]] for APOC to obtain a site on [[Abadan, Iran|Abadan]] Island for a refinery, depot, storage tanks, and other operations. The refinery was built and began operating in 1912.<ref name=":0" /> In 1913, the British government acquired a controlling interest (50.0025%) in the company then, at the urging of [[Winston Churchill]], the then [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], the British navy quickly switched from coal to oil for the majority of their war ships.<ref name=masjid/><ref name=bbc110898/><ref name=beale/> In 1914, APOC signed a 30-year contract with the [[British Admiralty]] for supplying oil for the [[Royal Navy]] at the fixed price.<ref name="Atabaki"/> In 1915, APOC established its shipping subsidiary the [[British Tanker Company]] and in 1916, it acquired the British Petroleum Company which was a marketing arm of the German ''Europäische Petroleum Union'' in Britain.<ref name=masjid/> In 1919, the company became a [[shale oil|shale-oil]] producer by establishing a subsidiary named Scottish Oils which merged remaining Scottish [[oil shale industry|oil-shale industries]].<ref name="ferrier-shale"/><ref name=marwick/><ref name=uphall/><ref name=museum/>

After [[World War I]], APOC started marketing its products in Continental Europe and acquired stakes in the local marketing companies in several European countries. Refineries were built in [[Llandarcy]] in Wales (the first refinery in the United Kingdom) and [[Grangemouth Refinery|Grangemouth]] in Scotland.  It also acquired the controlling stake in the [[Courchelettes]] refinery in France and formed, in conjunction with the [[Government of Australia]], a partnership named [[Commonwealth Oil Refineries]], which built the Australian's first refinery in [[Laverton, Victoria]].<ref name=masjid/> In 1923, Burmah employed [[Winston Churchill]] as a paid consultant to lobby the British government to allow APOC have exclusive rights to [[Iran|Persian]] oil resources, which were subsequently granted by the Iranian monarchy.<ref name=independent030909/>

APOC and the Armenian businessman [[Calouste Gulbenkian]] were the driving forces behind the creation of [[Turkish Petroleum Company]] (TPC) in 1912, to explore oil in [[Mesopotamia]] (now Iraq); and by 1914, APOC held 50% of TPC shares.<ref name=MetzTPC/> In 1925, TPC received concession in the [[Oil reserves in Iraq|Mesopotamian oil resources]] from the [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraqi government]] under British mandate. TPC finally struck oil in Iraq on 14 October 1927. By 1928, the APOC's shareholding in TPC, which by now was named [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), was reduced to 23.75%; as the result of the changing geopolitics post [[Ottoman empire]] break-up, and the [[Red Line Agreement]].<ref name="GT-DEX-1920-78"/> Relations were generally cordial between the pro-west [[Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Monarchy (1932–58)]] in Iraq and IPC, in spite of disputes centered on Iraq's wish for greater involvement and more royalties. During the 1928–68 time period, IPC monopolised oil exploration inside the [[Red Line Agreement|Red Line]]; excluding Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.<ref name=SH/><ref name=yergin/>

In 1927, Burmah Oil and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] formed the joint marketing company [[Burmah-Shell]]. In 1928, APOC and Shell formed the Consolidated Petroleum Company for sale and marketing in Cyprus, South Africa and Ceylon, which in 1932 followed by a joint marketing company [[Shell-Mex and BP]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name=beale/><ref name=Ferrier1982a>[[#RefFerrier1982|Ferrier (1982)]], p. 463</ref> In 1937, AIOC and Shell formed the Shell/D'Arcy Exploration Partners partnership to explore for oil in [[Nigeria]]. The partnership was equally owned but operated by Shell. It was later replaced by Shell-D'Arcy Petroleum Development Company and Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company (now [[Shell Petroleum Development Company]]).<ref name=James2000>[[#RefJames2000|Bamberg (2000)]], pp. 109–110</ref>

In 1934, APOC and [[Gulf Oil]] founded the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] as an equally owned partnership. The oil concession rights were awarded to the company on 23 December 1934 and the company started drilling operations in 1936.<ref name=brune/><ref name=alsharhan/> In 1935, [[Rezā Shāh]] requested the international community to refer to Persia as '[[Iran]]', which was reflected in the name change of APOC to the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC).<ref name="bio"/>

In 1937, [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], 23.75% owned by BP,<ref name="RLA">{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/red-line|title=Milestones: 1921–1936 – Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov}}</ref> signed an oil concession agreement with the Sultan of Muscat that covers the entire region of the Sultanate, which was in fact limited to the coastal area of present-day Oman. After several years of failure to discover oil in the Sultanate's region, IPC presumed that oil was more likely to be found in the interior region of Oman, which was part of the Imamate of Oman. IPC offered financial support to raise an armed force that would assist the Sultanate in occupying the interior region of Oman. Later, in 1954, the Sultan of Muscat, backed by the British government and the financial aid he received from IPC, started occupying regions within the interior of Oman, which led to the outbreak of [[Jebel Akhdar War]] that lasted for more than 5 years.<ref name="OmansInsurgencies">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wkUhBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT43|title=Oman's Insurgencies: The Sultanate's Struggle for Supremacy|first=J. E.|last=Peterson|date=2013|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-702-5|page=43}}</ref>

In 1947, British Petroleum Chemicals was incorporated as a joint venture of AIOC and [[The Distillers Company]].  In 1956, the company was renamed British Hydrocarbon Chemicals.<ref name=James2000c>[[#RefJames2000|Bamberg (2000)]], pp. 350–352</ref>

Following World War II, nationalistic sentiments were on the rise in the Middle East; most notable being [[Iranian nationalism]], and [[Arab Nationalism]]. In Iran, the AIOC and the pro-western Iranian government led by Prime Minister [[Ali Razmara]] resisted nationalist calls to revise AIOC's concession terms in Iran's favour. In March 1951, Razmara was assassinated and [[Mohammed Mossadeq]], a nationalist, was elected as the new prime minister by the [[Majlis of Iran]] (parliament).<ref name="Ref-B-William1991"/> In April 1951, the Iranian government [[Nationalization|nationalised]] the Iranian oil industry by unanimous vote, and the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC) was formed, displacing the AIOC.<ref name="NYTRoots"/><ref name="BPHistory"/> The AIOC withdrew its management from Iran, and Britain organized an effective worldwide embargo of Iranian oil. The British government, which owned the AIOC, contested the nationalisation at the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]], but its complaint was dismissed.<ref name="Sztucki"/>

Prime Minister Churchill asked President Eisenhower for help in overthrowing Mossadeq. The anti-Mossadeq plan was orchestrated under the code-name '[[Operation Ajax]]' by CIA, and 'Operation Boot' by [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] (MI6). The CIA and the British helped stage a coup in August 1953, the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]], which established pro-Western general [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] as the new PM, and greatly strengthened the political power of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. The AIOC was able to return to Iran.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=CIA Admits It Was Behind Iran's Coup |first=Malcolm|last=Bryne |date=18 August 2013|journal=Foreign Policy | url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/19/cia-admits-it-was-behind-irans-coup/}}</ref>

===1954 to 1979===
[[File:HY jaune et vert2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A BP truck from 1967]]
In 1954, the AIOC became the British Petroleum Company. After the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]], [[Iranian Oil Participants Ltd]] (IOP), a [[holding company]], was founded in October 1954, in London to bring Iranian oil back to the international market.<ref name="Ref-B-Vassiliou2009"/><ref name="Ref-B-Lauterpacht1973"/> British Petroleum was a founding member of this company with 40% stake.<ref name="Ref-B-William1991"/><ref name="Ref-B-Vassiliou2009"/> IOP operated and managed oil facilities in Iran on behalf of NIOC.<ref name="Ref-B-Vassiliou2009"/><ref name="Ref-B-Lauterpacht1973"/> Similar to the [[Saudi Aramco#History|Saudi-Aramco "50/50" agreement of 1950]],<ref name="Ref-B-Christine2008"/> the consortium agreed to share profits on a 50–50 basis with Iran, "but not to open its books to Iranian auditors or to allow Iranians onto its board of directors."<ref name=Stephen2003/>

In 1953, British Petroleum entered the Canadian market through the purchase of a minority stake in Calgary-based Triad Oil Company, and expanded further to Alaska in 1959, resulting discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field|Prudhoe Bay]] in 1969.<ref name=beale/><ref name=investfairbanks/> In 1956, its subsidiary D'Arcy Exploration Co. (Africa) Ltd. has been granted four oil concessions in [[Libya]].<ref name=wsj230256/> In 1962, Scottish Oils ceased [[oil shale|oil-shale]] operations.<ref name=museum/> In 1965, it was the first company to strike oil in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=gulliver/> In 1969, BP entered the United States by acquiring the East Coast refining and marketing assets of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]].<ref name=James2000b>[[#RefJames2000|Bamberg (2000)]], p. 273</ref> The Canadian holding company of British Petroleum was renamed [[BP Canada]] in 1969; and in 1971, it acquired 97.8% stake of [[Supertest Petroleum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/williams_j/supertesthistory.html|title=Supertest History|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref>

By the 1960s, British Petroleum had developed a reputation for taking on the riskiest ventures. It earned the company massive profits; it also earned them the worst safety record in the industry. In 1967, the giant oil tanker ''[[Torrey Canyon]]'' foundered off the English coast. Over {{convert|32|MUSgal|oilbbl m3}} of crude oil was spilled into the Atlantic and onto the beaches of Cornwall and Brittany, causing [[Torrey Canyon oil spill|Britain's worst-ever oil spill]].<ref name="Legacy of the Torrey Canyon"/> The ship was owned by the [[Bahamas]]-based Barracuda Tanker Corporation and was flying the flag of [[Liberia]], a well-known [[flag of convenience]], but was being chartered by British Petroleum.<ref name="Legacy of the Torrey Canyon"/> The ship was bombed by [[RAF]] [[jet bomber]]s in an effort to break up the ship and burn off the leaking oil, but this failed to destroy the oil slick.<ref name=bbc290367/>

In 1967, BP acquired chemical and plastics assets of The Distillers Company which were merged with British Hydrocarbon Chemicals to form BP Chemicals.<ref name=James2000d>[[#RefJames2000|Bamberg (2000)]], pp. 385–389</ref>

The company's oil assets were nationalised in Libya in 1971, in Kuwait in 1975, and in Nigeria in 1979.<ref name=alsharhan/><ref name="BPHistory"/><ref name="GT-DEX-21C-O-01"/> In Iraq, IPC ceased its operations after it was nationalised by the [[Ba'athist Iraq]]i government in June 1972, although legally Iraq Petroleum Company still remains in existence,<ref name=cc/> and one of its associated companies —[[Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company]] (ADPC), formerly Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd – also continues with the original shareholding intact.<ref name="GT-DEX-2012-100"/><ref name="GT-DEX-2012-101"/>

The intensified power struggle between oil companies and host governments in Middle East, along with the oil price shocks that followed the [[1973 oil crisis]] meant British Petroleum lost most of its direct access to crude oil supplies produced in countries that belonged to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]), and prompted it to diversify its operations beyond the heavily Middle East dependent oil production. In 1976, BP and Shell de-merged their marketing operations in the United Kingdom by dividing Shell-Mex and BP. In 1978, the company acquired a controlling interest in [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] (Sohio).<ref name="NYtimes"/>

In Iran, British Petroleum continued to operate until the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] in 1979. The new regime of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] nationalised all of the company's assets in Iran without compensation: as a result, BP lost 40% of its global crude oil supplies.<ref name="nyt200379"/>

In 1970–1980s BP diversified into [[coal]], [[minerals]] and [[nutrition]] businesses which all were divested later.<ref name=beale/>

===1979 to 1997===
[[File:BP old logo.svg|thumb|right|The final version of the BP "shield" logo, introduced in 1989 and used until 2000; the shield logo was originally designed by AR Saunders in 1920.]]

The [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] sold 80&nbsp;million shares of BP at $7.58 in 1979, as part of [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher-era]] privatisation. This sale represented slightly more than 5% of BP's total shares and reduced the government's ownership of the company to 46%.<ref name="Globe1979"/> After the worldwide stock market crash on 19 October 1987, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] initiated the sale of an additional GBP7.5 billion ($12.2 billion) of BP shares at 333 pence, representing the government's remaining 31% stake in the company.<ref name="Lohr1987"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Lohr |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/business/bp-issue-to-proceed-safeguard-put-on-price.html |title=B.P.

In November 1987 the [[Kuwait Investment Authority|Kuwait Investment Office]] purchased a 10.06% interest in BP, becoming the largest institutional shareholder.<ref name="TorontoStar1987"/> The following May, the KIO purchased additional shares, bringing their ownership to 21.6%.<ref name=nyt191187/> This raised concerns within BP that operations in the United States, BP's primary country of operations, would suffer. In October 1988, the British [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] required the KIO to reduce its shares to 9.6% within 12 months.<ref name="OConnor1988"/>

[[Peter Walters]] was the company chairman from 1981 to 1990.<ref name=lat080989/> During his period as chairman he reduced company's refining capacity in Europe.<ref name=lat080989/> In 1982, the [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] assets of BP Canada were sold to [[Petro Canada]]. In 1984, [[Standard Oil of California]] was renamed to [[Chevron Corporation]]; and it bought Gulf Oil—the largest merger in history at that time.<ref name="CVX-H-01"/> To meet anti-trust regulations, Chevron divested many of Gulf's operating subsidiaries, and sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum and [[Cumberland Farms]] in 1985.<ref name="chevron-profile"/> In 1987, British Petroleum negotiated the acquisition of [[Britoil]]<ref name=ap050288/> and the remaining publicly traded shares of Standard Oil of Ohio.<ref name="NYtimes"/> At the same year it was listed on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] where its share were traded until delisting in 2008.<ref name=reuters240608/>

Walters was replaced by [[Robert Horton (businessman)|Robert Horton]] in 1990. Horton carried out a major corporate downsizing exercise, removing various tiers of management at the head office.<ref name=roberts/> In 1992, British Petroleum sold off its 57% stake in BP Canada ([[Upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]] operations), which was renamed as [[Talisman Energy]].<ref name="TLM-H-01"/> [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|John Browne]],<!-- not ennobled until 2001 --> who had joined BP in 1966 and rose through the ranks to join the board as managing director in 1991, was appointed group chief executive in 1995.<ref name=browne/>

In 1981, British Petroleum entered into the solar technology sector by acquiring 50% of Lucas Energy Systems, a company which became Lucas BP Solar Systems, and later [[BP Solar]]. The company was a manufacturer and installer of [[photovoltaic]] [[solar cells]]. It became wholly owned by British Petroleum in the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=BP and Lucas form solar company |journal=Electronics and Power |date=March 1981|doi=10.1049/ep.1981.0091|volume=27|page=204 }}</ref>

British Petroleum entered the Russian market in 1990 and opened its first service station in Moscow in 1996. In 1997, it acquired 10% stake in Russian oil company [[Sidanco]], which later became a part of TNK-BP.<ref name=mt290212/>

In 1992, the company entered into Azerbaijani market. In 1994, it signed the production sharing agreement for the [[Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli]] oil project and in 1995 for the [[Shah Deniz gas field]] development.<ref name=caspia>{{cite web | url=https://www.bp.com/en_az/caspian/aboutus/history.html | title= BP in Azerbaijan.

===1998 to 2009===
Under John Browne, British Petroleum acquired other oil companies, transforming BP into the third largest oil company in the world. British Petroleum merged with [[Amoco]] (formerly Standard Oil of Indiana) in December 1998, becoming BP Amoco plc.<ref name=bbc110899/><ref name="namechg"/> Most Amoco stations in the United States were converted to BP's brand and corporate identity.

=== Integrity and compliance ===
Investigative journalism by [[Panorama (TV programme)|BBC Panorama]] and Africa Eye aired in June 2019 criticizing BP for the way in which it had obtained the development rights of Cayar Offshore Profond and St. Louis Offshore Profond blocks, off the coast of [[Senegal]] in 2017. In 2012, a [[Frank Timiș]] company, Petro-Tim, though previously unknown to the oil industry, was awarded a license to explore the blocks despite having no known record in the industry. Soon after, Aliou Sall, brother of Senegal's president, [[Macky Sall]], was hired at the company, implying a conflict of interest,<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-senegal-politics-energy/senegal-justice-ministry-calls-for-inquiry-into-energy-contracts-idUKKCN1TB29Z|title=Senegal justice ministry calls for inquiry into energy contracts|date=10 June 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref> causing public outrage in Senegal. The 2019 program by BBC Panorama and Africa Eye accuses BP of a failure in [[due diligence]] when it agreed on a deal with Timis Corporation in 2017. The deal by BP is expected to provide substantial royalties to Frank Timiș despite accusations of initially obtaining the exploration rights through corruption. [[Kosmos Energy]] was also implicated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kosmosenergy.com/latest-news/response-to-bbc-panorama/|title=Response to BBC Panorama|date=6 June 2019|website=Kosmos Energy {{!}} Deepwater Exploration and Production|language=en-US|access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref> BP refutes any implications of improper conduct. Regarding the acquisition of Timis Corporation interests in Senegal in April 2017, BP states that it "paid what it considered a fair market value for the interests at this stage of exploration/development". However, BP has not made public what was the basis of the valuation, and states that "the details of the deal are confidential".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/what-we-do/worldwide/bbc-panorama-response-english.pdf|title=BP Response to BBC Panorama Programme|date=6 June 2019|work=BP Press Release|access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref> BP argues that "the amount which would be paid separately by BP to Timis Corporation would be less than one percent of what the Republic of Senegal would receive".

===Climate policy===
Prior to 1997, BP was a member of the [[Global Climate Coalition]], an industry organisation established to promote [[global warming scepticism]], but withdrew in 1997, saying "the time to consider the policy dimensions of [[climate change]] is not when the link between [[greenhouse gas]]es and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously by the society of which we are part. We in BP have reached that point.".<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Change Speech By John Browne, Group Chief Executive, British Petroleum (BP America) Stanford University, 19 May 1997 |url=http://www.jayhanson.us/page106.htm |work=From Capitalism To Democracy}}</ref><ref name="Stanford GSB">{{Cite news|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/community/bmag/sbsm0997/feature_ranks.html |title=Breaking Ranks |publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006112452/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/community/bmag/sbsm0997/feature_ranks.html |archive-date=6 October 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> BP was distinguished as the first multinational outside of the reinsurance industry to publicly support the [[scientific consensus on climate change]], which [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]] president [[Eileen Claussen]] then described as a transformative moment on the issue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cornelissen|first=Joep|title=Corporate Communications: Theory and Practice|year=2004|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0761944362|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWVOhNxeLpEC}}</ref> In March 2002, Lord John Browne, the group chief executive of BP that time, declared in a speech that [[global warming]] was real and that urgent action was needed.<ref name=nyt050610>{{cite news |last=Frey |first=Darcy |title=How green is BP? | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/magazine/how-green-is-bp.html |date=8 December 2002 |access-date=5 June 2010}}</ref> Notwithstanding this, from 1988 to 2015 BP was responsible for 1.53% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=guardian100717/> In 2015, BP was listed by the UK-based non-profit organisation Influence Map as the fiercest opponent of action on climate change in Europe.<ref name=guardian050610>{{cite news |last= Neslen |first= Arthur | title = BP tops the list of firms obstructing climate action in Europe | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/21/bp-tops-the-list-of-firms-obstructing-climate-action-in-europe |date= 21 September 2015 |access-date = 25 October 2020}}</ref> In 2018, BP was the largest contributor to the campaign opposing [[Washington Initiative 1631|carbon fee initiative 1631]] in Washington State.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Times |first1=Seattle |title=Carbon-fee opponents raise record $25.8M to defeat I-1631 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/carbon-fee-opponents-raise-record-25-8m-to-defeat-i-1631/ |accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref> Robert Allendorfer, manager of BP's Cherry Point refinery, wrote the following in a letter to state lawmakers: "[Initiative 1631] would exempt six of the ten largest stationary source emitters in the state, including a coal-fired power plant, an aluminum smelter, and a number of pulp and paper plants."<ref>{{cite news |title=E&E News |url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060095019 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref> According to a 2019 [[The Guardian|Guardian]] ranking, BP was the 6<sup>th</sup> largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.<ref name=guardian>{{Cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Matthew|last2=Watts|first2=Jonathan|date=9 October 2019|title=Revealed: the 20 firms behind a third of all carbon emissions | newspaper = The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions|access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref>

In BP's Energy Outlook 2020, BP stated that the changing energy landscape coupled with the [[Financial_market_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic#Oil_prices|economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic]] means that the global crude demand [[Peak oil|will never again surpass 2019's average]]. All three scenarios in the outlook see the consumption of coal, oil, and natural gas dropping while the role of renewable energy will soar. BP is also attempting to move from being an international oil company into becoming an integrated energy company that will focus on low-carbon technologies while also setting a target to reduce its overall oil and gas production by 40% by 2030.<ref>[https://pubs.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=7601 BP’s Energy Outlook Foresees Big Shift For Oil Demand] ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'', 14 September 2020</ref>

In September 1999, one of BP's US subsidiaries, BP Exploration Alaska (BPXA), pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from its illegally dumping of hazardous wastes on the [[Alaska North Slope]], paying fines and penalties totaling $22&nbsp;million. BP paid the maximum $500,000 in criminal fines, $6.5&nbsp;million in civil penalties, and established a $15&nbsp;million environmental management system at all of BP facilities in the US and Gulf of Mexico that are engaged in oil exploration, drilling or production. The charges stemmed from the 1993 to 1995 dumping of hazardous wastes on [[Endicott Island]], Alaska by BP's contractor Doyon Drilling. The firm illegally discharged [[waste oil]], paint thinner and other toxic and hazardous substances by injecting them down the outer rim, or annuli, of the oil wells. BPXA failed to report the illegal injections when it learned of the conduct, in violation of the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/016bcfb1deb9fecd85256aca005d74df/5d61856989631e20852567f6004bbbff?OpenDocument |title=BP Exploration [Alaska] Pleads Guilty To Hazardous Substance Crime Will Pay $22&nbsp;Million, Establish Nationwide Environmental Management System |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |date=23 September 1999 |accessdate=11 June 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100705140015/http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/016bcfb1deb9fecd85256aca005d74df/5d61856989631e20852567f6004bbbff?OpenDocument| archive-date= 5 July 2010 |url-status = live}}</ref>

In 2013, a total of 474 [[Galveston County]] residents living near the BP Texas City Refinery filed a $1 billion lawsuit against BP, accusing the company of "intentionally misleading the public about the seriousness" of a two-week release of toxic fumes which began on 10 November 2011.

In 2009, another group of 95&nbsp;Colombian farmers filed a suit against BP, saying the company's Ocensa pipeline caused landslides and damage to soil and groundwater, affecting crops, livestock, and contaminating water supplies, making fish ponds unsustainable. Most of the land traversed by the pipeline was owned by peasant farmers who were illiterate and unable to read the environmental impact assessment conducted by BP prior to construction, which acknowledged significant and widespread risks of damage to the land.<ref>{{cite news|author=Diane Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/11/colombia-farmers-sue-bp-pipeline |title=BP faces damages claim over pipeline through Colombian farmland  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=26 April 2013 |location=London |date=11 November 2009}}</ref>

==Violations and accidents==
Citing conditions similar to those that resulted in the 2005 [[Texas City Refinery explosion]], on 25 April 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor's [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) fined BP more than $2.4 million for unsafe operations at the company's [[Oregon, Ohio]] refinery.  An OSHA inspection resulted in 32 per-instance willful citations including locating people in vulnerable buildings among the processing units, failing to correct depressurization deficiencies and deficiencies with gas monitors, and failing to prevent the use of non-approved electrical equipment in locations in which hazardous concentrations of flammable gases or vapors may exist.  BP was further fined for neglecting to develop shutdown procedures and designate responsibilities and to establish a system to promptly address and resolve recommendations made after an incident when a large feed pump failed three years prior to 2006.  Penalties were also issued for five serious violations, including failure to develop operating procedures for a unit that removes sulfur compound; failure to ensure that operating procedures reflect current operating practice in the Isocracker Unit; failure to resolve process hazard analysis recommendations; failure to resolve process safety management compliance audit items in a timely manner; and failure to periodically inspect pressure piping systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=12170|title=2006 – 04/25/2006 – OSHA Fines BP $2.4 Million for Safety and Health Violations|work=osha.gov|accessdate=15 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317051556/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=12170|archive-date=17 March 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name="CNN-4-25-06">{{cite news|title=BP fined $2.4M for refinery safety problems|url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/04/25/news/companies/bp_fine/|accessdate=16 April 2013|publisher=CNN|date=25 April 2006}}</ref>

In 2008, BP and several other major oil refiners agreed to pay $422 million to settle a class-action lawsuit stemming from water contamination tied to the gasoline additive [[MTBE]], a chemical that was once a key gasoline ingredient.  Leaked from storage tanks, MTBE has been found in several water systems across the United States. The plaintiffs maintain that the industry knew about the environmental dangers but that they used it instead of other possible alternatives because it was less expensive.  The companies will also be required to pay 70% of cleanup costs for any wells newly affected at any time over the next 30 years.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Gelsi |url=http://articles.marketwatch.com/2008-05-08/news/30709613_1_scott-summy-mtbe-gasoline-additive |title=Refiners to pay $422 million settlement on MTBE | work = Marketwatch |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=26 April 2013 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502104957/http://articles.marketwatch.com/2008-05-08/news/30709613_1_scott-summy-mtbe-gasoline-additive |archive-date=2 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24541226/ns/us_news-environment/t/most-oil-companies-mtbe-lawsuits-settle/ |title=Oil companies settle MTBE lawsuits – US news – Environment |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>

BP has one of the worst safety records of any major oil company that operates in the United States. Between 2007 and 2010, BP refineries in Ohio and Texas accounted for 97% of "egregious, willful" violations handed out by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

A report in ''[[ProPublica]]'', published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'''' in 2010, found that over a decade of internal investigations of BP's Alaska operations during the 2000s warned senior BP managers that the company repeatedly disregarded safety and environmental rules and risked a serious accident if it did not change its ways. ProPublica found that "Taken together, these documents portray a company that systemically ignored its own safety policies across its North American operations – from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico to California and Texas.

===Texas City Refinery explosion and leaks===

The former [[Amoco]] oil refinery at [[Texas City, Texas]], was beset by environmental issues, including chemical leaks and a 2005 explosion that killed 15 people and injured hundreds. ''[[Bloomberg News]]'' described the incident, which led to a guilty plea by BP to a felony [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] charge, as "one of the deadliest U.S. industrial accidents in 20 years." The refinery was sold to [[Marathon Petroleum]] in October 2012.<ref name="Bloomberg-Texas City refinery sale"/>

====2010 chemical leak====

In August 2010, the Texas Attorney General charged BP with illegally emitting harmful air pollutants from its [[Texas City]] refinery for more than a month.
BP has admitted that malfunctioning equipment led to the release of over {{convert|530000|lbs}} of chemicals into the air of Texas City and surrounding areas from 6 April to 16 May 2010. The leak included {{convert|17000|lbs}} of [[benzene]], {{convert|37000|lbs}} of [[nitrogen oxides]], and {{convert|186000|lbs}} of [[carbon monoxide]].  The State's investigation showed that BP's failure to properly maintain its equipment caused the malfunction.  When the equipment malfunctioned and caught fire, BP workers shut it down and routed escaping gases to flares. Rather than shut down associated units while compressor repairs were made, BP chose to keep operating those other units, which led to unlawful release of contaminants for almost 40 days.  The Attorney General is seeking civil penalties of no less than $50 nor greater than $25,000 per day of each violation of state air quality laws, as well as attorneys' fees and investigative costs.<ref name="ChronNov32011"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/bp-texas-refinery-had-huge-toxic-release-just-before-gulf-blowout |title=BP Texas Refinery Had Huge Toxic Release Just Before Gulf Blowout |publisher=ProPublica |accessdate=17 July 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715151201/https://www.propublica.org/article/bp-texas-refinery-had-huge-toxic-release-just-before-gulf-blowout| archive-date= 15 July 2010 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name="The Attorney General of Texas">{{cite web | url=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/oagnews/release.php?id=3442 | title=Attorney General Abbott Charges BP With Additional Violations at Texas City Refinery | publisher=The state of Texas | date=9 August 2010 | accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>

In the settlement of a civil suit, in July 2011 investigators from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration determined that the 2006 spills were a result of BPXA's failure to properly inspect and maintain the pipeline to prevent corrosion. The government issued a Corrective Action Order to BP XA that addressed the pipeline's risks and ordered pipeline repair or replacement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had investigated the extent of the oil spills and oversaw BPXA's cleanup. When BP XA did not fully comply with the terms of the corrective action, a complaint was filed in March 2009 alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Pipeline Safety Act.  In July 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska entered a consent decree between the United States and BPXA resolving the government's claims.  Under the consent decree, BPXA paid a $25 million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill, and agreed to take measures to significantly improve inspection and maintenance of its pipeline infrastructure on the North Slope to reduce the threat of additional oil spills.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/enrd/5812.htm|title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : U.S. v.

===California storage tanks===

Santa Barbara County District Attorney sued BP West Coast Products LLC, BP Products North America, Inc., and Atlantic Richfield Company over allegations that the companies violated state laws regarding operating and maintaining motor vehicle fuel underground storage tank laws. BP settled a lawsuit for $14 million. The complaint alleged that BP failed to properly inspect and maintain underground tanks used to store gasoline for retail sale at approximately 780 gas stations in California over a period of ten years and violated other hazardous material and hazardous waste laws.  The case settled in November 2016 and was the result of collaboration among the California Attorney General's Office and several district attorney's offices across the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edhat.com/?nid=182278|title=Edhat &#124; Local News From Your Community|website=www.edhat.com}}</ref>

In November 2012, BP and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] reached a $4 billion settlement of all federal criminal charges related to the explosion and spill.  Under the settlement, BP agreed to plead guilty to 11&nbsp;felony counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanors, and a felony count of lying to Congress and agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics.  BP also paid  $525 million to settle civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it misled investors about the flow rate of oil from the well.<ref name="NYTimes2012-11"/><ref>Staff, Environmental Law Institute.

Judge Barbier ruled in the first phase of the case that BP had committed gross negligence and that "its employees took risks that led to the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history."

===Lobbying for Libyan prisoner transfer release===
BP lobbied the British government to conclude a prisoner-transfer agreement which the Libyan government had wanted to secure the release of [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]], the only person convicted for the 1988 [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] over Scotland, which killed 270 people.
