{{Israeli occupations navbox}}
The '''Israeli-occupied territories''' refers to [[status of territories occupied by Israel in 1967|the territories]] [[Military occupation|occupied]] by [[Israel]] during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and sometimes also to areas of [[Southern Lebanon]], where Israeli military was notably present to support local Lebanese militias during the civil war and after it. Originally, the sole governance of the territories were as the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-annexed West Bank]], the [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip]], the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]], and the Syrian [[Golan Heights]]. The first use of the term 'territories occupied' was in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] following the Six-Day War in 1967, which called for "the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East" to be achieved by "the application of both the following principles: ... Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict ... Termination of all claims or states of belligerency" and respect for the right of every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.  In addition to the territories occupied following the Six-Day War, Israel also occupied portions of [[Southern Lebanon]] following the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and maintained a military presence there until withdrawing in 2000.

From 1967 to 1981, the four areas were governed under the [[Israeli Military Governorate]], referred to by the UN as ''occupied Arab territories''.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/carter-says-error-led-us-to-vote-against-israelis/96769c94-19d6-43cc-87f3-32507792afab/?noredirect=on Carter Says Error Led U.S. to Vote Against Israelis] "President Carter said last night that, because of a foulup, the United States incorrectly voted Saturday for a United Nations resolution calling on Israel to dismantle its settlements in occupied Arab territories."</ref> The IMG was dissolved in 1981, after the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]. In the process, Israel handed the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, the Golan Heights was incorporated into the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] by the [[Golan Heights Law]], and West Bank continued to be administrated via the [[Israeli Civil Administration]], the latter two of which the UN continued to refer to as the ''occupied Arab territories''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/89-92/Chapter%208/MIDDLE%20EAST/item%2024_occupied%20arab%20territories_.pdf|title=The situation in the occupied Arab territories}}</ref> Despite dissolving the military government, in line with Egyptian demands, the term ''Occupied Arab territories'' had remained in use, referring to the [[West Bank]] including [[East Jerusalem]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and Western [[Golan Heights]]. From 1999 to early 2013, the term ''[[Palestinian territories, Occupied]]'' became utilized to refer to territories that the interim governing body of the [[State of Palestine]], or [[Palestinian National Authority]], controlled in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

==Overview==
The significance of the designation of these territories as [[Military occupation|occupied territory]] is that certain legal obligations fall on the [[occupying power]] under international law. Under [[international law]] there are certain [[Military occupation#Military occupation and the laws of war|laws of war governing military occupation]], including the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] and the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/634KFC Occupation and international humanitarian law: questions and answers], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], 2004.</ref> One of those obligations is to maintain the ''status quo'' until the signing of a [[peace treaty]], the resolution of specific conditions outlined in a peace treaty, or the formation of a new civilian government.<ref name=GCIV>Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.

Israel disputes whether, and if so to what extent, it is an occupying power in relation to the [[Palestinian territories]] and as to whether [[Israeli settlements]] in these territories are in breach of Israel's obligations as an occupying power and constitute a grave breach of the [[Geneva Conventions]] and whether the settlements constitute [[war crimes]].<ref name="legal.un.org">[http://legal.un.org/icc/STATUTE/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute Of The International Criminal Court Article 8]. legal.un.org.

==Sinai Peninsula==
{{Main| Israeli occupation of Sinai}}
Israel captured the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from [[Egypt]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. It established settlements along the Gulf of Aqaba and in the northeast portion, just below the [[Gaza Strip]]. It had plans to expand the settlement of [[Yamit]] into a city with a population of 200,000,<ref>''The Arab–Israeli Dilemma (Contemporary Issues in the Middle East)'', Syracuse University Press; 3rd edition (August, 1985 {{ISBN|0-8156-2340-2}}</ref> though the actual population of Yamit did not exceed 3,000.<ref>[http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/c.hsJPK0PIJpH/b.689861/k.7BC5/Israels_Withdrawal_from_Sinai_19791982.htm/ Kintera.org—The Giving Communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301091150/http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/c.hsJPK0PIJpH/b.689861/k.7BC5/Israels_Withdrawal_from_Sinai_19791982.htm |date=2006-03-01 }}.

The settlements were demolished, as it was feared that settlers might try to return to their homes after the evacuation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Since 1982, the Sinai Peninsula has not been regarded as occupied territory.

==South Lebanon==
{{Main|Southern Lebanon|Free Lebanon State|South Lebanon security belt administration}}
The Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon took place after [[Israel]] invaded [[Lebanon]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and subsequently retained its forces to support the Christian [[South Lebanon Army]] militia in Southern Lebanon. In 1982, the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) and allied [[Free Lebanon Army]] Christian militias seized large sections of Lebanon, including the capital of [[Beirut]], amid the hostilities of the wider [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Later, Israel withdrew from parts of the occupied area between 1983 and 1985, but remained in partial control of the border region known as the ''South Lebanon Security Belt'', initially in coordination with the self-proclaimed [[Free Lebanon State]], which executed a limited authority over portions of southern [[Lebanon]] until 1984, and later with the [[South Lebanon security belt administration]] and its [[South Lebanon Army]] (transformed from Free Lebanon Army), until the year 2000. Israel's stated purpose for the Security Belt was to create a space separating its northern border towns from terrorists residing in Lebanon.

During the stay in the security belt, the IDF held many positions and supported the SLA. The SLA [[South Lebanon security belt administration|took over daily life]] in the security zone, initially as the official force of the [[Free Lebanon State]] and later as an allied militia. Notably, the South Lebanon Army controlled the prison in Khiam. In addition, [[United Nations]] (UN) forces and the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) were deployed to the security belt (from the end of [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|Operation Litani]] in 1978).

The strip was a few miles wide, and consisted of about 10% of the total territory of Lebanon, which housed about 150,000 people who lived in 67 villages and towns made up of [[Shiites]], [[Maronites]] and [[Druze]] (most of whom lived in the town of [[Hasbaya]]). In the central zone of the Strip was the Maronite town [[Marjayoun]], which was the capital of the security belt. Residents remaining in the security zone had many contacts with Israel, many of whom have worked there and received various services from Israel.

Before the Israeli [[1999 Israeli legislative election|election in May 1999]] the [[prime minister of Israel]], [[Ehud Barak]], promised that within a year all Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon. When negotiation efforts failed between Israel and Syria—the goal of the negotiations was to bring a peace agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well, due to [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]] until 2005—Barak led the withdrawal of the IDF to the Israeli border on 24 May 2000. No soldiers were killed or wounded during the redeployment to the internationally recognized border of [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]].

==Golan Heights==
{{Main|Golan Heights}}
[[File:Golan 92.jpg|right|thumb|Map of the [[Golan Heights]] since 1974]]
Israel captured the [[Golan Heights]] from [[Syria]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. A ceasefire was signed on 11 June 1967 and the Golan Heights came under Israeli military administration.<ref name="ybookcoil2004">During the Autumn of 2003, following the [http://my.ynet.co.il/pic/docs/doc_30.1/default.htm declassification of key Aman documents] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321042602/http://my.ynet.co.il/pic/docs/doc_30.1/default.htm |date=2008-03-21 }}, the newspaper [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] released a series of controversial articles which revealed that key Israeli figures were aware of considerable danger that an attack was likely, including Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan, but had decided not to act. The two journalists leading the investigation, Ronen Bergman and Gil Meltzer, later went on to publish ''Yom Kippur War, Real Time: The Updated Edition'', [http://www.ybook.co.il/catalog1.asp?bID=3622710 Yediot Ahronoth/Hemed Books], 2004. {{ISBN|965-511-597-6}}</ref> Syria rejected [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UNSC Resolution 242]] of 22 November 1967, which called for the return of Israeli-occupied State <!-- UNSC Res 242 was only between "State/s" -->territories in exchange for peaceful relations. Israel had accepted Resolution 242 in a speech to the Security Council on 1 May 1968. In March 1972, Syria "conditionally" accepted Resolution 242,{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} and in May 1974, the [[Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria]] was signed.

In the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, Syria attempted to recapture the Golan Heights militarily, but the attempt was unsuccessful. Israel and Syria signed a ceasefire agreement in 1974 that left almost all the Heights under Israeli control, while returning a narrow demilitarized zone to Syrian control. A United Nations observation force was established in 1974 as a buffer between the sides.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14724842 Golan Heights profile].

On 14 December 1981, Israel passed the [[Golan Heights Law]], extending Israeli administration and law to the territory. Israel has expressly avoided using the term "[[annexation]]" to describe the change of status. However, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] has rejected the ''de facto'' annexation in [[UN Security Council Resolution 497|UNSC Resolution 497]], which declared it as "null and void and without international legal effect",<ref>[http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/SC497.pdf UN Security Council Resolution 497]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-01-15.</ref> and consequently continuing to regard the Golan Heights as an Israeli-occupied territory. The measure has also been criticized by other countries, either as illegal or as not being helpful to the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|Middle East peace process]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Syria wants the return of the Golan Heights, while Israel has maintained a policy of "[[land for peace]]" based on Resolution 242. The first high-level public talks aimed at a resolution of the [[Israel–Syria relations|Syria–Israel conflict]] were held at and after the multilateral [[Madrid Conference of 1991]]. Throughout the 1990s several Israeli governments negotiated with Syria's president [[Hafez Al-Assad]]. While serious progress was made, they were unsuccessful.

In 2004, there were 34 settlements in the Golan Heights, populated by around 18,000&nbsp;people.<ref name="Golan Facts">[http://english.golan.org.il/vaad/efacts.asp Golan Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821032728/http://english.golan.org.il/vaad/efacts.asp |date=2006-08-21 }}.</ref> Today, an estimated 20,000 Israeli settlers and 20,000 Syrians live in the territory.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> All inhabitants are entitled to [[Israeli citizenship]], which would entitle them to an Israeli driver's license and enable them to travel freely in Israel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The non-Jewish residents, who are mostly [[Druze]], have nearly all declined to take Israeli citizenship.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/golan-heights-druze-cross-into-syria-for-annual-pilgrimage-1.168787 "Golan Heights Druze cross into Syria for annual pilgrimage"], ''[[Haaretz]]'' 1 September 2005</ref>

In the Golan Heights there is another area occupied by Israel, namely the [[Shebaa farms]]. Syria and Lebanon have claimed that the farms belong to Lebanon and in 2007 a UN cartographer came to the conclusion that the Shebaa farms do actually belong to Lebanon (contrary to the belief held by Israel). UN then said that Israel should relinquish the control of this area.<ref>Ravid, Barak.

Today, Palestinians make up around half of Jordan's population.

Jordan occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from 1948 to 1967, annexing it in 1950 and granting Jordanian citizenship to the residents in 1954 (the annexation claims and citizenship grants were rescinded in 1988 when Jordan acknowledged the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people). Egypt administered the Gaza Strip from 1948 to 1967 but did not annex it or make Gazans Egyptian citizens.<ref>{{CRS|article = Israel and the Palestinians: Prospects for a Two-State Solution| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R40092.pdf}}</ref>

The West Bank was allotted to the Arab state under [[1947 UN Partition Plan|United Nations Partition Plan of 1947]], but the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|West Bank was occupied by Transjordan]] after the 1948 war. In April 1950, Jordan annexed the West Bank,<ref>Lutfiyya, Abdulla M., Baytin: A Jordanian Village. A Study of Social Institutions and Social Change in a Folk Community, Walter de Gruyter, 1966, p.14</ref> but this was recognized only by the [[United Kingdom]] and Pakistan. (see [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]])

In 1967, the West Bank came under Israeli military administration. Israel retained the mukhtar ([[mayor]]al) system of government inherited from Jordan, and subsequent governments began developing [[infrastructure]] in Arab villages under its control. (see [[#Palestinians and Israeli law|Palestinians and Israeli law]], [[International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict|International legal issues of the conflict]], [[Palestinian economy]]). As a result of "[[Enclave law]]", large portions of Israeli [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] are applied to Israeli settlements and Israeli residents in the occupied territories.<ref name="Ben-NaftaliSfard2018">{{cite book|author1=Orna Ben-Naftali|author2=Michael Sfard|author3=Hedi Viterbo|title=The ABC of the OPT: A Legal Lexicon of the Israeli Control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Is5TDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA52|date=10 May 2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-15652-4|pages=52–}}</ref>

Since the [[Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition]] of 1993, most of the [[Demographics of Palestine|Palestinian population]] and [[List of cities in Palestinian Authority areas|cities]] came under the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian Authority]], and only partial Israeli military control, although Israel has frequently redeployed its [[Israel Defense Forces|troops]] and reinstated full military administration in various parts of the two territories.
On July 31, 1988, Jordan renounced its claims to the West Bank for the PLO.<ref name="nytimes"/>

In 2000, the Israeli government started to construct the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], within the [[West Bank]]s, separating Israel and several of its settlements, as well as a significant number of Palestinians, from the remainder of the West Bank. State of Israel cabinet approved a route to construct separation barrier whose total length will be approximately {{convert|760|km|0|abbr=on}} built mainly in the West Bank and partly along the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 Armistice line]], or "Green Line" between Israel and Palestinian West Bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/separation_barrier/statistics |title=The Separation Barrier - Statistics &#124; B'Tselem |publisher=Btselem.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> 12% of the West Bank area is on the Israel side of the barrier.<ref>"Israel High Court Ruling Docket H.C.J. 7957/04: International Legality of the Security Fence and Sections near Alfei Menashe"</ref>

==== East Jerusalem ====
{{Main|East Jerusalem}}
[[Jerusalem]] has created additional issues in relation to the question of whether or not it is occupied territory. The [[1947 UN Partition Plan]] had contemplated that all of Jerusalem would be an international city within an international area that included [[Bethlehem]] for at least ten years, after which the residents would be allowed to conduct a [[referendum]] and the issue could be re-examined by the Trusteeship Council.

However, after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], [[Jordan]] captured [[East Jerusalem]] and the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]], and Israel captured and annexed the western part of Jerusalem {{Citation needed|reason=Date of referendum? Source citing the document for this annexation?|date=November 2011}}.

On June 27, Israel extended its laws, jurisdiction, and administration to East Jerusalem and several nearby towns and villages, and incorporated the area into the Jerusalem Municipality. In 1980, the [[Knesset]] passed the [[Jerusalem Law]], which was declared a [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law]], which declared Jerusalem to be the "complete and united" capital of Israel. However, [[United Nations Security Council]] [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|Resolution 478]] declared this action to be "null and void", and that it "must be rescinded forthwith". The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem and considers it occupied territory.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Korman|first=Sharon|title=The right to conquest: the acquisition of territory by force in international law and practice|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueDO1dJyjrUC&pg=PA250 |pages=250–260|isbn=978-0-19-828007-1}}</ref>

UN Security Council Resolution 478 also called upon countries which held their diplomatic delegations to Israel in Jerusalem, to move them outside the city. Most nations with embassies in Jerusalem complied, and relocated their embassies to [[Tel Aviv]] or other Israeli cities prior to the adoption of Resolution 478. Following the withdrawals of [[Costa Rica]] and [[El Salvador]] in August 2006, no country maintains its embassy in Jerusalem, although [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] once had theirs in nearby [[Mevaseret Zion]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Costa Rica's Exit Leaves El Salvador with Lone Embassy in Jerusalem |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/110349 |work=[[Arutz Sheva]] |date=18 August 2006 |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |editor-last=HaLevi |editor-first=Ezra |title=Last Embassy Abandons Jerusalem |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/110798 |work=[[Arutz Sheva]] |date=27 August 2006 |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref> The United States [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995, stating that "Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel; and the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999." As a result of the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act|Embassy Act]], official U.S. documents and web sites refer to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Until May 2018, the law had never been implemented, because successive U.S. Presidents [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], [[George W.

===Gaza Strip===
{{Main|Gaza Strip}}
The Gaza Strip was allotted to the Arab state envisioned by the [[1947 UN Partition Plan|United Nations Partition Plan of 1947]], but no Arab state formed as a result of the 1947 partition plan. As a result of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], the [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Gaza Strip became occupied by Egypt]].

Between 1948 and 1967, the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian military administration, being officially under the jurisdiction of the [[All-Palestine Government]] until in 1959 it was merged into the [[United Arab Republic]], de facto becoming under direct Egyptian military governorship.

Between 1967 and 1993, the Gaza Strip was under Israeli military administration. In March 1979, Egypt renounced all claims to the Gaza Strip in the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]].

Since the [[Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition]] of 1993, the Gaza Strip came under the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian Authority]].

A July 2004 opinion of the [[International Court of Justice]] treated Gaza as part of the occupied territories.<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1677.pdf Summary of the Advisory Opinion: Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825085245/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1677.pdf |date=2014-08-25 }}, [[International Court of Justice]], July 9, 2004.</ref>

In February 2005, the Israeli government voted to implement a [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]] from the Gaza Strip.  The plan began to be implemented on 15 August 2005, and was completed on 12 September 2005. Under the plan, all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip (and four in the West Bank) and the joint Israeli-Palestinian Erez Industrial Zone were dismantled with the removal of all 9,000 Israeli settlers (most of them in the [[Gush Katif]] settlement area in the Strip's southwest) and military bases. Some settlers resisted the order, and were forcibly removed by the IDF.  On 12 September 2005 the Israeli cabinet formally declared an end to Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip.  To avoid allegations that it was still in occupation of any part of the Gaza Strip, Israel also withdrew from the [[Philadelphi Route]], which is a narrow strip adjacent to the Strip's border with Egypt, after Egypt's agreement to secure its side of the border.  Under the Oslo Accords the Philadelphi Route was to remain under Israeli control to prevent the smuggling of materials (such as ammunition) and people across the border with Egypt.  With Egypt agreeing to patrol its side of the border, it was hoped that the objective would be achieved.  However, Israel maintained its control over the crossings in and out of Gaza.  The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza was monitored by the Israeli army through special surveillance cameras.  Official documents such as passports, I.D. cards, export and import papers, and many others had to be approved by the Israeli army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

<blockquote>it is of no relevance whether a State has a monist or a dualist approach to the incorporation of international law into domestic law. A position dependent upon such considerations contradicts Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 which states that: "''a state is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purposes of a treaty when it has undertaken an act expressing its consent thereto.''" The Treaty, which is substantially a codification of customary international law, also provides that a State "''may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty''" (Art. 27).</blockquote>

====Israeli judicial decisions====

In two cases decided shortly after independence, in the Shimshon and Stampfer cases, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] held that the fundamental rules of international law accepted as binding by all "civilized" nations were incorporated in the domestic legal system of Israel. The Nuremberg Military Tribunal determined that the articles annexed to the [[Hague IV Convention]] of 1907 were customary law that had been recognized by all civilized nations.<ref>"Place of customary international law", pp. 5–6 of [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1290714 International Law in Domestic Courts: Israel, by Dr. David Kretzmer] and Chapter 2 "Application of International Law", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Thjg-0dut0C&printsec=frontcover The Occupation of Justice], by David Kretzmer</ref> In the past, the Supreme Court has argued that the Geneva Convention insofar it is not supported by domestic legislation  "does not bind this Court, its enforcement being a matter for the states which are parties to the Convention". They ruled that "Conventional international law does not become part of Israeli law through automatic incorporation, but only if it is adopted or combined with Israeli law by enactment of primary or subsidiary legislation from which it derives its force". However, in the same decision the Court ruled that the Fourth Hague Convention rules governing belligerent occupation did apply, since those were recognized as customary international law.<ref name=r1>[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/81/690/000/z01/81000690.z01.pdf International Law – Administered Territories – Rights and Duties of Occupying Power – Registration and Taxation – Articles 43 and 49 of the Hague Regulations, 1907] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113021733/http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/81/690/000/z01/81000690.z01.pdf |date=2016-01-13 }}.

The [[Israeli High Court of Justice]] determined in the 1979 [[Elon Moreh]] case that the area in question was under occupation and that accordingly only the military commander of the area may requisition land according to [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp#art52 Article 52 of the Regulations annexed to the Hague IV Convention]. Military necessity had been an after-thought in planning portions of the Elon Moreh settlement. That situation did not fulfill the precise strictures laid down in the articles of the Hague Convention, so the Court ruled the requisition order had been invalid and illegal.<ref>[[Yoram Dinstein]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=-QL8LsEpbuoC&pg=PA347 Israel Yearbook on Human Rights].

The court has confirmed this interpretation many times, for example in its 2004 and 2005 rulings on the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|separation fence]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasite/images/iht_daily/D010704/hcfen0604.rtf 2004 Israeli Supreme Court ruling]  (RTF format)</ref><ref>[http://www.zionism-israel.com/hdoc/High_Court_Fence.htm 2005 Israeli Supreme Court ruling].

In its June 2005 ruling upholding the constitutionality of the [[Gaza disengagement]], the Court determined that "Judea and Samaria" [West Bank] and the Gaza area are lands seized during warfare, and are not part of Israel:<blockquote>The Judea and Samaria areas are held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation. The long arm of the state in the area is the military commander. He is not the sovereign in the territory held in belligerent occupation (see The Beit Sourik Case, at p. 832). His power is granted him by public international law regarding belligerent occupation. The legal meaning of this view is twofold: first, Israeli law does not apply in these areas. They have not been "annexed" to Israel. Second, the legal regime which applies in these areas is determined by public international law regarding belligerent occupation (see HCJ 1661/05 The Gaza Coast Regional Council v. The Knesset et al. (yet unpublished, paragraph 3 of the opinion of the Court; hereinafter – The Gaza Coast Regional Council Case). In the center of this public international law stand the Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, The Hague, 18 October 1907 (hereinafter – The Hague Regulations). These regulations are a reflection of customary international law. The law of belligerent occupation is also laid out in IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949 (hereinafter – the Fourth Geneva Convention).<ref>see [http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/04/570/079/a14/04079570.a14.pdf HCJ 7957/04 Mara’abe v.

====Israeli legal and political views====
Soon after the 1967 war, Israel issued a military order stating that the [[Geneva Conventions]] applied to the recently occupied territories,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/cgi-bin/browse.py?sectionname=laws&action=view&item=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622212939/http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/cgi-bin/browse.py?sectionname=laws&action=view&item=1 |archive-date=June 22, 2006 |title=Israeli Military Orders List |url-status=dead |accessdate=June 1, 2016 }}. p. 1. israellawresourcecenter.org</ref> but this order was rescinded a few months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/cgi-bin/browse.py?sectionname=laws&action=view&item=101 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622213011/http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/cgi-bin/browse.py?sectionname=laws&action=view&item=101 |archive-date=June 22, 2006 |title=Israeli Military Orders List |url-status=dead |accessdate=June 1, 2016 }}. p. 3. israellawresourcecenter.org</ref> For a number of years, Israel argued on various grounds that the Geneva Conventions do not apply.  One is the Missing Reversioner theory<ref>Yehuda Z.

In the cases before the Israeli High Court of Justice the government has agreed that the military commander's authority is anchored in the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and that the humanitarian rules of the Fourth Geneva Convention apply.<ref>{{cite web|last=Israel: Supreme Court|title=Beit Sourik Village Council v.

Mfa.gov.il. Retrieved on 2012-01-15.</ref>

Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court [[Meir Shamgar]], taking a different approach, wrote in the 1970s that there is no ''[[de jure]]'' applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention regarding occupied territories to the case of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] since the Convention "is based on the assumption that there had been a sovereign who was ousted and that he had been a legitimate sovereign."<ref name="Gold on Disputed Territories">{{cite web |last=Gold |first=Dore |title=From "Occupied Territories" to "Disputed Territories |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (Israeli Security, Regional Diplomacy, and International Law)|date=16 January 2002 |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp470.htm |accessdate=30 June 2017 }}</ref> Israeli diplomat, [[Dore Gold]], has stated that the language of "occupation" has allowed Palestinian spokesmen to obfuscate this history. By repeatedly pointing to "occupation," they manage to reverse the causality of the conflict, especially in front of Western audiences. Thus, the current territorial dispute is allegedly the result of an Israeli decision "to occupy," rather than a result of a war imposed on Israel by a coalition of Arab states in 1967.<ref name="Gold on Disputed Territories"/>

[[Gershom Gorenberg]], disputing these views, has written that the Israeli government knew at the outset that it was violating the Geneva Convention by creating civilian settlements in the territories under IDF administration. He explained that as the legal counsel of the Foreign Ministry, Theodor Meron was the Israeli government's expert on international law. On September 16, 1967 Meron wrote a top secret memo to Mr. Adi Yafeh, Political Secretary of the Prime Minister regarding "Settlement in the Administered Territories" which said "My conclusion is that civilian settlement in the Administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention."<ref>Gorenberg, Gershom, ''The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967–1977'', Macmillan, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8050-7564-X}} p. 99</ref> Moshe Dayan authored a secret memo in 1968 proposing massive settlement in the territories which said "Settling Israelis in administered territory, as is known, contravenes international conventions, but there is nothing essentially new about that."<ref>See Israeli State Archives 153.8/7920/7A, Document 60, dated October 15, 1968, cited on page 173 of Gorenberg's ''The Accidental Empire''</ref>

Various [[Government of Israel|Israeli Cabinets]] have made political statements and many of Israel's citizens and supporters [[Military occupation#Disputed to be a military occupation by nation of dominant military forces in area|dispute]] that the territories are occupied and claim that use of the term "occupied" in relation to [[Israel]]'s control of the areas has no basis in [[international law]] or [[Land of Israel#The Land of Israel and the State of Israel|history]], and that it prejudges the outcome of any future or ongoing [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|negotiations]]. They argue it is more accurate to refer to the territories as "[[International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict#"Occupied" vs. "Disputed" territories|disputed]]" rather than "[[Military occupation|occupied]]" although they agree to apply the humanitarian provisions of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] pending resolution of the dispute. [[Yoram Dinstein]], has dismissed the position that they are not occupied as being "based on dubious legal grounds".<ref>see Yoram Dinstein, ‘The International Law of Belligerent Occupation and Human Rights’, 8 Israeli Yearbook on Human Rights 104, 107 (1978) and [http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/view.php?articleID=5387 International law expert, Professor Yoram Dinstein, on the international ‘War on Terrorism’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402070502/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/view.php?articleID=5387 |date=2010-04-02 }}</ref> Many Israeli government websites do refer to the areas as being "occupied territories".<ref>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=690 Public activities section of Ezer Weizman's Knesset profile].

====Israeli Jewish religious views====
{{Main|Land of Israel|Greater Israel}}
[[File:Map Land of Israel.jpg|thumb|200px|Map showing an interpretation of the borders of the Land of Israel, based on scriptural verses found in {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1-15|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13-20|HE}}, includes almost all of the occupied territories.]]

According to the views of most adherents of [[Religious Zionism]] and to certain streams of [[Orthodox Judaism]], there are no, and cannot be, "occupied territories" because all of the [[Land of Israel]] ({{lang-he-n|אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל}} ''ʼÉreṣ Yiśrāʼēl'', ''Eretz Yisrael'') belongs to the [[Jews]], also known as the [[Children of Israel]], since the times of Biblical antiquity based on various [[Hebrew Bible]] passages.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Jewish religious belief that the area is a God-given inheritance of the Jewish people is based on the [[Torah]], especially the books of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], as well as the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. According to the Book of Genesis, the land was promised by [[God in Judaism|God]] to the descendants of [[Abraham]] through his son [[Isaac]] and to the [[Israelites]], descendants of [[Jacob]], Abraham's grandson. A literal reading of the text suggests that the land promise is (or was at one time) one of the [[Biblical covenants]] between God and the Israelites, as the following verses show.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The definition of the limits of this territory varies between biblical passages, some of the main ones being:
* {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18–21|HE}}
* {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:28–33|HE}}
* {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1–15|HE}}
* {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|11:24|HE}}
* {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|1:7|HE}}
* {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13–20|HE}}

The boundaries of the Land of Israel are different from the borders of historical [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israelite kingdoms]]. The [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba state]], the [[Herodian Kingdom]], the [[Hasmonean Kingdom]], and possibly the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel and Judah]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/israeljudaea/f/UnitedMonarchy.htm|title=Ancient History: The United Monarchy|author=N.S. Gill|publisher=About.com Education}}</ref> ruled lands with similar but not identical boundaries. The current [[State of Israel]] also has similar but not identical boundaries.

A small sect of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews, the [[Neturei Karta]] opposes [[Zionism]] and calls for a peaceful dismantling of the [[State of Israel]], in the belief that Jews are forbidden to have their own state until the coming of the [[Messiah]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/nk.html|title=Neturei Karta|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nkusa.org/AboutUs/Zionism/judaism_isnot_zionism.cfm|title=Judaism is not Zionism|publisher=Neturei Karta International|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415203350/http://www.nkusa.org/AboutUs/Zionism/judaism_isnot_zionism.cfm|archive-date=2007-04-15}}</ref>

[[Israel]] raised a number of exceptions and objections,<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1579.pdf 'Letter dated 29 January 2004 from the Deputy Director General and Legal Advisor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the Written Statement of the Government of Israel'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305232558/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1579.pdf |date=5 March 2011 }}.

The Court ruled that territories had been occupied by the Israeli armed forces in 1967, during the conflict between Israel and Jordan, and that subsequent events in those territories, had done nothing to alter the situation.

The establishment of [[Israeli settlements]] is held to constitute a transfer of Israel's civilian population into the occupied territories and as such is illegal under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Israeli Settlements in Occupied Arab Lands: Conquest to Colony|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=11|issue=2|publisher=University of California Press|jstor=2536268|quote=annexations, expulsions and the creation of settlements are specifically prohibited by international law. The Fourth Geneva Convention, in Article 47, proscribes the annexation of occupied territory, and the United Nations has repeatedly condemned Israel's precipitous annexation of East Jerusalem and a wide belt of surrounding suburbs, villages and towns. Article 49 of the same convention prohibits the forcible transfer or deportation of residents from an occupied area, regardless of motive. And yet thousands of Palestinians have been expelled (see Lesch, 1979: 113–130, for a partial list of the "officially deported" ones) while many more have been, through measures to be described below, "pressured" to leave. The same Article expressly forbids the transfer by an occupying power of any of its civilian population into occupied areas. And yet, at most recent count, over 90,000 Israeli Jews have been officially "settled" within the illegally annexed Jerusalem district, and more than 30,000 others have been "settled" in some 100 nahals (military forts), villages and even towns that the Israeli government has authorized, planned, financed and built in unannexed zones beyond the 1949 cease-fire line that Israelis refer to not as a border, but euphemistically as a "green line."|pages=16–54 [17] |year=1982|doi=10.1525/jps.1982.11.2.00p0373x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=International Law and the al-Aqsa Intifada |last=Falk |first=Richard|author-link=Richard Falk|journal=Middle East Report|issue=217|publisher=Middle East Research and Information Project |jstor=1520166|quote=Article 49 has been interpreted as prohibiting both forced deportations of Palestinians and population transfers of the sort associated with the establishment and continuous expansion of Israeli settlements|pages=16–18 [17]|year=2000|doi=10.2307/1520166 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Prolonged Military Occupation: The Israeli-Occupied Territories Since 1967|last=Roberts|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Roberts (scholar)|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=84|issue=1|publisher=American Society of International Law |jstor=2203016|quote=The settlements program is quite simply contrary to international law.

In 2000, the editors of the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Palestine Yearbook of International Law (1998–1999) said "the "transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory" amounts to a war crime.

The Court also concluded that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established "in breach of international law" and that all the States parties to the Geneva Convention are under an obligation to ensure compliance by Israel with international law as embodied in the Convention.<ref name="icj"/>

In May 2012 the 27 ministers of foreign affairs of the European Union published a report strongly denouncing policies of the State of Israel in the West Bank and finding that settlements in the West Bank are illegal: "settlements remain illegal under international law, irrespective of recent decisions by the government of Israel.

===2012 UN report on settlements===
The [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] decided in March 2012 to establish a panel charged with investigating "the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem."<ref name="Haaretz 2012">''Haaretz'', 3 May 2012, "U.S. Pressing UN Human Rights Commissioner to Put Off West Bank Settlements Probe," http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-pressing-un-human-rights-commissioner-to-put-off-west-bank-settlements-probe-1.427744</ref> In reaction the government of Israel ceased cooperating with the [[UN High Commissioner on Human Rights]] and boycotted the UN Human Rights Commission. The U.S. government acceded to the Israeli government demand to attempt to thwart the formation of such a panel.<ref name="Haaretz 2012"/>

On January 31, 2012 the United Nations independent "International Fact-Finding Mission on Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" filed a report stating that Israeli settlement led to a multitude of violations of Palestinian human rights and that if Israel did not stop all settlement activity immediately and begin withdrawing all settlers from the West Bank, it potentially might face a case at the [[International Criminal Court]]. It said that Israel was in violation of article 49 of the fourth [[Geneva convention]] forbidding transferring civilians of the occupying nation into occupied territory. It held that the settlements are "leading to a creeping annexation that prevents the establishment of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state and undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination." After Palestine's admission to the United Nations as a non-member state in September 2012, it potentially may have its complaint heard by the International Court. Israel's foreign ministry replied to the report saying that "Counterproductive measures – such as the report before us – will only hamper efforts to find a sustainable solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The human rights council has sadly distinguished itself by its systematically one-sided and biased approach towards Israel."<ref>Harriet Sherwood, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/31/israel-must-withdraw-settlers-icc Israel must withdraw all settlers or face ICC, says UN report], ''[[The Guardian]]'', January 31, 2013.</ref><ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44045&Cr=palestin&Cr1=#.UQtfEWc1CSo Independent UN inquiry urges halt to Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory], United Nations News Center, January 31, 2012.</ref><ref>Human Rights Council Twenty-second session, Agenda item 7, Human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories, [http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/FFM/FFMSettlements.pdf Report of the independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem] (Advanced Unedited Version), accessed February 1, 2013.</ref>

===2013 EU directive for 2014 to 2020===
Following a decision by [[European Union]] (EU) foreign ministers in December 2012 stating that "all agreements between the state of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967," the [[European Commission]] issued guidelines for the 2014 to 2020 financial framework covering all areas of co-operation between the EU and Israel, including economics, science, culture, sports and academia but excluding trade on 30 June 2013. According to the directive all future agreements between the EU and Israel must explicitly exclude Jewish settlements and Israeli institutions and bodies situated across the pre-1967 Green Line – including the Golan Heights, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.<ref name="Guardianexclusion-clause">{{cite web|title=EU takes tougher stance on Israeli settlements|author=Harriet Sherwood |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=16 July 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/16/eu-israel-settlement-exclusion-clause}}</ref> EU grants, funding, prizes or scholarships will only be granted if a settlement exclusion clause is included, forcing the Israeli government to concede in writing that settlements in the occupied territories are outside the state of Israel to secure agreements with the EU.<ref name="Haaretz1.535952">{{cite web|title=EU: Future agreements with Israel won't apply to territories|author=Barak Ravid |work=Haaretz |location=Tel Aviv |date=16 July 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.535952#}}</ref>

In a statement, the EU said that
 
<blockquote>the guidelines are...in conformity with the EU's longstanding position that Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and with the non-recognition by the EU of Israel's sovereignty over the occupied territories, irrespective of their legal status under domestic Israeli law. At the moment Israeli entities enjoy financial support and cooperation with the EU and these guidelines are designed to ensure that this remains the case. At the same time concern has been expressed in Europe that Israeli entities in the occupied territories could benefit from EU support. The purpose of these guidelines is to make a distinction between the State of Israel and the occupied territories when it comes to EU support.<ref name="EU">{{cite web|title=Statement by the Delegation of the European Union to the State of Israel on the European Commission Notice |publisher=Delegation of the European Union to Israel|date=16 July 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013 |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/israel/press_corner/all_news/news/2013/20131607_02_en.htm}}</ref></blockquote>

The guidelines do not apply to any Palestinian body in the West Bank or East Jerusalem, and they do not affect agreements between the EU and the PLO or the Palestinian Authority, nor do they apply to Israeli government ministries or national agencies, to private individuals, to human rights organizations operating in the occupied territories, or to [[NGO]]s working toward promoting peace which operate in the occupied territories.<ref name="Haaretz1.536155">{{cite web|title=EU's new policy on Israeli settlements: The full guidelines|author=Barak Ravid |work=Haaretz |location=Tel Aviv |date=16 July 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.536155}}</ref><ref name="Guidelines">{{cite journal|title=Guidelines on the eligibility of Israeli entities and their activities in the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967 for grants, prizes and financial instruments funded by the EU from 2014 onwards|journal=Official Journal of the European Union |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2013:205:FULL:EN:PDF#page=11 |date=19 July 2013 |volume=56 |accessdate=12 August 2013|pages=9–11}}</ref>

The move was described as an "earthquake" by an Israeli official who wished to remain anonymous,<ref name="Haaretz1.535952"/> and prompted harsh criticism by prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who said in a broadcast statement: "As prime minister of Israel, I will not allow the hundreds of thousands of Israelis who live in the West Bank, Golan Heights and our united capital Jerusalem to be harmed. We will not accept any external diktats about our borders. This matter will only be settled in direct negotiations between the parties." Israel is also concerned that the same policy could extend to settlement produce and goods exported to European markets, as some EU member states are pressing for an EU-wide policy of labelling produce and goods originating in Jewish settlements to allow consumers to make informed choices.<ref name="Guardianexclusion-clause" /> A special ministerial panel led by prime minister Netanyahu, decided to approach the EU and demand several key amendments in the guidelines before entering any new projects with the Europeans. A spokesperson for the EU confirmed that further talks would take place between Israel and the EU, stating: "We stand ready to organise discussions during which such clarifications can be provided and look forward to continued successful EU-Israel cooperation, including in the area of scientific cooperation."<ref name="Telegraphexclusion-clause">{{cite news|title=Israel seeks compromise on EU settlement sanctions|author=Robert Tait |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=9 August 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10233578/Israel-seeks-compromise-on-EU-settlement-sanctions.html}}</ref>

Palestinians and their supporters hailed the EU directive as a significant political and economic sanction against settlements. [[Hanan Ashrawi]] welcomed the guidelines, saying: "The EU has moved from the level of statements, declarations and denunciations to effective policy decisions and concrete steps, which constitute a qualitative shift that will have a positive impact on the chances of peace."<ref name="Guardianexclusion-clause" />
