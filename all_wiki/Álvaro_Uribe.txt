'''Álvaro Uribe Vélez''' (born 4 July 1952) is a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] politician who served as the 31st [[President of Colombia]] from 7 August 2002 to 7 August 2010.

Uribe started his political career in his home department of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]]. He held offices in the [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín|Public Enterprises of Medellín]] and in the [[Ministry of Labour (Colombia)|Ministry of Labor]] and was the director of the [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics]] (1980–1982). He became Mayor of Medellín in October 1982. He was Senator between 1986 and 1994 and finally Governor of Antioquia between 1995 and 1997 before he was elected President of Colombia in 2002. Following his 2002 election, Uribe led an all out military offensive against [[List of left-wing militant groups|leftist guerrilla groups]] such as the [[FARC]] and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] with funding and backing from the Clinton and Bush Administrations in the form of a 2.8 billion dollars direct foreign aid package called "[[Plan Colombia]]", as well as leading a controversial effort in the demobilizing of the rightwing paramilitary group known as the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], all of which are part the [[Colombian Armed Conflict]]. On 13 January 2009 the United States awarded Uribe the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for his role in fighting along the US lead [[War on Terror]] in the Colombian Armed Conflict. However, his role in the conflict was accompanied by large-scale alleged exactions: thousands of civilians were killed by the Colombian army (see [["False positives" scandal]]) with almost total impunity, being investigated by the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-nota-13649|title=ONU denuncia patrón de ejecuciones extrajudiciales e impunidad en Colombia}}</ref> and millions of people have been victims of forced displacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.co/colombia/colombia-es-el-segundo-pais-con-mayor-cantidad-de-desplazados-en-el-mundo-193052|title=Colombia es el segundo país con mayor cantidad de desplazados en el mundo|date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

In August 2020 the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia]] ordered his arrest as part of an investigation into [[bribery]] and [[witness tampering]] as well as [[crimes against humanity]] for his alleged involvement with [[right wing]] [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitary units]] in the [[massacre]]s at [[El Aro Massacre|El Aro]] and La Granja, which took place while he was Governor of Antioquia.<ref name="theguardian-arrest" /><ref name="thebogotapost-arrest">{{cite news|date=4 August 2020|title=House arrest for ex-president Álvaro Uribe Vélez|url=https://thebogotapost.com/house-arrest-for-ex-president-alvaro-uribe-velez/47271/}}</ref><ref name="eltiempo-arrest">{{Cite web|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|date=2020-08-23|title=Esta es la indagación de Corte a Álvaro Uribe por la masacre de El Aro|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/unidad-investigativa/alvaro-uribe-expediente-por-la-masacre-de-el-aro-por-el-que-corte-suprema-lo-citan-a-version-libre-532318|access-date=2020-08-25|website=El Tiempo|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Espectador|first=El|title=ELESPECTADOR.COM|url=https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/siete-puntos-claves-de-la-denuncia-de-montealegre-contra-uribe-por-delitos-de-lesa-humanidad/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=ELESPECTADOR.COM|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=colombiareports|date=2020-08-26|title=Colombia's Supreme Court receives 'proof' Uribe was involved in massacres|url=https://colombiareports.com/colombias-supreme-court-receives-proof-uribe-was-involved-in-massacres/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Colombia News {{!}} Colombia Reports|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Armario {{!}} AP|first=Christine|title=US cables: Colombia's ex-president suspected of militia ties|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/us-cables-colombias-ex-president-suspected-of-militia-ties/2020/08/31/865c6122-eb94-11ea-bd08-1b10132b458f_story.html|access-date=2020-09-04|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Álvaro Uribe  was born in Medellín, the oldest of five children. His father, Alberto Uribe, was a landowner. At the age of 10 his family left their [[Salgar]] ranch and moved to Medellín. He graduated in 1970 from the Instituto Jorge Robledo after being expelled from the Medellín Benedictine School for arguing with the priests.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|date=2002-08-11|title=ALVARO URIBE VÉLEZ|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1335372|access-date=2020-08-31|website=El Tiempo|language=es}}</ref>

Uribe studied Law at the University of Antioquia and he graduated in 1977. His father was killed by a guerrilla group during a 1983 kidnapping attempt.<ref>Colombia, laboratorio de embrujos.

He served on the Medellín city council between 1984 and 1986.

In 1993 he attended [[Harvard University]], receiving a Certificate of Special Studies in Administration and Management from [[Harvard Extension School]] and a Certificate in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution from [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name="H.E.

==Political career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2016}}

In 1976 Uribe was Chief of Assets for the Public Enterprises of Medellín (''Empresas Públicas de Medellín'').<ref name="HojadeVidaOf" /> He served as Secretary General of the Ministry of Labor under [[Alfonso López Michelsen]] from 1977 to 1978.<ref name="HojadeVidaOf" /> During this time he married Lina Moreno, a philosopher from [[Medellín]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

===Senator of Colombia===
Uribe was elected one of Antioquia's senators from 1986 to 1990 and again from 1990 to 1994. As senator, he served as president of the Seventh Commission and he supported laws dealing with reform of pensions, labor and [[social security]], as well as promotion of administrative careers, [[cooperative banking]], brown sugar, and protection for women. Some of the legislation later drew criticism, in particular that which reduced the state's responsibility for social security. During his later term he received official and unofficial awards as one of the "best senators" (1990, 1992 and 1993) and as the senator with the "best legislative initiatives" (1992).<ref name="HojadeVidaOf">[http://web.presidencia.gov.co/presidente/hojaing_auv5.htm Álvaro Uribe Vélez.

Retrieved 29 August 2007.</ref>

===Governor of Antioquia===
He was elected governor of the department of Antioquia for the 1995 to 1997 term. During his term, Uribe developed what he described as a model for a [[communitarian]] state, where in theory citizens would participate in the administration's decision making. It was claimed that this model would help improve employment, education, administrative transparency and public security.

Within his jurisdiction, Uribe openly supported a national program of licensed private security services<ref name="UNHCR_HOST_HRW_1998">[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,45865eec2,45865fb02,3ae6a7e30,0.html War Without Quarter: Colombia and International Humanitarian Law], [[Human Rights Watch]]. 1 October 1998. Retrieved 3 June 2010.</ref> that became known as [[CONVIVIR]], which had been created by Decree 356 issued by the Colombian Defense Ministry in February 1994. The groups quickly became controversial – while some reportedly improved security in communities and intelligence coordination with the military, their members were accused of abusing civilians and operated without serious oversight. In 1998, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated: "we have received credible information that indicated that the CONVIVIR groups of the [[Magdalena Medio Antioquia|Magdalena Medio]] and of the southern Cesar regions were directed by known paramilitaries and had threatened to assassinate Colombians that were considered as guerrilla sympathizers or which rejected joining the cooperative groups".<ref name="UNHCR_HOST_HRW_1998"/><ref name="IACHR_1999">{{cite web |url=http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Colom99sp/capitulo-4e.htm |title=Tercer Informe sobre la Situación de los Derechos Humanos en Colombia.

===2002 presidential election===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2020}}

{{see also|1999–2002 FARC–Government peace process}}
[[File:Campaignuribevelez.png|thumb|upright|Uribe's Presidential campaign poster. The slogan reads "Firm hand, big heart".]]
Uribe ran as an independent liberal candidate, having unofficially separated from his former party. His electoral platform centered on confronting Colombia's main guerrilla movement, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]]. Other relevant propositions included slashing the national administration's expenses, fighting corruption and initiating a national referendum to resolve several of the country's political and economic concerns.

Colombia's government under President [[Andres Pastrana]] was undergoing [[1999–2002 FARC–Government peace process|peace negotiations]] with the largest guerrilla group, the FARC. but after four years of peace negotiations without cease fires, disapproval of Colombia's main parties grew. Violence was rampant. The FARC had, as they claimed, taken control of some 100 [[municipalities of Colombia]] out of 1093 at that moment, kidnappings were common and were among the highest in the world, as well as the assassination and crime rate. The AUC was also gaining influence, and expanding its massacres and illicit drugs production, competing with FARC, ELN and other narco-traffickers.

Until at least 2001, polls showed that at most 2% of the electorate contemplated voting for Uribe and that the Liberal Party's [[Horacio Serpa]] would probably win. But public mood shifted in his favor after the peace process with the guerrillas degenerated. The administration of President [[Andrés Pastrana]] had failed for four years to secure a cease-fire, and Uribe began to be seen as the candidate who may provide a viable security program. Former General [[Harold Bedoya]], a candidate with a superficially similar program, remained marginalized.

Uribe was elected [[List of Presidents of Colombia|President of Colombia]] in the first round of 26 May 2002 elections with 53% of the popular vote. His running mate was [[Francisco Santos Calderón]], a member of the Santos family, who have a long-lasting tradition as members of the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] and as owners of Colombian daily newspaper ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]''. Santos was also one of the founders of the anti-kidnapping [[NGO]] ''Fundación País Libre'', created shortly after his own experience as a hostage of drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]].

Observers considered the elections mostly free of foul play at the national level, but there were instances of active intimidation of voters and candidates, by the actions of guerrilla and paramilitary groups. 47% of the potential electorate voted, down from the previous round of voting. <!--[http://www.electionworld.org/colombia.htm] This now just redirects to the Politics of Colombia Article. Can anyone find a better source?-->

Some of Uribe's opponents made accusations during his campaign, especially in a speech by [[Horacio Serpa]] and a book published by Newsweek's [[Joseph Contreras]], who interviewed Uribe that year. Claims centered on Uribe's alleged past personal relationships with members of the [[Medellín Cartel]] and the sympathy that some paramilitary spokesmen expressed towards Uribe as a candidate. Uribe and his supporters denied or undermined these claims, and critics never committed to legal action because there was no evidence for these claims.

===Internal conflict===
During his tenure, Uribe's declared priority was to contain or defeat the three main armed groups in Colombia, the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] (AUC),{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] (ELN), and FARC. And by the end of his first term in office the AUC had other right-wing militias agree to disarm and go to jail under special sentences of seven years.<ref>The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, Terrorist Organization Profile:United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=126</ref>

Uribe stated that the government had to first show military superiority in order to eventually make the guerrillas return to the negotiating table with a more flexible position, even if this would only happen after his term in office expired. Early in his government, he was quoted as saying that Colombia's main concerns were the challenges of terrorism and the [[narcotic]]s trade.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.presidencia.gov.co/cne/2003/agosto/22/17222003.htm En Colombia No Hay Conflicto Sino Terrorismo], ''Centro de Noticias del Estado'', 22 August 2003. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref> In a dialog with [[BBC]]'s ''Talking Point'', Uribe stated: "Of course we need to eliminate social injustice in Colombia but what is first? Peace. Without peace, there is no investment. Without investment, there are no fiscal resources for the government to invest in the welfare of the people".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021213.stm Uribe defends security policies], [[BBC News]], 18 November 2004. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref>

His security program was based on a policy of [[democratic security]], aiming to:
# Gradually restore police presence in all municipalities.
# Increase judicial action against crimes of high social impact.
# Strengthen public institutions.
# Reduce human rights violations.
# Dismantle terrorist organizations (especially armed rebel groups, the main one is the [[FARC-EP]]).
# Reduce kidnappings and extortion.
# Reduce homicide levels.
# Prevent forced displacement and facilitating the return of forcefully-displaced people.
# Continue to fight the illegal drug trade through interdiction, eradication and judicial action.

The policy intended to achieve these goals by:
# Engaging the civilian population more actively.
# Supporting soldiers.
# Increasing intelligence capacity.
# Reinstating control over national roads.
# Demobilizing illegal groups.
# Integrating the armed forces services.
# Increasing defense spending.<ref name="EmbWDC">[http://www.colombiaemb.org/opencms/opencms/defense/ Democratic Security and Defense Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017035016/http://www.colombiaemb.org/opencms/opencms/defense/ |date=17 October 2007 }}, Embassy of Colombia, Washington, D.C.</ref>

In early 2002, Uribe's administration decreed a one-time tax of 1.2% of the liquid assets of the higher income Colombians and corporations, with the goal of raising US$800 million. More than $650 million was collected before the final payment quota was made, surpassing original expectations. Another goal was to increase defense expenditures from a current level of about 3.6% of GDP to 6% of GDP by 2006.<ref name="EmbWDC"/>

According to official government statistical information from August 2004, in two years, homicides, kidnappings, and terrorist attacks in Colombia decreased by as much as 50% – their lowest levels in almost 20 years. In 2003, there were 7,000 fewer homicides than in 2002 – a decrease of 27%. By April 2004, the government had established a permanent police or military presence in every Colombian municipality for the first time in decades.<ref>[https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/08/19/after_a_dark_period_a_better_colombia/ OpEd: After a dark period, a better Colombia] by Luis Alberto Moreno, ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 19 August 2004. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref>

The Colombian Embassy in Washington states that, as a result of this policy, the Colombian armed forces would now have: "60% more combat ready soldiers than four years ago; Helicopters which have significantly improved the mobility of Armed Forces throughout the national territory; Attack helicopters ensuring means to be more aggressive in the fight against FARC and AUC; Increased basic combat supplies, including rifles and ammunition; and [has received] significant less human rights complaints against them".<ref name="EmbWDC" />

In January 2005, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated: "Paramilitary groups maintain close ties with a number of Colombian military units. The Uribe administration has yet to take effective action to break these ties by investigating and prosecuting high-ranking members of the armed forces credibly alleged to have collaborated with paramilitary groups. Credible reports indicate that some of the territories from which the military has ejected the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia, FARC) are now under the control of paramilitary groups, which continue to carry out indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population".<ref>[https://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/colomb9847.htm World Report 2005: Colombia], [[Human Rights Watch]]. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref>

A February 2005 report by the [[United Nations]] [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] on the year 2004 stated: "Achievements and advances were observed in the field of human rights and international humanitarian law; however, there were also difficulties and contradictions. ... Progress was recorded in terms of prevention and protection, including strengthening of the mechanism of community defenders and the early warning system, as well as regarding the Ministry of the Interior's programs for the protection of vulnerable groups. Weaknesses persisted in the Government's responses to warnings, as well as in decreasing risk factors for vulnerable groups. The Government adopted positive measures regarding the destruction of stored anti-personnel mines. The armed forces occasionally carried out operations in which they failed to observe humanitarian principles".<ref>[http://www.hchr.org.co/documentoseinformes/informes/altocomisionado/Informe2004_eng.pdf Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Colombia], [[UNHCHR]], 25 February 2005, page 3. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref>

An anti-terror statute criticized by many human rights groups was approved by Congress on 11 December 2003 but was struck down in August 2004 by the Colombian Constitutional Court during its review. The statute granted the military judicial police rights and allowed limited arrests and communication intercepts without warrants. It was struck down due to an error in the approval procedure, an objection the court has also presented towards other bills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indh.pnud.org.co/articuloImprimir.plx?id=187&t=informePrensa|title=Corte Constitucional declara inexequible Acto Legislativo de Estatuto Antiterrorista|date=28 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928094307/http://indh.pnud.org.co/articuloImprimir.plx?id=187&t=informePrensa|archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref>

After some of the AUC's main leaders had declared a cease-fire and agreed to concentrate in [[Santa Fe de Ralito]], several paramilitary demobilizations began in earnest, thousands of their "rank and file" fighters were disarmed and incorporated into government rehabilitation programs late in 2004. The main AUC leaders, who would be held responsible for atrocities, remained in the concentration zone and continued talks with the government's High Commissioner for Peace, [[Luis Carlos Restrepo]]. A number of the paramilitary members who initially demobilized in Medellín apparently did not actually belong to the AUC and this caused public concern. The AUC commanders claimed, as the year ended, that they had difficulties controlling all of their personnel from their isolated position, that they had already demobilized some 20% of their forces, and that they would await for the drafting of the necessary legal framework before making any more significant moves.

In 2005, Uribe and Colombia's congressmen prepared for the elections held in May and March 2006 respectively. FARC, which had been perceived as relatively passive, began to show signs of what analysts considered renewed vigor in February.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} It made a series of attacks against small military units, which left at least three dozen casualties. Uribe said in a speech that FARC remained strong and had never retreated, and he credited Colombia's soldiers for previous successes against FARC activities.

Negotiations with the AUC also increased public anxiety. Discussions continued about the legal provisions to assure "justice, reparation and truth" after a full demobilization. Also according to many observers, paramilitary activity continued despite AUC's declared cease-fire, albeit at a reduced rate. The demobilizations were renewed in November and finished in the complete disbandment of the group by middle February 2007, although some of the paramilitary units rejected disbandment and returned to criminal activity. These groups became known as the [[Black Eagles]]. This group is relatively small in comparison to the AUC and have not been able to achieve the notoriety or the military power of their predecessor, but are present on some former paramilitary areas, like Catatumbo and Choco.<ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title=Las 'Águilas negras', grupo conformado por desmovilizados de las autodefensas, ya azotan 5 regiones |date=31 October 2006 |work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/conflicto/noticias/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3306783.html |access-date=20 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312173530/http://www.eltiempo.com/conflicto/noticias/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3306783.html |archive-date=12 March 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The [[Colombian Congress]] agreed to prosecute AUC leaders under the controversial [[Justice and Peace Law of Colombia|Justice and Peace Law]], by which the paramilitary leaders would receive reduced sentences in exchange for their testimony and declarations of their entire criminal activity: links with [[drug dealers]], assassinations, disappearances and massacres.<ref>[http://www.altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co/justicia_paz/documentos/Ley1_975.pdf Ley de Justicia y Paz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721102306/http://www.altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co/justicia_paz/documentos/Ley1_975.pdf |date=21 July 2011 }}, [[Congress of the Republic of Colombia]], 15 July 2005.

The paramilitary leaders are also forced to "repair" the damage caused to the victims or their families: By disclosing the location of [[mass graves]] and by repaying each of them through economic assistance. As of 2008, these public hearings are still underway.

To improve its results in the fight against guerrilla warfare, the [[Colombian army]] carried out mass executions of civilians transformed into [["False positives" scandal|false positives]]. If exactions of this kind already existed, the phenomenon became widespread from 2002, encouraged by the bonuses paid to the soldiers and by quasi-absolute impunity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/amerique-sud/colombie-des-milliers-de-civils-tues-pour-simuler-des-succes-militaires_1693719.html|title=Colombie: des milliers de civils tués pour simuler des succès militaires|date=26 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.varmatin.com/article/monde/lonu-denonce-un-taux-dimpunite-de-985-des-forces-armees-en-colombie.188555.html|title=L'ONU dénonce un taux d'impunité de 98,5% des forces armées en Colombie|website=archives.varmatin.com}}</ref> In 2010 a mass grave containing 2,000 corpses was discovered near a military base in the department of [[Meta]].

According to the CODHES human rights NGO, forced displacement during Uribe's term affected over 2.4 million Colombian nationals by the end of 2009.

===Colombian parapolitics scandal===
{{Main|Colombian parapolitics scandal}}
In November 2006, a [[Para-political scandal|political crisis]] emerged as several of Uribe's congressional supporters were questioned or charged by the [[Colombian Supreme Court]] and the office of the Attorney General for having alleged links to paramilitary groups. [[Álvaro Araújo Castro|Álvaro Araújo]], brother of Uribe's Foreign Minister [[María Consuelo Araújo]], was among those summoned for questioning.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sibylla |last=Brodzinsky |page=1 |title=Colombian establishment rocked by death squad scandal |date=29 November 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,1959864,00.html |location=London}}</ref> In November, the former ambassador to [[Chile]], Salvador Arana, was charged with the murder of a mayor in a small town in the Department of Sucre.<ref>{{cite news |first=Constanza |last=Vieira |page=1 |title=Colombia – Arrests of Lawmakers with Paramilitary Ties Rock Government |date=17 November 2006 |publisher=Inter Press Service News |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35525 |access-date=8 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402042203/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35525 |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Supreme Court sentenced Arana to 40 years in prison in December 2009.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kristen |last=Begg |page=1 |title=Ex governor jailed for 40 years for parapolitics |date=3 December 2009 |publisher=Colombia Reports |url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/7180-supreme-court-sentences-ex-governor-to-40-years-in-jail-for-parapolitics.html}}</ref>

In April 2007, Senator [[Gustavo Petro]] made several accusations against Uribe during a televised congressional debate about paramilitarism in Antioquia. Petro said that some of the Uribe family's farms in the north of the country had been previously used as staging grounds for paramilitary forces. He also showed a picture of Santiago Uribe, the President's brother, together with [[Fabio Ochoa Vásquez|Fabio Ochoa]], a drug dealer, in 1985. Petro also argued that Governor Uribe's office allowed paramilitary personnel to participate in some of the legal cooperative neighborhood watch groups known as [[CONVIVIR]]. Another accusation concerned the possible participation of a helicopter belonging to the former Antioquia Governor's administration during a paramilitary massacre.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news |page=1 |title=La fibra intima |date=22 April 2006 |work=[[Revista Semana]] |url=http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=102363 |access-date=10 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605200224/http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=102363 |archive-date=5 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Two days later, Uribe publicly revealed that former US Vice President [[Al Gore]] had canceled his participation in a pro-environment event Uribe was to attend in [[Miami]] due to the continuing allegations against him. The Colombian President reacted by organizing a press conference during which he addressed several of the accusations Senator Petro and others had made against him. Uribe argued that his family had nothing to do with any massacres and that they had already sold the implicated farms several years before the alleged events. He also stated that the Uribes and the Ochoas were both famous in the horse breeding business, causing their meetings to be both common and public. He claimed that the helicopter's hours and missions had been strictly logged, making it impossible for it to have participated in any massacre. Uribe said that he supported the CONVIVIR groups but was not solely responsible for their creation, adding that other civilian and military authorities also participated in their oversight. He also said that he dismantled some CONVIVIR groups when doubts began to surround their activities.<ref name="autogenerated2" /><ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title=Uribe se defiende |date=22 April 2006 |work=[[Revista Semana]] |url=http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=102325 |access-date=10 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607010718/http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=102325 |archive-date=7 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 22 April 2008, former senator [[Mario Uribe Escobar]], one of the Colombian President's cousins and a close political ally, was arrested after being denied asylum at the Costa Rican embassy in [[Bogotá]], as part of a judicial inquiry into the links between politicians and paramilitary groups.

On 23 April 2008, Uribe revealed that a former paramilitary fighter had accused him of helping to plan the 1997 [[El Aro massacre|massacre of El Aro]], a charge which he said was under official investigation.

===Wiretapping scandal===
In May 2009 Colombian prosecutors officially began an investigation on a series of illegal wiretapping and spying activities carried out against opposition politicians, judges, journalists and others by the [[Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad|Department of Administrative Security]] (DAS).<ref name=WPonDASMay2009 /> The probe has involved several of Uribe's top aides and former high-ranking personnel within the department.<ref name=WPonDASMay2009>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/16/AR2009051602301.html |title=Scandals Surround Colombian Leader.

Former DAS counterintelligence director Jorge Alberto Lagos has told investigators that information on the country's Supreme Court judges was provided to Bernardo Moreno and José Obdulio, two of Uribe's aides.<ref name=WPonDASMay2009 /> Gaviria has claimed that criminals have tried to damage the government's image as part of a "political war" against the administration.<ref name=WPonDASMay2009 /> ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' has criticized these explanations, raising questions about the President's knowledge of these activities.<ref name=WPonDASMay2009 /> Uribe himself has denied ordering any illegal wiretapping and claims that those responsible for spying on the opposition are part of "a mafia group that hurts the Colombian Democracy, freedom, the country and the government itself".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/2999-uribe-denies-having-ordered-das-wiretaps.html |title=Uribe denies having ordered DAS wiretaps – Colombia news |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>

The DAS, an "intelligence service that answers to the president" as described by the ''[[Washington Post]]'',<ref name=WPonDASMay2009 /> has been the subject of earlier controversies during the Uribe administration. According to ''[[Revista Semana]]'', revelations about the infiltration of paramilitaries affected the entity under former DAS chief [[Jorge Noguera]] in 2007 and further accusations have continued to surface.<ref name=SemanaDASsigueGrab>{{cite web |url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-nacion/das-sigue-grabando/120991.aspx |title=El DAS sigue grabando |work=[[Revista Semana]] |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=8 June 2010 |language=es}}</ref> The magazine reported that information gathered by the DAS has been allegedly forwarded to paramilitaries, narcotraffickers and guerrillas.<ref name=SemanaDASsigueGrab />

Previously, former DAS computer systems chief Rafael García had claimed that the department and Colombian paramilitaries were involved in a plan to assassinate Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Gonzalo Guillen |url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2009/10/02/v-fullstory/557125/rosales-niega-plan-para-asesinar.html |title=Rosales niega plan para asesinar a Chávez – Venezuela |work=El Nuevo Herald |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309170954/http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2009/10/02/v-fullstory/557125/rosales-niega-plan-para-asesinar.html |archive-date=9 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Uribe's administration was responsible for arresting and extraditing more drug traffickers to the United States and to other countries than all other previous presidents. He has been publicly recognized as a supporter of the US [[war on drugs]] by continually implementing the anti-drug strategy of [[Plan Colombia]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

He is also recognized as a supporter of the US [[war on terror]], and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. In January 2003, Uribe ended a radio interview by asking "why isn't there any thought of [making] an equivalent deployment [as in the invasion of Iraq] to put an end to this problem [the Colombian conflict], which has such potentially grave consequences?".<ref>Hernandez, A., "[http://www.ania.urcm.net/noticia.php3?id=4258&idcat=13&idamb=3 Uribe pide a E.U. un despliegue militar en Colombia “similar” al de Irak]", ANIA, 23 January 2003</ref>

In a 22 November visit to the coastal city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], US President [[George W. Bush]] stood by the results of Uribe's security policies and declared he would continue to provide Plan Colombia aid in the future: "My nation will continue to help Colombia prevail in this vital struggle. Since the year 2000, when we began Plan Colombia, the United States has provided more than $3 billion in vital aid. We'll continue providing aid. We've helped Colombia to strengthen its democracy, to combat drug production, to create a more transparent and effective judicial system, to increase the size and professionalism of its military and police forces, to protect human rights, and to reduce corruption. Mr. President, you and your government have not let us down. Plan Colombia enjoys wide bipartisan support in my country, and next year I will ask our Congress to renew its support so that this courageous nation can win its war against narco-terrorists".<ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2004/Nov/23-231491.html Bush, Uribe Applaud Strength of U.S.-Colombia Partnership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824153938/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2004/Nov/23-231491.html |date=24 August 2006 }}, [[United States Department of State]], 23 November 2004.

Several analysts consider that, being an ally of the USA, Uribe would be ideologically opposed to left wing governments in Latin America and elsewhere. Yet, Uribe has participated in multilateral meetings and has held bilateral summits with presidents [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Martín Torrijos]], [[Lula da Silva]], [[Ricardo Lagos]], and [[Carlos Mesa]], among others. Colombia has also maintained diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]] and the People's Republic of China.

There have been some diplomatic incidents and crises with Venezuela during his term, in particular around the 2005 [[Rodrigo Granda affair]], Colombia's frustrated 2004 acquisition of 46 [[AMX-30]] tanks from Spain, and an [[Alleged planned Venezuelan coup in 2004]] by Colombian paramilitaries. These internationally worrying circumstances have been ultimately resolved through the use of official diplomatic channels and bilateral presidential summits (in the first two cases).

[[File:President Obama and President Uribe.jpg|thumb|left|Uribe and the US president [[Barack Obama]].]]
International law enforcement cooperation has been maintained with countries such as the USA, Spain, the United Kingdom, [[México]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]], [[Peru]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Honduras]] and [[Brazil]] among others.

Uribe's government, along with Peru and Ecuador, negotiated and (with Peru) signed a [[free trade]] agreement with the US. On 30 December 2005, Uribe signed a [[free trade agreement]] (FTA) with [[Mercosur]] and gives Colombian products preferential access to the market of 230 million people. Trade negotiations have also been underway with Mexico, Chile, the [[Andean]] community and the USA over its current proposal.

After the [[2009 Honduran general election|2009 Honduran election]] Uribe joined a list of leaders that are supporting the next government following the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|coup d'état]]. "Colombia recognizes the next government", Uribe told reporters during an Ibero-American summit in Portugal on 30 November 2009. "A democratic process has taken place in Honduras with high participation, without fraud".<ref name="Honduras hopes to move past coup with election (Version 2)">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091130/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_elections |title=Honduras hopes to move past coup with election (Version 2) |date=30 November 2009 |publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]] via [[Yahoo News]] |accessdate=30 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201190036/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091130/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_elections |archive-date=1 December 2009 }}</ref>

In 2009, bilateral negotiations between the United States and Colombia which would give U.S. forces increased access to several Colombian military bases for the stated purpose of fighting terrorism and the drug trade generated controversy throughout the region. Venezuela's [[Hugo Chávez]] criticized the proposed deal as the creation of a purported "imperialist beachhead" while Colombian diplomats defended the agreement. [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] stated that "there was no intention to expand the number of permanent [U.S.] personnel [in Colombia] beyond the maximum permitted by Congress". Other Latin American nations, including [[Brazil]], also expressed their own concerns about the matter.<ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title=U.S. Military Base Plan Puts Colombia in Hot Water |date=12 August 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1915825,00.html#ixzz0rehy8KtO}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Simon|last=Romero |page=1 |title=Increased U.S. Military Presence in Colombia Could Pose Problems With Neighbors |date=23 July 2009 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/world/americas/23colombia.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title=Outcry in South America over US military base pact |date= 27 August 2009 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/27/anger-america-colombia-bases-deal |location=London |first1=Rory |last1=Carroll |first2=Ewen |last2=MacAskill}}</ref>

On 2 July 2008 a covert rescue operation codenamed [[Operation Jaque]] by the Colombian Special Forces disguised as FARC guerrillas resulted in the rescue of Senator and former Presidential candidate [[Ingrid Betancourt]], the Americans [[Marc Gonsalves]], [[Thomas Howes (hostage)|Thomas Howes]], and [[Keith Stansell]] and eleven soldiers and police officers. It was done without bloodshed and led to the capture of two guerrilla leaders. The operation heightened Uribe's already soaring popularity.

Despite significant political differences, until 2007 Colombia and Venezuela had only one major impasse in their relations, the [[Rodrigo Granda affair]], which had been overcome thanks to the direct talks between Uribe and Chávez. Uribe's main political problem during 2007 was his handling of the [[humanitarian exchange]] situation: the FARC guerrillas held over 700 hostages, living in poor conditions in the Colombian jungle. These hostages included presidential candidate and French citizen [[Ingrid Betancourt]] (later freed), three American citizens (later freed), and several Colombian politicians and law enforcers. Some of the captives had been in the jungle for over 10 years. For the release of 40 of these hostages (the so-called "canjeables" or "exchangeables") the FARC demands a [[Demilitarized Zone]] that includes the towns of Florida and Pradera. The government has refused to comply with this demand, deciding instead to push for a military rescue of the hostages, or by searching the mediation of third parties like Switzerland and the [[Catholic Church]].

As all of those plans failed to get any positive outcome, Uribe appointed Senator [[Piedad Córdoba]] to mediate between the government and the guerrillas in an attempt to secure the liberation of the hostages. Córdoba then asked Chávez to mediate as well, with Uribe's consent. French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was also willing to help in the mediation effort.

On 8 November 2007 Chávez met with alias "Iván Márquez" one of the highest members of the FARC and some other members of its secretariat at the  [[Palacio de Miraflores]] in a widely publicized event. After the event Chavez promised to deliver evidence that some of the hostages remained alive. When Chávez met with Sarkozy on 19 November, Chávez was still waiting for the evidence. Lacking the "proof of life" that was promised to the families of the hostages, and seeing prominent FARC members using the media attention to promote their own ideology, Uribe became disgruntled with the mediation process.

On 22 November Uribe abruptly ended the mediation after Chávez spoke with the high command of the Colombian military during a call made by Córdoba.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Uribe had warned Chávez against any attempt to talk to military high command. Chávez initially accepted the decision, but tensions escalated as the presidents increasingly attacked each other verbally, with Chávez claiming that Uribe and the U.S. simply preferred the war continue, and Uribe implying Chávez supported the rebels.

Chávez announced a "freeze" of political relations and called Uribe a "pawn of the empire" and cut contact with the Colombian government, including rejecting calls from the Colombian embassy in Caracas. He announced his intent to sharply reduce bilateral commerce.<ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title=Escaramuzas Vervales |date=26 January 2008 |work=[[Revista Semana]] |url=http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=109049 |access-date=29 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129114302/http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?IdArt=109049 |archive-date=29 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Chávez continued negotiating with the rebels and eventually secured the unilateral release of two, then four more, hostages to Venezuela which were meant as signs of good faith and preceded calls for more negotiations, which Uribe dismissed.

A [[2008 Andean diplomatic crisis|regional crisis]] began after Colombian troops killed FARC commander [[Raúl Reyes]] in a guerrilla camp inside Ecuadorian borders on 1 March. Ecuador, Venezuela and Nicaragua, which has a maritime dispute with Colombia, cut diplomatic ties with Colombia as a response, with Chavez and Ecuadorean President [[Rafael Correa]] ordering troops to their respective borders with Colombia.<ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title=Neighbours cut ties with Colombia |date=4 March 2008 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7276228.stm}}</ref> Uribe in response placed the armed forces on high alert but did not move his troops to confront them even though the Colombian army is larger than Ecuador's and Venezuela's combined.<ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title =Hugo Chavez Moves His Tanks to Border as Regional War Looms |date=3 March 2008|work =[[The Times]]|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article3471872.ece. |location=London |first1=Sean |last1=O'Neill |first2=Fiona |last2=Hamilton}}</ref>

The impasse was finally solved when [[Leonel Fernández]], President of the [[Dominican Republic]], hosted an emergency summit of Latin American nations in [[Santo Domingo]]. He got Uribe, Correa, and Chavez to shake hands.

===Socio-economic policy===
The Uribe administration has continued dealing with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]], securing loans, agreeing to cut expenses, agreeing to continue debt payments, privatize public companies and foment investor confidence, in order to comply with financial orthodoxy.

[[File:Alvaro Uribe in INNOVA Awards 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Uribe in INNOVA awards 2006, designed to boost the development of micro and small industry]]

Under Uribe, social spending has also seen a huge increase. The government's High Advisor for Social Policy, [[Juan Francisco Lozano Ramírez]], stated in February 2005 that the administration had by 2004 achieved an increase of 5 million affiliates to the subsidized health system (3.5 million added in 2004, for a total of 15.4 million affiliates), an increase of 2 million Colombians that receive meals and care through the Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) (for a total of 6.6 million), an increase of 1.7 million education slots in the National Service of Learning (SENA) (for a total of 2.7 million), an increase of 157% in the amount of [[microcredit]] available to small entrepreneurs, a reduction of unemployment from 15.6% in December 2002 to 12.1% by December 2004, the addition of almost 200,000 new houses to existing housing projects for the poor, a total of 750,000 new school slots in primary and high school, some 260,000 new university slots, the return of 70,000 displaced persons to their homes (under an 800% increase in the budget assigned to this matter), and support for a program that seeks to increase economic subsidies from 170,000 to 570,000 of the elderly by the end of the term. The High Advisor added that a "colossal effort" is still required and work must continue, and that this progress would constitute a sign of the Uribe administration's positive effects on social indicators.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://noticias.presidencia.gov.co/sne/2005/febrero/12/03122005.htm Gobierno Uribe Tiene un Impacto Favorable en la Reducción de la Pobreza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132215/http://noticias.presidencia.gov.co/sne/2005/febrero/12/03122005.htm |date=29 September 2007 }}, Colombian State News, 12 February 2005.

Companies such as Carbocol, [[Telecom Colombia]], Bancafé, Minercol and others, which were either already in crisis or considered by the government as overly expensive to maintain under their current spending conditions, were among those restructured or privatized.

Most direct critics have considered Uribe's administration [[neoliberal]], and argued that it has not addressed the root causes of poverty and unemployment, because continued application of traditional trade and tax policies tend to benefit private and foreign investors over small owners and workers. Union and labor claim that many of the privatizations and liquidations have been done to please the IMF, the World Bank and multinational companies, and will hurt several national industries in the long run.<ref>[http://www.minesandcommunities.org/Action/action48.htm To the Spoilers the Victory: Colombia Privatises the Mineral Industry with World Bank Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318201747/http://www.minesandcommunities.org/Action/action48.htm |date=18 March 2008 }}, Mines & Communities Action, 29 October 2003.

Unemployment remains at a high level (between 11 and 12% under Uribe's administration).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://datos.bancomundial.org/indicador/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS?locations=CO&page=1|title=Desempleo, total (% de la población activa total) (estimación modelado OIT) - Colombia &#124; Data|website=datos.bancomundial.org}}</ref>

===Referendum for reelection===
A national referendum was promoted during Uribe's campaign and later modified by Congress and judicial review. The ability to revoke Congress was removed, as was the option to vote "Yes" or "No" as a whole. The modified proposal was defeated at the polls on 25 October 2003, and several left-wing candidates opposed to the referendum were victorious at regional elections the following day. At least 25% of the electorate needed to vote on each of the 15 proposals in order it to be accepted, but overall participation was only 24.8% and only the first proposal ("political death for the corrupt") achieved this. All 15 proposals were approved by a substantial majority of those who voted.<ref>[http://www.electionguide.org/election.php?ID=388 2003 Colombian Referendum], [[International Foundation for Election Systems]]. Retrieved 4 April 2007</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.registraduria.gov.co/2003RE_escrut/e/vre0.htm?1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040902093224/http://www.registraduria.gov.co/2003RE_escrut/e/vre0.htm?1|url-status=dead|title=Official Election Results|archive-date=2 September 2004}}</ref>

Analysts considered these events a political setback for Uribe, as one of his main campaign propositions had failed, despite his personal leadership. The "active abstention" and blank voting campaigns that his opponents, in particular the [[Independent Democratic Pole]] and the [[Colombian Liberal Party]], had promoted were allegedly successful in convincing enough of their sympathizers to stay home and instead participate in the next day's round of elections.

A number of Uribe's own supporters did not participate, as they found the referendum, which had been modified by Congress and later by the Judicial branch, to be too complex, long and uninspiring. Some also pointed out that extraordinary electoral initiatives (that is, those voted outside standard electoral dates) have traditionally suffered complications in Colombia, including a lack of participation.

In September 2003, Uribe issued a speech that contained allegations against what he called "agents of terrorism" inside a minority of [[human rights|human rights organizations]], while at the same time declaring that he respected criticism from most other established organizations and sources. Similar statements were later repeated in other instances.<ref>[http://ciponline.org/colombia/030908urib.htm Speech by Álvaro Uribe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231555/http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/030908urib.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}, 8 September 2003. Text courtesy [[Center for International Policy]]. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref>
These statements were sharply criticized inside and outside Colombia because they could endanger the work of human rights and opposition figures.<ref>[http://ciponline.org/colombia/ngos.htm The Uribe government and NGOs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234549/http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/ngos.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}, [[Center for International Policy]], 8 September 2003. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref>

Contacts begun in 2002 with the paramilitary AUC forces and their leader [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]], which had publicly expressed their will to declare a cease-fire, continued in 2003 amid a degree of national and international controversy.

===Reelection proposal===
In 2004, Uribe successfully sought a Congressional amendment to the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]] which allowed him to run for a second term as president. For years, Colombian presidents had been limited to a single four-year term and had been barred from any sort of reelection, even if nonconsecutive. Uribe originally had expressed his disagreement with consecutive reelection during his campaign, but later changed his mind, first at a private level and later in public appearances.

Many analysts considered that, in order to secure the approval of this reform, Uribe may have slacked on his campaign promises, because of what has been perceived as his indirect bribing of congressmen, through the alleged assignment of their relatives to the diplomatic corps and through promises of investment in their regions of origin. Uribe's supporters consider that no actual bribing took place, and that a consensus among the diverse sectors that back Uribe's policies in Congress had to be reached through political negotiation.

The amendment permitting a single reelection was approved by Congress in December 2004, and by the Constitutional Court in October 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4359064.stm Colombia re-election ban lifted], [[BBC News]], 20 October 2005. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref>

===2006 presidential elections===
{{Main|2006 Colombian presidential election}}
In 2004, Uribe's political supporters amended the constitution to allow him to run for a second term, previously proscribed by the Colombian constitution, and his own decision to run for a second term was announced in late 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_4477000/4477020.stm Uribe se lanza a la reelección ], [[BBC News]], 28 November 2005. Retrieved 13 August 2008.</ref> With this amendment, Uribe was re-elected on 28 May 2006 for a second presidential term (2006–2010), and became the first president to be consecutively re-elected in Colombia in over a century. He received about 62% of the vote, winning over 7.3 million votes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5024428.stm Colombia's Uribe wins second term], [[BBC News]], 29 May 2006. Retrieved 4 April 2007.</ref> This was the largest victory for a presidential candidate in Colombian history.

The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) deployed electoral observers in 12 departments: Antioquia, Risaralda, Quindío, Atlántico, Bolívar, Santander, Córdoba, Cauca, César, Nariño, Magdalena and Valle. In a statement made on 28 May, OAS mentioned that the elections "have taken place in an atmosphere of freedom, transparency and normalcy", despite incidents "related to the use of indelible ink, voter substitution and the accreditation of electoral witnesses, though these have no effect on the electoral process as a whole" and "developments in northern Santander province that took the lives of army personnel and left others injured in an ambush carried out by subversive groups".<ref>[http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press_releases/press_release.asp?sCodigo=EOM-CO-03 OAS Observation Mission: Colombian Elections Transparent, Normal], [[Organization of American States]], 28 May 2006.

===Bribery investigation===
{{Main|Yidispolitics scandal}}
In April 2008, Yidis Medina, a former congresswoman from the pro-government [[Colombian Conservative Party]], claimed that members of Uribe's administration had offered her to appoint local officials in her home province, in exchange for voting in favor of the 2004 reelection bill. According to Medina, the government had not fulfilled that promise, prompting her declaration. The Attorney General of Colombia ordered her arrest, after which she turned herself over to authorities and testified to the Supreme Court as part of the investigation.  The opposition [[Alternative Democratic Pole]] party asked for Uribe to be investigated for bribery.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN2948031320080429 Colombian opposition calls for Uribe bribery probe], [[Reuters]], 29 April 2008.

According to a June 2009 Ipsos-Napoleón Franco national poll for the 2010 presidential campaign, covering over thirty cities and municipalities, Uribe's overall approval rating was 76% but only 57% would vote in favor of his potential reelection for a third term.<ref>{{cite news |title=Si no es Uribe, es Santos |work=[[Revista Semana]] |url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-politica/no-uribe-santos/124634.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Las nueve conclusiones sobre la primera Gran Encuesta |publisher=[[La Silla Vacía]] |url=http://www.lasillavacia.com/historia/2225}}</ref>

===2010 third term proposal===
As the end of Uribe's second term approached, his supporters sought a new amendment that would grant him the right to run for a third term.<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[The Economist]]'', 10 January 2009 U.S. print edition, page 34. "Politics in Colombia: Third Term Temptation"</ref>

In May 2009, Defense Minister [[Juan Manuel Santos]] resigned so he could run for president in case Uribe either did not or could not run again.  Santos said before resigning that he did not want to run against Uribe.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

[[Congress of Colombia|Congress]] backed a proposed referendum on the matter, but the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] rejected it after reviewing the resulting law. On 26 February 2010 lead justice Mauricio Gonzalez publicly announced the Court's decision.  Gonzalez said that the Court had found numerous irregularities in the way signatures were obtained to allow the referendum to pass.<ref>{{cite news |title=Colombia court rules out any Uribe bid for third term |author=Chris Kraul |author2=Jenny Carolina González |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=27 February 2010 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/27/world/la-fg-colombia-uribe27-2010feb27}}</ref>  He also said that the law calling for a referendum contained "substantial violations to the democratic principle" that made it unconstitutional.

==Post-presidency and controversy==
[[File:Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe with his students from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.jpeg|thumb|right|Uribe (center) with his students at Georgetown University]]

In late 2010, a few months after leaving office, Uribe was named visiting scholar at [[Georgetown University]]'s Walsh School of Foreign Service,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthonyclarkarend.com/humanrights/former-colombian-president-alvaro-uribe-to-teach-at-georgetown-university/|title=Former Colombian President, Alvaro Uribe, to teach at Georgetown University|date=12 August 2010}}</ref> where he taught students in different disciplines as a guest lecturer in seminars and classes. In 2011, Uribe was granted an honorary award by the Latin American Student Association of Georgetown, for his leadership and commitment with the Latin American community of the university.

Uribe's appointment at Georgetown sparked controversy. In September, more than 150 scholars, including 10 Georgetown professors and leading experts on Latin America and Colombia, signed a letter calling for Uribe's firing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/appointment-colombian-ex-president-sparks-controversy-georgetown-74165|title=Appointment of Colombian Ex-President Sparks Controversy at Georgetown|first=Mike Giglio On 10/13/10 at 3:18 PM|last=EDT|date=13 October 2010|website=Newsweek}}</ref> A Colombian humorist suggested Uribe teach a course on [[wiretapping]], which his administration illegally conducted on opposition figures, human rights workers, journalists and Supreme Court justices.<ref name="pri.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2010-09-22/colombia-dark-side-alvaro-uribe|title=Colombia: The dark side of Alvaro Uribe|website=Public Radio International}}</ref> Many students protested, with some hanging banners calling him a "mass murderer" for the deaths of thousands of civilians that the army was accused of later dressed up as guerrillas.<ref name="pri.org"/>

After a year at Georgetown, Uribe left to continue with his personal endeavors in Colombia.

In October 2012, [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] welcomed Uribe to the Board of Directors upon the retirement of Andrew Knight, John Thornton, and Arthur Siskind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_545.html |title=Chairman's Address to the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, Uribe joined the Leadership Council of Concordia, a nonprofit organization in New York City that creates public-private partnerships.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Prosecutors accuse Uribe of helping to plan paramilitary massacres in La Granja (1996), San Roque (1996) and [[El Aro Massacre|El Aro (1997)]] while he was governor of Antioquia, and the February 1998 assassination of Jesús María Valle, an attorney and human rights defender working with victims in those cases.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/world/americas/colombia-uribe-death-squad.html|title=In Colombian Death Ranch Case, Some Fear Prosecution Will Be Buried|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en}}</ref>
