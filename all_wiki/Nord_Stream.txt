'''Nord Stream''' (former names: '''North Transgas''' and '''North European Gas Pipeline'''; {{lang-ru|Северный поток}}, ''Severny potok'') is a system of offshore [[natural gas]] [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] from Russia to Germany. It includes two lines running from [[Vyborg]] to [[Lubmin]] near [[Greifswald]] forming original Nord Stream, and two lines under construction running from [[Ust-Luga]] to Lubmin termed '''Nord Stream 2'''. In Lubmin the lines connect to the [[OPAL pipeline|OPAL]] line to [[Olbernhau]] on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border and to the [[NEL pipeline|NEL]] line to [[Rehden]] near [[Bremen]]. Nord Stream is owned and operated by [[Nord Stream AG]], whose majority shareholder is the Russian state company [[Gazprom]], and Nord Stream 2 is owned and will be operated by Nord Stream 2 AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom.

Nord Stream projects have been opposed by the United States as well as several Central and Eastern European countries because of concerns that it would increase Russia's influence in the region. The U.S. resistance of Nord Stream 2 is also influenced by the country's increased production of natural gas, which gives the U.S. Congress economic incentive to resist the Russian supply of gas to the EU, in favour of U.S. [[Shale gas in the United States|shale gas]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://subscription.newsoveraudio.com/playlists/nord-stream-ii-252155|title=Nord Stream 2: An EU-Russian Gas Pipeline|date=20 December 2019|work=Noa|access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref>

The name "Nord Stream" occasionally refers to a wider pipeline network, including the feeding onshore pipeline in the Russian Federation, and further connections in [[Western Europe]].

==History==
[[File:Nord Stream ceremony.jpeg|left|thumb|Nord Stream opening ceremony on 8 November 2011 with [[Angela Merkel]], [[Dmitry Medvedev]], [[Mark Rutte]] and [[François Fillon]].]]

===Nord Stream===
The original pipeline project started in 1997 when Gazprom and the Finnish oil company [[Neste]] (in 1998 merged with Imatran Voima to form [[Fortum]], which in 2004 separated again into Fortum and Neste) formed the joint company North Transgas Oy for construction and operation of a gas pipeline from Russia to Northern Germany across the Baltic Sea.<ref name=fortum/> North Transgas cooperated with the German gas company [[Ruhrgas]] (which later became part of [[E.ON]], which was split still later into E.ON and [[Uniper]]). A route survey in the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]s of [[Finland]], Sweden, [[Denmark]] and Germany, and a feasibility study of the pipeline was conducted in 1998. Several routes were considered including routes with onshore segments through Finland and Sweden.<ref name="notification2006">

In August 2020, Poland fined Gazprom 50 million euro due to the latter's lack of cooperation with an investigation by UOKiK, the Polish anti-monopoly watchdog. This comes after the watchdog launched a probe under competition rules against Gazprom and five other companies that are financing the pipeline project, suspecting that they have continued to work on the pipeline without permission from the government of Poland. At that time 160km remained to be constructed, all within Danish waters. <ref>{{Cite news|date=3 August 2020|title=Poland fines Gazprom €50m over Nord Stream 2 pipeline|work=[[Financial Times]]|url=https://www.ft.com/content/42d196cf-0622-4255-8cab-98a2de961f73|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref>

Russian and German officials have claimed that the pipeline leads to economic savings due to the elimination of transit fees (as transit countries would be bypassed), and a higher operating pressure of the offshore pipeline which leads to lower operating costs (by eliminating the necessity for expensive midway compressor stations).<ref name="NSQA2">{{cite web

===Environmental aspects===
The greatest environmental impact in connection with the pipeline results from the consumption of the transported gas, if it allows more imports to the EU. That would be in conflict with decarbonization efforts for climate protection. At a nominal capacity of {{convert|55|e9m3/a|e12cuft/a|abbr=unit}}, each pipe pair can cause carbon emissions of 110 million tonnes {{co2}} each annually.<ref>Conversion with 10.1 kWh/m3 and 0.056 t {{co2}}/GJ </ref> Methane losses during extraction and transport need to be added.

For the Portowaja compressor station at the Russian beginning of North Stream 1 with a rating of 366 megawatts, {{co2}} emissions of around 1.5 million tons p.a. are estimated,<ref> http://www.gazprom.de/projects/nord-stream/ Retrieved on 7 September 2020, with 40% efficiency of the gas turbines</ref> not including compressor stations for the gas pipelines within Russia.

Since the pressure loss is the square of the flow velocity, dividing an unchanged gas transport volume between two Nord Stream systems could save around 3/4 of the pumping effort and presumably more than one million tons of {{co2}} emissions could be avoided annually. Using the [[Umweltbundesamt]]'s discounted {{co2}} damage costs of 180 euros / tonne,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/hohe-kosten-durch-unterlassenen-umweltschutz |title=Hohe Kosten durch unterlassenen Umweltschutz |work=[[Umweltbundesamt]] }}</ref> this would, after a rough estimate, enable the third tube to be amortized within around 20 years from a global point of view. Possibly also the fourth tube could be amortized in the hypothetical case of an overall optimization of gas flow over various pipelines between Russia and the EU.

The production of over 2 million tons of steel for the Nord Stream 2 tubes resulted in more than 3 million tons of {{co2}} emissions; not including the concrete coating and the associated pipeline sections onshore.

Before construction there were concerns that during construction the sea bed would be disturbed, dislodging [[World War II]]-era [[naval mine]]s and toxic materials including mines, chemical waste, [[chemical weapon|chemical munitions]] and other items dumped in the Baltic Sea in the past decades, and thereby toxic substances could surface from the seabed, damaging the Baltic's particularly sensitive ecosystem.<ref name="helcom2">{{cite news

===Land-based alternatives===
On 11 January 2007, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Finland made a statement on the environmental impact assessment programme of the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, in which it mentioned that alternative routes via the Baltic states, [[Kaliningrad]] and/or Poland might theoretically be shorter than the route across the Baltic Sea, would be easier to flexibly increase the capacity of the pipeline, and might have better financial results.<ref name="ktm">{{cite journal

===EU regulations===
According to the amended EU gas directive, the EU extends its gas market rules to external pipelines entering to the EU internal gas market. It applies to all pipelines which were completed after 23 May 2019 when amended directive entered into force.<ref name=euractiv260919>{{cite news | url = https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/nord-stream-2-seeks-arbitration-in-dispute-with-eu-commission/ | title = Nord Stream 2 seeks arbitration in dispute with EU Commission | first = Georgi | last = Gotev

Nord Stream 2 AG has started the legal proceeding in the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] to annul the amended directive and has started the arbitration against the EU under the [[Energy Charter Treaty]].<ref name=euractiv260919/><ref name="euobserver270919">{{cite news | url = https://euobserver.com/foreign/146101 | title = Russian pipeline firm launches anti-EU dispute | last = Rettman | first = Andrew | date = 27 September 2019 | work = EUobserver | accessdate = 22 December 2019}}</ref> 
Although Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and has terminated its provisional application, both—the EU and Switzerland, a domicile of Nord Stream 2 AG—are contracting parties of it.
