==History==
The firm was created in 1998 when Coopers & Lybrand merged with Price Waterhouse.<ref name=chronology />

===Coopers & Lybrand===
In 1854, [[William Cooper (accountant)|William Cooper]] founded an accountancy practice in London, England. It became Cooper Brothers seven years later when his three brothers joined.<ref name=chronology />

In 1898, [[Robert Hiester Montgomery|Robert H. Montgomery]], William M. Lybrand, Adam A. Ross Jr. and his brother T. Edward Ross formed Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery in the United States.<ref name=chronology />

In 1957, Cooper Brothers, along with Lybrand, Ross Bros & Montgomery and a Canadian firm (McDonald, Currie and Co.), agreed to adopt the name Coopers & Lybrand in international practice.<ref name=chronology /> In 1973, the three member firms in the UK, US and Canada changed their names to Coopers & Lybrand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/~/media/Files/Library/subjects/accounting%20history/family%20trees/family-tree-coopers-lybrand |title=ICAEW: Firms family trees}}</ref> Then in 1980, Coopers & Lybrand expanded its expertise in [[insolvency]] substantially by acquiring [[Cork Gully]], a leading firm in that field in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/411874/UK-Profile---Michael-Jordan-Cork-Gully/ |title=Profile – Michael Jordan of Cork Gully |work=Management Today |date= 1 January 1993 |access-date=3 August 2012 |archivedate=28 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528135713/http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/411874/UK-Profile---Michael-Jordan-Cork-Gully/ }}</ref> In 1990, in certain countries, including the UK, Coopers & Lybrand merged with [[Deloitte|Deloitte, Haskins & Sells]] to become Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte;<ref name=chronology/> in 1992 they reverted to Coopers & Lybrand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/155667/icaew_ga/en/Home/About_us/History_of_accounting/Coopers__Lybrand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228213852/http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/155667/icaew_ga/en/Home/About_us/History_of_accounting/Coopers__Lybrand |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 February 2010 |title=ICAEW family trees |publisher=Icaew.com |df= }}</ref>

===Price Waterhouse===
[[File:Edwinwaterhouse.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Edwin Waterhouse]] photographed as a young man]]

In 1849, [[Samuel Lowell Price]], an accountant, founded an accountancy practice in London, England.<ref name="pwhistory">{{cite book |title=Accounting for Success: a History of Price Waterhouse in America 1890–1990 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |isbn=978-0-87584-328-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/accountingforsuc00alle_0 |url-access=registration |year=1993}}</ref> In 1865, Price went into partnership with [[William Hopkins Holyland]] and [[Edwin Waterhouse]].<ref name="pwhistory"/> Holyland left shortly afterwards to work alone in accountancy and the firm was known from 1874 as Price, Waterhouse & Co.<ref name="pwhistory"/> The original partnership agreement, signed by Price, Holyland, and Waterhouse could be found in [[Southwark Towers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=164843|title=Price Waterhouse (Biographical details)|publisher=The British Museum|access-date=17 August 2013}}</ref>

By the late 19th century, Price Waterhouse had gained recognition as an accounting firm. As a result of growing trade between the United Kingdom and the United States, Price Waterhouse opened an office in New York in 1890, and the American firm expanded. The original British firm opened an office in [[Liverpool]] in 1904 and then elsewhere in the United Kingdom and worldwide, each time establishing a separate partnership in each country: the worldwide practice of PW was, therefore, a federation of collaborating firms that had grown organically rather than being the result of an international merger.<ref name="pwhistory" />

In a further effort to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], PW and [[Arthur Andersen]] discussed a merger in 1989<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/companies/account.html |title=University of Washington: Accounting firms and organisations |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu}}</ref> but the negotiations failed, mainly because of conflicts of interest such as Andersen's strong commercial links with [[IBM]] and PW's audit of IBM, as well as the radically different cultures of the two firms. It was said by those involved with the failed merger that at the end of the discussion, the partners at the table realized they had different views of business, and the potential merger was scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/business/fi-365_1_price-waterhouse|title=Accounting Giants Call Off Merger Plan : Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen Cite 'Differences'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1989|access-date=17 August 2013}}</ref>

===1998 to present===
In 1998, Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form PricewaterhouseCoopers (written with a lowercase "w" and a [[camelcase]] "C").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060625115425/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3755/is_199709/ai_n8768518 Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand to merge] Weekly Corporate Growth Report 29 September 1997</ref>

After the merger, the firm had a large professional [[Consultant|consulting]] branch, as did other major accountancy firms, generating much of its fees. The major cause for growth in the 1990s was the implementation of complex integrated [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems for multi-national companies. PwC came under increasing pressure to avoid conflicts of interest by not providing some consulting services, particularly financial systems design and implementation, to its audit clients. Since it audited a large proportion of the world's largest companies, this was beginning to limit its consulting market. These conflicts increased as additional services including outsourcing of IT and back-office operations were developed. For these reasons, in 2000, [[Ernst & Young]] was the first of the [[Big Four auditors|Big Four]] to sell its consulting services, to [[Capgemini]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/01/business/international-business-cap-gemini-to-acquire-ernst-young-s-consulting-business.html |title=International Business Capgemini to Acquire Ernst Young Consulting Business |work=[[New York Times]] |first=John | last=Tagliabue |date=March 1, 2000 |access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1017-237396.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809205004/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1017-237396.html |title=Ernst & Young sells consulting unit to Cap Gemini |first=Melanie Austria |last=Farmer |work=[[CNET]] |date=February 29, 2000 |archivedate=August 9, 2011 }}</ref>

The fallout from the [[Enron]], [[Worldcom]] and other [[Enron scandal|financial auditing scandals]] led to the passage of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] (2002), severely limiting interaction between management consulting and auditing (assurance) services. PwC Consulting began to conduct business under its own name rather than as the MCS division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC, therefore, planned to capitalize on MCS's rapid growth through its sale to [[Hewlett Packard]] (for a reported $17 billion) but negotiations broke down in 2000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1021544.stm Hewlett-Packard drops PWC bid] BBC News, 13 November 2000</ref>

In 2000, PwC acquired Canada's largest [[SAP SE|SAP]] consulting partner, Omnilogic Systems.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.therecord.com/news/business/article/637077--passion-for-business-takes-entrepreneur-from-software-to-cars-to-music|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111191843/http://www.therecord.com/news/business/article/637077--passion-for-business-takes-entrepreneur-from-software-to-cars-to-music |title=Passion for business takes entrepreneur from software to cars to music|first=Rose |last=Simone  |work=[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]|date=December 10, 2011 | archivedate=January 11, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2002, Arthur Andersen, LLP affiliates in Hong Kong and China completed talks to join PricewaterhouseCoopers, China.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726114903/http://www.muzi.com/cc/english/10318%2C19931.shtml?q=1201761 Andersen Affiliates in China to Join Rival] Singapore News, 21 March 2002</ref>

PwC announced in May 2002 that its consulting activities would be spun off as an independent entity and hired an outside CEO to run the global firm. An outside [[consultancy]], [[Wolff Olins]], was hired to create a brand image for the new entity, called "Monday".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2035803.stm|title=Monday name change for PwC|date=10 June 2002|publisher=BBC|access-date=14 December 2014}}</ref> The firm's CEO, [[Greg Brenneman]] described the unusual name as "a real word, concise, recognizable, global and the right fit for a company that works hard to deliver results."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2035803.stm Monday name change for PwC], ''BBC News'', 10 June 2002.</ref> These plans were soon revised, however. In October 2002, PwC sold the entire consultancy business to [[International Business Machines|IBM]] for approximately $3.5 billion in cash and stock. PwC's consultancy business was absorbed into [[IBM Global Business Services]], increasing the size and capabilities of IBM's growing consulting practice.<ref>[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2002/07/31/ibm_buying_price_waterhouse_coopers_consulting_business.html IBM buying PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting business] Technology, 31 July 2002</ref>

==Controversies==

===Gender employment discrimination===
{{main|Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins}}
In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that Price Waterhouse must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding [[Ann Hopkins]]'s employment would have been the same if [[sex discrimination]] had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone Hopkins's promotion to the partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the [[Mixed motive discrimination|mixed-motive framework]] as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present.<ref>Goldstein, Leslie. "Gender Stereotyping and the Workplace: Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989)." 2006. The Constitutional and Legal Rights of Women, 3rd ed. Los Angeles: Roxbury, 2006. 167–75. Print.''</ref> Hopkins's candidacy for partnership had been put on indefinite hold. She eventually resigned and sued the company for [[occupational sexism]], arguing that her lack of promotion came after pressure to walk, talk, dress, and act more "femininely."<ref name="Levit">{{cite book|last1=Levit|first1=Nancy|title=The Gender Line: Men, Women, and the Law|date=1998|publisher=New York University Press|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUldDkj_mg4C&pg=PA212|access-date=27 December 2014|isbn=9780814751220}}</ref>

In 1990 a Federal district judge in Washington ordered the firm to make Hopkins a partner.

===Tax issues===
In 2014, it came to light that PwC had received $55m from [[Caterpillar Inc.]] to develop a [[tax avoidance]] scheme, according to an investigation of the US Senate, and had helped Caterpillar Inc. drastically reduce its taxes for more than a decade.<ref name="Senate report claims"/><ref name="audit firms behind"/> Profits valued at $8bn were shifted from the US to Switzerland, which allegedly made it possible to save more than $2.4bn in US taxes over a decade.

In 1990, the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] seized most of the assets of [[Willie Nelson]], claiming he owed $32 million in back taxes, including penalties and interest.

===American International Group Inc.===
In 2005 ''BusinessWeek'' reported that PwC was [[American International Group]] Inc.'s auditor through AIG's years of "questionable dealings" and accounting improprieties. AIG on 30 March 2005 said that deals with a [[Barbados]]-based insurance company, for instance, may have been incorrectly accounted for over the past 14 years, because an AIG-affiliated company may have been secretly covering that insurer's losses.<ref name="businessweek">[https://web.archive.org/web/20050407205849/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_15/b3928047_mz011.htm Tough Questions For AIG's Auditors – Regulators are probing if PwC let the financial shenanigans slip through] Businessweek, Joseph Weber, Mike McNamee, Marcia Vickers and Diane Brady, 11 April 2005</ref> ''BusinessWeek'' said that PwC also appeared to have "dropped the ball" on the deals between AIG and [[Berkshire Hathaway]] Inc.'s General Re Corp. General Re transferred $500 million in anticipated claims and premiums to AIG. ''BusinessWeek'' asked: "Did the auditor do its job by verifying that AIG was assuming risk on claims beyond the $500 million, thus allowing AIG to account for the deal as insurance? That's Accounting 101 in any reinsurance transaction."<ref name="businessweek"/>

PwC was also criticised by several witnesses during the 2010 [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] investigation into AIG's collapse in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], after the insurer was unable to fulfil its collateral obligations to [[Goldman Sachs]]. The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the [[credit default swap]] contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however, the head of the unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by ''Business Insider'', witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/joe-cassano-on-goldman-aig-dispute-2016-3?r=US&IR=T|title=We just got a new insight into a crucial crisis-era dispute between Goldman Sachs and AIG|website=Business Insider|date=11 March 2016|access-date=2 June 2016}}</ref>

Shortly after the suspension of ChuoAoyama, PwC acted quickly to stem any possible client attrition as a result of the scandal.

===Yukos prosecutions===
[[Yukos]] was a Russian oil and gas company that was the target of politically motivated prosecutions by Russian authorities. The company's assets were sold for alleged unpaid taxes and it was declared bankrupt. PwC's audits were the foundation for the firm's defense in a series of continuing trials against former chief executive, [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], and the former majority shareholder, [[Platon Lebedev]]. The Russian authorities then went after PwC. In March 2007 police raided PwC's Moscow offices, confiscating documents related to Yukos and charging and convicting PwC of failing to pay 243 million rubles, or $9.4 million, in taxes. PwC withdrew its Yukos audits and less than two weeks later authorities cleared PwC of any wrongdoing in regard to its audit.<ref name="Law 360: Russian Officials Clear PwC Of Fraud In Yukos Audit">{{cite web|last1=Zapata|first1=Ron|title=Russian Officials Clear PwC Of Fraud In Yukos Audit|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/29939/russian-officials-clear-pwc-of-fraud-in-yukos-audit|publisher=Law 360|access-date=11 May 2017|date=18 July 2007}}</ref><ref name="NYTimes: Russian court hands victory to PricewaterhouseCoopers in tax evasion case">{{cite news|last1=Elder|first1=Miriam|title=Russian court hands victory to PricewaterhouseCoopers in tax evasion case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-pwc.4.6595461.html|publisher=NYTimes|access-date=11 May 2017|date=10 July 2007}}</ref>

A cable from the U.S. embassy in Moscow stated that the trial was politically motivated and that a deposition in a U.S. court by PricewaterhouseCoopers may show that PwC was pressured by the Russian government to withdraw its prior Yukos audits.

===JP Morgan Securities audit===
In 2012, the Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board (AADB) of the UK fined PwC a record £1.4m for wrongly reporting to the Financial Services Authority that JP Morgan Securities had complied with client money rules which protects client funds. The accountants neglected to check whether JP Morgan had the correct systems in place and failed to gather sufficient evidence to form opinions on the issue, and as a result, failed to report that JP Morgan failed to hold client money separate from JP Morgan's money. The £1.4m fine was at the time the greatest penalty administered to a professional accountancy firm in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/8995981/PwC-fined-record-1.4m-over-JP-Morgan-audit.html |title=PwC fined record £1.4m over JP Morgan audit |date=5 January 2012 |author=Anna White |work=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref>

===Water privatisation in Delhi===
PwC was found to be unethically favored by the [[World Bank]] in a bid to privatize the water distribution system of [[Delhi]], India, an effort that was alleged as corrupt by investigators.<ref name="MoneyLife">{{cite web|url=http://www.moneylife.in/article/rti-expose-of-how-world-bank-had-arm-twisted-delhi-jal-board-for-water-privatisation/23217.html|title=RTI expose of how World Bank had arm-twisted Delhi Jal Board for water privatisation |work=Moneylife}}</ref> When bidding took place, PwC repeatedly failed in each round, and the World Bank in each case pressured PwC to be pushed to the next round and eventually win the bid. The effort at privatization fell through when an investigation was conducted by [[Arvind Kejriwal]] and the non-governmental organization (NGO) [[Arvind Kejriwal#Parivartan|Parivartan]] in 2005.<ref name="MoneyLife" /> After submitting a [[Right to Information]] (RTI) request, Parivartan received 9000 pages of correspondence and consultation with the World Bank, where it was revealed that the privatization of Delhi's water supply would provide salaries of $25,000 a month to four administrators of each of the 21 water zones, which amounted to over $25 million per year, increasing the budget by over 60% and water taxes 9 times.<ref name="World Bank Tribunal">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbanktribunal.org/Delhi_privatisation.html|title=Independent People's Tribunal on The World Bank in India: Program: Arvind Kejriwal|work=worldbanktribunal.org}}</ref><ref name="Youtube">{{YouTube|-tqaLMOgPH0|''How World-Bank Dicatates Indian Policies''}}. BharatKiAwaaz.</ref>

The [[Delhi Jal Board]] (DJB), which administers the water system of Delhi, was first approached by Parivartan in November 2004, following a report by the newspaper ''[[The Asian Age]]'', where the scheme was revealed to the public for the first time.<ref name="World Bank Tribunal" /><ref name="Youtube" /> The DJB denied the existence of the project, but after an appeal, the RTI request was granted. The documents revealed that the project began in 1998, in complete secrecy within the DJB administration.<ref name="World Bank Tribunal" /><ref name="Youtube" /> The DJB approached the World Bank for a loan to improve the water system, which it approved, and the effort began with a $2.5 million consultation loan. The Delhi government could have easily provided the money, and the interest rate of 12% that was to be loaned by the World Bank could have been raised on capital markets for 6%.<ref name="World Bank Tribunal" /><ref name="Youtube" /> Following the consultation, 35 multi-national companies bid, of which six were to be shortlisted. When PwC was in 10th place, the World Bank said that at least one company should be from a developing country, and since PwC made the bid from its [[Kolkata]] office, it was dubbed an "Indian" company, and its rank was raised to 6th.<ref name="MoneyLife" /> When PwC failed in the second round, the World Bank pressured the DJB to start over with a fresh round of bidding. Only one company succeeded in the new round that was not PwC, and the World Bank had the lowest marks from an evaluator thrown out. The contract was awarded to PwC in 2001.<ref name="Commonwealth">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/programs/ai/rti/india/states/delhi/rti_spurs_debate_on_world_bank_delhi_water_project.pdf |title=RTI Spurs Debate on World Bank Involvement in Delhi Water Deal |publisher=Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative}}</ref> Following the investigation by Parivartan, a campaign was waged by Kejriwal, [[Aruna Roy]], and other activists across Delhi and the DJB withdrew the loan application to the World Bank.<ref name="MoneyLife" /><ref name="World Bank Tribunal" /><ref name="Youtube" />

===Cattles===
In 2013 [[Cattles]] plc brought a legal action against PwC in the UK in respect of 2006 and 2007 audits, claiming that PwC had failed to carry out adequate investigations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://economia.icaew.com/news/march-2013/pwc-failed-as-competent-auditor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106005043/http://economia.icaew.com/news/march-2013/pwc-failed-as-competent-auditor |title=PwC failed as 'competent auditor', says Cattles |work=Economia |first=Raymond |last=Doherty|date=5 March 2013 |archivedate=6 November 2013}}</ref> Cattles, a UK consumer finance company, later discovered control weaknesses which caused its loan book to be materially overstated in its balance sheet; having been listed as a FTSE250 company, it subsequently lost its listing.

The [[Financial Reporting Council]] (FRC) issued a fine of £2.3m on PwC and ordered the firm to pay £750,000 costs following their investigation of the 2007 audits of Cattles and its principal trading subsidiary.  PwC admitted their “conduct fell significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of a member firm” in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC said that PwC had insufficient audit evidence as to the adequacy of loan loss provisions.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/31/pwc-fined-over-auditing-of-subprime-lender-cattles PwC fined £2.3m over auditing of subprime lender Cattles] The Guardian 31 August 2016</ref>

===Luxembourg Leaks===
{{Main|Luxembourg Leaks}}
[[File:Tax ruling luxembourg.png|thumb|One of the tax rulings of ''Luxembourg Leaks'' negotiated by PwC]]
The firm helped multinational companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provided written assurance that the multinational companies' tax-saving plans would be seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved billions of dollars in taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/your-head-spinning-5-tips-understand-lux-leaks-files|title=Is Your Head Spinning? 5 Tips to Understand the 'Lux Leaks' Files|work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|access-date=10 May 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>ICIJ [http://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/explore-documents-luxembourg-leaks-database Explore the Documents: Luxembourg Leaks Database]</ref> In 2013 and 2014, PwC UK's head of tax was called before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes.

The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. In 2016 PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy, and they were convicted and sentenced with suspended prison sentences and fined. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld the convictions of the two whistleblowers, but with reduced sentences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/luxleaks-whistleblowers-get-lighter-sentences/|title=LuxLeaks whistleblowers get lighter sentences|last=Ariès|first=Quentin|date=15 March 2017|website=Politico|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref>
