'''Sky Sports''' is a group of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[broadcasting of sports events|subscription television sports channels]] operated by the [[satellite television|satellite]] [[pay television|pay-TV]] company [[Sky Group|Sky]], a division of [[Comcast]]. Sky Sports is the dominant subscription television sports brand in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It has played a major role in the increased commercialisation of British sport since 1991, sometimes playing a large role in inducing organisational changes in the sports it broadcasts, most notably when it encouraged the [[Premier League]] to break away from [[English Football League|the Football League]] in 1992.

Sky Sports Main Event, Premier League, Football, Cricket, Golf, F1, Action, and Arena are available as a premium package on top of the basic Sky package. These channels are also available as premium channels on nearly every satellite, cable and [[IPTV]] broadcasting system in the UK and Ireland. [[Sky Sports News]], [[Sky Sports Racing]], and Sky Sports Mix are all provided as part of basic packages. The Sky Sports network is managed by Rob Webster.

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of Sky Sports}}

===1989-1991: Predecessors===
[[British Satellite Broadcasting]] operated '''The Sports Channel''', which launched on 25 March 1990. In the BSB years, it shared the same frequency with its underpromoted sister channel, [[The Computer Channel (BSB)|The Computer Channel]], which broadcast in the mornings when the Sports Channel was off-air. On 2 November 1990, BSB merged with [[Sky Television (1984–1990)|Sky Television plc]] to form [[Sky UK|British Sky Broadcasting]].

In 1989, Sky Television had co-founded another sports network, [[Eurosport]], with the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. However in 1991, Eurosport was the subject of a complaint by a competitor, [[Screensport (TV channel)|Screensport]], who argued that the venture had the effect of restricting and distorting competition in the sports market.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991D0130:EN:NOT|title = EUR-Lex – 31991D0130 – EN|access-date = 25 February 2015|website = European Union}}</ref> and Sky pulled out of the venture. Later in 1991, the channel was sold to the [[TF1 Group]] and merged with Screensport.

===1991-1998: Beginnings===
The Sports Channel was renamed '''Sky Sports''' on 20 April 1991, and began broadcasting to Sky viewers via the newly launched [[Astra 1B]] satellite on that date, alongside its existing transmissions on BSB's [[Thor (satellite)|Marcopolo satellite]]. The channel was sold as one of the major draws of the Sky system and initially aired sports such as [[Rugby football|rugby]] and golf before acquiring rights to [[Fußball-Bundesliga|German]] and [[Serie A|Italian league]] football (both previously carried over from the Sports Channel). The channel was initially encrypted but broadcast free-to-view, requiring an analogue [[VideoCrypt]] decoder, but no paid subscription, to be viewed. Since VideoCrypt decoders were only officially available within the United Kingdom, this measure was intended to prevent viewing of the service outside the United Kingdom and Ireland.

However, it was following the formation of the [[Premier League]] for the 1992/93 football season, believed to have been assisted by the promise of higher television payments, that Sky Sports became well known. By bidding £304m, BSkyB beat the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] to acquire the live and exclusive Premier League [[association football|football]] broadcasting rights for the United Kingdom and Ireland for a five-year period. In doing so, they had taken live top-flight English league football from terrestrial and free-to-air television for the first time ever. At this point, on 1 September 1992, Sky Sports became a monthly subscription channel and was sold either on a standalone basis, or at a reduced price if taken with Sky's movie channels.

On 19 August 1994, a secondary channel called Sky Sports 2 was launched often used at weekends. On 1 November 1995, Sky launched a classic sports channel called Sky Sports Gold, however the channel ceased broadcasting after only a year on the air. On 16 August 1996, Sky launched Sky Sports 3, the original channel was renamed to Sky Sports 1. Sky Sports also acquired the rights to Scottish football and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]. On 1 September 1997, Sky Sports 2 became a full-time service.

===1998-2017: Digital era===
[[File:Sky Sports viewing figures.png|right|200px|thumb|Sky Sports share of viewing 2000–08]]
With the launch of the Sky Digital satellite platform on 1 October 1998, Sky Sports launched [[Sky Sports News]], a channel carrying rolling sports news coverage, followed by Sky Sports Xtra (later branded as Sky Sports 4 since 2010, then Sky Sports Golf since 2017) in August 1999.

During a Premier League match on 22 August 1999, Sky Sports launched an [[interactive television]] service known as [[Sky Sports Active]] via the digital platform, allowing viewers to watch matches with access to additional on-screen statistics, and a choice of alternate camera angles and replays. Sky expected to extend the interactive services to other sports the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/418668.stm|title='Play TV' on the way|website=BBC News|access-date=18 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/aug/13/newsstory.sport|title=Now armchair fans get to control what they watch|last=Chaudhary|first=Vivek|date=12 August 1999|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Sky Sports' football coverage was at the centre of controversy in January 2011 when footage emerged of presenters [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]] and [[Richard Keys]] making comments perceived as sexist. On 25 January 2011, Gray was sacked over the comments.<ref>[http://metro.co.uk/2011/01/25/andy-gray-sacked-after-charlotte-jackson-video-emerges-following-sian-massey-sexism-row-633036/ Andy Gray sacked for offensive behaviour] Metro.co.uk, 25 January 2011</ref> On 25 January 2011, fellow reporter [[Andy Burton (TV presenter)|Andy Burton]] was suspended by Sky due to his involvement in the sexist comments made about a female assistant referee, [[Sian Massey]], which also involved Gray and Keys.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/25/sky-andy-burton-suspended-sian-massey|title=Sky reporter Andy Burton dropped in wake of Sian Massey comments|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=25 January 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> However, unlike Gray and Keys, Burton later returned to his regular duties at Sky.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9108625/Jamie-Carragher-1-Andy-Burton-0.html|title=Jamie Carragher 1 Andy Burton 0|work=Telegraph|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Om 29 July 2011, it was announced that Sky Sports had acquired rights to [[Formula One]] racing from 2012 through 2018, with the BBC to share free-to-air rights to roughly half of the events, and have highlights rights for the remainder.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/29/bbc-sky-share-f1-broadcast-rights|title=BBC and Sky to share F1 broadcast rights|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=29 July 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9550930.stm|title=BBC and Sky awarded rights in new Formula 1 deal|website=BBC Sport|language=en-GB|access-date=18 July 2017}}</ref> Sky subsequently announced that it would introduce a new channel dedicated specifically to its coverage, [[Sky Sports F1]], which would air practices, qualifying, and advert-free coverage of each race; the channel was made available at no extra charge to all Sky high-definition subscribers, regardless of whether they were a Sky Sports subscriber.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/25/sky-f1-channel-hd|title=Sky to launch F1 channel in HD|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=25 November 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Sky extended its contract in 2016, to last through 2024; beginning in 2019, Sky became the exclusive broadcaster of all F1 races excluding the British GP which will also be broadcast on the free to air [[Channel 4]] (who also hold highlights rights for all the races).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/23/sky-buys-exclusive-rights-to-all-formula-one|title=Sky buys exclusive rights to all Formula One|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|date=23 March 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

On 12 August 2014, Sky launched a new channel called Sky Sports 5, which would be dedicated primarily to European football, including [[UEFA European Championship]] qualifiers, [[La Liga]], [[Eredivisie]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rumsby |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10888216/Sky-Sports-to-launch-new-European-football-channel.html |title=Sky Sports to launch new European football channel |publisher=The Telegraph |date=10 June 2014 |access-date=10 June 2014}}</ref>

On 24 August 2016, Sky launched Sky Sports Mix, a new channel designed to offer a sampling of content from the full range of Sky Sports networks to those who are not subscribers. On Sky, the channel is included as a basic channel with all plans, and was also available on certain Virgin Media packages on-launch.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/sky-sports-to-launch-new-channel-which-will-offer-free-premier-league-matches-34552857.html|title=Sky Sports to launch new channel which will offer free Premier League matches|work=The Independent|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/more-sports/news/12040/10543289/new-channel-sky-sports-mix-to-launch-on-wednesday|title=New channel Sky Sports Mix launches today|work=Sky Sports|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

On 18 July 2017, Sky re-aligned its sports channels, dropping the numbered services in favour of dedicated channels devoted to their core sports properties, including cricket, Formula One, golf, and two football channels (with one specifically dedicated to the Premier League), and three channels dedicated to general sports coverage.<ref name="pocketlint-newsky">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/141570-10-new-sky-sports-channels-explained-what-they-are-and-how-to-get-them|title=10 new Sky Sports channels explained: What they are and how to get them|website=Pocket-lint|language=en|access-date=18 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="guardian-newsky17"/> In addition, Sky announced that it would revise the pricing structure of the channels to make them more attractive to viewers; Sky customers can purchase up to three of the channels on an ''[[a la carte pay television|a la carte]]'' basis, or the entire bundle.

The American [[NBC Sports]] division became a sibling of Sky Sports following [[Comcast]]'s acquisition of Sky plc. On 29 January 2019, Sky and sister American pay television network [[NBCSN]] partnered on coverage of the [[transfer deadline]] (NBC holds the [[Premier League on NBC|Premier League rights in America]]), and the network later announced that it would add an hour-long simulcast of the Sky Sports News channel to its weekday morning lineup beginning 4 March.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/nbc/first-nbc-sky-collaboration-since-comcast-bought-sky-is-premier-league-transfer-deadline-coverage.html|title=First major NBC-Sky collaboration is for extra Premier League transfer deadline coverage|date=29 January 2019|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/nbc/nbcsn-will-replace-the-dan-patrick-show-with-a-pft-live-replay-and-an-hour-of-sky-sports-news.html|title=NBCSN will replace the Dan Patrick Show with a PFT Live replay and an hour of Sky Sports News|date=26 February 2019|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref> For the PGA Tour's [[2019 Players Championship]], Sky Sports Golf trialled similar synergies with its new sister [[Golf Channel]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/pga-players-championship-simulcast-nbc-sky-sports|title=The Players Championship to be simulcast on NBC Sports and Sky Sports|website=SportsPro|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref> For the [[2019–20 Premier League|2019–20 season]], NBC began more extensive on-air integration of Sky Sports resources into its American coverage of the premiership, including adding Sky's studio programmes to its "Premier League Pass" subscription service, adoption of on-air presentation reminiscent of Sky, and originating coverage from Sky's studio during the opening weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldsoccertalk.com/2019/08/09/nbc-embarks-tighter-relationship-sky-sports-enhance-premier-league-coverage/|title=NBC embarks on tighter relationship with Sky Sports to enhance Premier League coverage|last=Harris|first=Christopher|date=2019-08-09|website=World Soccer Talk|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/nbc/nbcs-premier-league-pass-now-includes-some-sky-programming-other-shoulder-coverage.html|title=NBC's Premier League Pass now includes some Sky programming, other shoulder coverage|date=2019-07-09|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>

=== Sky Sports Racing ===
{{Main|Sky Sports Racing}}
'''Sky Sports Racing''' is the only Sky Sports channel not wholly owned by Sky, although Sky purchased majority control of it in 2017. The channel was founded in 2000 as '''At The Races''' by the Go Racing consortium, a partnership of Channel 4, Sky and Arena Leisure plc (owner of [[Ascot Racecourse]], and acting on behalf of a further 27 out of the 59 UK racecourses) in July 2004. Following its high-profile collapse (and Channel 4 removing itself from the consortium) the channel – now purely a joint venture between Sky plc and Arena Leisure – focuses on [[horse racing]] from the UK, Ireland, North America and Germany, showing many live races and related shows. The station is "affiliated" with various [[betting]] companies, since gamblers are generally the sport's main audience, and its pictures, provided by satellite link provider [[Satellite Information Services|SIS]], are also commercially distributed to betting shops across the country.

On 1 January 2019, At The Races relaunched as '''Sky Sports Racing'''; the relaunch includes wider availability and heavier integration with the remaining Sky Sports channels, the relocation of production facilities to [[Sky Campus]] in Isleworth from their former base at SIS's facilities in Milton Keynes, and availability in high definition. The network also acquired rights to fixtures from the Ascot Racecourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/30/at-the-races-channel-relaunch-sky-sports-racing-start-of-2019-horse-racing|title=Sky Sports Racing has plenty going for it in two-horse race with Racing UK|last=Wood|first=Greg|date=30 April 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=7 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sky launches racing channel in rebranding of At The Races |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/racing/2018/04/30/chester-bangor-switch-sky-racing-rebranding/ |website=The Telegraph |access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mann |first1=Colin |title=Sky Sports Racing: Jan 1st Starter's Orders |url=https://advanced-television.com/2018/12/06/sky-sports-racing-jan-1st-starters-orders/ |website=advanced-television.com |access-date=16 December 2018 |date=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Imi |first1=Matthew |title=Sky Sports Racing will deliver new prospects for horseracing |url=https://www.sbcnews.co.uk/europe/2018/12/06/matthew-imi-sky-sports-racing-will-deliver-new-prospects-for-horseracing/ |website=SBC News |access-date=16 December 2018 |date=6 December 2018}}</ref>

The channel was called ''Premiership Plus'' from 2001 to 2004, before being shortened to the later PremPlus for the beginning of the 2004–05 season. PremPlus closed down after the last match of the 2006–07 season after [[Setanta Sports]] obtained a third of the Premier League rights for 2007–10 This left Sky with only 92 live matches, meaning a Pay-Per-View service was unsustainable.

==== 4K broadcasting tests ====
It was widely reported that Sky used the West Ham United v Stoke City Premier League game on 31 August 2013 as an internal production test for broadcasting 4K / Ultra HD picture.

In the "Sky Views Blog", Barney Francis, managing director Sky Sports stated that, although it was only viewed internally, the test has been key in helping Sky evaluate whether it will start broadcasting in 4K.

"We saw enough in this test event to know that live sport in UHD has real potential. The broadcast also demonstrated the capability of our satellite platform, which is ideally placed to continue supporting high-bandwidth video."

"That said, we've still much more to learn, particularly about how to make full use of UHD from a live production perspective."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.sky.com/story/1135574/ultra-high-definition-tv-coming-soon|title = Ultra High Definition TV Coming Soon|date = 1 September 2013|access-date = 18 February 2015|website = Sky News|last = Stanford|first = Martin}}</ref>

=== Cricket ===
Sky was the first broadcaster to show live coverage of a complete overseas tour involving [[England cricket team|England]] when they toured the [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] in 1990. This was originally shown on Sky One. Since then Sky has acquired the rights to show home international series involving England, [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] and [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] at various times as well as showing almost every England overseas tour and ICC tournaments such as the [[Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] and [[ICC T20 World Cup|T20 World Cup]]. Sky also shows extensive coverage of [[county cricket]], with over 60 live games each season involving every county in all competitions. The [[Kia Super League]] was added to Sky's coverage of Women's cricket in 2018, earning rights to show 12 matches per season. In 2018 Sky Sports won the rights off [[BT Sport]] to broadcast all 34 games of the [[Caribbean Premier League]] from the 2018 season which continued into the 2019 and 2020 seasons. In 2015 Sky Sports won exclusive UK rights to broadcast the [[Indian Premier League]] for 3 years taking the rights from then broadcaster, [[ITV4]] and in 2018, these rights were renewed on a multi-year deal. [[Star Sports (Indian TV network)|Star Sports]], the global distributor of IPL coverage then unexpectedly cut their contract for the [[2019 Indian Premier League|2019 season]], however, these rights were reinstated from the [[2020 Indian Premier League|2020]] season onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/11932371/ipl-returns-to-sky-sports-in-2020-as-part-of-a-three-year-contract|title= IPL returns to Sky Sports in 2020 as part of a three-year contract|date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

Sky Sports first started broadcasting Home England Tests in 1999. In a joint deal with terrestrial broadcaster Channel 4, it began showing 1 home Test each summer plus one-day internationals (Channel 4 were the senior broadcast partner). This arrangement continued until 2006, when Sky Sports' flagship live coverage of England's home test series began. The previous year, it was announced by the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] that it had awarded Sky exclusive coverage of all of England's home tests, one-day internationals and Twenty20 Internationals including the [[2009 Ashes]] with highlights on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] produced by Sunset & Vine who produced Channel 4's coverage. The ECB have since renewed Sky Sports' deal until 2024 with BBC taking over the rights held by Channel 5 and picking up additional rights.<ref name="Sky plc">{{cite web|title=Sky Sports and ECB agree landmark partnership for England Cricket|url=http://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/10932229/sky-sports-and-ecb-agree-landmark-partnership-for-england-cricket|website=Sky Sports|publisher=Sky plc}}</ref> The Fifth Test vs India at the Oval, (commencing 15 August 2014) was the 200th England Test shown live on Sky Sports.

Along with Sky's team, a guest commentator from the touring side also contributes to the coverage such as former internationals [[Ian Bishop (cricketer)|Ian Bishop]] (West Indies), [[Ricky Ponting]] (Australia), [[Wasim Akram]] (Pakistan), [[Shaun Pollock]] (South Africa) or [[Harbhajan Singh]] (India). Highlights are broadcast in a prime time slot each evening.

For coverage of the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]], only matches involving [[England cricket team|England]] and the semi-finals and final had a presentation team from Sky Sports with all other games taking the world feed presentation. Ian Ward hosted these games for Sky Sports alongside Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton, Shane Warne, Andrew Strauss and Rob Key. Games not involving [[England cricket team|England]] had out-of-vision continuity provided by Mark Butcher or Dominic Cork. Commentary on all games was provided by the world feed.

"The Cricket Debate" (formerly called "The Verdict") is shown every evening in a prime time slot after every England test match day. Up until the [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2019–20|2019 English cricket season]] the show was presented by the iconic cricket broadcasting duo of [[Charles Colvile (commentator)|Charles Colvile]] alongside [[Bob Willis]]. From [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2019-20|England’s tour of New Zealand in 2019]] onwards, Colvile presented alongside a variety of other Sky Sports pundits and guests as a result of Willis falling ill, which resulted in his death.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/11878027/bob-willis-ex-england-captain-and-sky-sports-cricket-expert-dies-aged-70|title= Bob Willis, ex-England captain and Sky Sports Cricket expert, dies aged 70|date=4 Dec 2019}}</ref>

=== Rugby union ===

In 2014, Sky Sports extended their already long-term deal with the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] to continue showing [[England national rugby union team|England]] Internationals (outside of the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]]) exclusively live up until the end of the 2019–20 season. This includes their autumn test matches at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] and their annual Spring fixture.

Lead commentators include [[Miles Harrison]], Rupert Cox, Johnnie Hammond and [[Martin Gillingham]].

=== Rugby league ===
The power of television over sport can perhaps be best portrayed by the change of [[rugby league]] from a winter sport to one played during the summer months under the banner of Super League. These changes caused great controversy when they were introduced in 1996, yet they have been seen as positive and as having an impact even greater than the broadcaster has had with football.

The sport is now seen as being in a healthy state with two or three live matches from the Super League every week fronted by [[Brian Carney (rugby)|Brian Carney]] who is joined in the studio by [[Terry O'Connor (rugby league)|Terry O'Connor]], [[Phil Clarke]], [[Barrie McDermott]] or [[Stuart Cummings]]. [[Jon Wells]] provides analysis from the touchscreen regularly. Bill Arthur, Ben Proe or [[Stuart Pyke]] lead the commentary team alongside the summarisers, Terry O'Connor, Phil Clarke, Jon Wells, Barrie McDermott and Jodie Cunningham. Jenna Brooks and Fraiser Dainton are the pitch-side reporters.

Live Super League broadcasts routinely rank amongst the top 10 most watched programmes in a week on Sky Sports. Sky has sold rights to a highlights package of the Super League to [[BBC Sport]], who air ''The [[Super League Show]]'' on Sunday nights/Afternoon in Northern regions, with a nationwide replay on Monday afternoon.

Beginning in 2012, Sky Sports airs [[Challenge Cup]] matches alongside the BBC: usually, they will air one match in the fourth and fifth rounds and two of the quarter-finals with highlights of the Semi-Finals and Finals which are exclusively live on the BBC.

The joint broadcast rights were held by BBC but transferred to Channel 4 from the {{F1|2016}} season. The shared nature of the contract initially meant that [[Sky Sports F1]] showed all races live, with 10 races being shown by both Sky and Channel 4 (who were also televising highlights of all races on a delayed basis).,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/sporteditors/2011/07/f1_coverage_to_be_shared_betwe.html|title=New F1 deal explained|first=Ben|last=Gallop|date=29 July 2011|access-date=31 July 2011|work=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref name="Channel 4 to show f1">{{cite web|title=Channel 4 becomes terrestrial home of formula 1|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-becomes-terrestrial-home-of-formula-1?hootPostID=dde274dfb372ab4d0ede906f68a35e34|website=Channel 4|publisher=Channel 4 Television Corporation|access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref> however since the start of the 2019 season, sky have had exclusive rights to broadcast every race live except the British GP, which is both live on Sky and Channel 4, however channel 4 still show highlights of both qualifying and the race from every other GP.

=== Darts ===
Sky Sports covered some BDO tournaments during its inception, including the 1992 Winmau World Masters, which was previously broadcast on ITV. Since the creation of the World Darts Council in 1992, since renamed the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC), formed when many of the leading [[darts]] players, including [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]], [[Eric Bristow]], [[John Lowe]] and [[Dennis Priestley]], [[split in darts|broke away]] from the [[British Darts Organisation]] (BDO), the game's then sole ruling body, Sky Sports has broadcast the new organisation's main darts tournaments live, which currently includes the following. Between 1993 and 2007 Sky were the only regular UK broadcaster of PDC Darts (apart from the 1999 BDO v PDC showdown between Phil Taylor and [[Raymond van Barneveld]] which was broadcast on ITV). However this changed in 2007 when ITV covered the PDC/BDO tournament the [[Grand Slam of Darts]], this moved to Sky in 2011 however ITV continued to show the European Championship and Players Championship Finals, their coverage expanded in 2014 to cover the UK Open and the Masters.

=== Boxing ===
[[Eddie Hearn]]'s [[Matchroom Sport]] enjoys an exclusive television deal with Sky Sports through 2021 and provides Sky Sports with upwards of 20 boxing events per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12040/9858554/sky-sports-and-matchroom-extend-their-exclusive-boxing-deal-to-2021|title=Sky Sports and Matchroom extend their exclusive boxing deal to 2021}}</ref> Some of the coverage is shown on a pay-per-view basis via [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]]. [[Anna Woolhouse]] is the lead presenter, alongside former boxers, [[Johnny Nelson]], [[Spencer Oliver (boxer)|Spencer Oliver]], [[Paulie Malignaggi]], [[Carl Froch]] and [[Tony Bellew]], with also the likes of [[Paul Smith (boxer)|Paul Smith]] and [[Matthew Macklin]].

On larger pay-per view events, Tony Bellew, Paulie Malignaggi or [[David Haye]] join the commentary team. Andy Clarke and Matthew Macklin commentate on undercard action. The reporter and post-fight interviewer is Andy Scott.

In April 2019, Sky Sports aired nine fights of the [[World Boxing Super Series]] (WBSS) in the 2018–19 season, starting with the semi-final world title bouts between [[bantamweight]]s [[Nonito Donaire]] and Stephon Young followed by [[super-lightweight]]s [[Regis Prograis]] and [[Kiryl Relikh]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=25 April 2019|title=LONG READ: Sauerland strikes back|url=http://www.boxingmonthly.com/stories/long-read-sauerland-strikes-back/|access-date=29 July 2020|website=Boxing Monthly|language=en-GB}}</ref> and ending in November with the bantamweight final between Nonito Donaire and [[Naoya Inoue]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 November 2019|title=Sky Sports and DAZN will televise Inoue vs Donaire WBSS Final|url=https://www.worldboxingnews.net/2019/11/05/sky-sports-inoue-donaire/|access-date=29 July 2020|website=World Boxing News}}</ref>

Previously, the event had been aired on [[ITV Box Office]] in the 2017–18 season but [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] did not renew the contract for the following season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== Mixed Martial Arts ===

In February 2019, Sky Sports announced a deal with [[Bellator MMA]] to broadcast [[mixed martial arts]] events.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/more-sports/other-sports/news/29877/11631366/sky-sports-to-show-bellator-mma}}</ref>

=== Gaelic Games ===
On 2 April 2014, Sky Sports signed a deal with the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) to broadcast fixtures from both the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2014/0401/606028-gaa-rights-deal/|title=RTÉ & Sky secure GAA rights, RTÉ in worldwide deal|date=2 April 2014|access-date=2 April 2014|work=RTÉ}}</ref> The deal gave Sky Sports 20 championship matches across both sports, including both semi-finals and both All-Ireland Finals. Sky would have exclusive rights in both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and the UK to 14 of these matches, with the remaining six matches being simultaneously broadcast by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] in the Republic of Ireland. The deal covered the years, 2014 to 2016. It was estimated that the GAA would make €0.5&nbsp;million from the deal. The deal led to debate in Ireland, with many loyal fans being unable to watch some key games during the All-Ireland season. The debate was reignited, with [[Michael Duignan]] stating publicly on RTÉ: "The biggest disgrace of the weekend was on Saturday evening, that [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] and [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] (Round 2 [[hurling]] match) wasn't shown free-to-air in this country", a statement which resounded with many GAA fans across Ireland and gained much public sympathy, bringing further into question the continuation of the Sky GAA deal in the long term.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://historyhub.ie/sports-rights-commercialization-revisited-sky-and-the-gaa|title=Sports Rights Commercialization Revisited: Sky and the GAA – History Hub|newspaper=History Hub|language=en-US|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> On the other hand, the GAA was unlikely to receive the same amount of money from RTE as it got from Sky, especially given RTE's increasing emphasis on soccer.

== Previous coverage ==

=== Football ===

====Premier League====

Between the 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons, Sky Sports broadcast a 3&nbsp;pm Saturday match exclusively for subscribers in the Republic of Ireland. The coverage went out under the ''Premier League Live'' banner and was anchored by the match commentators. The rights for these games were taken over by [[Premier Sports]] for the 2019–20 season onwards.

====UEFA Champions League====

Sky Sports covered the UEFA Champions League between 2003 and 2015 but in 2013 Sky was outbid by BT Sport and the rights transferred at the end of the 2014/15 tournament,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24879138 |title=Champions League: BT Sport win £897m football rights deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 November 2013 |access-date=9 November 2013}}</ref> with highlights on ITV Sport.  Since 2018 until at least 2021, however, BT Sport have also acquired the rights to the highlights to the Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League]].

====FA Cup and FA Community Shield====

Sky Sports covered the [[FA Cup]] since it first went on air as BSB's Sports Channel in 1990 alongside the BBC but has not broadcast the FA Cup since 2008 after both broadcasters were outbid by ITV and Setanta. After the collapse of Setanta, Sky did not bid for the rights so they went to ESPN UK. In 2014–15 the rights transferred from ITV and ESPN to BBC and BT Sport after bidding together. From 2020, ITV won the rights back off BT Sport meaning live coverage of all FA Cup games is on free-to-air television with BBC and ITV sharing the rights.

Sky Sports had been the first channel to show the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] live and as with the FA Cup, Sky has not broadcast this event since 2011 after rights transferred to ITV and then BT Sport, then later back to ITV.

====England National Football Team====

One of Sky's first major live football rights deal was exclusive live coverage of the [[England national football team|England football team]] and held these rights throughout the 1990s. The live rights transferred to BBC Sport in 2001 until 2008, and currently remain free to air with ITV owning the rights.

Sky Sports currently still provide coverage of England matches, however not nearly on the same scale as in the 1990s.  They are limited to just [[UEFA Nations League]] and mid-season international friendlies which, thanks to the aforementioned UEFA Nations League competition, have not occurred as often as they once did.

==== La Liga ====

Sky Sports was the long-time home of [[La Liga]], the top-tier of Spanish domestic football, having broadcast the competition for 20 years. From the 2018-19 season, the rights to broadcast La Liga were won by [[Eleven Sports Network UK|Eleven Sports]], then subsequently Premier Sports. During Sky Sports' tenure as La Liga broadcaster, live matches were broadcast on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday nights. Towards the end of the contract, Sky Sports broadcast up to 10 live matches each round with the coverage handled by the commentators who included Rob Palmer, Kevin Keatings, Jon Driscoll and Dominic Johnson. They would usually be joined by summarisers, [[Gerry Armstrong (footballer)|Gerry Armstrong]], [[Terry Gibson]], David Phillips, Garry Birtles and Efan Ekoku. Highlights and weekly review of La Liga, were shown on Revista de La Liga, presented by the Spanish football expert [[Guillem Balagué]].

==== Eredivisie ====
In 2014, Sky Sports signed an exclusive 4-year deal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isportconnect.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27269:sky-sports-reveal-new-eredivisie-rights-deal-with-launch-of-new-channel&catid=10:media--broadcasting&Itemid=20|title=Sky Sports Reveal New Eredivisie Rights Deal with Launch of New Channel|last=Desk|first=iSportconnect News|website=www.isportconnect.com}}</ref> to show live matches from the Dutch top-flight league Eredivisie. The commentary was taken from the world feed provided by [[IMG (company)|IMG]] Worldwide. Starting with the 2018-19 season, live and exclusive rights were won by Eleven Sports.<ref name="auto1"/>

=== Rugby union ===

Sky Sports was the first channel to show live rugby union every week when it picked up the rights to show the [[Aviva Premiership|top division of England club rugby]] in the mid 1990s. The rights transferred to ESPN in 2009 and the league is now covered by BT Sport. Sky Sports also covered England matches from the 5/6 nations from 1997 to 2002 as well as France v England with all other matches being live on the BBC, the rights were sold to the BBC in 2003 and they covered every match live from the Six Nations until 2015 when BBC and ITV teamed up to keep the rights free to air after the BBC were outbid by Sky Sports with BBC covering France, Wales & Scotland home matches and ITV covering England, Ireland & Italy.

In 2003, Sky Sports began its coverage of the [[Heineken Cup]], when it outbid the previous rights holder [[BBC Sport]] with its offer of £20&nbsp;million for 3 years. Coverage of 10 matches each pool weekend and all knockout matches from the Heineken Cup was the norm. Additionally, up to three matches per round in the Amlin Challenge Cup were usually shown. Following the demise of the Heineken Cup, Sky Sports shared the rights to the newly formed [[Rugby Champions Cup]] with BT Sport, until the 2017–18 season. Sky exclusively broadcast up to 30 pool matches, 2 quarter-finals and 1 semi-final from each competition with the finals being shown by both. Sky also received first pick on Challenge Cup matches involving Premiership Rugby clubs. From the 2018-19 season, Sky Sports no longer have the shared rights to the Champions Cup, these passed to Channel 4 and so did the contracts to cover [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland's]] Autumn Internationals after 2018.

Commencing from the 2014–15 season, Sky Sports began showing games from the [[Pro14]] (covering 30 matches alongside the current terrestrial broadcasters BBC Wales, S4C, [[TG4]], BBC NI and BBC Alba). From 2018, Premier Sports broadcast all 152 games live.

===Rugby league===

Until 2012, Sky aired [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[Northern Rail Cup]] games on Thursdays and Sundays, until the rights for these were purchased by Premier Sports.

Sky also held the rights to show the majority of the matches from the [[Rugby League Four Nations|Four Nations]] and the previous competition the Tri Nations live, with the other games being shown live or in highlights form on BBC Sport and Sky Sports previously showed the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup|2008 World Cup]] exclusively live with only highlights on the BBC. This agreement ended in 2012 and Sky Sports surprisingly lost the rights to International Rugby League from the 2013 Rugby League World Cup to the BBC and Premier Sports. The matches for the 2013 and 2017 Rugby League World Cup were shared between the BBC and Premier Sports with BBC covering all England matches, Wales v Italy, One Quarter Final, One Semi-final and the Final in 2013. The BBC and Premier Sports had also signed a deal to cover the 2014 and 2016 Four Nations.

=== Tennis ===
For nearly 25 years, Sky Sports was the main broadcaster of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] until 2015 but decided not to renew its contract to broadcast this event in 2016. Sky also previously covered Davis Cup tennis but these rights moved to the BBC and Eurosport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/07/sky-sports-us-open-tennis-premier-league-formula-one-open-golf |title=Sky Sports drops US Open tennis after 25 years |publisher=The Guardian |date=7 July 2016 |access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref> Sky was the broadcaster of ATP Tour events from 2002 until 2018, when [[Amazon Prime Video]] became the exclusive UK broadcaster.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/news/watch-atp-tour-tennis-11532491|title=Amazon Prime Video snatches coverage of ATP Tour tennis from Sky|last=insider.co.uk|date=6 June 2018|work=businessInsider|access-date=24 November 2018}}</ref> The Sky Sports tennis coverage was presented by Marcus Buckland with pundits, [[Annabel Croft]], [[Greg Rusedski]] and [[Peter Fleming (tennis)|Peter Fleming]]. Commentators included, Barry Millns, [[Leif Shiras]], [[Mark Petchey]] and [[Barry Cowan (tennis)|Barry Cowan]].

=== Ice hockey ===
In 2006, Sky Sports began showing a replay from a match in the [[Elite Ice Hockey League]] every week. Due to large audience numbers, even though it is normally on Sky Sports 4, they decided to show a live game for the first time in several years when they showed the play-off finals in 2010. A new deal was signed for the 2010/11 season in which Sky agreed to show eight live games throughout the season and a weekly highlights show. However, the broadcast rights have since moved to Premier Sports.

=== WWE ===
In 1989, Sky acquired the rights to [[WWE]]. Sky Sports Arena was considered the home of WWE programming on Sky, as the majority of the programmes were shown on it.

Part of the deal with Sky stated that major PPV's such as [[WrestleMania]], [[Survivor Series]], the [[Royal Rumble]] and [[SummerSlam]] were part of the Sky Sports Box Office pay-per-view service, and that ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'s'' first broadcast moved from [[Sky One]] to Sky Sports. As part of the deal, ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' was shown live on Sky Sports Arena early Tuesday morning because of the time difference. ''SmackDown!'' was broadcast live early Wednesday morning for the same reason.

Sky also broadcast WWE's third brand, ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW on Sci Fi]]'' before it was cancelled. For a couple of months it replaced ''[[WWE Velocity]]'' on Sunday mornings. It was shown two nights after the US broadcast after a viewer complained to [[Ofcom]] in August 2006 about an image in the opening credits, and Sky agreed to air the program after the [[Watershed (television)#United Kingdom|watershed]].

The deal of 14 Pay-Per-Views did not account for WWE's extra pay-per-views which have been added subsequently, and therefore [[WWE Cyber Sunday]] would not have been picked up by Sky. However, a last-minute deal was struck between Sky and WWE, that allowed the PPV to be shown live on Sky Sports 1.<ref>[http://www1.skysports.com/news-wire/ Sky to show 2 major WWE PPVs] Sky Sports, 1 November 2006</ref>

The first WWE event to be shown in wide-screen (16:9) format on Sky Sports was [[WWE No Way Out|No Way Out]] on 18 February 2008 at 1&nbsp;am on Sky Sports 1. Although after this, other WWE programming were still in standard (4:3) format however due to complaints all WWE programming will now be airing in widescreen from a down-scaled HD feed.

When [[WWE Heat]] ended in June 2008, it was replaced with [[WWE Vintage Collection]], a programme which showcases classic archive matches from the extensive [[WWE Video Library]].

On 30 January 2014, Sky Sports announced they had signed another five-year deal with WWE. Sky will now continue to exclusively broadcast WWE's flagship shows in the UK and Ireland through to 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s216/wwe/news/a547640/wwe-signs-five-year-deal-with-sky-through-to-2019.html#~p5jKzXG2c5n2Xy|title = WWE signs five-year deal with Sky through to 2019|date = 30 January 2015|access-date = 25 February 2015|website = Digital Spy United Kingdom|last = Nissim|first = Mayer}}</ref>

WWE pay-per-views were previously shown on Sky Sports for free roughly every five months, with all remaining pay-per-views being broadcast on Sky Sports Box Office at an additional cost. However, as of 2015, all pay-per-views were broadcast on Sky Sports Box Office at a cost of £19.95.

On 20 June 2019, it was announced that WWE would be leaving Sky Sports after 30 years, with BT Sport taking over the rights from January 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport.bt.com/news/bt-sport-and-wwe-announce-exclusive-new-tv-partnership-in-multi-year-deal-S11364370135846 |title=BT Sport and WWE announce new partnership in multi-year TV deal |publisher=BT |date=20 June 2019 |access-date=22 June 2019}}</ref>
