The '''Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award''' is awarded periodically by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) at the [[Governors Awards]] ceremonies for an individual's "outstanding contributions to humanitarian causes". Prior to 2009, this award was presented during the main Oscars ceremony. The award category was instituted in 1956 and first awarded at the [[29th Academy Awards]], in March 1957. Unlike the Academy Award of Merit, the nomination and voting for this award are restricted to members of the Board of Governors of [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]].<ref name="Honorary Awards">{{cite web|title=Honorary Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=honoraryaward|accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref>
