[[File:Gal Gadot by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright|{{As of|2017}}, the Israeli actress [[Gal Gadot]] is the most recent winner of ''FHM''{{'s}} 100 Sexiest Women.|alt=Upper body colour photograph of Gal Gadot in 2016.]]
'''''FHM''{{'s}} 100 Sexiest Women''' is an annual listing compiled by the monthly British men's lifestyle magazine ''[[FHM]]'', based on which women they believe to be the "[[sexual attraction|sexiest]]". {{As of|2017}}, each year's list is first announced through a section on ''FHM''{{'s}} official website, [[FHM|FHM.com]]. The first listing was published in 1995 and was voted for by a panel of 250 judges. The inaugural winner was German supermodel [[Claudia Schiffer]]. From 1996 to 2015, the poll was instead voted for by the general public, with, at its height, several million votes being cast each year. Subsequent winners have included the British singer [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], the American actress [[Halle Berry]], and [[Jennifer Lopez]].{{#tag:ref|{{As of|2017}}, the only people to top the list more than once are [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]].<ref name=FHM/>|name="More than once"|group=nb}} At 36 years old, Berry was the oldest woman ever to top the listing, while Lopez was the first to top it more than once. By the time ''FHM'' ceased publication of its print edition in January 2016, the 100 Sexiest Women list had been compiled 21 times.<ref name=Daubney/> The current holder of the Sexiest Woman title is Israeli actress [[Gal Gadot]].

Alongside the 100 Sexiest Women list, ''FHM'' has also twice published a "Most Eligible Bachelorettes" list, in 2006 and 2007, to celebrate qualities such as "talent, star quality and cash".<ref name=Mischa/> These lists were topped by the American actress [[Mischa Barton]] and the American socialite [[Kimberly Stewart]], respectively. To commemorate the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the 100 Sexiest Women list, two [[:wiktionary:one-off#Adjective|one-off]] charts were compiled in April 2004 and May 2014, to recognise the sexiest women up to those points. The winner of the 2004 list was the English singer [[Louise Redknapp]], who had placed on every 100 Sexiest list since 1996, while the 2014 chart topper was the singer [[Rachel Stevens]], who had peaked at number two in 2001, 2002, and 2004.

==History==
The first 100 Sexiest Women list was published in 1995, and was compiled exclusively by a panel of 250 judges; German supermodel [[Claudia Schiffer]] topped the inaugural chart.<ref name="1995 Top 10"/> The following year's poll was the first to be opened up to the general public – a total of 10,000 votes were cast, with the American actress [[Gillian Anderson]] being announced as the winner that September. A spokesman for ''[[FHM]]'' described her as the "thinking man's crumpet" and a "surprise winner". Anderson had posed half-naked on the front cover of the magazine earlier that year.<ref name="1996 Top 10"/>

[[File:Gail Porter on Parliament.jpg|thumb|The 1999 "100 Sexiest Women" poll was launched by projecting a {{convert|60|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} naked image of [[Gail Porter]] onto the [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref name=Porter/>|alt=Colour photograph of a naked image of Gail Porter projected onto the Palace of Westminster in 1999]]

Over subsequent years, the list's popularity continued to grow. The 1998 poll was voted on by half a million readers, with its companion issue being sold sealed inside a plastic cover.<ref name=Sticky/> [[Martin Daubney]], a former features editor of ''FHM'', noted that this added a "sense of mystique and occasion" to the issue, which went on to sell 936,000 copies.<ref name=Documentary/> The issue's [[cover girl]] was British TV presenter [[Cat Deeley]], who had placed at number seven; the 100 Sexiest winner was ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Jenny McCarthy]].<ref name="1998 Top 10"/> The following year, ''FHM'' publicists promoted the poll by projecting a 60&nbsp;ft naked image of British TV presenter [[Gail Porter]] onto the front of the [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref name=Porter/> An ''FHM'' spokesman remarked: "We want to up the voting frenzy for the poll&nbsp;... It is a cheeky way of increasing interest."<ref name=Porter/> Porter was placed at number eight in the chart that year, while American actress [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] was number one.<ref name="1999 Top 10"/>

The first person to top the 100 Sexiest Women list more than once was American singer [[Jennifer Lopez]], who was placed at number one in both 2000 and 2001.<ref group=nb name="More than once"/> Speaking about being named the sexiest woman in the world for a second year running, Lopez said she was "overwhelmed", and added: "Any woman who says they don't like being called sexy, they're lying."<ref name=Tooze/> By 2002, the list was attracting over five million votes – that year, Russian tennis player [[Anna Kournikova]] was number one.<ref name=Age/> A further five million votes were cast the following year, when the American actress [[Halle Berry]] was named as the world's sexiest. At 36 years old, Berry was the oldest woman ever to top the list.<ref name=Metro/> She responded: "Wow, that's a pretty heady title. I'm not so sure I live up to it, but thank you anyway."<ref name="2003 Top 10"/> The first British woman to top the listing was the model [[Kelly Brook]], who was named the world's sexiest in 2005, the most successful poll to that point.<ref name=Brook/> {{As of|2017}}, Brook has been featured in the top ten of ''FHM''{{'s}} 100 Sexiest Women ten times, more than any other entrant.<ref name="2005 Top 10"/>

The 2011 list was noted for being the first to include a transgender woman. The androgynous model [[Andrej Pejić]] was voted at number 98 on the poll.<ref name=Peck/><ref name="2011 Top 10"/> ''FHM'' caused controversy when the entry's accompanying [[blurb]] warned its readers to "pass the sick bucket" and described Pejic as a "thing". Following a backlash, ''FHM'' removed the text from their website, spoke directly with Pejić and issued a public apology, saying that the online entry "wasn't subbed prior to going live".<ref name=Peck/> The final 100 Sexiest Women poll to be voted for by the public was published in 2015, before ''FHM'' went out of print in January the following year.<ref name=Wells/> The list included its oldest entrant ever, 80-year-old food writer [[Mary Berry]], who was placed at number 74,<ref name=Selby/> while the sexiest woman that year was British actress [[Michelle Keegan]].<ref name="2015 Top 10"/> Speaking in November 2015 as ''FHM'' suspended its print publication, a spokesman reflected that the poll was what the magazine was best known for, and that it had "helped propel the careers of many well-known actresses, musicians and models".<ref name=Bauer/><ref name=Sims/> Subsequent 100 Sexiest Women lists have been compiled by ''FHM''{{'s}} writers themselves, and have been published on FHM.com. {{As of|2017|12}}, the most recent winner is [[Gal Gadot]].<ref name="2017 Top 10"/>

==Most Eligible Bachelorettes==
Alongside the 100 Sexiest Women list, ''FHM'' also twice published a "Most Eligible Bachelorettes" list, which compiled women based on their "[[wiktionary:eligible#Adjective|eligibility]]" and was voted for by the magazine's readership.<ref name=West/> Unlike the 100 Sexiest Women list, this list also considered qualities such as "talent, star quality and cash" as well as [[sex appeal]] in its compilation.<ref name=Mischa/> Similar lists published by the US version of ''FHM'' had been topped by women such as the model [[Lauren Bush]] and the socialite [[Paris Hilton]].<ref name=Mischa/>

The 2006 list was voted for by more than 3,000 ''FHM'' readers, and was published in March of that year. It was topped by American actress [[Mischa Barton]].<ref name=West/> Speaking about the result, ''FHM'' editor Ross Brown remarked: "Our most eligible list consists of much more than just sex appeal and our readers recognise a good catch when they see one."<ref name=Eligible/> The following year, the Most Eligible Bachelorettes list was topped by the American socialite [[Kimberly Stewart]].<ref name=Noah/> The list received over 10,000 votes from ''FHM''{{'s}} readership, and was featured in the April 2007 issue of the magazine. An ''FHM'' spokesperson stated: "Kimberly Stewart has all the attributes you want in a woman. She's rich, gorgeous, likes to party, and she's the daughter of a legend."<ref name=Manchester/>

==Anniversary lists==
On two occasions, ''[[FHM]]'' has produced special lists to mark anniversaries of the 100 Sexiest Women chart. To commemorate the tenth edition of the poll in May 2004, ''FHM'' published a list ranking the 50 sexiest women of the previous ten years. The list was topped by the English singer [[Louise Redknapp]], who had placed on every 100 Sexiest list since 1996.<ref name=Decade/> Ten years later, in May 2014, ''FHM'' published a list of the "Sexiest Women of All Time", compiled using a new analysis based on the previous 20 years' worth of polls. The winner was the English singer [[Rachel Stevens]].<ref name=Wilson/> Stevens had been featured on 11 lists at that point, but had never been placed first on any of the annual lists, instead peaking at number two in 2001, 2002 and 2004.<ref name=Wilson/> On learning the result, she remarked: "To win this award feels absolutely amazing.&nbsp;... It's brilliant."<ref name=Decade/>
