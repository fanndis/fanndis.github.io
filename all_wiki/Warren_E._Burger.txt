'''Warren Earl Burger''' (September 17, 1907 – June 25, 1995) was the 15th [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice of the United States]], serving from 1969 to 1986. Born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]], Burger graduated from the St. Paul College of Law in 1931. He helped secure the Minnesota delegation's support for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]]. After Eisenhower won the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]], he appointed Burger to the position of [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in charge of the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]]. In 1956, Eisenhower appointed Burger to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. Burger served on this court until 1969 and became known as a critic of the [[Warren Court]].

In 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] nominated Burger to succeed Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], and Burger won [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation. He did not emerge as a strong intellectual force on the court, but sought to improve the administration of the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judiciary]]. He also helped establish the [[National Center for State Courts]] and the [[Supreme Court Historical Society]]. Burger remained on the court until his retirement in 1986, when he became Chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. He was succeeded as chief justice by [[William H. Rehnquist]], who had served as an associate justice since 1972.

In 1974, Burger wrote for a unanimous court in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', which rejected Nixon's invocation of [[executive privilege]] in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]]. The ruling played a major role in Nixon's resignation. Burger joined the majority in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' in holding that the [[right to privacy]] prohibited states from banning abortions. He later abandoned  ''Roe v. Wade'' in ''[[Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]]''. His majority opinion in ''[[INS v. Chadha]]'' struck down the one-house [[Legislative veto in the United States|legislative veto]].

Although Burger was perceived as a conservative,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/polisci/jsegal/QualTable.pdf | title=Perceived Qualifications and Ideology of Supreme Court Nominees, 1937–2012| publisher=[[Stony Brook University|SUNY at Stony Brook]]| access-date=April 4, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Burger Court]] delivered numerous conservative decisions, the Burger Court also delivered some liberal decisions regarding [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]], [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], [[Establishment clause|religious establishment]], and school [[desegregation]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link1=Lucius Barker|last=Barker|first=Lucius J.|date=Autumn 1973|title=Black Americans and the Burger Court: Implications for the Political System|url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol1973/iss4/|journal=Washington University Law Review|volume=1973|issue=4|pages=747–777|via=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/}}</ref> during his tenure.<ref>Earl M. Maltz, ''The Coming of the Nixon Court: The 1972 Term and the Transformation of Constitutional Law'' (University Press of Kansas; 2016)</ref>

==Early years==

Warren Earl Burger was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], in 1907, as one of seven children. His parents, Katharine (née Schnittger) and Charles Joseph Burger, a traveling salesman and railroad cargo inspector,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Br-Ca/Burger-Warren.html|title=Warren Burger Biography - life, family, children, death, school, young, information, born, college, contract}}</ref> were of [[Austrian German]] descent. His grandfather, [[Joseph Burger (Medal of Honor)|Joseph Burger]], had emigrated from Tyrol, [[Austria]] and joined the [[Union Army]] when he was 12. Joseph Burger fought and was wounded in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], resulting in the loss of his right arm and was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] at the age of 14. At age 16, Joseph Burger became the youngest [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in the Union Army.

Burger grew up on the family farm near the edge of Saint Paul. At age 8, he stayed home from school for a year after contracting polio.<ref name="Civil">{{cite web |url= http://uscivilliberties.org/biography/3264-warren-e-burger-1907-1995.html |title=Warren E. Burger (1907–1995) |date=December 1, 2012 |website=Uscivilliberties.org |publisher=Civil Liberties in the United States}}</ref>  He attended [[Johnson Senior High School (St. Paul, Minnesota)|John A. Johnson High School]], where he was president of the student council.<ref name="Civil" /> He competed in hockey, football, track, and swimming.<ref name="Civil" />  While in high school, he wrote articles on high school sports for local newspapers.<ref name="Civil" />  He graduated in 1925, and received a partial scholarship to attend [[Princeton University]], which he declined because his family's finances were not sufficient to cover the remainder of his expenses.<ref name="Civil" />

That same year, Burger also worked with the crew building the [[Robert Street Bridge]], a crossing of the [[Mississippi River]] in Saint Paul that still exists. Concerned about the number of deaths on the project, he asked that a net be installed to catch anyone who fell, but was rebuffed by managers. In later years, Burger made a point of visiting the bridge whenever he came back to town.

==Education and early career==

Burger enrolled in extension classes at the [[University of Minnesota]] for two years while selling insurance for Mutual Life Insurance.<ref name="Civil" /> Afterward, he enrolled at St. Paul College of Law (which later became William Mitchell College of Law, now [[Mitchell Hamline School of Law]]), receiving his [[Bachelor of Laws]] ''magna cum laude'' in 1931.<ref name="Civil" /> He took a job at a St. Paul law firm.<ref name="Civil" /> In 1937, Burger served as the eighth president of the Saint Paul [[Jaycees]].<ref name="Civil" /> He also taught for twelve years at William Mitchell.<ref name="Civil" />  A spinal condition prevented Burger from serving in the military during [[World War II]]; instead he supported the war effort at home, including service on Minnesota's emergency war labor board from 1942 to 1947.<ref name="Civil" /> From 1948 to 1953, he served on the governor of Minnesota's interracial commission, which worked on issues related to racial desegregation.<ref name="Civil" />  He also served as president of the St. Paul's Council on Human Relations, which considered ways to improve the relationship between the city's police department and its minority residents.<ref name="Civil" />

==Politics==

Burger was a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].<ref>https://www.oyez.org/justices/warren_e_burger</ref> His political career began uneventfully, but he soon rose to national prominence. He supported [[Minnesota]] Governor [[Harold E. Stassen]]'s unsuccessful pursuit of the Republican nomination for president in 1948.<ref>[[Osro Cobb]], ''Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memoirs of Historical Significance'', Carol Griffee, ed. ([[Little Rock, Arkansas]]: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), p. 99</ref> In 1952, at the Republican convention, he played a key role in [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s nomination by delivering the Minnesota delegation. After he was elected, President Eisenhower appointed Burger as the [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in charge of the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]].

In this role, he first argued in front of the Supreme Court. The case involved John P. Peters, a [[Yale University]] professor who worked as a consultant to the government. He had been discharged from his position on loyalty grounds. Supreme Court cases are usually argued by the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]], but he disagreed with the government's position and refused to argue the case. Burger lost the case. Shortly after, Burger appeared in a case defending the United States against claims from the [[Texas City Disaster|Texas City ship explosion disaster]], successfully arguing that the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] of 1947 did not allow a suit for negligence in policy making; the United States won the case (''Dalehite, et al., vs. United States'' 346 U.S. 15 (1953)).

==Court of Appeals service==

Burger was nominated by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on January 12, 1956, to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] vacated by Judge [[Harold M. Stephens]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on March 28, 1956, and received his commission on March 29, 1956. His service terminated on June 23, 1969, due to his elevation to the Supreme Court.

==National prominence==
[[File:Warren Burger Official.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of Burger]]
In 1968, Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] announced his retirement after 15 years on the Court, effective on the confirmation of his successor. President [[Lyndon Johnson]] nominated sitting [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Abe Fortas]] to the position, but a Senate [[filibuster]] blocked his confirmation. With Johnson's term as president about to expire before another nominee could be considered, Earl Warren remained in office.

==Supreme Court service==
[[File:President Richard Nixon and Judge Warren Burger.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] introduces Burger as his nominee for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court]]
Burger was nominated by President [[Richard Nixon]] on May 23, 1969, to a seat on the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] vacated by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]. In his presidential campaign, Nixon had pledged to appoint a strict constructionist as chief justice. Burger had first caught Nixon's eye through a letter of support the former sent to Nixon during the 1952 [[Checkers Speech#Fund crisis|Fund crisis]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/the-checkers-speech-after-60-years/262172/?single_page=true |title=The Checkers Speech After 60 Years |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |date=September 22, 2012|access-date=September 23, 2012}}</ref> and then again 15 years later when the magazine ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' had reprinted a 1967 speech that Burger had given at [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]]. In it, Burger compared the United States judicial system to those of [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]]:

{{quote|I assume that no one will take issue with me when I say that these North European countries are as enlightened as the United States in the value they place on the individual and on human dignity. [Those countries] do not consider it necessary to use a device like our [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], under which an accused person may not be required to testify. They go swiftly, efficiently and directly to the question of whether the accused is guilty. No nation on earth goes to such lengths or takes such pains to provide safeguards as we do, once an accused person is called before the bar of justice and until his case is completed.}}

Through speeches like this, Burger became known as a critic of Chief Justice Warren and an advocate of a literal, [[Strict constructionism|strict-constructionist]] reading of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Nixon's agreement with these views, being expressed by a readily confirmable, sitting federal appellate judge, led to the nomination. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on June 9, 1969, and received his commission on June 23, 1969. [[Earl Warren]] swore in the new chief justice the same day.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=49cvAAAAIBAJ&pg=6175,4642853&dq=warren+burger&hl=en |title=Warren Officially Retires As Burger Takes Oath |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |newspaper=[[Evening Independent]] |agency=Associated Press |date=June 23, 1969 |page=12–A |access-date=August 11, 2012}}</ref> He assumed [[senior status]] on September 26, 1986. His service terminated on June 25, 1995, due to his death.

According to President Nixon's memoirs, he had asked Chief Justice Burger in the spring of 1970 to be prepared to run for [[President of the United States|president]] in 1972 if the political repercussions of the [[Cambodian Campaign|Cambodia invasion]] were too negative for him to endure. A few years later, in 1971 and 1973, Burger was on Nixon's short list of vice-presidential replacements for Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], along with [[John Connally]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Nelson Rockefeller]] before [[Gerald Ford]] was appointed following Agnew's resignation in October 1973.

==Chief Justice==
{{anchor|The Burger Court|Burger Court|Burger court}} <!--used by redirects-->

===Jurisprudence===
The Court issued a unanimous ruling, ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' (1971) supporting [[desegregation busing|busing]] to reduce ''de facto'' [[racial segregation]] in schools. However, Burger wrote the majority opinion for ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' (1974), which upheld ''de facto'' school segregation across school district lines if segregationist policy was not explicitly stated by all of the districts involved. In ''[[United States v. U.S. District Court]]'' (1972), the Burger Court issued another unanimous ruling against the [[Nixon administration]]'s desire to invalidate the need for a search warrant and the requirements of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] in cases of domestic surveillance. Then, only two weeks later in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' (1972), the court, in a 5–4 decision, invalidated all [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty laws]] then in force although Burger dissented from that decision. In the most controversial ruling of his term, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), Burger voted with the majority to recognize a broad right to [[privacy]] that prohibited states from banning [[abortions]]. However, Burger abandoned ''Roe v. Wade'' in ''[[Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]]''.

On July 24, 1974, Burger led the court in a unanimous decision in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]''. That was Nixon's attempt to keep several memos and tapes relating to the [[Watergate scandal]] private. As documented in Woodward and Armstrong's ''[[The Brethren (Bob Woodward book)|The Brethren]]'' and elsewhere, Burger's original feelings on the case were that Watergate was merely a political battle, and Burger "didn't see what they did wrong."<ref>{{harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=251}}.</ref> The actual final opinion was largely Brennan's work, but each justice wrote at least a rough draft of a particular section.<ref>{{harvnb|Eisler|1993|pp=251–253}}.</ref> Burger was originally to vote in favor of Nixon but tactically changed his vote to assign the opinion to himself and to restrain the opinion's rhetoric.<ref>{{harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=252}}.</ref> Burger's first draft of the opinion wrote that executive privilege could be invoked when it dealt with a "core function" of the presidency and that in some cases, the executive could be supreme.<ref>{{harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=254}}.</ref> However, the other justices in the Supreme Court were able to convince Burger to excise that language from the opinion: the judicial branch alone would have the power to determine whether something qualifies to be shielded under executive privilege.<ref>{{harvnb|Eisler|1993|pp=254–255}}.</ref>

Burger was opposed to [[gay rights]], as he wrote a famous concurring opinion in the Court's 1986 decision upholding a Georgia law criminalizing sodomy (''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''); he relied on historical evidence that laws criminalizing homosexuality were of ancient vintage. Burger pointed out that the famous legal author [[William Blackstone]] had written that sodomy was a {{"'}}crime against nature'...&nbsp;of 'deeper malignity than rape', a heinous act 'the very mention of which is a disgrace to human nature' and 'a crime not fit to be named{{'"}}.<ref>''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 196–197 (Burger, C.J., concurring).</ref>  That decision was overturned in 2003 by the decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which sought relief against a Texas law, which sanctioned heterosexual sodomy but criminalized it between homosexuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/12/the-supreme-courts-overturning-of-bowers-v-hardwick-provided-a-critical-precedent-for-marriage-equality.html/ |title=How the Battle Over Anti-Sodomy Laws Became the Lynchpin of Marriage Equality  |publisher=The Slate Group |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=2020-06-15}}</ref>

[[File:Ford sworn-in.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Betty Ford]] between them, Chief Justice Burger swears in President [[Gerald Ford]] following the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]].]]

Burger also emphasized the maintenance of [[checks and balances]] between the branches of government. In ''[[INS v. Chadha|Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha]]'' (1983), he held for the majority that the US Congress could not reserve a legislative veto over executive branch actions.

On issues involving criminal law and procedure, Burger remained reliably conservative. He joined the majority in voting to reinstate the death penalty in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' (1976), and in 1983, he vigorously dissented from the Court's holding in the case of ''[[Solem v. Helm]]'' that a sentence of life imprisonment for issuing a fraudulent check in the amount of $100 constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]].

===Leadership===
Rather than dominating the court, Burger sought to improve administration both within the court and within the nation's legal system. Criticizing some advocates as unprepared, Burger created training venues for state and local government advocates.<ref>Warren E. Burger, Conference on Supreme Court Advocacy, 33 Catholic U. L.Rev. 525–526 (1984)</ref> He also helped found the [[National Center for State Courts]], which is now in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]], as well as the Institute for Court Management, and National Institute of Corrections to provide professional training for judges, clerks, and prison guards.<ref>Christensen, George A., ''Journal of Supreme Court History'' Volume 33 Issue 1, Pages 17–41 (February 19, 2008), ''Here Lies the Supreme Court: Revisited'', University of Alabama.</ref> Burger also began a tradition of annually delivering a ''State of the Judiciary'' speech to the [[American Bar Association]], many of whose members had been alienated by the Warren Court. However, some detractors thought his emphasis on the mechanics of the judicial system trivialized the office of chief justice.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Burger drew internal controversy within the Supreme Court throughout his tenure, as was revealed in the controversial best-selling book by [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Scott Armstrong (journalist)|Scott Armstrong]], ''[[The Brethren (non-fiction)|The Brethren]]''. Although US Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] noted Burger "looked, sounded, and acted like a chief justice," the reporters depicted Burger as an ineffective chief justice who was not seriously respected by his colleagues for his alleged pomposity and lack of legal acumen.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Woodward and Armstrong's sources indicated that some of the other justices were annoyed by Burger's practice of switching his vote in conference or simply not announcing his vote so that he could control opinion assignments. "Burger repeatedly irked his colleagues by changing his vote to remain in the majority, and by rewarding his friends with choice assignments and punishing his foes with dreary ones."<ref name="time.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961645-7,00.html | work=Time | title=Reagan's Mr. Right | date=June 30, 1986 | access-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref> Burger would also try to influence the course of events in a case by circulating a pre-emptive opinion.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=157}}.</ref>

Consequently, the Burger Court was described as his "in name only."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961645-1,00.html | work=Time | title=Reagan's Mr. Right | date=June 30, 1986 | access-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref> ''Time'' magazine called him "plodding" and "standoffish"<ref name="ReferenceA" /> as well as "pompous," "aloof," and unpopular.<ref name="time.com" /> Burger was a constant irritant on the Court's group dynamic, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[Linda Greenhouse]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=234}}.</ref> [[Jeffrey Toobin]] wrote in his book ''[[The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court|The Nine]]'' that by the time of his departure in 1986, Burger had alienated all of his colleagues to one degree or another.<ref>{{citation |last=Toobin |first=Jeffrey |author-link=Jeffrey Toobin |title=The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year=2005}}.</ref> In particular, Associate Justice [[Potter Stewart]], who had been considered a candidate to succeed Warren as chief justice, was so discontented with Burger that he became the primary source for Woodward and Armstrong when they wrote ''The Brethren''.

Greenhouse pointed to ''INS v. Chadha'' as evidence of Burger's "foundering leadership." Burger would cause the case to be delayed for over twenty months although there had been five votes to affirm the appeals court's finding of unconstitutionality after the case had been first argued: Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, and Stevens. Burger did not allow an opinion to be assigned, first by asking for a special conference on the case and then by delaying the case for reargument when that conference fell through even though he never held a formal vote on holding the case over for reargument.<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=154–157}}.</ref>

==Later life==

Burger retired on September 26, 1986, in part to lead the campaign to mark the 1987 bicentennial of the [[United States Constitution]], at which time he commissioned the construction of the Constitution Bicentennial Monument ([[The National Monument to the U.S. Constitution]]).

==Legacy==

As chief justice, Burger was instrumental in founding the [[Supreme Court Historical Society]] and was its first president. Burger is often cited as one of the foundational proponents of [[Alternative Dispute Resolution]] (ADR), particularly in its ability to ameliorate an overloaded justice system. In a speech given in front of the [[American Bar Association]], Justice Burger lamented the state of the justice system in 1984, "Our system is too costly, too painful, too destructive, too inefficient for a truly civilized people. To rely on the adversary process as the principal means of resolving conflicting claims is a mistake that must be corrected."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmlaw.org/fsm/decisions/vol3/3fsm015_017.htm|title=FSM 3 Intrm. 015-017}}</ref> The Warren E.
