'''''The Dominion Post''''' is a metropolitan daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Wellington]], New Zealand. It is owned by media business [[Stuff (company)|Stuff Ltd]], formerly the New Zealand branch of [[Australia]]n media company [[Fairfax Media]]. Weekday issues are now in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, and its Saturday edition is in [[broadsheet]] format.

Since 2020 the editor has been [[Anna Fifield]].

== History ==
''The Dominion Post'' was created in July 2002 when [[Independent Newspapers|Independent Newspapers Limited]] (INL) amalgamated two Wellington printed and published metropolitan broadsheet newspapers, ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]]'', an evening paper first published on 8 February 1865, and ''[[The Dominion (Wellington)|The Dominion]]'', a morning paper first published on [[Dominion Day]], 26 September 1907.

''The Dominion'' was distributed throughout the lower half of the North Island, as far as Taupo, where it met with Auckland's ambitiously named ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''. ''The Evening Post'' was not so widely distributed, but had a much greater circulation than ''The Dominion''.

INL sold ''The Dominion Post'' and all other New Zealand newspapers and most magazines in its catalogue to [[Fairfax Media]] in 2003.

''The Dominion Post'' is the only pay-and-read local newspaper in Wellington City.
