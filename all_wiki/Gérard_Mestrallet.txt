==Early life and education==

==Career==
===Career in government===
After his studies, Mestrallet joined the Treasury. From September 1982 and July 1984 he was the technical advisor in charge of industrial affairs under the [[Ministry of the Economy and Finance (France)|Minister of Economics and Finance]] (during the tenure of [[Jacques Delors]])

===Career in the energy sector===
In 1984, Mestrallet started working as a special advisor for Suez, known today just as Suez.<ref name="Gerard Mestrallet">{{cite web|url=http://gerard-mestrallet.dirigeants-entreprise.com/gdf-suez/gerard-mestrallet/ |title=Gerard Mestrallet|publisher=DIRIGEANTS ENTREPRISE|access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref> He has been its Chairman and CEO since 2001. He was named Deputy Delegate General for Industrial Affairs in June 1986. In July 1987, he was General Director of the European Court of Human Rights, an affiliate of the Compagnie financière de Suez. In January 1991 he started as the Deputy Director General of the company, but a month later he became the Managing Director and Chairman of the Management Committee of the Société General de Belgique, to ensure its refocusing and development.

In 1995 Mestrallet took a position as the head of Suez and from then he worked for Suez while focusing on three businesses: energy, water, and waste<ref name="edubourse.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.edubourse.com/guide/biographies.php?bio=gerard-mestrallet |title=Gerard Mestrallet|publisher=Fondationface.org |access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref> He was also the instigator of the reconciliation between Suez and the Lyonnaise des Eaux. The Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux was started in 1997, at which time Mestrallet became the chairman of its executive board while Jérôme Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise, became the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.<ref name="Gerard Mestrallet"/><ref name="edubourse.com"/> However, the group soon went back to its original name, Suez and in 2003 its leaders made a proposition to shareholders to change the association of the company by becoming an LP with a board of directors and Gerard Mestrallet as the CEO.<ref name="Gerard Mestrallet"/>

In July 2008, Mestrallet was appointed CEO of [[Engie|GDF Suez]] (later [[Engie]]). Upon merging Gaz de France and Suez to create a new European energy company, he spent about 4 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in a series of targeted acquisitions across the globe by late 2008. He also set a target for the group of investing 10 billion euros a year over the period from 2009 until 2011.<ref>Paul Betts (11 September 2008), [Mestrallet steps on the gas at merged GDF-Suez] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In 2012, GDF Suez's board of directors extended the age limit for the group's chairman and chief executive to 67 from 65, a step that enabled Mestrallet to extend his tenure.<ref>Dominique Vidalon (17 February 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/gdf-suez/rpt-gdf-to-extend-boss-mestrallets-mandate-report-idUSL5E8DH0LS20120217 GDF to extend boss Mestrallet's mandate -report] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

On 3 May 2016, Mestrallet left his position due to statutory age limits<ref>David Keohane (19 December 2018), [https://www.ft.com/content/8959ff32-035c-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1 Battle to replace Suez chief and chairman heats up] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> and instead became chairman of the board of directors of the group, with [[Isabelle Kocher]] appointed as CEO, as planned for months.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/isabelle-kocher-to-head-engie-1452763955 Isabelle Kocher to Head Engie], Inti Laundauro, Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 14 January 2016</ref>

===Controversy===
In 2014, France's [[Autorité de la concurrence]] ordered GDF Suez to share a set of customer data with competitors while pursuing an investigation into alleged abuse of a dominant position by GDF Suez.<ref>Inti Landauro (9 September 2014), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-antitrust-watchdog-opens-investigation-into-gdf-suez-1410254089 French Antitrust Watchdog Opens Investigation Into GDF Suez] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>

Also in 2014, Mestrallet's retirement cap of 21 million euros was a controversy in the media due to GDF Suez's record losses for 2013 and its effort to prepare a savings plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2014/10/23/20005-20141023ARTFIG00310-polemique-autour-de-la-retraite-chapeau-du-pdg-de-gdf-suez.php|title=Polémique autour de la retraite-chapeau du PDG de GDF Suez|work=Le Figaro|access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref> In 2016, Engie announced that Mestrallet's 350,000 euro salary would go to the Engie Foundation charity and that he would carry out his role for free.<ref>Geert De Clercq (3 May 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-engie-agm-idUKKCN0XU1PI Engie says Mestrallet's chairman salary will go to charity] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

==Later career==
In 2016, Mestrallet was appointed by [[Ministry of Ecology|Minister of Ecology]] [[Ségolène Royal]] to chair a three-member advisory committee to review European carbon pricing and make recommendations to the French government. Under his leadership, the committee recommended that France increase taxation on coal-fired power plants, or set stricter carbon emissions standards, to encourage a shift to gas-fired plants to reduce carbon emissions.<ref>Bate Felix (11 July 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/france-carbon-pricing/update-1-french-carbon-pricing-committee-proposes-tax-on-coal-fired-power-idUSL8N19X4SM French carbon pricing committee proposes tax on coal-fired power] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 2018, Mestrallet was appointed by [[President of France|President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] as Executive Chairman of the French Agency for the Development of [[Al-ʿUla]] in Saudi Arabia, a French organization in charge of tourism and cultural development in the area in cooperation with the Saudi Kingdom.<ref>Vincent Noce (10 May 2018), [https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/blueprint-for-a-grand-projet-in-saudi-arabia The blueprint for Saudi Arabia's multi-billion-euro project with France] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref>
