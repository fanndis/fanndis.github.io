On August 2, 2018, [[Warner Music Group]] announced that it had acquired Uproxx and its properties (except for BroBible, which will continue to publish independently) for an undisclosed sum, although Uproxx has raised around $43m (£33m) from previous investment, which provides some sense of the firm's valuation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Maytom |first1=Tim |title=Uproxx Media Group Acquired by Warner Music Group |url = https://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.com/uproxx-media-group-acquires-by-warner-music-group |access-date= August 4, 2018 |work=Mobile Marketing Magazine |date=August 3, 2018}}</ref> With this acquisition, Uproxx Media Group is no longer active, with its remaining properties existing under Warner Music Group.
