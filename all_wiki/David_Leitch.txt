He wrote and starred in ''[[Confessions of an Action Star]]'', a parody of action films and the action film industry released in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with David Leitch (Matrix, 300, Wolverine, Bourne Ultimatum, Confessions of an Action Star) Pt. 1|url=http://actionflickchick.com/superaction/interview-with-david-leitch/|date=May 15, 2009|publisher=Action Flick Chick}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with David Leitch (Part 2) |url=http://actionflickchick.com/superaction/interview-with-david-leitch-part-2/|date=June 16, 2009|publisher=Action Flick Chick}}</ref>

Leitch and Chad Stahelski opened an action design production company called 87Eleven in 1997. In 2009, Stahelski and Leitch were second-unit directors and stunt co-ordinators on ''[[Ninja Assassin]].'' The two co-directed the 2014 film ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Keanu Reeves, 'John Wick' Directors on How Their 'Matrix' Past Helped With Assassin Film|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/keanu-reeves-john-wick-directors-743810|accessdate=March 28, 2017|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=24 October 2014}}</ref> although Leitch himself was not credited as co-director. Leitch executive produced the two ''John Wick'' sequels, which Stahelski solo directed.

He eventually moved on to direct films such as ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'', ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' and ''[[Hobbs & Shaw|Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw]]'' with his wife and creative partner, Kelly McCormick serving as a producer.
