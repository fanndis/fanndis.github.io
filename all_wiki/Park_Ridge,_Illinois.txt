'''Park Ridge''' is a city in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], and a [[Chicago]] suburb.  The population was 37,480 at the 2010 census. It is located {{convert|15|mi}} northwest of downtown Chicago. It is close to [[O'Hare International Airport]], major expressways, and rail transportation. It is a part of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], bordering three northwestern neighborhoods of Chicago's [[Community areas of Chicago#Far North-West side|Far North Side]] ([[Edison Park, Chicago|Edison Park]], [[Norwood Park, Chicago|Norwood Park]], and [[O'Hare, Chicago|O'Hare]].)

As its name suggests, Park Ridge lies on a ridge. The soil is abundant with clay deposits, which made it a [[brick-making]] center for the developing city of Chicago. Park Ridge was originally called Pennyville to honor George Penny, the businessman who owned the local brickyard along with Robert Meacham. Later it was named Brickton.<ref>[http://www.parkridge.us/about/history.aspx "The History of Park Ridge"]. City of Park Ridge.</ref> The [[Des Plaines River]] divides Park Ridge from neighboring [[Des Plaines, Illinois]], which is west of Park Ridge. Chicago is south and east of Park Ridge, and [[Niles, Illinois|Niles]] and [[Maine Township, Cook County, Illinois|unincorporated Maine Township]] are to its north.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/gazetteer?Maine+Township |title=Gazetteer Files - Geography - U.S. Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |access-date=2014-04-16}}</ref>

==History==
The area of Park Ridge was inhabited by the [[Potawatomie]] until they were removed in 1833. The area was a convenient portage between the Des Plaines and Chicago rivers for the French explorers and in the early 1830s, the first settlers arrived from New England and New York. In 1854 George Penny established a [[brick]]works in the area. In 1910 Park Ridge had a population of 2,009. In 1930 the population was 10,417. In 1950 the population was 16,602. In 1960 the population was 32,625, with 99.9% of the population white. There were five African-Americans and 31 people classed other than black or white. By 1970, the population had risen to 42,466.<ref>Encyclopedia of Chicago, [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2203.html Park Ridge]</ref>  In 2016, former First Lady [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] campaigned as the Democratic candidate for President of the United States.  She was a graduate of the first class of Park Ridge's Maine Township High School South (1965).<ref>Milton E. Nelson, ''Park Ridge:  Milestones Of History'' pp. 156, 159 (2017)</ref>

*Park Ridge's most recognizable landmark is the [[Pickwick Theatre]], an [[Art Deco]] building dating back to 1928. It is a movie theater and a venue for plays and concerts. In 1975, the theater was named to the National Register of Historic Places. Although smaller theaters have been added to the rear of the building, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212649/http://www.architechgallery.com/arch_images/architech_images/iann/ian_pickwick.jpg main auditorium theater] remains intact in its original large five-aisle state. The main auditorium can seat up to 1,400 people. In the 1980s, the Pickwick's facade was one of many used as the backdrop for the opening credits of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert's]] ''[[At the Movies (1982–1990 TV series)|At the Movies]]''.
