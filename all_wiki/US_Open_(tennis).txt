The '''United States Open Tennis Championships''' is a [[hard court]] [[tennis]] tournament. The tournament is the modern version of one of the oldest tennis championships in the world, the U.S. National Championship, for which men's singles and men's doubles were first played in [[1881 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1881]].

Since 1987, the US Open has been chronologically the fourth and final [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament of the year. The other three, in chronological order, are the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]], and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. The US Open starts on the last Monday of August and continues for two weeks, with the middle weekend coinciding with the U.S. [[Labor Day]] holiday.

The tournament consists of five primary championships: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The tournament also includes events for senior, junior, and [[wheelchair tennis|wheelchair]] players. Since 1978, the tournament has been played on [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]] hard courts at the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]] in [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park]], [[Queens]], [[New York City]]. The US Open is owned and organized by the [[United States Tennis Association]] (USTA), a [[not-for-profit organization|non-profit organization]], and the chairperson of the US Open is [[Patrick Galbraith]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Revenue from ticket sales, sponsorships, and television contracts are used to develop tennis in the United States.

The US Open employs standard 7-points tiebreakers in every set of a singles match. For the other three Grand Slam events, there are special scoring methods for a match that reaches 6–6 in the last possible set (the third for women and the fifth for men): in the French Open, the decisive set continues until a player takes a two-game lead, in Australia, an extended tiebreaker to 10 points is played, and at Wimbledon, a standard tiebreaker is played only if the game score reaches 12–12. As with the US Open, those events use tiebreakers to decide the other sets.

===1881–1914: Newport Casino===
[[File:Newport Tennis Hall of Fame.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Newport Casino Tennis Court (as of 2005), where the US Open was first held in 1881]]

The tournament was first held in August 1881 on [[grass court]]s at the [[Newport Casino]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. That year, only clubs that were members of the [[United States Tennis Association|United States National Lawn Tennis Association]] (USNLTA) were permitted to enter.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/07/14/98565187.pdf | title=National Lawn-Tennis Tournament | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 14, 1881 | accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref> [[Richard Sears (tennis)|Richard Sears]] won the men's singles at this tournament, which was the first of his seven consecutive singles titles.<ref name="collins">{{cite book | title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis | author=[[Bud Collins]] | publisher=New Chapter Press | location=New York City | year=2010 | edition=2nd | pages=10, 452, 454 | isbn=978-0942257700}}</ref>

From 1884 through 1911, the tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year's final, where he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament.

In the first years of the U.S. National Championship, only men competed and the tournament was known as the U.S. National Singles Championships for Men. In September 1887, six years after the men's nationals were first held, the first U.S. Women's National Singles Championship was held at the [[Philadelphia Cricket Club]]. The winner was 17-year-old Philadelphian [[Ellen Hansell]]. In that same year, the men's doubles event was played at the [[Orange Lawn Tennis Club]] in [[South Orange, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usta.com/en/home/about-usta/usta-history/national/usta-locations.html | title=USTA LOCATIONS |website=www.usta.com | access-date=November 7, 2020}}</ref>

The women's tournament used a challenge system from 1888 through 1918, except in 1917. Between 1890 and 1906, sectional tournaments were held in the east and the west of the country to determine the best two doubles teams, which competed in a play-off for the right to compete against the defending champions in the challenge round.<ref name="USTA"/>

The [[1888 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1888]] and the [[1889 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1889]] men's doubles events were played at the [[Staten Island Cricket Club]] in [[Livingston, Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2016/06/24/us-open-stadium-history-flushing-meadow-new-york-arthur-ashe | title=How the U.S. Open found its home in New York at Flushing Meadows | newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] | date=June 24, 2016 | accessdate=November 7, 2020}}</ref>
In the [[1893 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1893 Championship]], the men's doubles event was played at the St. George Cricket Club in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Championship tennis tournament|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1893/05/28/page/7/article/championship-tennis-tournament|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 28, 1893|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=On courts of turf|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1893/07/24/page/12/article/on-courts-of-turf|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 24, 1893|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tennis notes|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/07/24/109265252.pdf|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 24, 1893}}</ref>

In 1892, the U.S. Mixed Doubles Championship was introduced and in 1899 the U.S. Women's National Doubles Championship.

In 1915, the national championship was relocated to the [[West Side Tennis Club]] in [[Forest Hills, Queens]], New York City. The effort to relocate it to New York City began as early as 1911 when a group of tennis players, headed by New Yorker [[Karl Behr]], started working on it.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/02/04/104777617.pdf | title=Tennis Tournament at Newport Again | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 4, 1911 | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref>

===1915–1977: West Side Tennis Club===

In early 1915, a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of moving the tournament. They argued that most tennis clubs, players, and fans were located in the New York City area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championship there.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/01/17/301768272.pdf | title=Newport May Lose Tennis Tourney | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 17, 1915 | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref> This view was opposed by another group of players that included eight former national singles champions.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/01/18/100131498.pdf | title=Want Newport for Tennis Tourney | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 18, 1915 | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/01/23/100134451.pdf | title=A Tennis "Solar Plexus" | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 23, 1915 | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref> This contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual USNLTA meeting on February 5, 1915, with 128 votes in favor of and 119 against relocation.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vw0nAAAAIBAJ&dq=national%20lawn%20tennis%20newport%20new%20york&pg=5776%2C1049672 | title=Tourney Goes to New York | newspaper=[[Boston Evening Transcript]] | date=February 6, 1915 | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/02/07/104641023.pdf | title='All-Comers' Tourney to be Restricted | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 7, 1915 | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/02/06/106729791.pdf | title=Newport Loses Tennis Tourney | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 6, 1915 | accessdate=July 21, 2012}}</ref> In August 1915, the men's singles tournament was held in the [[West Side Tennis Club|West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills]] in [[New York City]] for the first time while the women's tournament was held in [[Philadelphia Cricket Club]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia]] (the women's singles event was not move until [[1921 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1921]]).

===Open era===

The [[Tennis open era|open era]] began in 1968 when professional tennis players were allowed to compete for the first time at the Grand Slam tournament held at the West Side Tennis Club. The previous U.S. National Championships had been limited to amateur players. Except for mixed doubles,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} all events at the [[1968 US Open (tennis)|1968 national tournament]] were open to professionals. That year, 96 men and 63 women entered, and prize money totaled US$100,000. In 1970, the US Open became the first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament to use a [[Tennis score#Scoring a tiebreak game|tiebreaker]] to decide a set that reached a 6–6 score in games. From 1970 through 1974, the US Open used a best-of-nine-point sudden-death tiebreaker before moving to the [[International Tennis Federation]]'s (ITF) best-of-twelve points system.<ref name="collins"/> In 1973, the US Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to award equal prize money to men and women, with that year's singles champions, [[John Newcombe]] and [[Margaret Court]], receiving US$25,000 each.<ref name="collins"/> From 1975, following complaints about the surface and its impact on the  ball's bounce the tournament played on clay courts instead of grass, this was also an experiment to make it more "TV friendly". The addition of floodlights allowed matches to be played at night.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Open History|url=https://www.tennis.com/tournaments/2012/08/us-open-history/16931/|website=Tennis.com|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=When the US Open was played on clay…|url=https://thelacesout.com/when-the-us-open-was-played-on-clay-acbd0247aa6c|last=Maverick|first=Vickey|date=2016-08-27|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref>

===Since 1978: USTA National Tennis Center===
In 1978, the tournament moved from the West Side Tennis Club to the larger and newly constructed [[USTA National Tennis Center]] in [[Flushing Meadows]], Queens, {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} to the north. The tournament's court surface also switched from [[Clay court|clay]] to [[Hardcourt|hard]]. [[Jimmy Connors]] is the only individual to have won US Open singles titles on three surfaces (grass, clay, and hard), while [[Chris Evert]] is the only woman to win US Open singles titles on two surfaces (clay and hard).<ref name="collins"/>

The US Open is the only Grand Slam tournament that has been played every year since its inception.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.itftennis.com/about/grand-slams/us-open.aspx | title=Grand Slams – US Open | publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] | accessdate=August 23, 2012}}</ref>

During the [[2006 U.S. Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]], the complex was renamed to "USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center" in honor of [[Billie Jean King]], a four-time US Open singles champion and women's tennis pioneer.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/sports/tennis/03tennis.html | title=Tennis Center to Be Named for Billie Jean King | author=Richard Sandomir | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 3, 2006}}</ref>

From 1984 through 2015, the US Open deviated from traditional scheduling practices for tennis tournaments with a concept that came to be known as "Super Saturday": the men's and women's finals were played on the final Saturday and Sunday of the tournament respectively, and their respective semifinals were held one day prior. The Women's final was originally held in between the two men's semi-final matches; in 2001, the Women's final was moved to the evening so it could be played on [[primetime]] television, citing a major growth in popularity for women's tennis among viewers.<ref name="nyp-ladiesfirst">{{cite news | url=https://nypost.com/2001/08/30/ladies-first-womens-open-final-is-so-hot-theyre-moving-it-to-prime-time/ | title=Ladies first – women's open final is so hot, they're moving it to prime-time | newspaper=[[New York Post]] | accessdate=September 12, 2016}}</ref> This scheduling pattern helped to encourage television viewership, but proved divisive among players because it only gave them less than a day's rest between their semi-finals and championship match.<ref name="espn-atpmonday"/><ref name=espn-tradschedule>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/usopen15/story/_/id/13550899/tennis-traditional-us-open-scheduling-favors-roger-federer | title=Traditional US Open scheduling favors Federer | website=ESPN.go.com | accessdate=August 31, 2015}}</ref>

For five consecutive tournaments between 2007 through 2012, the men's final was postponed to Monday due to weather. In 2013 and 2014, the USTA intentionally scheduled the men's final on a Monday—a move praised for allowing the men's players an extra day's rest following the semifinals, but drew the ire of the ATP for further deviating from the structure of the other Grand Slams.<ref name="espn-mondayfinish">{{cite web | title=US Open schedules Monday finish | url=http://en.espn.co.uk/tennis/sport/story/183876.html | website=ESPN.co.uk | accessdate=August 31, 2015}}</ref><ref name="espn-atpmonday">{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.co.uk/espn/sport/story/184271.html | title=ATP blasts US Open over Monday final | website=ESPN.co.uk | accessdate=August 31, 2015}}</ref> In 2015, the Super Saturday concept was dropped, and the US Open returned to a format similar to the other Grand Slams, with men's and women's finals on Saturday and Sunday. However, weather delays forced both sets of semifinals to be held on Friday that year.<ref name="si-usopenthursdaydelay">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/09/11/us-open-schedule-watch-semifinal-matches | title=U.S. Open schedule: How to watch semifinal matches | magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] | accessdate=September 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name="espn-tradschedule"/>

In 2018, the tournament was the first Grand Slam tournament that introduced the shot clock to keep a check on the time consumed by players between points.{{efn|name=Shot Clock|Once the chair umpire has announced the score following the previous point, the countdown starts and players have 25 seconds to begin their service motion. However, the chair umpire has the ability and discretion to pause or reset the clock to 25 seconds the clock if a point with a particularly long rally merits a pause for the players to recover their breath. In normal circumstances during the game, if the player has not started the service motion at the completion of the 25-second countdown, the chair umpire issues a time violation. The server will receive a warning and for each subsequent violation, the player loses a first serve (second serves are supposed to happen without delay, so the clock won't be used). In the case of the receiver, if it isn't ready at the end of 25 seconds, the chair umpire first issues a warning, then the loss of a point with every other violation. After even-numbered games, the chair umpire will start the clock when the balls are all in place on the server’s end of the court.<ref name=rules>{{cite news|title=US Open '18: On the clock! 25-second countdown's Slam debut|date=August 26, 2018|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2018/08/25/us-open-18-on-the-clock-25-second-countdowns-slam-debut/37603593/|work=[[Associated Press|AP]]|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>}} The reason for this change was to increase the pace of play.<ref name="shot clock">{{cite web|url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-07-10/50_for_50_billie_jean_king_1971_1972_and_1974_womens_singles_champion.html|title=Shot clock, warm-up clock to be implemented at 2018 US Open|last=Marshall|first=Ashley|date=July 11, 2018|website=usopen.org|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> The clock is placed in a position visible to players, the chair umpire and fans.<ref name="ATP">{{cite web|url=https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shot-clock-implemented-in-us-summer-swing-2018|title=USTA, ATP & WTA Implement Rules Innovations At Events Throughout Summer|date=July 11, 2018|website=atptour.com|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> Since 2020, all Grand Slams, ATP, and WTA tournaments apply this technology.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tennis: ATP to use Shot Clock in all tournaments in 2020|date=March 13, 2019|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-atp/tennis-atp-to-use-shot-clock-in-all-tournaments-in-2020-idUSKCN1QU2H0|work=[[Reuters]]|location=[[London]]|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>

All the courts used by the US Open are illuminated, allowing matches and television coverage to extend into [[primetime]]. In 2001, the women's singles final was intentionally scheduled for primetime for the first time. [[CBS Sports]] president [[Sean McManus (television executive)|Sean McManus]] cited significant public interest in star players [[Serena Williams]] and [[Venus Williams]] and the good ratings performance of the 1999 women's singles final, which was pushed into primetime by rain delays.<ref name="nyp-ladiesfirst"/>

===Surface===

From 1978 to 2019, the US Open was played on a [[hard court]] surface called Pro [[DecoTurf]]. It is a multi-layer cushioned surface and classified by the [[International Tennis Federation]] as medium-fast.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/courts/classified-surfaces/about-court-pace-classification.aspx | title=About Court Pace Classification | publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] | accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> Each August before the start of the tournament, the courts are resurfaced.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/sports/tennis/us-open-speed-bumps-on-a-hardcourt.html | title=Speed Bumps on a Hardcourt | author=Thomas Lin | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 7, 2011 | accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> In March 2020, the USTA announced that [[Laykold]] would become the new court surface supplier beginning with the 2020 tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2020/03/us-open-changing-hard-court-brand-for-1st-time-since-1970s/88096/|title= US Open Changing Hard-Court Brand for First Time since 1970S|agency=Associated Press|website=tennis.com|date=March 23, 2020|accessdate=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

Since 2005, all US Open and US Open Series tennis courts have been painted a shade of blue (trademarked as "U.S. Open Blue") inside the lines to make it easier for players, spectators, and television viewers to see the ball.<ref name="Surface"/> The area outside the lines is still painted "U.S. Open Green".<ref name="Surface">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/08/21/how-us-open-makes-courts-colors-science | title=The science behind creating the U.S. Open courts and signature colors | author=Tim Newcomb | magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] | date=August 24, 2015}}</ref>

===Player line call challenges===

In 2006, the US Open introduced [[instant replay]] reviews of line calls, using the [[Hawk-Eye]] computer system. It was the first Grand Slam tournament to use the system. According to many experts,{{who|date=August 2018}} the system was implemented because of a controversial quarterfinal match at the [[2004 U.S. Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} between [[Serena Williams]] and [[Jennifer Capriati]], where important line calls went against Williams.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/09/sports/tennis/williams-receives-apology-and-umpires-open-is-over.html | title=Williams Receives Apology, and Umpire's Open Is Over | author=Chris Broussard | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 9, 2004}}</ref> Instant replay was available only on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts through the 2008 tournament. In 2009, it became available on the Grandstand court.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Starting in 2018, all competition courts are outfitted with Hawk-Eye and all matches in the main draws (Men's and Women's Singles and Doubles) follow the same procedure{{Snd}} each player is allowed 3 incorrect challenges per set, with one more being allowed in a tiebreak.

In 2007, [[JP Morgan Chase]] renewed its sponsorship of the US Open and, as part of the arrangement, the replay system was renamed to "Chase Review" on in-stadium video and television.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/55967 | title=Chase signs mega renewal with Open | accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>
