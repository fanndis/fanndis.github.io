'''''XXL''''' is an American [[hip hop culture|hip hop]] [[magazine]], published by [[Townsquare Media]], founded in 1997.

==History==
In August 1997,<ref>{{cite web|title=Potential Markets|url=http://www.freelancewriting.com/magazinewriting/write-for-music-magazines.php|publisher=Freelance Writing|access-date=December 4, 2015}}</ref> [[Harris Publications]] released the first issue of ''XXL''. It featured rappers [[Jay-Z]] and [[Master P]] on a double cover.<ref name="xxlmag1">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/08/drake-on-the-cover-of-xxls-150th-issue/ |title=Drake On The Cover Of XXL’s 150th Issue|work=XXL mag|date=August 2013|access-date=January 4, 2014}}</ref> In December 2006, ''XXL'' took over the struggling hip-hop producer and DJ magazine ''[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]'' (another publication owned by Harris Publications), re-branding it as ''XXL Presents Scratch Magazine''. However ''Scratch'' shut down less than a year later in September 2007. 

Other titles with limited runs have been launched under the ''XXL'' brand, including ''Hip-Hop Soul'', ''Eye Candy'' and ''[[Shade 45|Shade45]]''. ''XXL'' has released many other special projects including tour programs, mixtapes and exclusive DVDs. ''XXL'' also maintains a popular website, which provides daily hip hop news, original content and content from the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/|title=Hip-Hop News, Rap Music|work=XXL|access-date=October 14, 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, [[Townsquare Media]] acquired ''XXL'',<ref name=bill>{{cite news|author1=Marc Schneider|title=XXL Magazine to Print Quarterly Issues|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6413798/xxl-magazine-print-quarterly-issues-townsquare|access-date=August 17, 2015|work=Billboard|date=December 18, 2014}}</ref> ''[[King (magazine)|King]]'' and ''Antenna'' from Harris Publications.

On October 14, 2014, Townsquare announced it would continue print publication of ''XXL''.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Rob Markman|title=Exclusive: XXL Magazine Isn't Going Out Of Print|work=MTV News|access-date=October 14, 2014|date=October 14, 2014|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1963042/xxl-magazine-isnt-going-out-of-print/ }}</ref> In December 2014 the company reported that the magazine would be published on a monthly basis.<ref name=bill/>

In May 2009, Datwon Thomas resigned from ''XXL'' and executive editor Vanessa Satten, who had been with ''XXL'' since 1998, was named the new Editor-in-Chief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sohh.com/2009/05/former_xxl_editor-in-chie.html|title=Former XXL Editor-In-Chief Looks Beyond Publication, "It Was A Hard Decision"|last=Langhorne|first=Cyrus|date=May 27, 2009|work=Sohh.Com|access-date=January 4, 2014}}</ref>

===Special releases===
[[Image:XXL Presents Shade 45 magazine cover.jpg|thumb|Magazine cover of ''XXL Presents Shade 45'']]

In August 2005, [[Eminem]] and ''XXL'' teamed up to release a special issue titled ''XXL Presents Shade 45'', and was designed to give maximum exposure to [[Shade 45]] as a [[radio station]], and at the same time give maximum exposure to the [[Shady Records]] label as a whole, as well as the radio [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s and [[G-Unit Records]]' artists. 

''XXL'' executive Publisher, Jonathan Rheingold, stated that typically magazines based around particular artists were not favorable, but "since Shade 45 is a truly authentic and uncensored rap radio channel, the marriage with the ''XXL'' brand made sense," with the feeling that it is what would interest rap fans.<ref>Carl Chery (August 23, 2005). [http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/7450/1 Eminem & Shade Collabo W/XXL For Special Radio Issue] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609204644/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/7450/1 |date=June 9, 2008 }}. ''SoHH.com''. Accessed January 29, 2008.</ref> 

In November 2008 ''XXL'' released ''XXL Raps Volume 1'', which included music from [[50 Cent]], [[G-Unit]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Jim Jones]], & [[Fabolous]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/XXL-Raps-Various-Artists/dp/B000BO8SIG |title=XXL Raps, Vol. 1: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=2014-01-04}}</ref> 

In September 2006, ''XXL'' put a special 90 minute DVD called ''XXL DVD Magazine Vol. 1'', which featured exclusive interviews and content with big-name rappers such as [[50 Cent]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Paul Wall]], & [[Mike Jones (rapper)|Mike Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=4543 |title=Saigon & Ice Cube I'm Talkin' To You - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=September 11, 2006|access-date=January 4, 2014}}</ref> 

On August 20, 2013 ''XXL'' released its 150th issue, also celebrating its sixteenth anniversary. The issue featured the first solo cover on the magazine from [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], and rappers such as [[Kendrick Lamar]] and [[B.o.B]] reviewing classic albums.<ref name="xxlmag1" />

==Annual Freshman Class List==
Beginning in 2007 (skipping 2008),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schwab|first1=Isabel|title=The ‘XXL’ Freshman Class List Is a Joke: Kidd Kidd, Iggy Azalea, and More Rap Lunacy|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/03/the-xxl-freshman-class-list-is-a-joke-kidd-kidd-iggy-azalea-and-more-rap-lunacy.html|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=June 19, 2016|date=June 4, 2015}}</ref> ''XXL'' releases its annual "Freshman Class" list. The issue features ten artists-to-watch, all appearing on the cover of the magazine. The list has a history of showcasing unknown/underground rappers, as well as artists considered to be on the rise. The list creates significant [[marketing buzz]] among listeners and artists alike, and is credited for giving many artists their first taste of fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refinedhype.com/hyped/entry/grading-xxls-freshman/ |title=Grading XXL’s Top 10 Freshman List|work=Refinedhype|access-date=January 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name="XXL">{{cite web|url = http://www.xxlmag.com/homepage-highlight/2010/03/xxclusive-xxl%E2%80%99s-10-freshmen-for-%E2%80%9910-cover-revealed/| title = 2010 XXL Freshmen class|publisher=XXL|date=July 14, 2011}}</ref><ref name="XXL2">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/2011-freshman-class/| title = 2011 XXL Freshmen class|publisher=XXL|date=July 14, 2011}}</ref>

Occasionally, the Freshman Class list may contain extra additions to include more rappers. The 2011, 2013, and 2019 Freshman Class lists, for example, had 11 rappers. In the case for the 2013 list, ''XXL'' added an honorary extra spot for Chicago rapper [[Chief Keef]] due to the artist being in a six-day jail stint and therefore being unable to attend the photo shoot in New York City.<ref name="XXL Chief Keef">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1704569/chief-keef-2013-xxl-freshman/|title=2013 XXL Freshman Issue Explained: Why Logic? Where's Chief Keef?|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}</ref> In 2014 and 2020, the Freshman Class lists included 12 rappers.

In 2018, the list was reduced to nine artists following a refusal to appear from Pennsylvania rapper [[Lil Skies]], who accused that year's list of being [[Vote rigging|rigged]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8460651/xxl-freshman-class-2018|title=XXL Announces 2018 Freshman Class, With Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, Trippie Redd & More|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref><ref name="Skies">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-skies-says-he-declined-xxl-freshmen-list-because-its-rigged-news.48738.html|title=Lil Skies Says He Declined XXL Freshmen List Because It's Rigged|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref> Skies' replacement, New York rapper [[Rich the Kid]], declined the list also.<ref name="Rich">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rich-the-kid-says-he-happily-declined-the-2018-xxl-freshmen-list-news.48612.html|title=Rich The Kid Says He "Happily Declined" The 2018 XXL Freshmen List|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref><ref name="Statten">{{Citation|last=Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM|title=Editor-In-Chief Vanessa Statten Breaks Down 2018 XXL Freshman Cover|date=2018-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16kYPMprvQ|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref>

The 2020 list includes, posthumously, an interview of [[Pop Smoke]] who was chosen as the first artist of the class before his death.<ref name="XXL-2020" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/pop-smoke-interview-brooklyn-drill/|title=Pop Smoke on Brooklyn Drill, New York Hip-Hop in Final Interview|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=September 3, 2020|access-date=September 16, 2020}}</ref>
