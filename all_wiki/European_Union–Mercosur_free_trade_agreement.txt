Aside from the threat to the climate, deforestation would directly impact [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazil's indigenous communities]],<ref name="Politico"/> who are already facing a worsening situation. Since becoming President, Bolsonaro has attempted to strip the indigenous agency [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] of its responsibility to identify and demarcate indigenous land<ref name="Resistance"/> and hand that power to the Agriculture ministry.

=== Governments and parliaments===

After Brazilian president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] received much criticism concerning the [[2019 Brazil wildfires|protection of the Amazon rain forest]], both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[France]] voiced concern, and threatened a veto on the agreement unless action is taken by the Brazilian government.<ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/ireland-block-eu-mercosur-trade-deal-amazon-fires-190823095908509.html</ref>

In September 2019, lawmakers on the Austrian parliament's EU subcommittee almost unanimously voted to reject the draft free trade agreement citing concerns over their national farming sector and the Amazon forest fires. As such the government is obliged to veto the pact at EU level, where all 28 member states and their parliaments must agree to trade deals. Lawmakers from the centre-right ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party also voted to reject the deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/austria-rejects-eu-mercosur-trade-deal-over-amazon-fires |title=Austria rejects EU-Mercosur trade deal over Amazon fires; Concerns about threats to farming sector also featured in Austrian parliament debate |first= Philip |last= Oltermann |date=19 September 2019 |work= The Guardian |access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref>

==Finalization, signature and ratification==
[[File:Press conference EU-Mercosul on June 26, 2019 (VII).jpg|thumb|In June 2019, representatives of EU and Mercosur announced they had reached an "historic" agreement]]
After the adoption and publication of the 17-page "agreement in principle" on 1 July 2019, 29 unfinished texts of chapters and annexes of the trade agreement were published in July and September with a disclaimer that they were published "for information purposes only and may undergo further modifications including as a result of the process of legal revision". The essential liberalization schedules for goods, services and investment have not yet been released.<ref>https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=2048</ref>
In the meantime negotiations for the other parts of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement have continued and were concluded on 18 June 2020 with an agreement on the pillars of political dialogue and cooperation, the preamble and the institutional and final provisions.<ref>https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/81950/eu-mercosur-association-agreement-conclusion-negotiations-political-dialogue-and-cooperation_en</ref> This text has not been published yet by the official instances, but was leaked by Greenpeace.<ref>https://trade-leaks.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EU-Mercosur_Association_Agreement_Background_And_Analysis.pdf</ref> Greenpeace condemned the fact that commitments to protect nature or to tackle the climate emergency, as laid down in the  UNFCC Paris Agreement, were not included in the conditions under which either of the parties could sanction the other, or suspend the agreement.<ref>https://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/issues/democracy-europe/45133/eu-mercosur-leaked-treaty-has-no-climate-protection-undermines-democracy/</ref>

Once the texts are final and legally revised they will need to be translated in all EU and Mercosur official languages.<ref name="Vote">{{cite web |title=Will Ireland have a vote on the Mercosur deal? |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/farming/will-ireland-have-a-vote-on-the-mercosur-deal-935735.html |publisher=Irish Examiner |accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref> 
The texts will then be presented by the European Commission to the Council of Ministers of the European Union for approval. In the Council unanimity is required. If approved the Council will sign the agreement and send it over to the Mercosur countries and to the European Parliament. An EU association agreement must also be approved by the national parliaments of all EU member states. Ratification of the agreement by the national parliaments of the Mercosur countries is also required.<ref name="aljazeera">{{cite web |title=Mercosur bloc leaders meet to fast-track EU trade deal |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/mercosur-bloc-leaders-meet-fast-track-eu-trade-deal-190717201223242.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref> All together this is a process that may take many years in itself.<ref name="Means"/> However in the EU the trade part of the agreement (and some elements of the preamble, institutional and final provisions) may already be implemented provisionally after the ratification by the Mercosur and the approval of the European Parliament.
The European Commission may also decide to present the trade pillar as a separate trade agreement. If the Mercosur countries and the Council agree with that, the separate trade agreement does not need to be approved by the parliaments of the EU member states (as trade is an exclusive EU competence), the approval of the European Parliament suffices.<ref name="Vote">{{cite web |title=Will Ireland have a vote on the Mercosur deal? |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/farming/will-ireland-have-a-vote-on-the-mercosur-deal-935735.html |publisher=Irish Examiner |accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref> What is left of the association agreement must still be approved by all the national parliaments and cannot be implemented provisionally.<ref>https://www.transportenvironment.org/publications/briefing-life-cycle-eu-trade-agreements</ref>

There are a number of potential barriers that could stop the deal from being ratified. For example, the election of a more left-wing candidate in the [[2019 Argentine general election]].<ref name="Means"/> The increased presence of environmentalists in the European Parliament following the [[2019 European Parliament election|2019 election]] has also been noted.<ref name="Means"/> ''[[The Economist]]'' speculates that distance and other priorities may cause of a loss of interest similar to that which delayed the talks for so long.<ref name="closer ties"/>
