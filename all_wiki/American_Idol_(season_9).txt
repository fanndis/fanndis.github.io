In addition, [[Simon Cowell]] announced shortly before the ninth season began that it would be his last season on ''American Idol''.

After her departure, DioGuardi helped and nominated [[Steven Tyler]] for a role as a judge on season ten to the show's producers.

The semi-final format used through the fourth through seventh seasons was revived for this season. Starting with 12 women and 12 men, the women and men perform on weekly separate shows and on the result shows, the bottom 2 women and the bottom 2 men are eliminated from the competition. The semi-finals took place over three weeks until there are six women and six men forming the top 12.

From this point on in the show, this season's exit song, "[[Leave Right Now]]" by [[Will Young]], was played over eliminations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632697/20100225/index.jhtml|title='American Idol' Reveals New Exit Song: 'Leave Right Now'|first=Katie|last=Byrne|publisher=MTV|date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=April 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304030554/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632697/20100225/index.jhtml|archive-date=March 4, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Controversies ==

===Ethnic voting bias===
Since the [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh season]], the voting results are seemingly skewed towards white contestants, and critics believe that it was white female viewers who vote only for white male contestants. During top 20 week, all four eliminated contestants were non-white. This season had the fewest non-white finalists. This led to criticism of bias in favor of white contestants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/03/american-idol-top-20-week-in-review-teen-girl-dreams-and-ethnic-cleansing.html|title='American Idol' Top 20 week in review: Teen girl dreams and ethnic cleansing|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Reiher|first=Andrea|date=March 5, 2010|accessdate=April 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909002755/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/03/american-idol-top-20-week-in-review-teen-girl-dreams-and-ethnic-cleansing.html|archive-date=September 9, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Chris Golightly===
Chris Golightly was originally selected as semi-finalist. According to reports, Golightly was disqualified on February 17, 2010, after already being told he was in the top 24, over an old contract. The contract had expired by the time the top 24 began to tape, but they disqualified him because he was under contract at the time of the tryouts, in violation of ''Idol'' rules. He was later replaced by Tim Urban at the last minute of the last part of Hollywood Week.<ref>

===Semi-final eliminations===
The semi-final eliminations of early favorites [[Alex Lambert]], Katelyn Epperly and Lilly Scott before the Top 12 stunned bloggers and viewers. Michael Slezak of [[Entertainment Weekly]] stated, "So you'd think by season 9 — during the inconsequential semifinals, no less — it would be easy to brush off the bad judgment of speed-texting tweens, to process the way-too-early exits of Lilly Scott, Katelyn Epperly, and Alex Lambert...and move on...(S)o why do the ritual killings of the dreams of (three) indisputably flawed semifinalists feel like they’re part of something bigger, a shifting of the tectonic plates at the core of the Idol universe?"<ref>Slezak, Michael. http://www.ew.com/recap/american-idol-recap-season-9-episode-21 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414045319/http://www.ew.com/recap/american-idol-recap-season-9-episode-21 |date=April 14, 2016 }}.
