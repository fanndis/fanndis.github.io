At the BRICS leaders meeting in [[St Petersburg]] in September 2013, China committed $41 billion towards the pool; Brazil, India, and Russia $18 billion each; and South Africa $5 billion. China, holder of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves and contributes the bulk of the currency pool, wants a more significant managing role, said one BRICS official. China also wants to be the location of the reserve. "Brazil and India want the initial capital to be shared equally. We know that China wants more," said a Brazilian official.

</ref>  One driver for the BRICS development bank is that the existing institutions primarily benefit extra-BRICS corporations, and the political significance is notable because it allows BRICS member states "to promote their interests abroad... and can highlight the strengthening positions of countries whose opinion is frequently ignored by their developed American and European colleagues."

In March 2014, at a meeting on the margins of the [[Nuclear Security Summit]] in The Hague, the BRICS Foreign Ministers issued a communique that "noted with concern, the recent media statement on the forthcoming [[G20]] Summit to be held in [[Brisbane]] in November 2014. The custodianship of the G20 belongs to all Member States equally, and no one Member State can unilaterally determine its nature and character." In light of the tensions surrounding the [[2014 Crimean crisis]], the Ministers remarked that "The escalation of hostile language, sanctions and counter-sanctions, and force does not contribute to a sustainable and peaceful solution, according to international law, including the principles and purposes of the [[United Nations]] Charter."<ref>

In March 2015, [[Morgan Stanley]] stated that India and Indonesia had escaped from the 'fragile five' (the five major emerging markets with the most fragile currencies) by instituting economic reforms. Previously, in August 2013, Morgan Stanley rated India and Indonesia, together with Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa, as the 'fragile five' due to their vulnerable currencies. But since then, India and Indonesia have reformed their economies, completing 85% and 65% of the necessary adjustments respectively, while Brazil had only achieved 15%, Turkey only 10%, and South Africa even less.<ref>

==Financial architecture==

Currently, there are two components that make up the financial architecture of BRICS, namely, the New Development Bank (NDB), or sometimes referred to as the BRICS Development Bank, and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA). Both of these components were signed into treaty in 2014 and became active in 2015.

===BRICS payment system===

At the [[7th BRICS summit|2015 BRICS summit]] in Russia, ministers from BRICS nations, initiated consultations for a payment system that would be an alternative to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]] system. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov stated in an interview, "The finance ministers and executives of the BRICS [[central bank]]s are negotiating ... setting up payment systems and moving on to settlements in national currencies. SWIFT or not, in any case we’re talking about ... a global multilateral payment system that would provide greater independence, would create a definite guarantee for BRICS."{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The [[Central Bank of Russia]] (CBR) also started consultations with BRICS nations for a payment system that would be an alternative to the SWIFT system. The main benefits highlighted were [[backup]] and redundancy in case there were disruptions to the SWIFT system. The Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, stated in an interview, "The only topic that may be of interest to all of us within BRICS is to consider and talk over the possibility of setting up a system that would apply to the BRICS countries, used as a backup."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://in.rbth.com/economics/2015/06/01/russia_offers_to_discuss_brics_prototype_of_swift_global_system_43421 |title=Russia offers to discuss BRICS prototype of SWIFT global system |work=Russia & India Report |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>

China has also initiated the development of their own payment system called CIPS, that would be an alternative to the SWIFT system. The [[Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System]] ('''CIPS''') is a planned alternative payment system to [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]] which would provide a network that enables [[financial institution]]s worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized, and reliable environment.<ref name="Reuters1">

On 9 April 2013, Isobel Coleman from the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], director of CFR's Civil Society, Markets, and Democracy Program said that members of BRICS share a lack of consensus. They uphold drastically different political systems, from a vibrant democracy in Brazil to entrenched [[oligarchy]] in Russia, and their economies are little integrated and are different in size by orders of magnitude. Also, she states that the significant difference in GDP influences the reserves. China taking up over 41% of the contribution, which in turn leads to bigger political say within the association.<ref>

Vijay Prashad, author and the [[Edward Said]] Chair at the [[American University of Beirut]], has shed light on the limits of the BRICS as a political and economic 'locomotive of the South' for the states concerned, according to Prashad, follow neoliberal policies. They have established neither new counter-balancing institutions nor come up with an alternative [[ideology]]. Furthermore, the BRICS project, argues Prashad, has no ability to challenge the primacy of the United States and [[NATO]].<ref>Prashad, Vijay 2014.
