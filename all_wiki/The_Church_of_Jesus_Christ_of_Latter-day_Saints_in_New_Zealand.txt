==History==

New Zealand was already deeply religious with many Christian sects by the time [[Missionaries (LDS Church)|Mormon missionaries]] arrived.<ref name="Mormon and Maori">{{cite book|last1=Troughton|first1=Geoffrey|title=New Zealand Jesus: Social and Religious Transformations of an Image|date=November 2011}}</ref> Formal LDS Church missionary proselytizing began on 20 October 1854 by William Cooke and Thomas Holden, under the direction of [[mission president]] Augustus Farnham. All three men left for the island from the United States on the ''William Denney''. However, due to lack of materials and interested individuals, the initial work was slow up until the 1870s when missionaries had more resources.<ref name="zion in nz">{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Brian W.|title=Zion in New Zealand|date=1977|publisher=Church College of New Zealand|location=Temple view, New Zealand}}</ref> These first proselyting efforts began as part of the Australasian Missionary efforts. In 1855, the first [[Branch (LDS Church)|branch]] of the LDS Church was organized at Karori, with the next organized in Kaiapoi in 1867.<ref name="Mormon and Maori" /> The first stakes of New Zealand were created in Auckland on 18 May 1958, and then in Hamilton and Hawkes Bay in 1960.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|93}} On 4 August 1897 the Australasian [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] was divided to give New Zealand its own respective mission.<ref name="zion in nz" /> The mission was again divided in May 1958 to include a New Zealand South portion.<ref name="zion in nz" /> As of May 2017, New Zealand now has three missions based in Auckland, Wellington, and Hamilton, respectively.<ref name="mormon newsroom">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Richard|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts {{!}} Total Church Membership|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/new-zealand|website=Mormon Newsroom|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> The LDS Church continues to hold a notable and respected presence in New Zealand, the first account being when Colonial Minister of Native affairs praised Mormonism for bringing good citizens to his nation back in 1912.<ref name="ottley journal">{{cite web|last1=Ottley|first1=Sidney James|title=Journal vol. 1|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/MMD/id/45179|website=Mormon Missionary Diaries|publisher=Harold B. Lee Library}}</ref>

Despite the country being more than three quarters Māori, primitive missionary efforts focused on teaching the English-speaking Europeans living within New Zealand.<ref name="unto the island">{{cite book|last1=Britsch|first1=R. Lanier|title=Unto the islands of the sea: a history of the Latter-day Saints in the Pacific|date=1986|publisher=Deseret Book|location=Salt Lake City, UT|isbn=9780877477549}}</ref>{{rp|284}} It was not until the 1880s that missionary efforts shifted from exclusively preaching to the [[Pakeha]] (Caucasians) to branching out to the native Māori population.<ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|253}} The early success that Mormon missionaries had amidst Māori has been thought to be because the Mormon religion was founded in the United States. One theory was that the churches associated with the British were despised by these natives, and the LDS Church was more accepted as a result. Other theories attribute Mormon success in New Zealand to early Christian missionaries who first began to persuade the natives out of their traditional habits that were alarming to Europeans and contrary to Mormon standards of living (cannibalism, nudism, etc.), thereby creating a more Westernized people for the Mormons to indoctrinate.<ref name="Mormon and Maori" /><ref name="zion in nz" />

==Māori translations==
By 1886 translation of the Word of Wisdom and the Articles of Faith was completed by Ezra F. Richards.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|23}} In this same year attempts to translate the Book of Mormon began by various elders and mission presidents, the most notable being Ezra F. Richards and Sondra Sanders, although some records state that William T. Steward and James Jury were other notable translators.<ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|278}}  On 26 April 1887, a home in the Waiapu District was dedicated for the translation of the Book of Mormon and in November of that same year, translation of the book was officially completed.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|24}} The first editions of the Book of Mormon in the [[Māori language]] were published by the Star Publishing Company of Auckland. The entire cost of £371 to print the Book of Mormon was paid for by local New Zealand church members.<ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|279}} In 1917, the second edition was published after extensive edits were made by [[Matthew Cowley]] under the direction of James N. Lambert. Shortly after its publication, Cowley was again called to start the translation of other sacred texts. With the help of Wiremu Duncan and Stuart Meha, the ''Doctrine and Covenants'' and ''Pearl of Great Price'' were translated and eventually published in 1919.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|25}}

==State Involvement==
===Māori Language Act of 1987===
Prior to the [[Māori Language Act 1987|Māori Language Act]] (MLA), the church operated only in English. The MLA declared Māori as an official language of New Zealand and greatly encouraged biculturalism into the church. Following the MLA, the church removed language restrictions from its meetings, blessings, and more importantly funerals, a sacred Māori practice. The first noted church events under the MLA include the dedication of the LDS [[marae]] (community center) and [[wharenui]] (large ceremonial house). These buildings were dedicated in 1994 at the [[Church College of New Zealand|Church College]], with prayers in Māori.<ref name="pioneers in the pacific" />

===Church schools===
After seeing a growing need for education in Māori villages, the LDS Church opened elementary schools to teach children in the English Language.<ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|288}} As early as 1877, multiple efforts were made to start private schools that were eventually closed due to lack of interest or to government schools opening in similar geographic areas.<ref name="zion in nz" /><ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|288}} A government policy passed in 1922 caused more primary schools to open and for all schools to undergo inspection. Most church schools did not pass this inspection. Despite the mass reduction in church schools, one school, the Māori Agricultural College, was opened as an effort to educate local Mormons in agriculture as well as to combine secular knowledge with the spiritual. The school was dedicated in 1913 by Orson D. Romney.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|35}} The school had strong music and sports programs and the majority of its teachers and supplies came from the United States.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|41}} In 1915, the church invested in 136 acres of land to add to the school. On this land they began raising pigs, chickens and other farm animals as an added means of income.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|43}} Despite the school's growth, church leaders in Salt Lake City were concerned with its lack of matriculate growth and prestige and considered closing it down. Before this order could be made official, however, the Napier earthquake of 1931 destroyed the building and ended its use.<ref name="Mormon and Maori" /><ref name="zion in nz" />

[[File:TempleViewChurchCollege.jpg|thumb|Church College of New Zealand with the New Zealand temple in the background]]
Years later, under the direction of the church and a local desire to reinstate a church-run school, the [[Church College of New Zealand]] was built and later dedicated on 24 April 1958.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|20}} The college experienced great success, and on 11 January 1958, 18 American teachers were sent on the ''Mariposa'' to meet the needs of the area. What was different about this new college church was the emphasis to hire fully qualified teachers.<ref name="Mormon and Maori" /> In addition to involvement in formal education, the church also began to operate the [[Church Educational System#Seminaries|seminary program]] in New Zealand. In 1968, the first seminary class was held in Kaikohe.<ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|337}} In 1970, the seminary program was officially instituted in the country.<ref name="zion in nz" />

===Government relations===
The church experienced various interactions with local New Zealand leaders. One of the first recorded incidents took place in 1902 when the mission president requested that various elders be given permission to perform weddings. The request was denied, and he took legal measures to re-appeal. He eventually received permission for two elders.<ref name="zion in nz" /><ref name="unto the island"/> In 1917 a temporary missionary ban was instituted. This ban was formed under the premise that American missionaries were allegedly trying to convince Māori to move to the United States with them.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|53}} <ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|296}}

==1921 report of miraculous language comprehension==
In 1921, [[David O. McKay]] and Hugh J. Cannon began a Pacific-wide tour of the Church. McKay was the first apostle to visit New Zealand; celebrations were organized to commemorate the event. On 21 April 1921, they were received with various cultural performances, athletic competitions, and feasts of local cuisine. After the celebration concluded, a more spiritual meeting was held. Regarding his remarks, McKay felt strongly that he should deliver his address without translation.<ref name="unto the island" />{{rp|304}} Multiple accounts state that during his address to the native Māori people, McKay was initially going to have a translator. When he went up to speak, however, he decided that a translation would inhibit the power of his message and decided to give the speech in English instead. Despite this language barrier, Māori people recall being able to understand his talk with complete clarity. In fact, when the message was eventually translated into Māori, many natives who were in attendance offered up correct translations of the speech from what they understood (regardless of the message being delivered in English).<ref name="zion in nz" />  Members attributed their comprehension of the English speech to the [[Gifts of the Spirit in Mormonism|gift of tongues]].<ref name="pioneers in the pacific" /><ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|55}}

==Contemporary history==
In 2020, the LDS Church canceled services and other public gatherings indefinitely in response to the spread of the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>Lovett, Ian.

Groundbreaking for the [[Hamilton New Zealand Temple]] was held on 21 December 1955.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|31}} Following construction, a general public open house was held from 23 March to 13 April 1958, with the dedication by LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[David O. McKay]] taking place seven days later on 20 April 1958.<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|85}} Other officials from Salt Lake City in attendance included [[Delbert L. Stapley]], [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], and [[Marion G. Romney]].<ref name="zion in nz" />{{rp|88}}
