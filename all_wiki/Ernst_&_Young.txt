==History==
===Early history and mergers===
EY resulted from several mergers of ancestor firms over the last century and a half, the oldest of which  was founded in 1849, in England, as Harding & Pullein. That same year, this firm was joined by an accountant named Frederick Whinney, who, a decade later, became a partner. After his son joined the firm, it was later renamed Whinney, Smith & Whinney, in 1894.<ref name="history">[http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Our-history "Ernst & Young – History"]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715172635/http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Our-history|date=15 July 2009}}. Ernst & Young. Retrieved 9 July 2011.</ref>

In 1903, the firm '''Ernst & Ernst''' was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, by [[Alwin C. Ernst]], and his brother, Theodore Ernst. In 1906, '''Arthur Young & Co. ''' was set up by a Scotsman accountant, [[Arthur Young (accountant)|Arthur Young]], in Chicago. Starting in 1924, these two American firms became allied with prominent British firms; Young with Broads Paterson & Co.; and Ernst with the aforementioned Whinney Smith & Whinney. The latter of these two mergers spawned Anglo-American partnership '''Ernst & Whinney''' in 1979, then the fourth largest accountancy firm in the world.<ref name="history" />

A decade later, in 1989, Ernst & Whinney merged with the fifth largest firm globally at the time, Arthur Young & Co., to create '''Ernst & Young'''.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DE1E38F93BA25756C0A96F948260 "Reports Say Arthur Young and Ernst May Merge"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 1989.</ref>

===Later developments===
In October 1997, Ernst & Young announced plans to merge its global practices with professional services network [[KPMG]], to create the largest professional services organization in the world. The announcement came on the heels of an announced merger between [[Price Waterhouse]] and [[Coopers & Lybrand]] only a month earlier. These plans were soon abandoned in February 1998, due to several factors ranging from client opposition, antitrust issues, cost problems, and the anticipated difficulty of merging the two diverse firms and cultures.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/56509.stm "Accountancy Merger Off"]. [[BBC News]]. 23 February 1998. Retrieved 9 July 2011.</ref> The merger between Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, however, went ahead as planned, creating [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/Company-history/Chronology-14.aspx |title=Chronology |access-date=27 September 2010 |publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010183230/http://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/Company-history/Chronology-14.aspx |archive-date=10 October 2010 }}</ref>

Ernst & Young expanded its consulting practice heavily during the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], and various members of the investment community, began to raise concerns about a potential conflict of interests. This conflict would be brought about by firms offering both consulting and auditing services simultaneously to overlapping clients, a common practice among the "Big Five". In May 2000, Ernst & Young was the first of those firms to fully separate its consulting practices via a sale to the French IT services company [[Capgemini]] for $11&nbsp;billion, creating the new company Capgemini Ernst & Young, which was later renamed back to [[Capgemini]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E6D81339F932A35750C0A9669C8B63 "Capgemini to Acquire Ernst & Young Consulting Business"].

In April 2009, [[Reuters]] reported that Ernst & Young, spurred by the global economic downturn, had launched a cost-saving initiative encouraging its staff in [[China]] to take 40 days of low-pay leave between the summer of 2009 and the summer of 2010. Those who participated got a prorated salary equal to 20% of a regular salary, plus the benefits of a full-time employee. The initiative applied to employees in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[mainland China]], where the firm's employees numbered 8,500 in total.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKHKG25976420090416|title=Ernst & Young China Staff to Take Low-Pay Leave|author=Chen, George|date=16 April 2009|work=Reuters}}</ref> In 2010, Ernst & Young acquired Terco, the Brazilian member firm of [[Grant Thornton]].<ref>[http://www.gti.org/Press-room/Brazil-member-firm-departure.asp Grant Thornton confirms departure of Brazilian member firm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114060135/http://www.gti.org/Press-room/Brazil-member-firm-departure.asp |date=14 November 2011 }} Grant Thornton, 3 August 2010</ref>

==Services==
Over the course of its operations, EY has transformed its business model and diversified its pool of offered services. Over the course of the last decade EY has substantially altered its business approach to offer a more comprehensive scope of services. This is mainly attributed to an intensified competition in the existing market of professional services, and competition in new markets: [[investment banking]] and strategic consultancy. According to the latest published data, the company has the following four main service lines:<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/gl/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-ey-reports-strong-global-revenue-growth-in-2017#BetterWorkingWorld |title=EY reports record global revenues in 2016 – up by 9% |access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref>
