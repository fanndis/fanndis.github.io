<blockquote>Gordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk's point that President Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics."

<blockquote>"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly.

In his testimony before the Committee, Sondland said that after the email exchange in which Taylor had expressed concerns about withholding the security assistance he called Trump asking for clarity on exactly what he wanted.  He said he clearly remembered the call and characterized it saying, “it was a very short, abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. And he just said, ‘I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky to do the right thing.'” 
''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted that adjusting for time differences, the call would have taken place between 12:31 a.m. Eastern time and 5:19 a.m. and the White House reported no record of a September 9 call between Trump and Sondland.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Trump’s big, ‘exonerating’ piece of Ukraine evidence takes a hit |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/28/trumps-big-exonerating-piece-ukraine-evidence-takes-hit/ |website=The Washington Post |access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref>

Three weeks later, on November 5, and following the testimony of other senior national security officials who told lawmakers that security assistance was also used to try to compel the Ukrainians to open investigations that might be of benefit to the Trump 2020 campaign, Sondland said that the testimony of the others had "refreshed" his memory, and he provided updated testimony stating that he did, in fact, view delivery of the aid package as contingent upon the Ukrainian government making a public statement reopening the investigation into Burisma as desired by the President.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/5/20950019/gordon-sondland-testimony-update-impeachment|title=Gordon Sondland dramatically changes his testimony in impeachment inquiry|last=Prokop|first=Andrew|date=November 5, 2019|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref> According to the testimony, he relayed this position to Ukrainian government officials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html|title=Sondland Updates Impeachment Testimony, Describing Ukraine Quid Pro Quo|last=Schmidt|first=Michael S.|date=2019-11-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In early November, [[Fiona Hill (presidential advisor)|Fiona Hill]] testified that Sondland, as a newcomer unaccustomed to diplomatic protocols, exhibited behavior that was "comical" but "deeply concerning," and his lack of adherence to security protocols made him a "counterintelligence risk." Hill testified that in July, Sondland attended a meeting with Ukrainian officials and told them that an Oval Office meeting with Trump would occur if investigations began. She testified, "Ambassador Sondland blurted out: 'Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff ([[Mick Mulvaney]]) for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start,'" and that [[John Bolton]] ended the meeting abruptly and later told her, "I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Santucci |first1=Jeanine |title=5 takeaways from the impeachment inquiry testimony of Fiona Hill, former White House adviser on Russia |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/08/impeachment-testimony-5-takeaways-fiona-hill-transcript/2530101001/ |access-date=November 20, 2019 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=November 8, 2019}}</ref> In her public testimony, Hill later apologized for implying that Sondland's diplomatic activities were part of an irregular channel, saying, "I wasn’t really being fair to Ambassador Sondland because he was carrying out what he thought he had been instructed to carry out and we were doing something that we thought was just as, or perhaps even more important, but it wasn’t in the same channel."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/67442/fiona-hill-a-domestic-political-errand-eclipsed-the-regular-channel-on-ukraine-policy/|title=Fiona Hill: A “Domestic Political Errand” Eclipsed the “Regular Channel” on Ukraine Policy|last=Brannen|first=Kate|date=November 22, 2019|website=Just Security|access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-testimonies-from-fiona-hill-and-david-holmes-filled-in-sondlands-gaps|title=How testimonies from Fiona Hill and David Holmes filled in Sondland’s ‘gaps’|date=November 21, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref>

On November 13, [[William B. Taylor Jr.|William Taylor]], the acting head of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, testified that a staff member, who was later identified as [[David Holmes (diplomat)|David Holmes]], told him that he overheard a phone conversation about Ukraine "investigations" between Sondland and the president at a restaurant in [[Kyiv]].  The call was made the day following Trump's phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked Zelensky to investigate corruption. Taylor said there were two other people having lunch in the restaurant, and they heard the conversation as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brenner |first1=Tom |title=Trump is throwing Sondland under the bus.

Holmes also testified that Sondland later told him that Trump "did not give a shit about Ukraine" and "only cared about the big stuff ... the big stuff that benefits the president like the Biden investigation that [[Rudy Giuliani|Mr. Giuliani]] was pushing." Sondland was also heard telling Trump that Zelensky "loves your ass".<ref>{{cite web |title=Witness overheard US ambassador tell Trump that Ukraine would investigate Biden |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/politics/holmes-testimony-sondland-call/index.html |website=CNN |access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> U.S. security experts were alarmed by the fact that Sondland called a U.S. president on an unsecured line in a public place, particularly in Ukraine, where calls are assumed to be monitored by Russia.<ref> L.A.

On November 16, the House impeachment investigators released the closed-door testimony of former National Security Council official [[Tim Morrison (presidential advisor)|Tim Morrison]].  Morrison voiced concerns saying that during the time that he had worked with Sondland he was not following the normal diplomatic process as used by other personnel but rather was on "a second track," chiefly led by Sondland, "where Rudy Giuliani's name would come up." Morrison also testified that he and Ambassador Taylor "had no reason to believe that the release of security-sector assistance might be conditioned on a public statement reopening the Burisma investigation until [his] September 1, 2019 conversation with Ambassador Sondland."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/e6b5c1b4adbc40dda0bb4f7fba8bae1d|title=Ex-Trump aide confirms Ukraine aid was linked to Biden probe|date=November 1, 2019|work=Associated Press|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref> Morrison said that on September 7, Sondland told him of a phone call he'd had from Trump in which the president said, "that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it."<ref>{{cite web |title=Ex-NSC official corroborates Sondland said he was directed by Trump on Ukraine |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/politics/jennifer-williams-tim-morrison-house-impeachment-deposition-transcripts/index.html |website=CNN |access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> During his public testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives on November 19, 2019, Morrison stated that Sondland confirmed to him that there was indeed a [[quid pro quo]] for US aid to Ukraine and Sondland told him this following a telephone conversation Sondland had with Ukraine official [[Andriy Yermak]] on September 1, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/19/20973157/impeachment-hearings-morrison-quid-pro-quo-ukraine|title=One of the Republicans' witnesses confirmed a quid pro quo on TV|first=Alex|last=Ward|publisher=Vox|date=2019-11-19|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>

In his public testimony on November 20, Sondland said it was at the "express direction of the president" that he, [[Kurt Volker]], and [[Rick Perry]], commonly referred to as [[Three Amigos|"the three amigos,"]]  worked with Giuliani on Ukraine matters even though they were uncomfortable with Giuliani's role.

===Trump impeachment trial===

During the [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump]] which began on January 16, 2020, and ended on February 5, ''The Washington Post'' wrote that Sondland's House testimony played a "central role" in the trial, reporting that House testimony was used both for and against a case for Trump's alleged attempt to use a ''quid pro quo'' to persuade Zelensky to deliver dirt on Biden in exchange for congressional funding for Ukraine.  Lead impeachment manager [[Adam B. Schiff|Adam Schiff]] opened with a Sondland statement in which he said , “Was there a ''quid pro quo''?  As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.”  But Trump's attorneys used Sondland's earlier statement wherein he said that Trump told him that he wanted “no ''quid pro quo''” and what they saw as Sondland's "tendency to portray his uninformed opinions and presumptions as fact"<ref>{{cite web |title=Gordon Sondland plugs away in Brussels while playing a central role in Trump’s impeachment trial |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gordon-sondland-plugs-away-in-brussels-while-playing-a-central-role-in-trumps-impeachment-trial/2020/01/22/13fb1902-3c85-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html |website=The Washington Post |access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref>
