== History ==
The company was founded by [[Henry Jarvis Raymond]] and [[George Jones (publisher)|George Jones]] in New York City. The first edition of the newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'', published on September 18, 1851, stated: "We publish today the first issue of the New-York Daily Times, and we intend to issue it every morning (Sundays excepted) for an indefinite number of years to come."<ref name="timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1851.html |title=Timeline |access-date=September 29, 2008 |publisher=The New York Times Company |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914122138/http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1851.html |archive-date=September 14, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The company moved into the cable channel industry purchasing a 40% interest in the Popcorn Channel, a theatrical movie preview and local movie times, in November 1994.<ref>(November 28, 1994).

In October, The Times reached an agreement to buy The Post's 50 percent stake in the venture for about $70 million -- in part, The Post said, by threatening to start a rival paper overseas. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 2, 2003 |access-date=August 29, 2008}}</ref>
