'''''An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History''''' is a 2000 [[coffee table book]] written by [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]].  Published by [[Simon & Schuster]], it describes life at the  [[White House]] during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], including the renovation and refurbishment projects that were done and the emphasis on [[American cuisine]].<ref name="nydn-rev"/>

==Background and writing==
Plans for the book were announced publicly in April 1999.<ref name="cnn-ann">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9904/15/hillary.book/index.html | title=Hillary Rodham Clinton plans book on White House entertaining | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=April 15, 1999}}</ref>  A spokesperson for the publisher said that Clinton had first thought of the idea for the book a year and a half earlier.<ref name="wapo-prep">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/10/04/white-house-welcome/2be3bfdd-e26b-420b-a7f0-f9df48cc373b/ | title=White House Welcome | first=Roxanne | last=Roberts | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 4, 2000}}</ref>

Clinton worked on the book during the [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000]], often writing notes or text out longhand in between campaign stops.<ref name="wapo-prep"/>  Writer Cheryl Merser was stated to be assisting Clinton with the research and writing of the work;<ref name="cnn-ann"/> she met with Clinton twice during this period.<ref name="wapo-prep"/>  The book was completed during summer 2000,<ref name="wapo-prep"/> but publication of it was held up until after the Senate election, to avoid the appearance that Clinton was using the book to gain an advantage with her time as First Lady.<ref name="nydn-rev"/><ref name="nyt-rev"/>  Thus the book was released shortly before the author left the White House to take her seat in the [[United States Senate]].<ref name="ct-rev"/>

==Themes of the book==
The book is the most traditional of Clinton's publications, having less to do with politicking than with hostessing.  In particular, it sought to portray the author as "a keeper of tradition".<ref name="ct-rev">{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-11-28/news/0011280129_1_white-house-historical-association-first-lady-blue-room | title=As She Departs, First Lady Hails White House History In New Book | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=November 28, 2000}}</ref>  Clinton received no advance and sales proceeds for the $35 book were given to the [[White House Historical Association]],<ref name="wapo-prep"/><ref name="ct-rev"/> a private, non-profit organization with a mission to enhance the public's understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment of the White House.  That association also holds the book's copyright.<ref name="front"/>

The book's foreword is by [[J. Carter Brown]], former director of the [[National Gallery of Art]].  Its introduction is by historian [[Carl Sferrazza Anthony]].  Chapters of the book include ones that discuss the historical aspects of the White House, what goes on behind the scenes, how White House functions celebrate arts and culture and Americans of accomplishment, and traditions associated with the winter holidays.  Much attention is given to the two-year renovation of the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]].<ref name="wapo-prep"/>  The final 90 pages of the book are devoted to various recipes of the White House Kitchens.<ref name="front">''An Invitation to the White House'', Front matter.</ref>  The volume contains over 350 color and black-and-white photographs.  Most were taken by various photographers of the White House Photo Office, including [[Ralph Alswang (photographer)|Ralph Alswang]] and [[Barbara Kinney]],<ref name="photo"/> along with never-before-published family photographs.<ref name="wapo-prep"/>  Many of the photographs of food items were taken by [[Romulo Yanes]].<ref name="photo">''An Invitation to the White House'', Photo credits on p. 304.</ref>

It contains a general allusion to the controversies and investigations that the Clintons were the subject of during their time in the White House.<ref name="ct-rev"/>  But it does not discuss any of them in particular; the only mention of the [[Lincoln Bedroom]] makes no reference to the [[Lincoln Bedroom for contributors controversy]].<ref name="nydn-rev"/>  Nor does it discuss Clinton's feelings or inner thoughts about being First Lady;<ref name="nyt-rev"/> that would have to come with her 2003 memoir ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]''.<ref name="nyt-pub"/>

==Critical and commercial reception==
The publisher, [[Simon & Schuster]], undertook a publicity campaign for the book and two others on American design as part of the holiday buying season.<ref name="nyt-pub">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/02/style/02iht-hill.t.html | title=Lavish Album Reveals Clinton Era's White House Makeover: Hillary, Decorator in Chief | first=Linda | last=Hales | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 2, 2001}}</ref>  The book's appearance also coincided with the 200th&nbsp;anniversary of the White House itself and several other books on that subject.<ref name="nyt-pub"/>  A book party was held at the White House in December 2000 with over 300&nbsp;guests.<ref name="nyt-pub"/>  The book sold well, spending nine weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for hardcover non-fiction, peaking at number five.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/bsp/besthardnonfiction.html | title=Best Sellers Plus: Nonfiction Hardcover | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 11, 2001}} This is the last entry on the list before dropping into 'Also Selling'.

The photography and scheme of illustrations in the book was generally characterized as "glossy" or "lavish".<ref name="wapo-prep"/><ref name="nyt-rev"/><ref name="nyt-pub"/><ref name="ap-rev-sc"/>  Regarding its content, [[Marian Burros]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that <blockquote>At the very moment Hillary Rodham Clinton has shattered the mold of First Lady by winning a Senate seat, she is also celebrating the traditional side of her life for the last eight years, as chatelaine of the Executive Mansion. ... she makes a case that a policy wonk can also pour her energies into the entertaining and 'cookie baking' side of being First Lady.<ref name="nyt-rev">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/12/style/a-peek-inside-the-house-if-not-the-woman.html | title=A Peek Inside the House, If Not the Woman | first=Marian | last=Burros | authorlink=Marian Burros | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date= November 12, 2000}}</ref> </blockquote> Lawrence L. Knutson of the [[Associated Press]] wrote that "The closest that the book comes to political or policy debate is a description of the intense inner-circle deliberations on choosing the right shade of deep sapphire blue for the Blue Room's new look."<ref name="ap-rev-sc">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/95106097/?terms=hillary%2B%22An%2BInvitation%2Bto%2Bthe%2BWhite%2BHouse%22 | title=First lady authors White House tribute | first=Lawrence L. | last=Knutson | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] | date=November 26, 2000 | page=B6 | via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>  Sherryl Connolly of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' wrote that <blockquote>the surprise of this book is Clinton's spotlighting her domestic duties â€“ when for eight years she has worked so determinedly to expand the role beyond the traditional and expected. But there she is, pictured fingering carpet swatches and fussing over the flower arrangements for last year's millennium celebration dinner.<ref name="nydn-rev">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/white-house-pages-books-hillary-showcase-historic-home-article-1.893190 | title=White House Pages: Books by Hillary, others, showcase the historic home | first=Sherryl | last=Connolly | newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York | date=November 14, 2000}}</ref></blockquote>
