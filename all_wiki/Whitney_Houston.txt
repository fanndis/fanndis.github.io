'''Whitney Elizabeth Houston''' (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American singer and actress.<!-- NOTE: The lead sentence should stick to what she was primarily known for. The infobox is there to include additional occupations.--> She was certified as the [[List of awards and nominations received by Whitney Houston|most awarded female artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' and is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling recording artists of all time]], with sales of over 200 million records worldwide. Houston released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have been certified diamond, multi-platinum, platinum, or gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). She is regarded as one of the greatest artists of all time. Her crossover appeal on the popular music charts as well as her prominence on [[MTV]] influenced several [[African Americans|African-American]] female artists.

Houston began singing in church as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school. With the guidance of [[Arista Records]] chairman [[Clive Davis]], she signed to the label at age 19. Her first two studio albums, ''[[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]]'' (1985) and ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'' (1987), both peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and are among the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. She is the only artist to have seven consecutive number-one singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, from "[[Saving All My Love for You]]" in 1985 to "[[Where Do Broken Hearts Go]]" in 1988. 

Houston's third studio album, ''[[I'm Your Baby Tonight]]'' (1990), yielded two ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one singles; "[[I'm Your Baby Tonight (song)|I'm Your Baby Tonight]]", and "[[All the Man That I Need]]" and was certified quintuple platinum by [[RIAA]]. Houston made her acting debut with the romantic thriller film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). She recorded six songs for the [[The Bodyguard (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]], including "[[I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston version)|I Will Always Love You]]", which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and became the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling physical singles|best-selling physical single]] by a female in music history. It won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and remains the best-selling soundtrack album of all time. Houston starred and recorded soundtracks for two other high-profile films, ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]'' (1996), with the latter's [[The Preacher's Wife (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] being the best-selling [[Gospel music|gospel]] album of all time.

Following the critical and commercial success of ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]'' (1998), Houston renewed her contract with Arista for $100 million. However, her personal struggles began overshadowing her career, and the album ''[[Just Whitney]]'' (2002) received mixed reviews. Her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer [[Bobby Brown]] received widespread media coverage. After a six-year break from recording, Houston returned to the top of the ''Billboard'' 200 chart with her final studio album, ''[[I Look to You]]'' (2009). On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead at [[the Beverly Hilton]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. The coroner's report showed that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|2012 Grammy Awards]] and was featured prominently in international media. Houston was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2020.

In 1983, Gerry Griffith, an [[A&R]] representative from [[Arista Records]], saw Houston performing with her mother in a New York nightclub.

Houston's second album, ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'', was released in June 1987. The album again featured production from Masser, Kashif, and Walden as well as [[Jellybean Benitez]].

Her next three singles, "[[Didn't We Almost Have It All]]", "[[So Emotional]]", and "[[Where Do Broken Hearts Go]]", all peaked at number one on the US Hot 100 chart, giving Houston a record total of seven consecutive number one hits; the previous record of six consecutive number one hits had been shared by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] and the [[Bee Gees]].<ref name="Company1988a">{{vcite book|title=Jet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54|date=May 2, 1988|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=54|issn=0021-5996}}</ref><ref name="Inc.2000">{{vcite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA104|date=May 13, 2000|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|page=104|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Houston became the first woman to generate four number-one singles from one album.

Following the success of ''The Bodyguard'', Houston embarked on another expansive global tour (''[[The Bodyguard World Tour]]'') in 1993–94.

===1995–1997: ''Waiting to Exhale'', ''The Preacher's Wife'', and ''Cinderella''===
In 1995, Houston starred alongside [[Angela Bassett]], [[Loretta Devine]], and [[Lela Rochon]] in her second film, ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as "a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers".<ref name=prissy/> After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=waitingtoexhale.htm |title=Waiting to Exhale (1995) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=March 2, 1996 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]'' and the [[Tyler Perry]] movies that became popular in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/africanambib2.html |title=African American Filmmakers, African American Films: A Bibliography of Materials in the UC Berkeley Library|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher= UC Berkeley Library |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ascher-Walsh, Rebecca | url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,284411,00.html | title=Back in the Groove?| work=Entertainment Weekly| date=August 14, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author=LaPorte, Nicole|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918919.html?categoryid=1055&cs=1|title=Diary of a Mad Niche Hit|magazine=Variety|date=March 6, 2005|access-date=February 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308073005/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918919.html?categoryid=1055&cs=1|archive-date=March 8, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens rather than as stereotypes.<ref>{{cite magazine| first1= Jack E. | last1= White | title= Heavy Breathing |date=January 15, 1996|magazine=Time | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983966,00.html| accessdate=March 17, 2007 }}</ref> The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast.

The film's accompanying soundtrack, ''[[Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album]]'', was written and produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]]. Though he originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she "wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction", and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film's message about strong women.<ref name=prissy>{{cite magazine| first1= Christopher John | last1= Farley | title= No More Prissy |date=December 4, 1995|magazine=Time | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983795-2,00.html| accessdate=March 17, 2007 }}</ref> Consequently, the album featured a range of contemporary R&B female recording artists along with Houston, such as [[Mary J.

Houston's "[[Exhale (Shoop Shoop)]]" peaked at No. 1, and then spent a record eleven weeks at the No. 2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R&B Charts. "Count On Me", a duet with [[CeCe Winans]], hit the U.S. Top 10; and Houston's third contribution, "[[Why Does It Hurt So Bad]]", made the Top 30.

In 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]'', with [[Denzel Washington]]. She plays the gospel-singing wife of a pastor ([[Courtney B. Vance]]). It was largely an updated remake of the 1948 film ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'', which starred [[Loretta Young]], [[David Niven]] and [[Cary Grant]]. Houston earned $10 million for the role, making her one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood at the time and the highest-earning African-American actress in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite news|author=Laurence, Charles| url=http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/dailytelegraph_1996.htm |title=The Arts: The gospel according to Whitney| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= December 14, 1996|accessdate= January 1, 2008}}</ref> The movie, with its all African-American cast, was a moderate success, earning approximately $50 million at the U.S. box offices.<ref>{{cite web|website=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117372/business |title=Box office / Business for "The Preacher's Wife"| accessdate= February 15, 2008}}</ref> The movie gave Houston her strongest reviews so far.

===1998–2000: ''My Love Is Your Love'' and ''Whitney: The Greatest Hits''===
After spending much of the early and mid-1990s working on motion pictures and their soundtrack albums, Houston's first studio album in eight years, the critically acclaimed ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]'', was released in November 1998.

===2000–2005: ''Just Whitney'' and personal struggles===
Though Houston was seen as a "good girl" with a perfect image in the 1980s and early 1990s, her behavior had changed by 1999 and 2000. She was often hours late for interviews, photo shoots and rehearsals, she canceled concerts and talk-show appearances, and there were reports of erratic behavior.<ref name="RollingStoneBio">{{vcite web|title=Whitney Houston biography |work=Rolling Stone |year=2012 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/whitney-houston/biography |accessdate=February 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209024845/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/biography |archivedate=December 9, 2009}}</ref><ref name="McShane-20000406">Larry McShane, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/ent3.htm "Whitney Houston Gets Bad Press"], ''The Washington Post'', April 6, 2000.</ref> Missed performances and weight loss led to rumors about Houston using drugs with her husband.

Shortly thereafter, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards, but was fired from the event by musical director and longtime friend [[Burt Bacharach]]. Her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book ''The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards'', author Steve Pond revealed that "Houston's voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery, and her attitude was casual, almost defiant", and that while Houston was supposed to sing "[[Over the Rainbow]]", she would start singing a different song during rehearsals.<ref>Movie & TV News @ IMDb.com, [https://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2004-12-23#celeb5 "Houston's Oscar Confusion"], December 23, 2004.

In 2002, Houston became involved in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise. Although the company was started by her father to manage her career, it was actually run by company president Kevin Skinner. Skinner filed a [[breach-of-contract]] [[lawsuit]] and sued for $100 million (but lost), stating that Houston owed the company previously unpaid compensation for helping to negotiate her $100 million contract with Arista Records and for sorting out legal matters.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Jennifer|last1=Vineyard|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1458015/whitney-houston-sued-for-100-million-by-dads-company/|title=Whitney Houston Sued For $100 Million By Dad's Company|accessdate=July 27, 2019|publisher=MTV|date=October 8, 2002}}</ref> Houston stated that her 81-year-old father had nothing to do with the lawsuit.

Also in 2002, Houston did an interview with [[Diane Sawyer]] to promote her then-upcoming album. During the prime-time special, Houston spoke about her drug use and her marriage, among other topics. Asked about the ongoing drug rumors, she replied, "First of all, let's get one thing straight. [[Crack cocaine|Crack]] is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is wack."<ref name="Sawyer-Houston-Interview-2002" /> The "crack is wack" line was drawn from [[Crack is Wack|a mural]] that [[Keith Haring]] painted in 1986 on the handball court at 128th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crack is Wack, 1986|url=http://www.haring.com/!/art-work/108#.U4zvQeaSys1|publisher=The Keith Haring Foundation|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> Houston did, however, admit to using alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and pills; she also acknowledged that her mother had urged her to seek help regarding her drug use.

In December 2002, Houston released her fifth studio album, ''[[Just Whitney]]''.

In December 2003, Brown was charged with battery following an altercation during which he threatened to beat Houston and then assaulted her. Police reported that Houston had visible injuries to her face.<ref name=":0" />

Having always been a touring artist, Houston spent most of 2004 touring and performing in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and [[Russia]]. In September 2004, she gave a surprise performance at the [[World Music Awards]] in a tribute to long-time friend [[Clive Davis]]. After the show, Davis and Houston announced plans to go into the studio to work on her new album.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cashmere, Paul|url=http://www.mtv.tv/news/Whitney-back-with-Clive-Davis-13112/|title=Whitney Back With Clive Davis|date=September 17, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709025508/http://www.mtv.tv/news/Whitney-back-with-Clive-Davis-13112/|archive-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref>

In early 2004, husband Bobby Brown starred in his own reality TV program, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', on the [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo network]]. The show provided a view of the domestic goings-on in the Brown household. Though it was Brown's vehicle, Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in unflattering moments. Years later, ''[[The Guardian]]'' opined that through her participation in the show, Houston had lost "the last remnants of her dignity".<ref name="theguardian.com"/> ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was "undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television".<ref>Barry Garron, [https://www.today.com/popculture/being-bobby-brown-disgusting-wbna8409211 "'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting"], MSNBC, June 29, 2005.</ref> Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot and continued Houston's successful forays into film and television.<ref>Steve Rogers, [https://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php "Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.</ref> The show was not renewed for a second season after Houston stated that she would no longer appear in it, and Brown and Bravo could not come to an agreement for another season.<ref>[https://blog.sfgate.com/dailydish/2007/01/10/brown-reality-show-cancelled/ "Brown Reality Show Cancelled"], ''SFGate'', The Daily Dish, January 10, 2007.</ref>

===Reaction===
====Pre-Grammy party====
The February 11, 2012 Clive Davis pre-Grammy party that Houston was expected to attend, which featured many of the biggest names in music and film, went on as scheduled – although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start:

<blockquote>By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.<ref>{{vcite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/02/clive-davis-whitney-houston-dead.html|title=Clive Davis: Whitney Houston would have wanted the music to go on|work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Tony Bennett]] spoke of Houston's death before performing at Davis's party. He said, "First, it was [[Michael Jackson]], then [[Amy Winehouse]], now, the magnificent Whitney Houston." Bennett sang "[[How Do You Keep the Music Playing?]]" and said of Houston, "When I first heard her, I called Clive Davis and said, 'You finally found the greatest singer I've ever heard in my life.{{' "}}<ref>{{vcite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/02/12/tony-bennett-calls-for-legalization-of-drugs|title=Tony Bennett calls for legalization of drugs|date=February 12, 2012|work=Toronto Sun|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref>

Some celebrities opposed Davis' decision to continue with the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body was still in the building. [[Chaka Khan]], in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Piers Morgan]] on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: "I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh.

I'm not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you.

Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the [[54th Grammy Awards]], announced that [[Jennifer Hudson]] would perform a tribute to Houston at the February 12, 2012 ceremony. He said, "event organizers believed Hudson&nbsp;– an Academy Award-winning actress and Grammy Award-winning artist&nbsp;– could perform a respectful musical tribute to Houston." Ehrlich went on to say: "It's too fresh in everyone's memory to do more at this time, but we would be remiss if we didn't recognize Whitney's remarkable contribution to music fans in general and in particular her close ties with the Grammy telecast and her Grammy wins and nominations over the years."<ref>{{vcite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/02/11/whitney-houston-dies-at-48/|title=Singer Whitney Houston found dead|publisher=FoxNews|date=February 12, 2012|access-date=February 12, 2012}}</ref> At the start of the awards ceremony, footage of Houston performing "I Will Always Love You" from the 1994 Grammys was shown following a prayer read by host [[LL Cool J]].

Lauren Everitt from [[BBC News|BBC News Magazine]] commented on [[melisma]] used in Houston's recording and its influence. "An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable", stated Everitt. "The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, but it was her rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [ ... ] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation." Everitt said that "[i]n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma for just the right moment."<ref>{{vcite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17039208 | title = Whitney Houston and the art of melisma | first = Lauren | last = Everitt | publisher = BBC | date = February 15, 2012 | accessdate = February 20, 2012}}</ref>

Houston's vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry. According to Linda Lister in ''Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars'', she has been called the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Pop]]" for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and [[Celine Dion]].<ref name= diva>"If Ella Fitzgerald is the queen of jazz, Billie Holiday first lady of the blues, and Aretha Franklin the queen of soul, then who is the queen of pop? In the 1990s, it would seem to be a three-way tie between Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Celine Dion. Certainly all three have their devotees and detractors, but their presence has been inescapable." in {{cite news | last1= Lister | first1=Linda | title=Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars| newspaper= Popular Music and Society | volume=25|issue=3/4| page=1| year= 2001|issn=0300-7766}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] from ''The New York Times'', in his review of Houston's [[Radio City Music Hall]] concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer, writing, "Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices. While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing." With regard to her singing style, he added: "Her [Houston's] stylistic trademarks&nbsp;– shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration&nbsp;– infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning."<ref>{{vcite news | author = Holden, Stephen | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/22/arts/review-pop-for-whitney-houston-showy-doesn-t-count-the-show-is-the-voice.html | title = Review/Pop; For Whitney Houston, Showy Doesn't Count: The Show Is the Voice |work=The New York Times | date = July 22, 1993 | accessdate =March 13, 2011 | authorlink = Stephen Holden}}</ref>

Elysa Gardner of the ''Los Angeles Times'' in her review for ''The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack'' highly praised Houston's vocal ability, commenting, "She is first and foremost a pop diva&nbsp;– at that, the best one we have. No other female pop star&nbsp;– not Mariah Carey, not Celine Dion, not [[Barbra Streisand]]&nbsp;– quite rivals Houston in her exquisite vocal fluidity and purity of tone, and her ability to infuse a lyric with mesmerizing melodrama."<ref>{{vcite web | first= Elysa |last=Gardner | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-24/entertainment/ca-2290_1_gospel-choir| title = Oh, Whitney&nbsp;– for Heaven's Sake |work=Los Angeles Times | date = November 24, 1996 | accessdate =March 6, 2011}}</ref>

Houston struggled with vocal problems in her later years. Gary Catona, a voice coach who began working with Houston in 2005, stated: "'When I first started working with her in 2005, she had lost 99.9 percent of her voice ... She could barely speak, let alone sing. Her lifestyle choices had made her almost completely hoarse.'"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2012/08/12/whitneys-bitter-pill/|title=Whitney's bitter pill|last1=Perry|first1=Caroline|date=August 12, 2012|website=NYPost.com|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref> After Houston's death, Catona asserted that Houston's voice reached "'about 75 to 80 percent'" of its former capacity after he had worked with her.<ref name="Connelly">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/houston-insider-reveals-whitneys-anguished-fight-win-back/story?id=15689692|title=Whitney Houston Insider Reveals Singer's Anguished Fight to Win Back Her Voice|last1=Connelly|first1=Chris|date=February 17, 2012|website=ABCNews.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref> However, during the world tour that followed the release of ''I Look to You'', "YouTube videos surfaced, showing [Houston's] voice cracking, seemingly unable to hold the notes she was known for".<ref name="Connelly"/>

===Influence===
During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With [[Michael Jackson]] breaking down the color barrier for black men, Houston did the same for black women. She became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the "How Will I Know" video.<ref>"Whitney Houston". ''Headliners and Legends''. [[NBC]]. August 8, 2000.</ref> Following Houston's breakthrough, other African-American women, such as [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Anita Baker]], were successful in popular music.<ref name="Rizzo 1987 11"/><ref name="Hunt 1987 44"/> Baker commented that "Because of what Whitney and [[Sade (singer)|Sade]] did, there was an opening for me ... For radio stations, black women singers aren't taboo anymore."<ref>{{vcite news | first = Dennis |last=Hunt | url = https://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-18/entertainment/ca-5281_1_other-black-women | title = Baker And The Rise Of Black Women In Pop | publisher = [[Tribune Company]] |work=Los Angeles Times | date = January 18, 1987 | accessdate =March 26, 2011}}</ref>

[[AllMusic]] noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene, commenting, "Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop, and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity" and that "the result was an across-the-board appeal that was matched by scant few artists of her era, and helped her become one of the first black artists to find success on MTV in Michael Jackson's wake".<ref name="allmusicbiography">{{vcite web | first = Steve |last=Huey | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/whitney-houston-p4519/biography | title = Whitney Houston Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | accessdate =October 16, 2010}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' stated that "Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions".<ref>Holden, Stephen. "The Pop Life; 1986, A Musically Conservative Year". ''The New York Times''. December 31, 1986.</ref> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:

<blockquote>Of her first album's ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [Houston] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. [ ... ] She was a phenomenon waiting to happen, a canny tapping of the listener's yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace.<ref name=Time/></blockquote>

Stephen Holden of ''The New York Times'' said that Houston "revitalized the tradition of strong gospel-oriented pop-soul singing".<ref>Holden, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/arts/review-pop-diana-ross-flirts-with-a-willing-audience.html "Review/Pop; Diana Ross Flirts With a Willing Audience"]. ''The New York Times''. June 16, 1989.</ref> Ann Powers of the ''Los Angeles Times'' referred to Houston as a "national treasure".<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"/> Jon Caramanica, another music critic of ''The New York Times'', called Houston "R&B's great modernizer", adding "slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream".<ref name="nytimesjon"/> He also drew comparisons between Houston's influence and other big names' on 1980s pop:

<blockquote>She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston's voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.<ref name="nytimesjon"/></blockquote>

''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston's influence on modern R&B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson's. "Because Whitney, more than any other single artist – Michael Jackson included – effectively mapped out the course of modern R&B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese, and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the 'soul diva' ", stated Gill. "Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang, and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape." Gill said that there "are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today's TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects&nbsp;– the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning".<ref>{{vcite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whitney-houston-the-greatest-voice-of-her-generation-6988653.html | title = Whitney Houston, the greatest voice of her generation | work = [[The Independent]] | publisher = Independent Print | first = Any | last = Gill | date = February 17, 2012 | accessdate = February 20, 2012}}</ref>
