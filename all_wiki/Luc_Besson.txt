He directed or produced the films ''[[Subway (film)|Subway]]'' (1985), ''[[The Big Blue]]'' (1988), and ''[[La Femme Nikita (film)|La Femme Nikita]]'' (1990). Besson is associated with the ''[[Cinéma du look]]'' film movement.

In 1980, he founded his own production company, '''Les Films du Loup''', and, later, '''Les Films du Dauphin''', which were superseded in 2000 by his co-founding [[EuropaCorp]] film company with his longtime collaborator, {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Ange Le Pogam|fr}}. As writer, director, or producer, Besson has so far been involved in the creation of [[Luc Besson filmography|more than 50 films]].

==Early life==
Besson was born in [[Paris]], to parents who both worked as [[Club Med]] [[scuba-diving]] instructors.<ref>[http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/B/Besson_Luc/2007/01/09/3255743.html Luc Besson on 'Arthur And The Invisibles'] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120712054957/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/B/Besson_Luc/2007/01/09/3255743.html |date=12 July 2012 }} – CANOE</ref> Influenced by this milieu, as a child Besson planned to become a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]]. He spent much of his youth travelling with his parents to tourist resorts in [[Italy]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]].<ref>"Luc Besson", ''Contemporary Authors Online'', Gale, 2008.</ref> The family returned to France when Besson was 10. His parents promptly divorced and each remarried.

<blockquote>"Here there is two families, and I am the only bad souvenir of something that doesn't work," he said in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''. "And if I disappear, then everything is perfect. The rage to exist comes from here. I have to do something!  Otherwise I am going to die."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/20/arts/20besson.php "Luc Besson: The most Hollywood of French filmmakers"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 20 May 2007</ref></blockquote>

At the age of 17, Besson had a diving accident that left him unable to dive.<ref name=Hayward1>{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Susan|title=Luc Besson|year=1998|publisher=Manchester university press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRs9hlrjMnwC&pg=PA42|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-5076-3|accessdate=6 September 2011|page=42}}</ref>

<blockquote><poem>"I was 17 and I wondered what I was going to do. ... So I took a piece of paper and on the left I put everything I could do, or had skills for, and all the things I couldn't do. The first line was shorter and I could see that I loved writing, I loved images, I was taking a lot of pictures. So I thought maybe movies would be good. But I thought that to really know I should go to a set. And a friend of mine knew a guy whose brother was a third assistant on a short film. It's true," he said in a 2000 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name="film.guardian.co.uk">[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/23/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank1 Luc Besson interviewed by Richard Jobson] ''The Guardian''; accessed 20 July 2018.</ref>

"So, I said: 'OK, let's go on the set.' So I went on the set...The day after I went back to see my mum and told her that I was going to make films and stop school and 'bye. And I did it! Very soon after I made a short film and it was very, very bad. I wanted to prove that I could do something, so I made a short film. That was in fact my main concern, to be able to show that I could do one."<ref name="film.guardian.co.uk"/></poem></blockquote>

==Career==
He reportedly worked on the first drafts of ''[[Le Grand Bleu]]'' while still in his teens. Out of boredom, Besson started writing stories, including the background to what he later developed as ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' (1997), one of his most popular movies.<ref>[http://zakka.dk/euroscreenwriters/interviews/luc_besson_514.htm Interviews with European Film Directors – Luc Besson] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120524211045/http://zakka.dk/euroscreenwriters/interviews/luc_besson_514.htm |date=24 May 2012 }} EuroScreenwriters</ref> The film is inspired by the [[Franco-Belgian comics|French comic books]] which Besson read as a teenager. Besson directed and co-wrote the screenplay of this science fiction thriller with the screenwriter [[Robert Mark Kamen]].<ref name="Luc Besson 2000">"Luc Besson," ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, Volume 2: Directors'', 4th ed. St. James Press, 2000.</ref>

At 18, Besson returned to his birthplace of Paris. There he took odd jobs in film to get a feel for the industry. He worked as an assistant to directors including [[Claude Faraldo]] and [[Patrick Grandperret]]. Besson directed three short films, a commissioned documentary, and several commercials.<ref>Elley, Derek. "Pop pic auteur", ''Variety'', 23 June 1997, v. 367 n. 8, pp. 44–45.</ref> After this, he moved to the United States for three years, but returned to Paris, where he formed his own production company. He first named it ''Les Films du Loup,'' but changed it to ''Les Films du Dauphin''. In the early 1980s, Besson met [[Éric Serra]] and asked him to compose the score for his first short film, ''L'Avant dernier''. He later used Serra as a composer for other films of his. Since the late 20th century, Besson has written and produced numerous action movies, including the ''[[Taxi (1998 film)|Taxi]]'' (1998–2007) and ''[[The Transporter]]'' (2002–2008) series, and the [[Jet Li]] films ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Unleashed/Danny the Dog]].''  His English-language films ''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'', ''[[Taken 2]]'' and ''[[Taken 3]]'', all starring [[Liam Neeson]], have been major successes, with ''Taken 2'' becoming the largest-grossing export French film. Besson produced the promotional movie for the [[Paris 2012 Olympic bid|Paris]] bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Cinéma du look===
Critics{{Who|date=June 2016}} cite Besson as a pivotal figure in the [[Cinema du look|Cinéma du look]] movement, a specific, highly visual style produced from the 1980s into the early 1990s. ''[[Subway (film)|Subway]]'' (1985), ''[[The Big Blue]]'' (1988) and ''[[La Femme Nikita (film)|La Femme Nikita]]'' (1990) are all considered to be of this stylistic school. The term was coined by critic [[Raphaël Bassan]] in a 1989 essay in ''La Revue du Cinema n° 449.''<ref>Translated into English: "The French neo-baroques directors: Beineix, Besson, Carax from Diva to le Grand Bleu" (pp. 11–23), in ''The Films of Luc Besson: Master of Spectacle'' (Under the direction of Susan Hayward and Phil Powrie), Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7190-7028-7}}</ref> A partisan of the experimental cinema and friend of the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] ("''[[nouvelle vague]]''") directors, Bassan grouped Besson with [[Jean-Jacques Beineix]] and [[Leos Carax]] as three directors who shared the style of ''"le look."'' These directors were later described critically as favouring style over substance, and spectacle over narrative.<ref>Austin, Guy (1999) ''Contemporary French Cinema: An Introduction'', Manchester University Press, pp. 119–120, 126–128. {{ISBN|0-7190-4611-4}}</ref>

Besson, along with most of the filmmakers so categorised, was uncomfortable with the label, particularly in light of the achievements of their forebears: France's [[French New Wave|New Wave]]. "[[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]] were rebelling against existing cultural values and used cinema as a means of expression simply because it was the most avant-garde medium at the time," said Besson in a 1985 interview in ''The New York Times''. "Today, the revolution is occurring entirely within the industry and is led by people who want to change the look of movies by making them better, more convincing and pleasurable to watch.

"Because it's becoming increasingly difficult to break into this field, we have developed a psychological armor and are ready to do anything in order to work", he added in this same interview. "I think our ardor alone is going to shake the pillars of the moviemaking establishment."<ref>Tremblay, Anne (21 July 1985) [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/21/movies/france-breeds-a-new-crop-of-auteurs.html "France Breeds a New Crop of Auteurs"], ''The New York Times,''.</ref>

Besson directed a biopic of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] called ''[[The Lady (2011 film)|The Lady]]'' (original title ''Dans la Lumiere''), which was released in the fall of 2011. He also worked on ''[[Lockout (film)|Lockout]]'', which was released in April 2012.<ref>Sobel, Ian (9 June 2011) [http://www.screenjunkies.com/movies/movie-news/looper-anonymous-and-lockout-do-the-release-date-shuffle/ "‘Looper’, ‘Anonymous’, And ‘Lockout’ Do The Release Date Shuffle'"], Screenjunkies.com.</ref>

===Work===
Many of Besson's films have achieved popular, if not critical, success. One such release was ''[[Le Grand Bleu]]''. 
<blockquote>"When the film had its premiere on opening night at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]], it was mercilessly drubbed, but no matter; it was a smash," observed the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' in a 2007 profile of Besson. "Embraced by young people who kept returning to see it again, the movie sold 10&nbsp;million tickets and quickly became what the French call a 'film générationnel,' a defining moment in the culture."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/20/arts/20besson.php "Luc Besson: The most Hollywood of French filmmakers"], ''International Herald Tribune,'' 20 May 2007</ref></blockquote>

Besson created the [[Arthur series (Besson)|Arthur series]], which comprises ''Arthur and the Minimoys'', ''Arthur and the Forbidden City'', ''[[Arthur and the Vengeance of Maltazard]]'' and ''Arthur and the War of the Two Worlds''. He directed ''[[Arthur and the Invisibles]]'', an adaptation of the first two books of the collection. A [[Films with live action and animation|film with live action and animation]], it was released in the UK and the US.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Critical evaluation===
Besson has been described as "the most Hollywood of French filmmakers."<ref>Tobias, Scott (20 May 2007).

[http://www.avclub.com/articles/district-b13,3939/ "District B13"], ''[[The Onion]]''. Retrieved 13 March 2011.</ref>

American film critic [[Armond White]] has praised Besson, whom he ranks as one of the best film producers, for refining and revolutionizing action film. He wrote that Besson dramatizes the struggle of his characters "as a conscientious resistance to human degradation".<ref>White, Armond (28 January 2009).

==Personal life==
Besson has been married four times; first, in 1986, to actress [[Anne Parillaud]] who starred in Besson's ''[[La Femme Nikita (film)|La Femme Nikita]]'' (1990). Besson and Parillaud had a daughter, Juliette, born in 1987. The couple divorced in 1991.

Besson's second wife was actress and director [[Maïwenn|Maïwenn Le Besco]], who he started dating when he was 31 and she was 15.<ref name="LeonDVDExtras">[http://www.sbs.com.au/films/movie/7402/Leon:-The-Professional- Leon: The Professional]. sbs.com.au</ref> They were married in late 1992 when Le Besco, 16, was pregnant with their daughter [[Shanna Besson|Shanna]], who was born on 3 January 1993.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130825210727/http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/shanna_besson Shanna Besson].

He married the 21-year-old on 14 December 1997, at the age of {{age|1959|3|18|1997|12|14}}, but they divorced in 1999.<ref>Kee, Chang; Stevens, Victoria (5 May 2012). Maïwenn's "Polisse".
