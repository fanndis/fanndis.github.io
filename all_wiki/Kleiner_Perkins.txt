Located in [[Menlo Park, California]], Kleiner Perkins had access to the growing technology industries in the area. By the early 1970s, there were many [[semiconductor]] companies based in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies.  Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund. Nevertheless, the firm was still active in this period.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} By 1996, Kleiner Perkins had funded around 260 companies a total of $880 million.<ref name=corcoran-perkins/> Beyond the original founders, notable members of the firm have included individuals such as<ref name=team-kpcb>{{cite news |title=Team |url=http://www.kpcb.com/teams |location=KPCB |access-date= 21 May 2017}}</ref> [[John Doerr]],<ref name="Kaplan_mentions_Doerr_page_301-302">
