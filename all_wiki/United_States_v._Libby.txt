'''''United States v. Libby''''' was the [[Law of the United States|federal trial]] of [[Scooter Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], a former high-ranking official in the [[George W. Bush administration]], for interfering with special prosecutor [[Patrick Fitzgerald]]'s [[Plame affair criminal investigation|criminal investigation of the Plame affair]].

Libby served as [[Assistant to the President]] under [[George W. Bush]] and [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States]] and Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs under [[Dick Cheney]] from 2001 to 2005. Libby resigned from his government positions hours after his indictment on October 28, 2005.

Libby was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] on five [[felony]] counts of [[making false statements]] to federal investigators, perjury for lying to a federal grand jury, and [[obstruction of justice]] for impeding the course of a [[CIA leak grand jury investigation|federal grand jury investigation]] concerned with the possibly illegal leaking by government officials of the classified identity of a [[Non-official cover|covert agent]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[Valerie Plame Wilson]], the wife of former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson IV]]. Pursuant to the grand jury leak investigation, Libby was convicted on March 6, 2007, on four counts of perjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements. He was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] of one count of making false statements.

Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and [[Fine (penalty)|fined]] $250,000. The sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] in June 2007 by President Bush, voiding the prison term. The convictions no longer stand on the record because Libby was pardoned by President Trump on 13 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/04/13/602209933/president-trump-pardons-scooter-libby-former-cheney-chief-of-staff |title=President Trump Pardons 'Scooter' Libby, Former Cheney Chief Of Staff |author=Nina Totenberg |authorlink=Nina Totenberg |date=April 13, 2018 |website=NPR.org |access-date=11 September 2019}}</ref>

On April 3, 2007, the District of Columbia Bar suspended his license to practice law in Washington, D.C., and recommended his disbarment pending his appeal of his conviction.<ref>The D.C. Bar revised its "Professional Rules of Conduct" on February 1, 2007, according to its "Bar News" section of its website; accessed June 5, 2007. On April 3, 2007, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals filed an "Order" ("In the Matter of I. Lewis Libby, Jr.  ... Bar Registration No. 950758"), suspending Libby "immediately from the practice of law in the District of Columbia pending resolution of this matter [in United States v. Libby]", which the Office of Bar Counsel (D.C. Bar) received on April 4, 2007, directing it to "inform the Court if the matter is resolved without the necessity of further court action." In that order, "the Board directed the Bar Counsel to file a brief addressing whether [Libby's] crimes inherently involve moral turpitude." In its brief, filed on April 24, 2007, entitled "Statement of Bar Counsel", the D.C. Bar stated that his crimes amounted to "moral turpitude" and recommended to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals Board on Professional Responsibility that Libby "be disbarred pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 11-2503(a)", which reads (in pertinent part): "When a member of the bar of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude ... the court shall, pending final determination of an appeal from the conviction, suspend the member of the bar from practice ... If a final judgment of conviction is certified to the court, the name of the member of the bar so convicted shall be struck from the roll of the members of the bar and such person shall thereafter cease to be a member." Pursuant to the policy on "Moral Turpitude" contained therein, it is also noted (n. 4) that Libby's "disbarment should be deemed to commence, for reinstatement purposes, on April 11, 2007, the date that [he] filed an affidavit in compliance with D.C. Bar R. XI, ยง 14(g)." The brief lists Libby's admission to practice law in that jurisdiction as May 19, 1978. At that time Libby's lawyers filed notification of his intention to appeal his conviction within ten days after his sentencing with the D.C. Bar, an appeal that he subsequently decided to drop (Cf. Apuzzo's account of December 10, 2007, op cit)</ref> On March 20, 2008, after he dropped his appeal, he was disbarred by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in Washington, D.C., at least until 2012.<ref>Carol D. Leonnig, "Court Disbars Cheney Ex-Aide: Libby Loses Right To Practice Law", The Washington Post, p. A2, March 21, 2008</ref> He delayed reinstatement until June 2016, when he successfully petitioned the court for reinstatement. He was readmitted to the D.C. bar on November 3, 2016.<ref>"Lewis Libby". nndb.com. Retrieved January 28, 2015</ref>

In the District of Columbia Court of Appeals Disciplinary Counsel's Report reinstating Libby's law license, the Counsel noted that Libby had continued to assert his innocence. As a result, the Counsel had to "undertake a more complex evaluation of a Petition for reinstatement" than when a petitioner admits guilt. But the Counsel found that "Libby has presented credible evidence in support of his version of events and it appears that one key prosecution witness {{sic}}, Judith Miller, has changed her recollection of the events in question."<ref>Disciplinary Counsel's Report regarding Petitioner's Petition for Reinstatement. Bar Docket No. 2016-D182. p. 5</ref> The reference to Judith Miller, a former New York Times reporter, involved her memoir, The Story, A Reporter's Journey. In the book, Miller said she read Plame's memoir and discovered that Plame's cover was at the State Department, a fact Miller said the prosecution had withheld from her. In rereading what she called her "elliptical" notes (meaning hard to decipher), she realized they were about Plame's cover, not her job at the CIA. She concluded that her testimony that Libby had told her Plame worked at the CIA was wrong. "Had I helped convict an innocent man?" she asked.<ref>Miller, Judith. The Story, A Reporter's Journey. Simon and Schuster 2015. pp. 307-310.</ref> Miller went on to note that John Rizzo, a former CIA general counsel, had said in his memoir that there was no evidence that the outing of Plame had caused any damage to CIA operations or agents, including Plame.<ref>Miller, p. 312</ref> That statement rebuts the prosecution's closing argument that as a result of the disclosure of Plame's identity, a CIA operative could be "arrested, tortured, or killed."<ref>Transcript of oral argument at p. 130, In re I.

{{Plame affair}}

==Events leading up to the trial==

===The Plame affair===
{{Main|Plame affair|CIA leak grand jury investigation|}}
The [[Plame affair]] ensued after the identity of Valerie Plame was leaked to journalists, which took place after her husband Joseph Wilson criticized the Bush administration's [[rationale for the Iraq War]] on July 6, 2003 by publicly stating that he had found no evidence for the claim that Saddam Hussein's regime had attempted to buy [[yellowcake]] [[uranium]] in [[Niger]] (a claim that first emerged due to the [[Niger uranium forgeries]]) in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' op-ed entitled "What I Didn't Find in Africa".<ref name=wilsonoped />

Wilson had been sent on a fact-finding mission to Niger but had found no evidence for the claim that Iraq had been attempting to buy yellowcake uranium in Africa, as part of an active [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction program]]. Nonetheless, this claim was repeated by president Bush during the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] that preceded the Iraq War. President Bush's controversial "[[September Dossier|16 words]]" in his 2003 [[State of the Union Address]] alluded to the Niger claim: "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."<ref>[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030128-19.html "President Delivers "State of the Union: The U.S. Capitol"], press release, ''[[The White House]]'', January 28, 2003, accessed July 23, 2007. (Full transcript of the speech.)</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/interactive/allpolitics/0307/bush.16.words/content2.html "16 Words"], ''[[CNN]].com'', March 7, 2003, accessed July 23, 2007.</ref> Bush's claim was apparently based on the forged uranium documents. On March 7, 2003, 11 days before the United States-led coalition [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) released its report determining that [[Yellowcake forgery|documents]] indirectly cited by President Bush as suggesting that Iraq had tried to buy 500 tons of uranium from Niger were actually "obvious" forgeries.<ref name=CNNElBar>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/07/sprj.irq.un.transcript.elbaradei/ "Transcript of El Baradei's U.N. Presentation"], CNN, March 7, 2003, accessed July 28, 2007.</ref>

On July 14, 2003, a newspaper column commenting on Wilson's claims written by [[Robert Novak]], entitled "Mission to Niger", disclosed Plame's name and status as an "operative" who worked in a CIA division on the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Wilson, her husband, stated in various interviews and subsequent writings (as listed in his 2004 memoir ''The Politics of Truth'') that his wife's identity was covert and that members of the administration knowingly revealed it as retribution for his op-ed entitled "What I Didn't Find in Africa", published in ''The New York Times'' on July 6, 2003.<ref name=wilsonoped>[[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson 4th]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/opinion/06WILS.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5007&en=6c6aeb1ce960dec0&ex=1372824000&partner=USERLAND "What I Didn't Find in Africa"], ''The New York Times'', July 6, 2003, accessed June 10, 2007.</ref> Some argue that his wife's employment at the CIA was no longer classified: Victoria Toensing, who helped craft the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, claims in her ''Washington Post'' opinion piece "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2305-2005Jan11 The Plame Game: Was This a Crime?]" that since Valerie Plame had not held a foreign post for over five years, she no longer qualified for covert status.

On September 26, 2003, at the request of the CIA, the [[United States Justice Department|Department of Justice]] and the FBI began a criminal investigation into the possible unauthorized disclosure of classified information regarding Valerie Wilson's CIA affiliation to various reporters in the spring of 2003. During this ongoing federal inquiry "into the alleged unauthorized disclosure of a CIA employee's identity," a possible violation of criminal statutes, including the [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act]] of 1982, and Title 18, [[United States Code]], Section 793, Libby testified to FBI agents and to the grand jury.

Libby was charged with lying to FBI agents and to the grand jury about two conversations with reporters, [[Tim Russert]] of [[NBC News]] and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. According to the Indictment, the obstruction of justice count alleges that while testifying under oath before the grand jury on March 5 and March 24, 2004, Libby knowingly and corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct and impede the grand jury's investigation by misleading and deceiving the grand jury as to when, and the manner and means by which, he acquired, and subsequently disclosed to the media, information concerning the employment of Valerie Wilson by the CIA.

On October 28, 2005, after twenty-two months of the investigation, a federal grand jury [[indictment|indicted]] Libby in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]. On November 3, 2005, Libby appeared at his [[arraignment]] before Judge Reggie B.

The text of the filed indictment includes: one count of [[obstruction of justice]] (Title 18, United States Code, section 1503) for impeding the grand jury's investigation; two counts of [[perjury]] (18 USC ยง1623) for lying under oath before the grand jury on March 5 and March 24, 2005; and two counts of making false statements (18 USC ยง1001(a)(2)) and in connection with for making "materially false and intentionally misleading statements" to FBI agents who interviewed him on October 14 and November 26, 2004.<ref name="Indictment" />

[[David Corn]] speculated that Libby was using [[Graymail]] as a defense tactic, based on the large amount of classified material that was requested by his defense and the addition of the graymail expert John D. Cline to his defense team.<ref name=Corn>David Corn, [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&pid=57174], ''[[Capital Games]]'' (blog), ''[[The Nation]]''.</ref><ref name=Waas>[[Murray Waas]], [http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/0209nj1.htm "Administration: Cheney 'Authorized' Libby to Leak Classified Information"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922140112/http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/0209nj1.htm |date=September 22, 2010 }}, ''[[The National Journal]]'', February 9, 2006, accessed March 13, 2006.</ref>

On February 3, 2006, Walton set a trial date of January 8, 2007.<ref name=King>John King, [http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/03/cia.leak/index.html "Ex-Cheney Aide Gets Trial Date: Libby Faces Charges Stemming from Leak of CIA Operative's Name"], CNN, February 3, 2006, accessed February 26, 2007.</ref>

On February 3, 2006, the defense [[subpoena]]ed ''The New York Times'', its former reporter [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], who had been jailed for 85 days after refusing to tell the grand jury about conversations she had with Libby, ''Time'' magazine and its reporter Matthew Cooper, and Tim Russert of NBC News for documents related to the Plame affair. According to Pete Yost of the [[Associated Press]], the subpoenaed reporters and organizations would have until April 7 to turn over the material or challenge the subpoenas:

{{quote|The subpoena to Miller seeks her notes and other materials, including documents concerning Plame prepared by Miller and ''Times'' columnist [[Nicholas D. Kristof]].

Kristof wrote the first account of the criticism that Plame's husband was leveling at the Bush administration. Referring to Plame's husband, though not by name, a May 6, 2003, ''Times'' column by Kristof raised the possibility the Bush administration might have disregarded prewar intelligence suggesting [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction]].

Three weeks after Kristof's column appeared, Libby started making inquiries at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] about the unnamed envoy in Kristof's column, according to the indictment.

The subpoena to the Times also calls for:

โDocuments of contacts between any Times employee and any of eight people, including then-[[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] and then-[[White House Press Secretary|White House spokesman]] [[Ari Fleischer]], regarding Joe Wilson.

โDocuments concerning a recent ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article in which Miller said she talked to many people in the government about Plame.

โDrafts of a personal account by Miller, published in the Times, about her grand jury testimony.

โDocuments regarding Miller's interactions with a Times editor in which Miller may have been told to pursue a story about Joe Wilson and a trip he made to Niger on behalf of the CIA.<ref name=Yost>Pete Yost (Associated Press), [http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--cialeak0316mar16,0,1648952.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork "Libby Lawyers Subpoena Times, Other News Organizations"], ''[[Newsday]]'', March 16, 2006.

On February 9, 2006, [[Murray Waas]] reported in ''The National Journal'' that Libby had testified to the grand jury that he had been authorized by his superiors to disclose classified information regarding intelligence estimates of Iraq's weapons programs. Waas identified Vice President Cheney as one such superior on the basis of unpublished statements of lawyers with knowledge of the situation and documents that Waas says were filed with the court.<ref name=Waas/>

On February 23, 2006, Libby's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against him. According to Toni Locy, reporting for the Associated Press, "The defense attorneys  ... said Fitzgerald's appointment violated federal law because his investigation was not supervised by the attorney general."<ref name=MotiontoDismissAP>Toni Locy (Associated Press), [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/02/24/ex_white_house_aide_seeks_dismissal_of_charges_in_leak_case/ "Ex-White House Aide Seeks Dismissal of Charges in Leak Case"], ''[[The Boston Globe|boston.com]]'', February 24, 2006, accessed July 17, 2007.</ref> Libby's attorneys argued that only the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] can approve such an arrangement," and that the appointment of Fitzgerald as Special Counsel by then-United States Deputy Attorney General James B.

On April 5, 2006, court filings distributed widely in the press and news media the next day, revealed that Libby had testified during the grand jury investigation about information that Vice President Cheney and President Bush had authorized disclosing; reportedly, the original intent of the filing was to restrict Libby's access to further classified information in defense [[Discovery (law)|discovery]].<ref>[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/iraq/uslibby40506grsp.html "Allegation: Cheney Told 'Scooter' Libby That Bush Authorized Iraq Intelligence Leak, U.S. v.

A court filing by Libby's defense team argued that Valerie Plame was not foremost on the minds of administration officials as they sought to rebut charges made by her husband, Joseph Wilson, that the White House manipulated intelligence to make a case for invasion.

===Sentencing of Libby===
Given current federal sentencing guidelines, which are not mandatory, if he had been convicted on all five counts, Libby's sentence could have ranged from no imprisonment to imprisonment of up to 25 years and a fine of $US1,000,000.<ref name=SniffenApuzzo/> Given those non-binding guidelines, according to lawyer, author, ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' staff writer, and CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on ''Anderson Cooper 360ยฐ'', the sentence based on Libby's conviction on four counts could have been between "one and a half to three years."<ref name=Toobin>''Anderson Cooper 360ยฐ'', March 6, 2007, 10:00 p.mโ12:00 a.m., ET, live; scheduled to be repeated on March 7, 2007, 1:00โ3:00 a.m., ET.</ref>

===Libby ordered to jail pending appeal===
According to CNN News, "After the June 5 sentencing, [Judge] Walton said he was inclined to jail Libby after the defense laid out its proposed appeal, but the judge told attorneys he was open to changing his mind"; however, on June 14, 2007, Judge Walton "ordered" Libby "to report to prison while his attorneys appeal his perjury and obstruction."<ref name=CNNJudge>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/14/libby.hearing/index.html "Judge Orders Libby Jailed during Appeal"], ''CNN News'', June 14, 2007, accessed June 14, 2007.</ref> Although "Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed  ... U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton denied the request and told Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff that he has 10 days to appeal the ruling"; in denying Libby's request, which had questioned Special Counsel [[Patrick Fitzgerald]]'s "authority to charge Libby," as quoted by CNN, Judge Walton said: "'Everyone is accountable, and if you work in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general,'" supporting Fitzgerald's authority in the case.<ref name=CNNJudge/> The judge was also responding to an [[Amicus curiae]] brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal.<ref name=AmicusCuriaeBr>Cf.

Judge Walton has indicated he is not inclined to grant it. Many political observers believe that if Libby gets bail and his appeals fail, he stands a better chance of receiving a presidential pardon because President Bush's term will be nearing its end. Technically, the scholars took no position on the question of bail, but if Judge Walton agreed with them [i.e., their arguments], bail would be highly likely."<ref name=Gerstein>Cf. Josh Gerstein, [http://www.nysun.com/article/56207 "National: Professors Back Libby on Appeal:] Group Includes Dershowitz, Bork", ''The New York Sun'', June 8, 2007, updated June 9, 2007, accessed June 15, 2007.</ref> Though "Judge Walton granted the scholars permission to file their brief," Gerstein reports, "his order doing so contained a caustic footnote questioning the motivation of the legal academics and suggesting he might not give a great deal of weight to their opinion[:]

<blockquote>It is an impressive show of public service when twelve prominent and distinguished current and former law professors are able to amass their collective wisdom in the course of only several days to provide their legal expertise to the court on behalf of a criminal defendant," the judge wrote. "The Court trusts that this is a reflection of these eminent academics' willingness in the future to step to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this Court and throughout the courts of this nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions even in instances where failure to do so could result in monetary penalties, incarceration, or worse. The Court will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries, as necessary in the interests of justice and equity, whenever similar questions arise in the cases that come before it."<ref name=Gerstein/></blockquote>

Noting that "Libby is the first sitting White House official to be indicted in 130 years," CNN News also reported that "At the beginning of Thursday's [June 5, 2007] hearing, Walton told the court that he had received 'harassing' and 'hateful' messages[:] 'In the interest of full disclosure, I have received a number of harassing, angry and mean-spirited phone calls and messages. Some wishing bad things on me and my family,' the judge said. 'Those types of things will have no impact.  ... I initially threw them away, but then there were more, some that were more hateful,' Walton said. 'They are being kept.'"<ref name=CNNJudge/>

[[Jeffrey Toobin]], CNN's senior legal analyst, "called the ruling 'a very dramatic and, to me, surprising decision,'" since, he pointed out, "'Many white collar defendants get bail pending appeal,'  ... citing [[Martha Stewart]] and some [[Insider trading|insider traders]] as examples" and concluding: "'Judge Walton has had it with Scooter Libby,' who, Toobin said, also got a stiff sentence for his crimes in the first place. 'This is going to put President Bush in a very difficult position regarding the question of a pardon.'"<ref name=CNNJudge/>

New York Times reporter Neil Lewis estimated subsequently that Libby's prison sentence could begin within "two months," explaining that

<blockquote>Judge Walton's decision means that the defense lawyers will probably ask a federal appeals court to block the sentence, a long-shot move. It also sharpens interest in a question being asked by Mr. Libby's supporters and critics alike: Will President Bush pardon Mr. Libby?  ... So far, the president has expressed sympathy for Mr. Libby and his family but has not tipped his hand on the pardon issue. ... If the president does not pardon him, and if an appeals court refuses to second-guess Judge Walton's decision, Mr. Libby will probably be ordered to report to prison in six to eight weeks' time. Federal prison authorities will decide where. "Unless the Court of Appeals overturns my ruling, he will have to report," Judge Walton said.<ref name=LewisStout>Neil A.

On June 20, 2007, Libby appealed Walton's ruling in federal appeals court.<ref name=APappeal>Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/washington/20brfs-libby.htm "Libby Appeals Sentencing Ruling"], ''New York Times'', June 20, 2007, accessed June 20, 2007.</ref> The next day, Judge Walton filed a 30-page expanded ruling, in which he explained his decision to deny Libby bail in more detail.<ref name=Gerstein2>Josh Gerstein, [http://www.nysun.com/article/57156?page_no=1 "Libby Judge Files Expanded Opinion:] Details Decision Not Allowing Libby to Remain Free", ''New York Sun'', June 22, 2007, accessed June 22, 2007.</ref>

On July 2, 2007, according to Cary O'Reilly (''Bloomberg News'') and other news media, "the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  ... [unanimously] denied his request for release.

===Presidential pardon and clemency issues===
{{Main|Lewis Libby clemency controversy}}
Soon after the verdict, calls for Libby to be [[pardon]]ed by President George W. Bush began to appear in some newspapers; some of them are posted online by the Libby Legal Defense Trust.<ref name=LLDT>''[http://www.scooterlibby.com/news/ Libby Legal Defense Trust: In the News]''; the Libby Legal Defense Trust also features a "Message from the Chairman", former Ambassador [[Mel Sembler]], and the Advisory Committee, June 1, 2007, accessed March 7, 2007.</ref> U.S. Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] issued a press release about the verdict, urging President Bush to pledge not to pardon Libby, and other Democratic politicians followed his lead.<ref name=Reid>[[Harry Reid]], [http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=270165& press release], ''democrats.senate.gov'', March 6, 2007, accessed April 5, 2007; cf. news account in [http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/06/cia.leak/index.html "Democrats to Bush: Don't Pardon Libby"], CNN News March 7, 2007, accessed April 5, 2007.</ref>

Surveying "the pardon battle" and citing both pro and con publications, ''The Washington Post'' online columnist [[Dan Froomkin]] concludes that many U.S. newspapers opposed a presidential pardon for Libby.<ref name=Froomkin>Dan Froomkin, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/06/07/BL2007060701120.html "Many Newspapers Oppose Pardon"], ''[[White House Watch]]'' (column and blog), ''The Washington Post'', June 7, 2007, accessed June 7, 2007.</ref> In an op-ed published in ''The Washington Post'', former federal prosecutor William Otis argues that the sentence is too stringent and that, instead of pardoning Libby, President Bush should commute his sentence.<ref name=Otis>William Otis, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/06/AR2007060602292.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 "Neither Prison Nor Pardon: Justice in the Libby Case Lies With Bush's Third Option"], ''The Washington Post'', June 7, 2007: A-27; online posting, ''washingtonpost.com'', June 7, 2007, accessed June 7, 2007.</ref>

After the sentencing, President Bush stated on camera: "[I] will not intervene until Libby's legal team has exhausted all of its avenues of appeal  ... It wouldn't be appropriate for me to discuss the case until after the legal remedies have run its course."<ref name=Rutenberg>Jim Rutenberg, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/07/news/leak.php "Bush in Dilemma on Libby Pardon"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', June 7, 2007, accessed June 7, 2007.</ref>

==Presidential commutation of Libby's prison sentence==
{{Main|Lewis Libby clemency controversy}}
{{Wikinews|'Scooter' Libby jail sentence commuted by US President George Bush}}
After denial of Libby's bond by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, President Bush commuted the prison term portion of Libby's sentence on July 2, 2007, leaving in place the felony conviction, the $250,000 fine, and the terms of probation (supervised release).

The President's commutation statement states (in part):

<blockquote>Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation. I respect the jury's verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby's sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison. My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby.<ref name=GWBWHP/></blockquote>

When [[Keith Olbermann]] interviewed former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson]], the husband of Valerie Plame, on the MSNBC television program ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' on the night of July 2, 2007, Joe Wilson expressed his and others' outrage:

<blockquote>There is nothing this administration does that shocks me anymoreโit is corrupt from top to bottom.  ... American citizens were outraged that the president of the United States would short circuit the rule of law and the system of justice.  ... We know in America the difference between right and wrong, even if this administration doesn't.<ref name=Olbermann>Keith Olbermann, interview of Joseph C. Wilson, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNZm1EMAmKg Video clip], [[YouTube]], ''Countdown'', MSNBC, July 2, 2007, accessed July 3, 2007.</ref></blockquote>

Wilson repeated his complaint that the President's action and others' actions leading to Bush's commutation of Libby's sentence could seriously damage United States national security by harming its intelligence capabilityโ"for the CIA, its covert officers, and for the agents that are recruited by officers, those who would put their lives at risk in order to obtain the intelligence we need will think long and hard about it when they see that the administration with impunity will betray its covert officers, will engage in treason."<ref name=Olbermann/>

On the following evening, in his "Special Comment," Olbermann called for both President Bush and Vice-President Cheney to resign.<ref name=Olbermann2>Keith Olbermann, [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19588942 "Olbermann: Bush, Cheney Should Resign:] 'I didn't vote for him, but he's my president, and I hope he does a good job.'" ''Countdown with Keith Olbermann'', ''MSNBC'', July 4, 2007, Special Comment, accessed July 4, 2007.</ref>

Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald objected to President Bush's characterizing Libby's sentence as "excessive," stating:

<blockquote>We fully recognize that the Constitution provides that commutation decisions are a matter of presidential prerogative and we do not comment on the exercise of that prerogative. We comment only on the statement in which the President termed the sentence imposed by the judge as "excessive." The sentence in this case was imposed pursuant to the laws governing sentencings which occur every day throughout this country. In this case, an experienced federal judge considered extensive argument from the parties and then imposed a sentence consistent with the applicable laws. It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals. That principle guided the judge during both the trial and the sentencing.<ref name=FitzStmtComm>Patrick Fitzgerald, [http://www.talkleft.com/LibbyTrial/LibbyPJFstatement7-2-07.pdf "Statement of the Special Counsel"], [[Office of Special Counsel]], July 2, 2007, accessed July 3, 2007; see also [http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003606511 "Statement of Special Counsel"]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Editor & Publisher'', mediainfo.com, July 3, 2003, accessed July 3, 2007.</ref></blockquote>

The day after the commuting of Libby's sentence, James Rowley (Bloomberg News) reported that President Bush has not ruled out pardoning Libby in the future and that Bush's press spokesman, [[Tony Snow]], denied any political motivation in the commutation. Quoting Snow, Rowley added: "'The president is getting pounded on [[Right-wing politics|the right]] because he didn't do a full pardon.' If Bush were 'doing the weather-vane thing' he 'would have done something differently.'"<ref name=Rowley>James Rowley, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&sid=abKC.Z877YPk&refer=home "Bush Won't Rule Out Pardon for Libby as Aide Defends Clemency"], ''Bloomberg News'', July 3, 2007, accessed July 3, 2007.</ref>

===Comment on the verdict by juror Denis Collins===
As reported in ''CNN Newsroom'', and subsequently on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on CNN and by various other television networks, including MSNBC (on ''[[Scarborough Country]]''), one jurorโ"[[Denis Collins (journalist)|Denis Collins]], a Washington resident and self-described registered Democrat," who is a former reporter for ''The Washington Post'' and author of a book on espionageโโ"said he and fellow jurors found that passing judgment on Libby was 'unpleasant.' But in the final analysis, he said jurors found Libby's story just too hard to believe ... 'We're not saying we didn't think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of, but it seemed like  ... he was the fall guy' ... Collins said the jury believed Libby was 'tasked by the vice president to go and talk to reporters.'"<ref name=CNNNewsroom/><ref name=Strupp>Joe Strupp, [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003554336 "Former Colleagues at 'Wash Post' Discuss (Now Famous) Libby Juror"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'', March 6, 2007, 5:05 p.m., ET, accessed March 6, 2007.

==Responses to commutation==
President Bush's commutation of Libby's prison sentence became the subject of a hearing on "The Use and Misuse of Presidential Clemency Power for Executive Branch Officials" held by the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|U.S. House Judiciary Committee]], chaired by Representative [[John Conyers|John Conyers, Jr.]], on July 11, 2007.<ref name=USN>[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bulletin/bulletin_070703.htm "Political Bulletin: Bush Bashed Over Libby Commutation:] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009040323/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bulletin/bulletin_070703.htm |date=October 9, 2012 }} Furious Democrats Will Hold Hearings", ''US News and World Reports'', Washington News, July 3, 2007, accessed July 3, 2007.</ref><ref name=Houseclem>[http://judiciary.house.gov/oversight.aspx?ID=346 "The Use and Misuse of Clemency Powers by Officials of the Executive Branch"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926195806/http://judiciary.house.gov/oversight.aspx?ID=346 |date=September 26, 2007 }}, ''[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|judiciary.house.gov]]'', July 11, 2007, accessed July 11, 2007.</ref><ref name=HirschfeldDavis>Julie Hirschfeld Davis ([[Associated Press]]), [http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Jul11/0,4670,LibbyClemency,00.html "Bush Refuses to Explain Libby Order"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309054848/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Jul11/0,4670,LibbyClemency,00.html |date=March 9, 2008 }}, ''Fox News'', July 11, 2007, accessed July 11, 2007.</ref>

On December 19, 2006, news organizations reported that Vice President Dick Cheney would be called to testify as a witness for the defense and that "former New York Times reporter [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and NBC News Washington bureau chief [[Tim Russert]] were expected to be prosecution witnesses" during Libby's trial, to begin in January 2007.<ref name=Vicini>James Vicini ([[Reuters]]), [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/12/19/defense_in_cia_leak_case_to_call_cheney_to_testify/ "Cheney To Be Called to Testify in CIA Leak Case"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Boston Globe'', December 19, 2006, accessed December 20, 2006.</ref><ref name=Apuzzo2>Matt Apuzzo (Associated Press), [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/12/19/national/w115212S64.DTL&type=politics "Cheney to Be Defense Witness in CIA Case"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408190336/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2006%2F12%2F19%2Fnational%2Fw115212S64.DTL&type=politics |date=April 8, 2008 }}, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', December 19, 2006, accessed December 20, 2006.</ref>

==Press coverage of the trial==
[[Blogs]] have played a prominent role in the press coverage of this trial. Scott Shane, in his article "For Liberal Bloggers, Libby Trial Is Fun and Fodder," published in ''The New York Times'' on February 15, 2007, quotes [[Robert Cox (Media Bloggers Association)|Robert Cox]], president of the [[Media Bloggers Association]], who observes that ''United States of America v. I. Lewis Libby'' is "the first federal case for which independent bloggers have been given official credentials along with reporters from the traditional news media."<ref name=NYT-20070215>Scott Shane, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/washington/15bloggers.html "For Liberal Bloggers, Libby Trial Is Fun and Fodder"], ''The New York Times'' February 15, 2007 [appended correction].</ref><ref name=MBA>''[http://www.mediabloggers.org/scooter-libby-trial The Scooter Libby Trial]'', ''Media Bloggers Association'', February 20, 2007โ28 June 2007 (updated periodically), accessed June 30, 2007.</ref>

On January 3, 2007, the first team of bloggers to announce that they had been granted press credentials was ''[[Firedoglake]]'', a progressive blog founded by [[Jane Hamsher]].<ref name="FDL1">Christy Hardin Smith, [http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/01/03/guess-who-is-going-to-dc/ "Guess Who Is Going To DC?"] ''Firedoglake'' (accredited press blog) January 3, 2007, accessed February 15, 2007.</ref> Less than a week later, on January 9, the Media Bloggers Association announced that several of its affiliated bloggers had been granted press credentials too.<ref>Robert Cox, [http://www.mediabloggers.org/robert-cox/federal-court-credentials-bloggers "Federal Court Credentials Bloggers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128131605/http://www.mediabloggers.org/robert-cox/federal-court-credentials-bloggers |date=January 28, 2007 }}, ''Media Bloggers Association'', January 9, 2007, accessed February 15, 2007.</ref>

Among those representing the traditional press and mainstream media reporter [[David Shuster]] began live blogging the trial for MSNBC on ''[[Hardblogger]]'', an online feature linked at ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', as well as reporting on camera in segments of various MSNBC News programs.<ref name=Schuster>[[David Shuster]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20061219004005/http://hardblogger.msnbc.msn.com/default.aspx "Prosecutors Introduce First Evidence at Libby Trial"] , ''Hardblogger'' (accredited press blog), ''MSNBC'', January 23, 2007, accessed January 24, 2007.</ref> A transcript of Schuster's broadcast report on the first day of the trial, during which Schuster says that the prosecution summarized evidence to support its allegations that Vice President Dick Cheney was involved in Libby's actions relating to the Plame affair, is posted on several of these news blogs.<ref name=Merritt3>[[Jeralyn Merritt]], [http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/1/23/205811/204 "The Scooter Libby Headline for Day One"], ''TalkLeft'' (accredited press blog), January 23, 2007, accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

Some controversy arose among various bloggers about who is primarily responsible for acquiring Libby trial press credentials, with numerous mainstream-media accounts, including ''The Washington Post'', giving Cox and his Media Bloggers Association credit:

{{quote|... for the first time in a federal court, two of these seats [in the actual courtroom] will be reserved for bloggers. After two years of negotiations with judicial officials across the country, the Media Bloggers Association, a nonpartisan group with about 1,000 members working to extend the powers of the press to bloggers, has won credentials to rotate among his members. The trial of I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the highest-ranking Bush administration official to face criminal charges, could "catalyze" the association's efforts to win respect and access for bloggers in federal and state courthouses, said Robert Cox, the association's president.

Robert Cox is trying to foster standards. His Media Bloggers Association won court credentials for bloggers ...<ref>Alan Sipress, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011002424.html "Too Casual To Sit on Press Row?] Bloggers' Credentials Boosted With Seats at the Libby Trial", ''The Washington Post'', January 11, 2007, accessed January 25, 25, 2007 (registration required).</ref>}}

Bloggers from ''Firedoglake'' disputed some of these statements.<ref>[http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/02/15/about-those-jury-instructions/ "About Those Jury Instructions"], ''Firedoglake'' (accredited press blog) February 15, 2007, accessed February 15, 2007.</ref><ref>Cf.

<blockquote>[The] front-page article on Thursday about bloggers covering the perjury trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr. referred imprecisely to the role of Robert A. Cox, president of the Media Bloggers Association, in securing credentials. Mr. Cox negotiated access for his association, which was the first blogger group to be granted credentials to cover the trial. He did not negotiate on behalf of firedoglake.com and other blogs that received their credentials later.<ref name=NYT-20070215/></blockquote>

Shane concludes: "With no audio or video feed permitted, the Firedoglake 'live blog' has offered the fullest, fastest public report available. Many mainstream journalists use it to check on the trial."<ref name=NYT-20070215/>

On February 7, 2007, during the examination of journalist [[Tim Russert]], as covered on MSNBC, video clips of Libby's Grand Jury testimony were played; Russert's current testimony contradicts key parts of Libby's previous testimony, in that on the stand Russert denied that he told (or even could have told) Libby about Mrs. Wilson's working for the CIA, as Libby has claimed.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17020411 "Russert Testifies in Libby Perjury Trial:] Packed Court Hears NBC Newsman Deny Identifying CIA Operative", ''Hardball with Chris Matthews'', ''MSNBC'', February 7, 2007, accessed February 9, 2007.

On February 13, as the defense was beginning to present its case, however, defense lawyers told the court that neither Cheney nor Libby would be taking the stand.<ref name=Bohn/><ref name="washingtonpost.com"/> In addition to their blogging, Jane Hamsher, Marcy Wheeler and Jeralyn Merritt also appeared on camera via ''PoliticsTV.com'' at the end of most days to sum up that day's legal proceedings directly observed in the courtroom, providing links to these video programs in their online accounts. For example, they appeared on camera to present their views of February 14, the day the defense rested, and did a similar roundup at the end of the trial, covering the closing arguments for the prosecution and the defense.

Beginning on February 26, the media reported that one of the twelve jurors had been "dismissed" because she "was exposed to information about the trial ... but the judge allowed the jury to continue deliberations with 11 members."<ref name=LATimes227>Richard B.
