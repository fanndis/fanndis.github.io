'''Willard Mitt Romney''' (born March 12, 1947) is an American politician, businessman and former presidential candidate who has served as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States senator]] from [[Utah]] since January 2019. He previously served as the 70th [[governor of Massachusetts]] from 2003 to 2007 and was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s nominee for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]].

Raised in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], by his parents, [[George W. Romney|George]] and [[Lenore Romney]], he spent over two years from 1966 in France as a [[Mormon missionary]]. He married [[Ann Romney|Ann Davies]] in 1969; they have five sons. By 1971, he had participated in the political campaigns of both parents. In 1971 Romney graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[English studies|English]] from [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) and in 1975 gained the [[JD–MBA]] degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-with-english-majors-2013-5 |first1=Vivian |last1=Giang |first2=Lynne |last2=Guey |first3=Max |last3=Nisen |date=May 16, 2013 |work=Business Insider |title=16 Wildly Successful People Who Majored In English|accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref> Romney became a management consultant and in 1977 joined [[Bain & Company]] in [[Boston]]. As Bain's [[chief executive officer]] (CEO), he later helped lead the company out of a financial crisis<!-- this is supported by detailed material and sources in body of article -->. In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off company [[Bain Capital]], a [[private equity]] investment firm that became one of the [[List of private equity firms|largest of its kind]] in the nation.<!-- this is supported by detailed material and sources in body of article --> Active in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) throughout his adult life, Romney served as [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of his [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] and later as a [[Stake (LDS Church)|stake president]], for an area covering Boston and many of its suburbs.

After stepping down from Bain Capital and his local leadership role in the LDS Church, Romney ran as the Republican candidate in the [[1994 United States Senate election in Massachusetts]]. After losing to longtime incumbent [[Ted Kennedy]], he resumed his position at Bain Capital. Years later, a successful stint as president and CEO of the then-struggling [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] led to a re-launch of his political career. Elected Governor of Massachusetts in [[2002 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2002]], Romney helped develop and later signed a [[Massachusetts health care reform|health care reform]] law (commonly referred to as "Romneycare") that provided near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and [[health insurance mandate|individual mandates to purchase insurance]]. He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2–1.5&nbsp;billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees and closing corporate [[tax loopholes]]. He did not seek re-election in [[2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2006]], instead focusing on his campaign for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election]]. Though he won several [[United States presidential primary|primaries and caucuses]], Romney ultimately lost the nomination to Senator [[John McCain]]. Romney's considerable net worth, estimated in 2012 at $190–250 million, helped finance his political campaigns prior to 2012. Romney again ran for and won the  [[2012 Republican presidential nomination|Republican presidential nomination in 2012]], becoming the first LDS Church member to be a presidential nominee of a [[major party]]. He was defeated by incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]], losing the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by a margin of 206–332 and the popular vote by a margin of 47–51%.

After re-establishing residency in Utah, Romney announced his campaign for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat held by the retiring [[Orrin Hatch]] in the [[2018 United States Senate election in Utah|2018 election]]; he defeated state representative [[Mike Kennedy (politician)|Mike Kennedy]] in the Republican primary and Democrat [[Jenny Wilson (politician)|Jenny Wilson]] in the general election. In doing so, he became only the third individual ever to be elected governor of one state and U.S. senator for another state (the others being [[Sam Houston]] and [[William Bibb]]). Romney was sworn in on January 3, 2019. In the [[impeachment trial of Donald Trump]], he voted to convict the president of [[abuse of power]] (over Trump's attempts to get Ukrainian President [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] to announce an investigation into his political rival [[Joe Biden]]), becoming the first and only senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party.<ref name="NYT_Impeachment_Vote">{{cite news |last1=Leibovich |first1=Mark |title=Romney, Defying the Party He Once Personified, Votes to Convict Trump |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/romney-trump-impeachment.html |accessdate=8 February 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=5 February 2020}}</ref>

Initially, Bain Capital focused on [[venture capital]] investments. Romney set up a system in which any partner could veto one of these potential opportunities, and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years.<ref name="bgseries3" /> The firm's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start [[Staples Inc.]], after founder [[Thomas G. Stemberg]] convinced Romney of the market size for office supplies and Romney convinced others; Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade.<ref name="bgseries3" /><ref name="blum" /><ref name="nym-onep">{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/print/?/news/politics/mitt-romney-2011-10/|title=Mitt Romney and the 1% Economy|author=Wallace-Wells, Benjamin|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=October 23, 2011}}</ref>

Romney soon switched Bain Capital's focus from startups to the relatively new business of [[leveraged buyouts]]: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets as collateral, then taking steps to improve the companies' value, and finally selling those companies once their value peaked, usually within a few years.<ref name="bgseries3" /><ref name="howmakemoney" /> Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but then found deals that made large returns.<ref name="bgseries3" /> The firm invested in or acquired [[Accuride Corporation]], [[Brookstone]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Sealy Corporation]], [[Sports Authority]], and [[Artisan Entertainment]], as well as some lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors.<ref name="bgseries3" /><ref name="howmakemoney" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2001/08/20/daily27.html|title=Bain Capital's Romney aiming for politics after Olympics|newspaper=[[Boston Business Journal]]|date=August 23, 2001}}</ref> Much of the firm's profit was earned from a relatively small number of deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.{{#tag:ref|One study of 68&nbsp;deals that Bain Capital made during Romney's time there found that the firm lost money or broke even on 33 of them.<ref name="vf-excerpt" /> Another study that looked at the eight-year period following 77&nbsp;deals during Romney's time found that in 17&nbsp;cases the company went bankrupt or out of business, and in 6&nbsp;cases Bain Capital lost all its investment.

Romney discovered few investment opportunities himself (and those that he did, often failed to make money for the firm).<ref name="real-155" /> Instead, he focused on analyzing the merits of possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved.<ref name="real-155">Kranish; Helman, ''The Real Romney'', pp. 141, 155.</ref> Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself.<ref name="nyt-depagr" />
Data-driven, Romney often played the role of a [[devil's advocate]] during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal.<ref name="bgseries3" /><ref name="nym-onep" /> He wanted to drop a Bain Capital [[hedge fund]] that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions.<ref name="bgseries3" /> He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated films]].<ref name="bgseries3" /> Romney served on the board of directors of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated).<ref name="bgseries3" /> In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.<ref name="blum" />
