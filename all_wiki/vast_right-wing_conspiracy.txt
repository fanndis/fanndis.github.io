"'''Vast right-wing conspiracy'''" is a [[conspiracy theory]] popularized by a 1995 memo by political opposition researcher [[Chris Lehane]] and then referenced in 1998 by the then [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], in defense of her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]], characterizing the continued allegations of scandal against her and her husband, including the [[Lewinsky scandal]], as part of a long campaign by Clinton's political enemies.<ref name = "WP1998">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/hillary012898.htm |title=First Lady Launches Counterattack |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=2009-06-14}}</ref> The term has been used since, including in a question posed to Bill Clinton in 2009 to describe verbal attacks on [[Barack Obama]] during [[Presidency of Barack Obama|his early presidency]].<ref name=MTP/> Hillary Clinton mentioned it again during her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]].<ref name="cbscondon"/>

==1995 memo==
A 332-page memo titled "Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce" was commissioned by [[Mark Fabiani]] and written by [[Chris Lehane]] in 1995. It was the first document to describe the conspiracies surrounding the Clintons, which Hillary Clinton later popularized with the term "vast right-wing conspiracy."<ref>{{cite web |last=Garofoli |first=Joe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/The-Spinner-How-Chris-Lehane-revered-by-some-2679295.php |title=The Spinner / How Chris Lehane, revered by some and reviled by others, gets the campaign consultant job done |date=October 24, 2004 |work=SFGate |access-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref> It described how online conservative media outlets such as ''[[The American Spectator]]'' spread conspiracy theories about the [[suicide of Vince Foster]], the [[Whitewater controversy]], and other events.

==''The Today Show'' interview==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In response to ongoing accusations surrounding the Clintons' investment in a real estate development known as [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clinton's [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] had appointed an [[independent counsel]], [[Kenneth Starr]], to investigate those accusations in 1994.  Starr's investigation began to branch out into other issues, from [[Filegate]] to [[Travelgate]] to Bill Clinton's actions in the civil case of his alleged sexual harassment of [[Paula Jones]] prior to his presidency.  In the course of the last of these, [[White House]] intern [[Monica Lewinsky]] signed an affidavit that she had not had a relationship with Clinton, but Lewinsky's confidant [[Linda Tripp]] had been recording their phone conversations and offered Starr tapes of Lewinsky describing her feelings for, and alleging intimate encounters with, the president.  The president was asked to give a deposition, and accusations that he lied about an affair under oath first made national headlines on January 17, 1998, when the story was picked up by the conservative-right e-mail newsletter ''[[The Drudge Report]]''.  Despite swift denials from President Clinton, the media attention grew.

On January 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', in an interview with [[Matt Lauer]].

{{quote|'''Lauer''': You have said, I understand, to some close friends, that this is the last great battle, and that one side or the other is going down here.<br/>
'''Clinton''': Well, I don't know if I've been that dramatic. That would sound like a good line from a movie. But I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this—they have popped up in other settings. This is—the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.}}

Clinton elaborated by decrying the tactics "and the kind of intense political agenda at work here".  [[Bob Woodward]] recounts in his book ''The Agenda'' (1994) that the then-first lady claimed that when her husband was making his decision to run for the presidency in 1991, he reported receiving "a direct threat from someone in the Bush White House, warning that if he ran, the Republicans would go after him. 'We will do everything we can to destroy you personally,' she recalled that the Bush White House man had said."<ref name="WP1998"/>

==Later uses==
[[David Brock]], a conservative-turned-liberal author, has said he was once a part of an effort to dredge up a scandal against Clinton.<ref name="apology">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/ | title=Reporter Apologizes For Clinton Sex Article | publisher=[[CNN]] |date= March 10, 1998 | access-date =2008-10-17 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614124146/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/ |archive-date = June 14, 2008}}</ref> In 1993 Brock, then of the ''[[American Spectator]]'', was the first to report Paula Jones' claims.<ref name="apology"/> As Brock explained in ''[[Blinded by the Right]]'', after learning more about the events and conservative payments surrounding [[Paula Jones]] he personally apologized to the Clintons. He documented his experience in ''[[Blinded by the Right|Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative]]'', wherein he alleged that Arkansas state troopers had taken money in exchange for testimony against Clinton which Brock had published in a previous book. [[Adam Curtis]] also discusses the concept in his documentary series ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]''.  Brock has agreed with Clinton's claim that there was a "Right wing conspiracy" to smear her husband, quibbling only with the characterization of it as "vast", since Brock contends that it was orchestrated mainly by a few powerful people. [[MSNBC]] also described the comment as once-ridiculed but now taken more seriously by "many Democrats" who point "to the well-documented efforts by conservative financier Richard Mellon Scaife to fund a network of anti-Clinton investigations."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17593375 |title=Clinton: Vast right-wing conspiracy is back |publisher=NBC News |agency=Associated Press |date=March 13, 2007}}</ref>

Specific claims of such funding have been made against conservative Republican supporter and billionaire [[Richard Mellon Scaife]].<ref>Media Transparency, [http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php Aggregated Grants from the Scaife Foundations.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608130352/http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php |date=2007-06-08 }}</ref>  Scaife played a major role in funding the [[Arkansas Project]] investigating President Clinton; former Clinton [[White House Counsel]] [[Lanny Davis]] claimed Scaife was using his money "to destroy a president of the United States."  Scaife claims to be public about his political spending (q.v.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scaife.org|title=scaife.org<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>). CNN stated in a study the news outlet conducted on Scaife, "If it's a conspiracy, it's a pretty open one."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/27/scaife.profile/ | work=CNN | access-date=May 27, 2010 | title=Who Is Richard Mellon Scaife? | first=Brooks | last=Jackson}}</ref>

Hillary Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography, "Looking back, I see that I might have phrased my point more artfully, but I stand by the characterization of Starr's investigation [regardless of the truth about Lewinsky]."<ref>''Living History'', p. 446.</ref> By 2007 her experiences caused Hillary Clinton to say in presidential campaign appearances that the vast right-wing conspiracy was back, citing such cases as the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]].<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17593375 Clinton: Vast right-wing conspiracy is back], NBC News/AP, March 13, 2007</ref> On the [[Stump speech (politics)|stump]] for [[Al Franken]]'s 2008 Senate campaign, Bill Clinton acknowledged his [[Air America Radio]] show by quipping that he had been taking on the "vast right wing conspiracy before others even acknowledged that it existed".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/21/hillary_clinton_al_franken_and.html|title=Hillary Clinton, Al Franken and the Return of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 21, 2008|author=Kane, Paul}}</ref>

Former President Clinton, when asked on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' (September 27, 2009) whether the vast right wing conspiracy was involved in the attacks on President [[Barack Obama]], said "Oh, you bet.  Sure it is.  It's not as strong as it was, because America's changed demographically, but it's as virulent as it was ... when they accused me of murder and all that stuff."<ref name = MTP>Meet the Press, 21 Sept. 2009, [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33032390 transcript]</ref>

Two other figures who have used the phrase are Nobel laureate economist [[Paul Krugman]] and journalist [[Joe Conason]]. Conason, in an article called "The vast right-wing conspiracy is back," refers the [[National Republican Trust PAC]] and [[Newsmax Media]], which are run by former foes of Bill Clinton and who made attacks on then-President Barack Obama.  The National Republican Trust PAC sponsored a campaign commercials against Obama in 2008 which [[FactCheck.org]] described as "one of the sleaziest false TV ads of the campaign."  One of Newsmax Media's owners "was among the most insistent endorsers of the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|Obama birth certificate myth]]" and a popularizer of  the canard that Bill Clinton's White House counsel [[Suicide of Vince Foster|Vince Foster]] did not commit suicide—as determined by five official investigations—but was murdered.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2009/10/05/clinton_obama_17/ The vast right-wing conspiracy is back]. Salon.com Oct 5, 2009</ref>

In some of his books, Krugman has used the phrase ("Yes, Virginia, there is a vast right-wing conspiracy"{{sfn|Krugman|2004|pages=217, 269–71}}) to refer not to a conservative Republican-leaning campaign against Clinton (or Obama), but more generally to "an interlocking set of institutions ultimately answering to a small group of people that collectively reward loyalists and punish dissenters" in the service of "[[movement conservatism]]."  The network of institutions provide

<blockquote>obedient politicians with the resources to win elections, safe havens in the event of defeat, and lucrative career opportunities after they leave office. They guarantee favorable news coverage to politicians who follow the party line, while harassing and undermining opponents. And they support a large standing army of party intellectuals and activists.{{sfn|Krugman|2007|page=163}}</blockquote>

In Krugman's view, the network of foundations that fund conservative scholarship, the national and regional think tanks and advocacy groups, talk radio media outlets, and conservative law firms through which they pushed their agenda to move the Republican Party to the right, far surpass in funding, size, inter-connectedness or influence anything the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] or the American political left/liberal movement have at their disposal.

==2014 reemergence==
In April 2014, the [[Clinton Presidential Center]] published the original 1995 memo on the conspiracy.<ref name="ABC memo"/> The memo's author, Chris Lehane, wrote, "As for the premise of the memo, I absolutely stand by it. Not only was it right about the right wing then, it is more accurate than ever today."<ref>{{cite web |last=Lehane |first=Chris |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/04/chris-lehane-right-wing-conspiracy-memo-106059 |title=Yeah, I Wrote the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy Memo |date=April 27, 2014 |work=POLITICO Magazine |access-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref>

==2016 reemergence==

==Use in popular culture==
After the release of a deposition Bill Clinton had given to [[Starr Report|the Independent Counsel]] in which he [[perjury|perjured]] himself, some conservatives began to adopt the VRWC phrasing ironically. In 2004, conservative lawyer [[Mark W. Smith]] wrote the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]] ''[[Official Handbook of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy]]'', which came with a "membership card" that made its owner an "official member of the VRWC."  Similarly, a number of newspaper, magazine, and website articles have used the phrase to report on [[left-wing politics]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/magazine/25DEMOCRATS.html |title=Wiring the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=2004-07-25 |first=Matt |last=Bai |publisher=[[New York Times]] |access-date=May 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407220527/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/magazine/25DEMOCRATS.html |archive-date=April 7, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://webm.powerparcel.com/domains/domainsponsor_all.php?parent=dsflip_live&domain=joinspencer.com | title=The Clinton-McFarland Connection: A vast left-wing conspiracy? | access-date=2007-04-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504020428/http://webm.powerparcel.com/domains/domainsponsor_all.php?parent=dsflip_live&domain=joinspencer.com | archive-date=2007-05-04 | url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Eugene Volokh]]'s blog [[The Volokh Conspiracy]] is said to have derived its name from as a reference to the "Vast right-wing conspiracy" statement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/168389/the-volokh-conspiracy|title=The Volokh Conspiracy Is Out To Get You|newspaper=Tablet Magazine|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}</ref>
