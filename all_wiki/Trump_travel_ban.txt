== Executive actions ==
* [[Executive Order 13769]] (January 27, 2017) – The original travel ban.
* [[Executive Order 13780]] (March 6, 2017) – The second and revised travel ban superseding the original travel ban. This ban was effective for only 90 days.
* [[Presidential Proclamation 9645]] (September 24, 2017) – A third travel ban to replace the second one, which expired after 90 days.
* [[Presidential Proclamation 9723]] (April 10, 2018) – A proclamation removed the travel restrictions on Chad.

In the days after the first executive order was issued, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] objected to the characterization of the executive order as a "travel ban".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/317144-spicer-trump-executive-order-not-a-travel-ban|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|title=Spicer: Trump executive order 'not a travel ban'|date=January 31, 2017|first=Jordan|last=Fabian|access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref> However, Trump himself referred to his actions as a "travel ban".<ref>{{cite news|title=A Travel Ban or Not?

After the question was asked, the text "DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON PREVENTING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION" was removed from Trump's campaign website.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/05/09/trumps-preventing-muslim-immigration-vow-disappears-from-campaign-website-after-spicer-questioned/|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=May 9, 2017|first=Fred|last=Barbash|title=Muslim ban language suddenly disappears from Trump campaign website after Spicer questioned|access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref>

All three travel bans were [[Legal challenges to the Trump travel ban|challenged in court]]. This delayed implementation and motivated the second and third revisions; eventually Presidential Proclamation 9645 and its accompanying travel ban was upheld in the Supreme Court.

In January 2020, the Trump Administration announced plans for an expansion of the travel ban.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/753968e412fab06e6fb8180e7ac98d47|title=White House considering dramatic expansion of travel ban|date=January 10, 2020|agency=[[Associated Press]]|first1=Jonathan|last1=Lemire|first2= Lisa|last2= Mascaro| first3= Jill| last3= Colvin}}</ref>

== Effect on banned countries ==

More than 135 million people lived in countries affected by the original ban (which has since been expanded). [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] were most affected— Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, and Syria experienced a 92%, 86%, 83%, 80%, 83%, and 77% decrease in the number of immigrant visas to the United States compared to the previous year. <ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Niayesh|first=Vahid|date=October 28, 2019|title=Statistics show that Trump's "travel ban" was always a Muslim ban|language=en|website=Quartz|url=https://qz.com/1736809/statistics-show-that-trumps-travel-ban-was-always-a-muslim-ban/|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref> However, the number of visas issued to [[North Korea|North Koreans]] increased by 40% during the same period. <ref name=":2" />

== Exceptions ==
[[Federal government of the United States|The United States government]] has a system to provide 'waivers' as exceptions to people affected from the countries who need visas. The waivers are granted at the discretion of the consular officers who review the applications.<ref name=":3" /> The waiver is granted to those facing a lot of undue hardship that requires them to be with their loved ones in the [[United States]]. For example, if a family member in the [[United States]] is dying, a person from the country with a travel ban on it would be granted a waiver to see their family member one last time.<ref name=":3" /> However, getting a waiver doesn't guarantee entry to the country. After being approved for the waiver the applicants must still apply for a visa.<ref name=":3" /> Only 2% of the people who applied for the waiver were granted one. From 33,176 applicants through April 30, 2018, 579 applicants had been granted the waiver.<ref name=":3" />
