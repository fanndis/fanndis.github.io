'''Print syndication''' distributes [[news article]]s, [[column (periodical)|columns]], [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoons]], [[comic strip]]s and other features to [[newspapers]], [[magazines]] and [[websites]]. The syndicates offer reprint rights and grant permissions to other parties for republishing content of which they own and/or represent copyrights. Other terms for the service include a '''newspaper syndicate''', a '''press syndicate''', and a '''feature syndicate'''.

The syndicate is an agency that offers features from notable journalists and authorities as well as reliable and established cartoonists. It fills a need among smaller weekly and daily newspapers for material that helps them compete with large urban papers, at a much lesser cost than if the client were to purchase the material themselves. Generally, syndicates sell their material to one client in each territory. [[News agency|News agencies]] differ in that they distribute news articles to all interested parties.

Typical syndicated features are [[advice columns]] (parenting, health, finance, gardening, cooking, etc.), [[Causerie|humor columns]], [[editorial]] opinion, [[critic]]'s reviews, and [[gossip columns]]. Some syndicates specialize in one type of feature, such as comic strips.

==Comic strip syndication==
{{main|Comic strip syndication}}
A comic strip syndicate functions as an agent for [[cartoonist]]s and comic strip creators, placing the cartoons and strips in as many newspapers as possible on behalf of the artist. In some cases, the work will be owned by the syndicate as opposed to the creator. A syndicate can annually receive thousands of submissions from which only two or three might be selected for representation.

The leading strip syndicates include  [[Andrews McMeel Syndication]], [[King Features Syndicate]],<ref>Dwyer, Ed. [https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2016/11/the-funny-papers/ "CULTURE: The Funny Papers: Newspapers may be in trouble, but the comic strip is alive and well — and flourishing online,"] ''Saturday Evening Post'' (November 7, 2016).</ref> and [[Creators Syndicate]], with the [[Tribune Content Agency]] and [[The Washington Post Writers Group]] also in the running.

== Editorial cartoon syndication ==
Syndication of editorial cartoons has an important impact on the form, since cartoons about local issues or politicians are not of interest to the national market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hynds|first=Ernest C.|date=April 1979|title=Herblock, Oliphant, MacNelly Lead Cartoon Resurgence|journal=Newspaper Research Journal|pages=54–60}}</ref> Therefore, an artist who contracts with a syndicate will either be one who already focuses their work on national and global issues, or will shift focus accordingly.

== History ==
An early version of syndication was practiced in the ''[[Journal of Occurrences]]'', a series of newspaper articles published by an anonymous group of "patriots" in 1768–1769 in the ''New York Journal and Packet'' and other newspapers, chronicling the occupation of Boston by the British Army.

According to historian [[Elmo Scott Watson]], true print syndication began in 1841 with a two-page supplement produced by ''[[The Sun (New York City)|New York Sun]]'' publisher [[Moses Yale Beach]] and sold to a score of newspapers in the U.S. northeast.<ref name=Watson>Watson, Elmo Scott. "CHAPTER VIII: Recent Developments in Syndicate History 1921-1935," ''History of Newspaper Syndicates''. [https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2016/07/history-of-newspaper-syndicates-by-elmo_8.html Archived at ''Stripper's Guide''].</ref>

By the end of the Civil War, three syndicates were in operation, selling news items and short fiction pieces. By 1881, [[Associated Press]] correspondent [[Henry Villard]] was self-syndicating material to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', the ''[[Cincinnati Commercial]]'', and the ''[[New York Herald]]''. A few years later, the ''[[New York Sun]]'''s [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] formed a syndicate to sell the short stories of [[Bret Harte]] and [[Henry James]].

The first full-fledged American newspaper syndicate was the [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]], launched in 1884 by publisher [[S. S. McClure]]. It was the first successful company of its kind, turning the marketing of [[columnist|columns]], book serials (by the likes of [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]), and eventually [[comic strip]]s, into a large industry.<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915459-1,00.html#ixzz0mmf1NCtQ ''Time'', 1977.]</ref>

Syndication properly took off in 1896 when the competitors the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[New York Journal]]'' began producing [[Sunday comic]] pages. The daily comic strip came into practice in 1907, revolutionizing and expanding the syndication business. Syndicates began providing client newspaper with [[Prepress proofing|proof]] sheets of black-and-white line art for the reproduction of strips."<ref>Scott, Randy. "The King Features Proof Sheet Collection". ''Insight''. Fall 2009. p. 3.</ref>

By 1984, 300 syndicates were distributing 10,000 features with combined sales of $100&nbsp;million a year.<ref name=Time />

With the 1960s advent of the [[underground press]], associations like the [[Underground Press Syndicate]], and later the [[Association of Alternative Newsmedia]], worked together to syndicate material — including weekly comic strips — for each other's publications.
