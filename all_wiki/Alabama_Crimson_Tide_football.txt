Alabama has had 28 head coaches since organized football began in 1892. Adopting the nickname ''"Crimson Tide"'' after the 1907 season, 12 coaches have led the Crimson Tide in postseason bowl games: [[Wallace Wade]], [[Frank Thomas (American football)|Frank Thomas]], [[Harold Drew|Harold D. "Red" Drew]], [[Bear Bryant]], [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]], [[Bill Curry]], [[Gene Stallings]], [[Mike DuBose]], [[Dennis Franchione]], [[Mike Shula]], [[Joe Kines]], and [[Nick Saban]].<ref name="Bama-NCs-text">{{cite web |url=http://www.rolltide.com/trads/national-championships.html |title=National Championships |publisher=University of Alabama Athletics |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022183419/http://www.rolltide.com/trads/national-championships.html |archive-date=October 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Eight of those coaches also won [[athletic conference|conference]] championships: Wade, Thomas, Drew, Bryant, Curry, Stallings, DuBose, and Saban.

===National championships===
National championships in [[NCAA]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] college football are debated as the NCAA does not officially award the championship. Despite not naming an official [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|National Champion]], the NCAA provides lists of championships awarded by organizations it recognizes.<ref name="NCAA_Past-champs">{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/ncaa?key=/ncaa/NCAA/Sports%20and%20Championship/General%20Information/ia_football_past_champs.html |title=Past Division I-A Football National Champions |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=December 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124233545/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/ncaa?key=%2Fncaa%2FNCAA%2FSports%20and%20Championship%2FGeneral%20Information%2Fia_football_past_champs.html |archive-date=November 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name="NCAA-history">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.com/default.php?id=91434 |title=NCAA History |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=October 7, 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> According to the official NCAA 2009 Division I Football Records Book, "During the last 138 years, there have been more than 30 selectors of national champions using polls, historical research and mathematical rating systems. Beginning in 1936, the Associated Press began the best-known and most widely circulated poll of sportswriters and broadcasters. Before 1936, national champions were determined by historical research and retroactive ratings and polls. [...] The criteria for being included in this historical list of poll selectors is that the poll be national in scope, either through distribution in newspaper, television, radio and/or computer online."<ref name="2009 Division I Football Records Book">{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2009/2009FBS.pdf |title=Football Bowl Subdivision Records pp. 76–78 |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>

Since World War II, Alabama claims only national championships awarded by the final [[AP Poll]] or the final [[Coaches' Poll]]. This policy is consistent with other FBS football programs with numerous national title claims, including Notre Dame, [[USC Trojans football|USC]], and [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]. All national championships claimed by the University of Alabama were published in nationally syndicated newspapers and magazines, and each of the national championship selectors, and are cited in the Official 2010 NCAA [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] Record Book.<ref>http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/DI/2010/2010FBS.pdf</ref> In addition to the championships claimed by the university, the NCAA has listed Alabama as receiving a championship for the [[1945 college football season|1945]], [[1966 NCAA University Division football season|1966]], [[1975 NCAA Division I football season|1975]], and [[1977 NCAA Division I football season|1977 college football seasons]].<ref name="NCAA_Past-champs" /><ref name="NCAA-history" />

In Alabama's 1982 media guide, the last for Coach Bryant, 1934 is listed as the only national championship before Coach Bryant in a footnote about the school's SEC history. In the 1980s, Alabama's Sports Information Director Wayne Atcheson started recognizing five pre-Bryant national championship teams (1925, 1926, 1930, 1934, 1941) by adding them to the University's Football Media Guide. According to Atcheson, he made the effort in the context of disputed titles being claimed by other schools, and "to make Alabama football look the best it could look" to compete with the other claimants. Atcheson maintains that the titles are the school's rightful claims.<ref name="Solomon-2010">Solomon, John (January 6, 2010) "[http://blog.al.com/solomon/2010/01/got_12.html Got 12? Here's how Alabama bumped up its claim to a dozen national titles]". ''[[The Birmingham News]]''.</ref>

The [[University of Alabama]] 2009 Official Football Media Guide says Alabama had 12 national championships prior to winning the [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]].<ref>"[http://www.rolltide.com/promotions/2009-m-footbl-guide.html"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119080308/http://www.rolltide.com/promotions/2009-m-footbl-guide.html |date=January 19, 2010}}</ref> The 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2017 titles bring the total number of national championships claimed by Alabama to 17. Twelve of Alabama's national championships were awarded by the wire-services ([[AP Poll|AP]], [[Coaches' Poll]]) or by winning the [[BCS National Championship Game]].<ref name="NCAA_Past-champs" /><ref name="NCAA-history" />

In January 2013, CNN suggested that Alabama might be college football's new dynasty,<ref name="Is Alabama college football's new dynasty?">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/08/sport/bcs-championship |publisher=CNN, Turner Broadcasting Company |title=Is Alabama college football's new dynasty? |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> and in May 2013, Athlon Sports ranked Alabama's ongoing dynasty as the fourth-best since 1934, behind [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] (1948–58), [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] (1986–92), and [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] (1993–97).<ref name="Athlon Sports ranks the best dynasties in college football since the AP Poll debuted">{{cite web |url=http://athlonsports.com/college-football/college-footballs-top-25-greatest-dynasties-ap-era |publisher=FoxSports.com |title=College Football's Top 25 Greatest Dynasties of the AP Era |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

==Rivalries==

===Auburn===
{{main|Iron Bowl}}
[[File:Alabama offense IronBowl 2010-11-26.jpg|thumb|left|Alabama on offense against the Tigers in 2010]]

The main rivalry of the Crimson Tide is against its in-state rival, Auburn University; considered one of the top sporting rivalries in the US. The Alabama-Auburn game has come to be known as the Iron Bowl.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html |title=The 10 greatest rivalries |publisher=ESPN |date=January 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924064710/http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html |archive-date= September 24, 2008 |url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpehWR53e7AC |title=Football Feuds: The Greatest College Football Rivalries |last=Rappoport |first=Ken |author2=Barry Wilner |publisher=Globe Pequot |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59921-014-8 |chapter=The Iron Bowl: Auburn-Alabama |page=77 |ref=FootballFeuds}}</ref> The outcome of the game generally determines "bragging rights" in the state of Alabama until the following contest. The game may also have implications as to which team will represent the SEC Western Division in the [[SEC Championship Game]].

On February 22, 1893, at Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Auburn was victorious in the first ever Iron Bowl, 32–22. The series was suspended after the 1907 contest, due to violence and financial complications.<ref>[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 79</ref> In 1944, Auburn suggested to reopen the series, though the Board of Trustees at Alabama rejected. The series was resumed in 1948, with Alabama crushing the Tigers 55–0, which is still the largest margin of victory in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1122productions.com/brandon/ftbstats/2000/week10-2000.html |title=The University of Alabama Football Facts |year=2000 |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119155128/http://www.1122productions.com/brandon/ftbstats/2000/week10-2000.html |archive-date=November 19, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rolltide.com/archive_files/files/football/2007/mediaguide/176-181.pdf |title=This is Alabama Football: Iron Bowl |publisher=University of Alabama Athletics |page=157 |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://www.rolltide.com/archive_files/files/football/2007/mediaguide/176-181.pdf |archive-date=May 4, 2017}}</ref> In the following contest, Auburn shocked Alabama with a 14–13 victory, which is credited with helping revive the series.<ref>[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 80</ref>

For many years, the contest was held at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham, before the teams began alternating between Bryant-Denny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa, and [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]]. Alabama won the most recent meeting 42-13 in Tuscaloosa and leads the series at 47-37–1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/alabama/vs/auburn|title=Winsipedia - Alabama Crimson Tide vs. Auburn Tigers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref>

===Tennessee===
{{main|Third Saturday in October}}
[[File:Alabama vs Tennessee 2009-10-24.jpg|thumb|Alabama on offense versus Tennessee in Tuscaloosa during the [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2009 season]] ]]

Despite the heated in-state rivalry with Auburn, Bear Bryant was more adamant about defeating his rivals to the north, the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]].<ref>[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 81</ref> The series is named the [[Third Saturday in October]], the traditional calendar date on which the game was played. Despite the name, the game has been played on the third Saturday only five times between 1995–2007. The first game between the two sides was played in 1901 in Birmingham, ending in a 6–6 tie. From 1902 to 1913, Alabama dominated the series, losing only once, and never allowing a touchdown by the Volunteers. Beginning in 1928, the rivalry was first played on its traditional date and began to be a challenge for the Crimson Tide as [[Robert Neyland]] began challenging Alabama for their perennial spot on top of the conference standings.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=akYFAAAACAAJ |title=Third Saturday in October: Tennessee Vs.

Between 1971–1981, Alabama held an 11-game winning streak over the Volunteers and, between 1986–1994, a nine-game unbeaten streak. However, following Alabama's streak, Tennessee responded with a seven-game winning streak from 1995–2001. Currently, Alabama has the longest winning streak at 14, dating back to 2007. Alabama won the most recent meeting 48-17 in Knoxville, and leads the series 58-37–8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/alabama/vs/tennessee|title=Winsipedia - Alabama Crimson Tide vs. Tennessee Volunteers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref>

Between 1971–1981, the Crimson Tide won 11 consecutive times. In the 1969 game, LSU defeated Alabama 20–15 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. Alabama did not lose again in Baton Rouge until 2000.

In 2007, the meeting was more heated following Alabama's hiring of head coach [[Nick Saban]], who previously coached at LSU. With the hiring, many media outlets dubbed the 2007 meeting as the "Saban Bowl".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/110207dnspocarlton.2725d4b.html |title=LSU, Alabama to meet in first Saban Bowl |work=The Dallas Morning News |last=Carlton |first=Chuck |date=November 2, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205180946/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/110207dnspocarlton.2725d4b.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2007/11/01/2007-11-01_bayou_lsu_fans_brace_for_nick_saban_bowl.html |title=Bayou, LSU fans brace for Nick Saban Bowl |work=New York Daily News |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/collegesports/2003986699_grid01.html |title=It's Saban Bowl for riled LSU fans |work=The Seattle Times |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205091837/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/collegesports/2003986699_grid01.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> The Crimson Tide lost the first "Saban Bowl" in 2007, won the 2008 and 2009 meetings only to lose in Baton Rouge in 2010.

In recent years, Alabama has developed what some consider to be a [[Alabama–Clemson football rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson Tigers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/12/03/clemson-alabama-playoff-rivalry-continues-in-sugar-bowl/108281478/|title=Clemson-Alabama playoff rivalry continues in Sugar Bowl|website=USA TODAY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/21931900/round-iv-alabama-crimson-tide-clemson-tigers-college-football-playoff-rivalry-bring-on|title=Alabama-Clemson, Round IV?

Clemson's top three winningest head coaches, [[Frank Howard (American football coach)|Frank Howard]], [[Dabo Swinney]], and [[Danny Ford]], all played at Alabama, as did Clemson coaches [[Hootie Ingram]] and [[Charley Pell]]. The teams first played each other in 1900. The series escalated into a rivalry when the teams met in the College Football Playoff in the [[2016 College Football Playoff National Championship|2015]], [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship|2016]], [[2018 Sugar Bowl|2017]], and [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship|2018]] seasons.

===Former rivalries===
The [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] were at one time considered Alabama's arch rival. During the suspension of the Iron Bowl between 1907 and 1948, Georgia Tech (then a member of the SEC) emerged as the most intense game on Alabama's schedule. The teams played many significant games, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A heated feud developed between Bear Bryant and Georgia Tech head coach [[Bobby Dodd]] following a controversial hit in the [[1961 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1961]] game, a 10–0 Alabama victory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Rz9SAAAAIBAJ&pg=6881,547355&dq=chick+graning+incident|title=St. Petersburg Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> Dodd cited this feud as the primary impetus for Georgia Tech leaving the SEC three years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cecilbuffington.com/catalog_40.html|title=GEORGIA TECH LEAVES THE SEC|website=cecilbuffington.com}}</ref> The two teams have met 52 times, making Georgia Tech Alabama's most played among current non-conference opponents. Alabama leads the series 28–21–3; Georgia Tech won the last meeting in [[1984 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1984]]. Alabama's fight song, "Yea Alabama", mentions Georgia Tech with the line "Send the Yellow Jackets to a watery grave."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lyricsondemand.com/miscellaneouslyrics/fightsongslyrics/alabamayeafightsonglyrics.html|title=Alabama Yea Lyrics - Alabama Yea Fight Song Lyrics|website=Lyrics On Demand}}</ref>

There have been many historic games between [[Alabama–Penn State football rivalry|Alabama and Penn State]]. The two teams met five times during the tenure of Bear Bryant, including in the [[1979 Sugar Bowl]], which determined the national championship for the 1978 season. The games usually have national implications{{mdash}}seven of the 15 meetings between the two schools have featured both teams ranked in the top ten{{mdash}}and eight of the meetings have been decided by a touchdown or less. The most recent game was in 2011, with Alabama winning 27–11. It was the final loss for long-time Penn State head coach [[Joe Paterno]]. Alabama leads the series 10–5.
