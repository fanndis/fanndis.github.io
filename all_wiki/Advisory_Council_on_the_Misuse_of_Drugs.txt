The '''Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs''' ('''ACMD''') is a British statutory [[non-departmental public body|advisory non-departmental public body]], which was established under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].

==Mandate==

Its [[terms of reference]],<ref name="UKSTCreport">{{cite journal|title=Drug classification, making a hash of it?|author=UK House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/1031/1031.pdf|year=2006}}</ref> according to the Act, are as follows:

<blockquote>''to keep under review the situation in the United Kingdom with respect to drugs which are being or appear to them likely to be misused and of which the misuse is having or appears to them capable of having harmful effects sufficient to constitute a social problem, and to give to any one or more of the Ministers, where either Council consider it expedient to do so or they are consulted by the Minister or Ministers in question, advice on measures (whether or not involving alteration of the law) which in the opinion of the Council ought to be taken for preventing the misuse of such drugs or dealing with social problems connected with their misuse, and in particular on measures which in the opinion of the Council, ought to be taken''

*a) ''for restricting the availability of such drugs or supervising the arrangements for their supply'';
*b) ''for enabling persons affected by the misuse of such drugs to obtain proper advice, and for securing the provision of proper facilities and services for the treatment, rehabilitation and aftercare of such persons'';
*c) ''for promoting co-operation between the various professional and community services which in the opinion of the Council have a part to play in dealing with social problems connected with the misuse of drugs'';
*d) ''for educating the public (and in particular the young) in the dangers of misusing such drugs and for giving publicity to those dangers'';
*e) ''for promoting research into, or otherwise obtaining information about, any matter which in the opinion of the Council is of relevance for the purpose of preventing the misuse of such drugs or dealing with any social problem connected with their misuse''.</blockquote>

==Functioning==

One of the key functions of the ACMD is to recommend classification of new or existing drugs, which may be misused.

The sources of evidence<ref name="UKSTCreport" /> that the ACMD uses are

*formal surveys undertaken for, or on behalf of, government including the [[British Crime Survey]], the [[Forensic Science Service]] statistics, general population surveys, school surveys as well as international/European surveys such as European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other drugs;
*the law enforcement agencies;
*voluntary sector organisations with concerns and responsibilities for those who misuse drugs;
*professional bodies;
*published and unpublished scientific literature;
*submissions from special interest groups and the general public.

In order to have a rough but quantitative measure of the harms of a drug, the ACMD uses<ref name="UKSTCreport" /> a risk assessment matrix, where nine different aspects of harm for each drug are evaluated:

*Physical harm
**Acute
**Chronic
**Parenteral (i.e. intravenous harm)
*Dependence
**Intensity of pleasure
**Psychological dependence
**Physical dependence
*Social harms
**Intoxication
**Other social harms
**Healthcare costs

==Criticism==

In 2006, the [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] of the UK House of Commons conducted a series of case studies examining the government's handling of scientific advice, risk and evidence in policy making. The second of its case-studies<ref name="UKSTCreport" /> focused on the relationship between scientific advice and evidence and the classification of illegal drugs. It examined the workings of the ACMD.

A summary of the findings, vis-a-vis ACMD:

<blockquote>''In the course of this case study, we have looked in detail at the role played by, and workings of, the Government’s scientific advisory committee on drug classification and policy, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). We have identified a number of serious flaws in the way the Council conducts its business. Although the Council has produced useful reports explaining the rationale behind its recommendations on drug classification decisions, we found a lack of transparency in other areas of its work and a disconcerting degree of confusion over its remit. We also note that the ACMD has failed to adhere to key elements of the Government’s Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees. In response to these and other concerns about the Council’s operations, we have called for the Home Office to ensure that there is, in future, independent oversight of the Council’s workings. We have also highlighted the need for the ACMD to play a far more a proactive role in supporting the work of the Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills: the Government’s approach to drug education and treatment must be informed by scientific advice and stronger cross-departmental coordination will be vital if the Public Service Agreement targets on drugs policy are to be met.''</blockquote>

Some specific findings:

<blockquote>''69. Overall, our examination of the processes used by the ACMD and Home Office to make, respectively, recommendations and decisions regarding the classification of drugs has revealed a disconcertingly ad hoc approach to determining when reviews should be undertaken and a worrying lack of transparency in how classification decisions are made.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''73. .. It is extremely disappointing that the Council has not taken any steps to increase the transparency of its operations and, moreover, that the Chairman displayed so little interest in improving the Council’s approach in evidence to us. It is incumbent upon the Chairman to ensure that the ACMD follows the spirit of openness prescribed by the Code of Practice.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''85. .. If, as the ACMD Chairman indicated to us, the Council’s work has been seriously hindered by the lack of evidence, the ACMD should have been far more vocal in pressing Ministers to ensure that more research was commissioned to fill the key gaps in the evidence base.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''97. .. We understand that the ACMD operates within the framework set by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 but, bearing in mind that the Council is the sole scientific advisory body on drugs policy, we consider the Council’s failure to alert the Home Secretary to the serious doubts about the basis and effectiveness of the classification system at an earlier stage a dereliction of its duty.''</blockquote>

==Findings==
{{See also|Cannabis classification in the United Kingdom}}
On the advice of the ACMD,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] downgraded cannabis from Class B to Class C in 2004. However, Home Secretary [[Jacqui Smith]] returned it to Class B in 2009, against the council's recommendation, and also declined to follow its recommendation to downgrade [[MDMA|ecstasy]] from Class A to class B.<ref name="register">{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/11/ecstasy_upgraded/|title=Jacqui Smith ecstatically ignores more scientific advice|last=Oates|first=John|date=11 February 2009|website=The Register|accessdate=2009-11-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091105234853/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/11/ecstasy_upgraded/| archivedate= 5 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In March 2010, the ACMD published a report, ''Consideration of the cathinones'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/drugs/acmd1/acmd-cathinodes-report-2010 |title=ACMD report on the consideration of the cathinones |publisher=Home Office |accessdate=2010-09-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831234826/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/drugs/acmd1/acmd-cathinodes-report-2010 |archivedate=2010-08-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which recommended that [[mephedrone]] and other [[cathinone]]s should be made illegal. On the same day it released a report titled ''Pathways to problems'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/drugs/acmd1/acmd-pathways-to-problems-report |title=ACMD: Pathways to Problems - a follow-up report |publisher=Home Office |accessdate=2010-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706043749/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/drugs/acmd1/acmd-pathways-to-problems-report |archivedate=2010-07-06 }}</ref> detailing progress made on recommendations made in 2006.  The report stated that not enough was being done about alcohol and tobacco usage and that the Misuse of Drugs Act should be reviewed. Because it was published on the same day as the report on cathinones, it received no media coverage, nor a response from the Home Office.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60556-9 |pmid=20399965 |title=A collapse in integrity of scientific advice in the UK |journal=The Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9723 |pages=1319 |year=2010 |last1=The Lancet }}</ref>

==Members==

The ACMD is required to have at least 20 members. All members are unpaid, although expenses are reimbursed.

===January 2011 appointments===

In January 2011, the government appointed nine new members to the Advisory Council, including a new chair.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8455642.stm |title=New drugs chief Les Iversen said cannabis 'safer' |work=BBC News |date=2010-01-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}</ref><ref name="ACMD new appointments">{{cite web | url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/drugs-head | title=Head of Drugs Advice Group Named | accessdate=2011-02-04 | date=2011-01-19}}</ref>  The new chairman, [[Les Iversen]] is a retired Oxford University professor of pharmacology and neuropharmacology specialist.<ref name="BBC Profile - Iversen">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8456726.stm | title=BBC Profile: Professor Les Iversen | accessdate=2011-02-04 | date=2011-01-13 | work=BBC Online}}</ref>
The appointment of Dr Hans-Christian Raabe, a prominent member of the Maranatha Community, which aims to "re-establish Christian values in society" received coverage in the British press.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/07/government-drug-adviser-anti-gay | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Randeep | last=Ramesh | title=Government drug adviser sacked for anti-gay views | date=2011-02-07}}</ref>  Raabe, a General Practitioner from Manchester, had previously stood as a [[Christian Peoples Alliance]] candidate for the North West of England in the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament elections]] of 2009.<ref name="BBC Candidate List">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8039972.stm#northwest | title=BBC - European election candidates: North West | accessdate=2011-02-04 | date=2009-06-02 | work=BBC News}}</ref> As a candidate for the [[Christian Peoples Alliance|CPA]], Raabe had made a number of controversial statements concerning homosexuality, one being; "there is a disproportionately greater number of homosexuals among paedophiles and an overlap between the gay movement and the movement to make paedophilia acceptable".<ref name="Guardian Editorial">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jan/25/gp-drugs-advisory-council | title=Guardian - Comment Is Free | accessdate=2011-02-04 | author=Harris, Evan | date=2011-01-25 | location=London | work=The Guardian| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110127025803/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2011/jan/25/gp-drugs-advisory-council| archivedate= 27 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Dr Raabe once argued that "it is futile to pursue discredited policies of so-called 'harm-reduction'",<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2011/01/another_acmd_member_threatens.html</ref> and had written that "The only way of stopping people from dying from drug-related deaths is to prevent drug use in the first place".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.c5492 |pmid=20929918 |title=Prohibition of cannabis |journal=BMJ |volume=341 |pages=c5492 |year=2010 |last1=Room |first1=R }}</ref> On the 8th of February 2011, Dr Raabe was sacked before his first meeting.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===Controversial resignations===

Professor [[David Nutt]] of the [[University of Bristol]] was Chairman of the ACMD until being relieved of his post on 30 October 2009 after criticising politicians for "distorting" and "devaluing" research evidence in the debate over illicit drugs.<ref>Tran, Mark (30 October 2009). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/30/drugs-adviser-david-nutt-sacked Government drug adviser David Nutt sacked], The Guardian.</ref> David Nutt founded the [[Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs]] on 15 January 2010. The goal of his new committee is to complement and eventually supersede the ACMD by providing independent advice that is untainted by government interference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8461442.stm |title=Sacked government drugs adviser vows to tell truth |work=BBC News |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref>

In February 2009, the government was accused by Professor Nutt of making a political decision with regard to drug classification in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade ecstasy from a class A drug. The ACMD report on ecstasy, based on a 12-month study of 4,000 academic papers, concluded that it is not as dangerous as other class A drugs such as heroin and cocaine, and should be downgraded to class B. The advice was not followed.<ref>{{cite news

I cannot have public confusion between scientific advice and policy and have therefore lost confidence in your ability to advise me as Chair of the ACMD."<ref>Easton, Mark (30 October 2009). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2009/10/nutt_gets_the_sack.html Nutt gets the sack], BBC News.</ref>

In his October 2009 paper (based on a lecture given in July 2009) Nutt had repeated his familiar view that illicit drugs should be classified according to the actual evidence of the harm they cause and pointed out that alcohol and tobacco caused more harm than LSD, ecstasy and cannabis. Alcohol should come fifth behind cocaine, heroin, barbiturates and methadone, and tobacco should rank ninth, ahead of cannabis, LSD and ecstasy, he said. He also argued that smoking cannabis created only a "relatively small risk" of psychotic illness.<ref>Jones, Sam; Booth, Robert (1 November 2009).

Explaining his sacking of Nutt, Alan Johnson wrote in a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'', that "He was asked to go because he cannot be both a government advisor and a campaigner against government policy. [...] As for his comments about horse riding being more dangerous than ecstasy, which you quote with such reverence, it is of course a political rather than a scientific point."<ref>Johnson, Alan (2 November 2009 ). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/02/drug-policy-alan-johnson-nutt Why Professor David Nutt was shown the door]. The Guardian ''Letters''.</ref> Responding in [[The Times]], Professor Nutt said:

{{cquote|I gave a lecture on the assessment of drug harms and how these relate to the legislation controlling drugs. According to Alan Johnson, the Home Secretary, some contents of this lecture meant I had crossed the line from science to policy and so he sacked me. I do not know which comments were beyond the line or, indeed, where the line was [...] <ref>Nutt, David (2 November 2009 ).

In the wake of Nutt's dismissal, Dr Les King, a part-time advisor to the Department of Health, and the senior chemist on the ACMD, resigned from the body.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8336635.stm Government drugs adviser resigns]. BBC News. 1 November 2009.</ref> His resignation was soon followed by that of Marion Walker, Clinical Director of Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's substance misuse service, and the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]'s representative on the ACMD.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8336884.stm Second drugs adviser quits post]. BBC News. 1 November 2009.</ref>

''The Guardian'' revealed that Alan Johnson ordered what was described as a 'snap review' of the 40-strong ACMD in October 2009. This, it was said, would assess whether the body is "discharging the functions" that it was set up to deliver and decide if it still represented value for money for the public. The review was to be conducted by [[David Omand]].<ref>Travis, Alan; Summers, Deborah (2 November 2009).

On 10 November 2009 three further members of the Council resigned following a meeting with Alan Johnson.  They were: Dr John Marsden, Dr Ian Ragan and Dr Simon Campbell.<ref>Whitehead, Tom (10 November 2009).

As well as being extremely unhappy with how the ACMD operates, I am not prepared to continue to be part of a body which, as its main activity, works to facilitate the potential criminalisation of increasing numbers of young people."

===Potential reduction of scientists on the committee===

The [[Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011]] removed the legal requirement which meant the ACMD had to have scientists and experts on the panel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harris |first=Evan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2010/dec/07/scientists-drugs-advisory-council-acmd |title=Political battle lines drawn over drugs advisory council scientists |newspaper=Guardian |date= 2010-12-07|accessdate=2011-01-23 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124121709/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/political-science/2010/dec/07/scientists-drugs-advisory-council-acmd| archivedate= 24 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chivers |first=Tom |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tomchivers/100049585/acmd-changes-removing-scientific-advice-from-drug-policy-is-a-catastrophically-bad-idea/ |title=ACMD changes: removing scientific advice from drug policy is a catastrophically bad idea |publisher=Blogs.telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/exclusion-of-scientists-from-drugs-council-worrying-2152556.html |title=Exclusion of scientists from drugs council 'worrying' |newspaper=The Independent |date= 2010-12-06|accessdate=2011-01-23 |location=London |first1=Wesley |last1=Johnson}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11923644 |title=Drugs advice body needs scientists, say campaigners |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}</ref>

==Public opinion==

Previous Home Secretaries, when responding  to the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, have all reiterated that the majority of public opinion is against reforming the current stance on prohibition.  However, a  poll commissioned by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] found that when the definitions of three regulatory options were given to members of the public  instead of simply asking "Do you think drugs should be legalised?" the majority in fact supported new regulatory control. How many of  those respondents did not support reforms, because of  previous Home Office advice on the other hand, was not recorded separately.<ref>Liberal Democrats (2010-07-10) [http://lddpr.org.uk/news/000020/poll_commissioned_by_lddpr_demonstrates_public_are_ready_for_drugs_discussion.html Poll commissioned by LDDPR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909145736/http://lddpr.org.uk/news/000020/poll_commissioned_by_lddpr_demonstrates_public_are_ready_for_drugs_discussion.html |date=2010-09-09 }}</ref>
