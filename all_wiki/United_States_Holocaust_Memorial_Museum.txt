The '''United States Holocaust Memorial Museum''' ('''USHMM''') is the United States' official memorial to [[the Holocaust]]. Adjacent to the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the USHMM provides for the documentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history. It is dedicated to helping leaders and citizens of the world confront hatred, prevent [[genocide]], promote human dignity, and strengthen democracy.<ref name="ushmm1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/about/ |title=About the Museum |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>

The museum has an operating budget, as of September 2018, of $120.6 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/online/annualreport/a/p/2018-financial-statements.pdf|title=2018 Financial Statements}}</ref> In 2008, the museum had a staff of about 400 employees, 125 contractors, 650 volunteers, 91 Holocaust survivors, and 175,000 members. It had local offices in [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Boca Raton]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Dallas]].<ref name="Press Kit">{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/press/kits/details.php?content=99-general |title=Press Kit |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705130142/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/press/kits/details.php?content=99-general |archive-date=2012-07-05 }}</ref>

Since its dedication on April 22, 1993, the Museum has had nearly 40 million visitors, including more than 10 million school children, 99 heads of state, and more than 3,500 foreign officials from over 211 countries. The Museum's visitors came from all over the world, and less than 10 percent of the Museum's visitors are Jewish. Its website had 25 million visits in 2008, from an average of 100 countries daily. Thirty-five percent of these visits were from outside the United States.<ref name="ushmm1"/>

The USHMM's collections contain more than 12,750 artifacts, 49 million pages of archival documents, 85,000 historical photographs, a list of over 200,000 registered [[Holocaust survivors|survivors]] and their families, 1,000 hours of archival footage, 93,000 library items, and 9,000 oral history testimonies. It also has teacher fellows in every state in the United States and, since 1994, almost 400 university fellows from 26 countries.<ref name="Press Kit"/>

Researchers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have documented 42,500 [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|ghettos]] and [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] erected by the Nazis throughout German-controlled areas of Europe from 1933 to 1945.<ref>Lichtblau, Eric. "The Holocaust Just Got More Shocking." ''The New York Times.'' March 3, 2013.</ref>

Though the museum is located geographically in the same cluster as the [[Smithsonian]] museums, contrary to popular conception, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is an independent entity, with its own governance structure. The museum and the Smithsonian regularly participate in joint collaborations, however.

==History==
===President's Commission on the Holocaust===
[[File:United States Holocaust Memorial Museum after the shooting.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=14th Street Entrance of USHMM. Large, rectangular façade with rounded opening.|14th Street entrance of USHMM]]
[[File:Think about what you saw.JPG|thumb|265px|Exterior of the museum's entrance]]

On November 1, 1978, President [[Jimmy Carter]] established the President's Commission on the Holocaust, chaired by [[Elie Wiesel]], a prominent author, activist, and Holocaust survivor. Its mandate was to investigate the creation and maintenance of a memorial to victims of the Holocaust and an appropriate annual commemoration to them. The mandate was created in a joint effort by Wiesel and [[Richard Krieger]] (the original papers are on display at the [[Jimmy Carter Museum]]). On September 27, 1979, the Commission presented its report to the President, recommending the establishment of a national Holocaust memorial museum in Washington, D.C. with three main components: a national museum/memorial, an educational foundation, and a Committee on Conscience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/faq/languages/en/06/01/commission/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903024933/http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/faq/languages/en/06/01/commission/|archive-date=September 3, 2013|title=President's Commission on the Holocaust |publisher=Ushmm.org}}</ref>

After a unanimous vote by the [[United States Congress]] in 1980 to establish the museum, the federal government made available {{convert|1.9|acres|ha}} of land adjacent to the [[Washington Monument]] for construction. Under the original director Richard Krieger, and subsequent director Jeshajahu Weinberg and chairman [[Miles Lerman]], nearly $190 million was raised from private sources for building design, artifact acquisition, and exhibition creation. In October 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] helped lay the cornerstone of the building, designed by architect [[James Ingo Freed]]. Dedication ceremonies on April 22, 1993 included speeches by American President [[Bill Clinton]], Israeli President [[Chaim Herzog]], Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, and Elie Wiesel. On April 26, 1993, the Museum opened to the general public. Its first visitor was the [[14th Dalai Lama]] of [[Tibet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secure.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=es&ModuleId=10005782 |title=History of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |publisher=Secure.ushmm.org |access-date=2012-05-03}}</ref>

=== Attacks ===
The museum has been the target of a planned attack and a fatal shooting. In 2002, a federal jury convicted [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] Leo Felton and Erica Chase of planning to bomb a series of institutions associated with American black and Jewish communities, including the USHMM.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/07/26/Jury-convicts-white-supremacists/UPI-67151027718854/|title=Jury convicts white supremacists|last=Haskell|first=Dave|date=2002-07-26|work=[[UPI]]|accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref> On June 10, 2009, 88-year-old [[James von Brunn]], an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semite]], [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting|shot Museum Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns]].  Special Police Officer Johns and von Brunn were both seriously wounded and transported by ambulance to the [[George Washington University Hospital]]. Special Police Officer Johns later died of his injuries; he is permanently honored in an official memorial at the USHMM. Von Brunn, who had a previous criminal record, died during his criminal trial in federal court,<ref name=Post>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/10/AR2009061001768.html?hpid=topnews|title=2 People Shot at U.S. Holocaust Museum|last=Wilgoren|first=Debbi|author2=Branigin, William |date=2009-06-10|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref> in [[Federal Correctional Complex, Butner|Butner federal prison]] in [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press January 6, 2010, 2:03 p.m. |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-holocaust-shooter7-2010jan07,0,2069772.story?track=rss |title=LA Times article on von Brunn's death |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>

==Architecture==
Designed by the architect [[James Ingo Freed]] of [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]], in association with [[Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc]], the USHMM is created to be a "resonator of memory". (Born to a Jewish family in Germany, Freed came to the United States at the age of nine in 1939 with his parents, who fled the Nazi regime.) The outside of the building disappears into the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], and [[Modern architecture|modern]] architecture of Washington, D.C. Upon entering, each architectural feature becomes a new element of allusion to the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/a_and_a/ |title=Art and Architecture |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref> In designing the building, Freed researched post-[[World War II]] [[German architecture]] and visited Holocaust sites throughout Europe. The Museum building and the exhibitions within are intended to evoke deception, fear, and solemnity, in contrast to the comfort and grandiosity usually associated with Washington, D.C. public buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/HOLO/arch.html |title=The Architecture of the Holocaust |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date=1985-10-16 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>

Other partners in the construction of the USHMM included Weiskopf & Pickworth, [[Cosentini Associates]] LLP, [[Jules Fisher]], and Paul Marantz, all from New York City. The structural engineering firm that was chosen for this project was [[Severud Associates]]. The Museum's Meyerhoff Theatre and Rubenstein Auditorium were constructed by Jules Fisher Associates of New York City. The Permanent Exhibition was designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]].<ref>Pei, Cobb, Freed and Partners. Karl Kaufman was the Director of Architecture.

==Exhibitions==
The USHMM contains two exhibitions that have been open continuously since 1993 and numerous rotating exhibitions that deal with various topics related to the Holocaust and [[human rights]].

===Hall of Remembrance===
[[Image:HallOfRemembrance.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Panoramic view of the Hall of Remembrance. Hexagonal room with red-tile floor, limestone walls, and black panels. Eternal flame in foreground supported by a black box containing ashes from European Concentration Camps.|Panoramic view of the Hall of Remembrance]]

The Hall of Remembrance is the USHMM's official memorial to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Visitors can memorialize the event by lighting candles, visiting an eternal flame, and reflecting in silence in the hexagonal hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/remember/days-of-remembrance/past-days-of-remembrance/2009-days-of-remembrance/remarks-by-joel-geiderman-and-memorial-candle-lighting|title=Remarks by Joel Geiderman and Memorial Candle Lighting — United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=www.ushmm.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}</ref>

===Permanent Exhibition===
Using more than 900 artifacts, 70 video monitors, and four theaters showing historic film footage and eyewitness testimonies, the USHMM's Permanent Exhibition is the most visited exhibit at the Museum. Upon entering large industrial elevators on the first floor, visitors are given identification cards, each of which tells the story of a person such as a random victim or survivor of the Holocaust. Upon exiting these elevators on the fourth floor, visitors walk through a chronological history of the Holocaust, starting with the Nazi rise to power led by [[Adolf Hitler]], 1933–1939. Topics dealt with include [[Aryan]] ideology, [[Kristallnacht]], [[Antisemitism]], and the American response to [[Nazi Germany]]. Visitors continue walking to the third floor, where they learn about [[List of Nazi-era ghettos|ghettos]] and the [[Final Solution]], by which the Nazis tried to exterminate all the Jews of Europe, and they killed six million of them, many in [[gas chamber]]s. The Permanent Exhibition ends on the second floor with the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]] by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces; it includes a continuously looped film of Holocaust survivor testimony.  First-time visitors spend an average of two to three hours in this self-guided exhibition. Due to certain images and subject matter, it is recommended for visitors 11 years of age and older.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/visit/whatinside/ |title=What's Inside |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511211444/http://www.ushmm.org/visit/whatinside/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

To enter the Permanent Exhibition between March and August, visitors must acquire free timed passes from the Museum on the day of the visit, or online for a service fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/visit/ |title=Plan a Visit |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>

===Remember the Children: Daniel's Story===
''Remember the Children: Daniel's Story'' is an exhibition designed to explain the Holocaust to elementary and middle school children. Opened in 1993, following true stories about children during the Holocaust. Daniel is named after the son of Isaiah Kuperstein who was the original curator of the exhibit. He worked together with Ann Lewin and Stan Woodward to create the exhibit. Because of its popularity with families, it is still open to the public today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/exhibit/ |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>

===Stephen Tyrone Johns Memorial===

==Operations==
The USHMM operates on a mixed federal and private revenue budget. For the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the museum reported total revenues of $133.4 million; $81.9 million and $51.4 million from private and public sources, respectively. Nearly the entirety of private funds come from donations. Expenses totaled of $104.6 million, with a total of $53.5 million used to pay 421 employees.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/03312016-irs-990-fy15.pdf |title=Form 990 (2014) |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref> Net assets tallied $436.1 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $319.1 million is classified as long-term investments, including the museum's endowment.<ref name="report2015">{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/20161019-2015-16-annual-report.pdf |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=2017-02-04 |title=Annual Report, 2015-16}}</ref>

===Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies===
In 1998, the USHMM established the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies (CAHS). Working with the Academic Committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, the CAHS supports research projects and publications about the Holocaust (including a partnership with [[Oxford University Press]] to publish the scholarly journal ''[[Holocaust and Genocide Studies]]''), helps make accessible collections of Holocaust-related archival material, supports fellowship opportunities for pre- and post- doctoral researchers, and hosts seminars, summer research workshops for academics, conferences, lectures, and symposia. The CAHS's Visiting Scholars Program and other events have made the USHMM one of the world's principal venues for Holocaust scholarship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/intro/ |title=About the Center |publisher=Ushmm.org |date=2001-03-22 |accessdate=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505125155/http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/intro/ |archive-date=2012-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Committee on Conscience===
The Museum contains the offices of the Committee on Conscience (CoC), a joint [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] and privately funded [[think tank]], which by presidential mandate engages in global human rights research. Using the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]], approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 and ratified by the United States in 1988, the CoC has established itself as a leading non-partisan commenter on the [[Darfur Genocide]], as well as the war-torn region of [[Chechnya]] in [[Russia]], a zone that the CoC believes could produce genocidal atrocities. The CoC does not have policy-making powers and serves solely as an advisory institution to the American and other governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/about/ |title=About the Committee on Conscience |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505211959/http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/about/ |archive-date=2012-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===National Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust (DRVH)===
{{main|Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust}}
[[File:Holocaust Remembrance Week.JPG|thumb|While standing inside The Hall of Remembrance, located within the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, a volunteer reads the names of Holocaust victims during the [[Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust]].]]

In addition to coordinating the National Civic Commemoration, ceremonies and educational programs during the week of the DRVH were regularly held throughout the country, sponsored by Governors, Mayors, veterans groups, religious groups, and military ships and stations throughout the world.

Each year, the USHMM designated a special theme for DRVH observances, and prepares materials available at no charge to support observances and programs throughout the nation, and in the United States military. Days of Remembrance themes have included:

===National Institute for Holocaust Education===
The USHMM conducted several programs devoted to improving Holocaust education. The ''Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Conference for Teachers'', conducted in Washington, D.C., attracted around 200 middle school and secondary teachers from around the United States each year. The Education Division offered workshops around the United States for teachers to learn about the Holocaust, to participate in the Museum Teacher Fellowship Program (MTFP), and to join a national corps of educators who served as leaders in Holocaust education in their schools, communities, and professional organizations. Some MTFP participants also participated in the Regional Education Corps, an initiative to implement Holocaust education on a national level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/education/foreducators/prodev/ |title=Professional Development |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511070828/http://www.ushmm.org/education/foreducators/prodev/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since 1999, the USHMM also provided public service professionals, including law enforcement officers, military personnel, civil servants, and federal judges with ethics lessons based in Holocaust history. In partnership with the [[Anti-Defamation League]], more than 21,000 law enforcement officers from worldwide and local law enforcement agencies such as the [[FBI]] and local police departments have been trained to act in a professional and democratic manner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/education/cpsite/lawenforcement/index.php?theme=students |title=Law Enforcement and Society |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119035557/http://www.ushmm.org/education/cpsite/lawenforcement/index.php?theme=students |archive-date=2012-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945]]'' is a seven-part encyclopedia series that explores the history of the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and the ghettos in German-occupied Europe during the [[Nazi era]]. The series is produced by the USHMM and published by the [[Indiana University Press]]. The work on the series began in 2000 by the researchers at the USHMM's [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum#Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies|Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies]]. Its general editor and project directory is the American historian [[Geoffrey P. Megargee]]. As of 2017, two volumes have been issued, with the third being planned for 2018.<ref>{{cite web| website= [[The Jerusalem Post]] | last=JTA Staff  | url = http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/First-two-volumes-of-Encyclopedia-of-Camps-and-Ghettos-released-494877 | title = First Two Volumes of 'Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos' Released | date =5 June 2017 | access-date = 20 July 2017}}</ref>

Volume I covers the early camps that the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[SS]] set up in the first year of the Nazi regime, and the camps later run by the [[SS Economic Administration Main Office]] and their numerous sub-camps. The volume contains 1,100 entries written by 150 contributors.

A large component of the USHMM was directed towards its website and associated accounts. With a majority of interest coming from the virtual world, the USHMM provided a variety of research tools online.

On its website, online exhibitions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ |title=Online Exhibitions |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref> the Museum published the ''[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]]''—an online, multilingual encyclopedia detailing the events surrounding the Holocaust.

The Genocide Prevention Mapping Initiative was a collaboration between the USHMM and [[Google Earth]]. It sought to collect, share, and visually present to the world critical information on emerging crises that may lead to genocide or related [[crimes against humanity]]. While this initiative focused on the [[Darfur Conflict]], the Museum wishes to broaden its scope to all human rights violations. The USHMM wanted to build an interactive "global crisis map" to share and understand information quickly, to "see the situation" when dealing with human rights abuses, enabling more effective prevention and response by the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/maps/ |title=Mapping Initiatives |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>

===Traveling exhibitions===
Since 1991, the USHMM had created traveling exhibitions to travel all over the United States and the world. These exhibitions have been to over one hundred cities in more than 35 states. It is possible to request and host various subject matters including: "[[Germany at the 1936 Summer Olympics|The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936]]", "[[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|Nazi Persecution of Homosexuals]]", and others depending on what a community desires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/traveling/ |title=Traveling Exhibitions |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>
