'''Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|საქართველო|tr}}; {{IPA-ka|sɑkʰɑrtʰvɛlɔ|IPA|Sakartvelo.ogg}}) is a transcontinental [[sovereign state|country]] in the [[Caucasus]] region of [[Eurasia]]. Located at [[Europe–Asia border|the crossroads]] of [[Western Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]], it is bounded to the west by the [[Black Sea]], to the north by [[Russia]], to the east by [[Azerbaijan]], and to the south by [[Armenia]] and [[Turkey]]. The [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities and towns in Georgia (country)|largest city]] is [[Tbilisi]]. Georgia covers a territory of {{convert|69700|km²|0|abbr=out}}, and its approximate population is about 3.718&nbsp;million. Georgia is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary|parliamentary republic]], with the government elected through a [[representative democracy]].

During the [[classical antiquity|classical era]], several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia, such as [[Colchis]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]]. The [[Georgians]] officially [[Christianization of Iberia|adopted Christianity]] in the early 4th century. The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] had enormous importance for the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|spiritual]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|political unification]] of early [[List of historical states of Georgia#Early Middle Ages|Georgian states]]. The unified [[Kingdom of Georgia]] reached its [[Georgian Golden Age|Golden Age]] during the reign of King [[David IV of Georgia|David the Builder]] and Queen [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]] in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Thereafter, the kingdom declined and eventually [[Kingdom of Georgia#Final disintegration|disintegrated]] under the hegemony of various regional powers, including the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and successive dynasties of [[Iran]]. In the late 18th century, the eastern Georgian [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti]] [[Treaty of Georgievsk|forged an alliance]] with the [[Russian Empire]], which directly [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|annexed]] the kingdom in 1801 and conquered the western [[Kingdom of Imereti]] in 1810. Russian rule over Georgia was eventually acknowledged in various peace treaties with Iran and the Ottomans and the remaining Georgian territories were absorbed by the Russian Empire in a piecemeal fashion through the course of the 19th century.

During the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] following the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, Georgia briefly became part of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Stephen|date=27 October 2020|title=The establishment of Soviet power in Transcaucasia: The case of Georgia 1921–1928|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09668138808411783?casa_token=FMxiPYCazXoAAAAA%3AuIvKXy8EhHkXLd7Y2XcBSNR9cgQP8_ocCE-we8kqsAikpZ6Y5zN46q4M64W1zviJLycXSZdGWUORkgU&|journal=Soviet Studies|volume=40:4|issue=4|pages=627|doi=10.1080/09668138808411783}}</ref> and then emerged as an independent [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|republic]] before the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Russian army invasion]] in 1921, which established a government of workers' and peasants' [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]. Soviet Georgia was incorporated into a new [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]] and became a founding republic of the Soviet Union in 1922. In 1936, the Transcaucasian Federation was dissolved and Georgia emerged as a [[Union Republic]]. During [[World War II]], almost 700,000 Georgians fought in the Red Army against the Germans. After Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], a native Georgian, died in 1953, a wave of protest spread against [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his [[de-Stalinization]] reforms, leading to the death of nearly one hundred students in 1956.

By the 1980s, an independence movement was established and grew, leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For most of the following decade, [[post-Soviet]] Georgia suffered from [[Georgian Civil War|civil conflicts]], secessionist wars in [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], and economic crisis. Following the bloodless [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy; aimed at [[Enlargement of NATO|NATO]] and [[Future enlargement of the European Union|European integration]], it introduced a series of democratic and economic reforms. This brought about mixed results, but strengthened state institutions. The country's Western orientation soon led to the worsening of [[Georgia–Russia relations|relations with Russia]], culminating in the brief [[Russo-Georgian War]] in August 2008 and Georgia's current [[territorial dispute]] with Russia.

Georgia is a [[developing country]] and ranks 70th on the [[Human Development Index]]. The country is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development]]. It contains two de facto independent regions, [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], which gained [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|very limited international recognition]] after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Most of the world's countries consider the regions to be [[Occupied territories of Georgia|Georgian territory under Russian occupation]].<ref name="smr">{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.gov.ge/docs/doc216.pdf |title=The Law of Georgia on Occupied Territories (431-IIs) |date=23 October 2008 |publisher=[[State Ministry for Reintegration (Georgia)|State Ministry for Reintegration]] |access-date=1 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624083638/http://www.smr.gov.ge/docs/doc216.pdf |archive-date=24 June 2014  }}</ref>

[[File:Gorgania on Fra Mauro map.jpg|thumb|left|"Gorgania" i.e. Georgia on [[Fra Mauro map]]]]

"Georgia" probably stems from the [[Iran|Persian]] designation of the Georgians – ''gurğān'', in the 11th and 12th centuries adapted via [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''gurz-ān''/''gurz-iyān'' and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''ĵurĵan''/''ĵurzan''. Lore-based theories were given by the traveller [[Jacques de Vitry]], who explained the name's origin by the popularity of [[Saint George|St. George]] amongst Georgians,<ref>[[Grigol Peradze|Peradze, Gregory]]. "The Pilgrims' derivation of the name Georgia". ''Georgica'', Autumn, 1937, nos. 4 & 5, 208–209</ref> while traveller [[Jean Chardin]] thought that "Georgia" came from Greek γεωργός ("tiller of the land"). As Prof. [[Alexander Mikaberidze]] adds, these century-old explanations for the word ''Georgia/Georgians'' are rejected by the scholarly community, who point to the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''gurğ/gurğān'' ("wolf"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hock|first1=Hans Henrich|last2=Zgusta|first2=Ladislav|title=Historical, Indo-European, and Lexicographical Studies|date=1997|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3110128840|page=211}}</ref>) as the root of the word.<ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"/> Starting with the Persian word ''gurğ/gurğān'', the word was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages.<ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"/><ref>{{cite book|first1=Winfried |last1=Boeder |first2=Wolfram |last2=Bublitz |first3=Manfred |last3=von Roncador |first4=Heinz |last4=Vater |title=Philology, typology and language structure |date=2002 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0820459912 |page=65|quote=The Russian designation of Georgia (Gruziya) also derives from the Persian gurg.}}</ref> This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-[[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region, which was referred to as ''[[Hyrcania|Gorgan]]'' ("land of the wolves").<ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rapp Jr.|first1=Stephen H.|title=The Sasanian World through Georgian Eyes: Caucasia and the Iranian Commonwealth in Late Antique Georgian Literature|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1472425522|page=21}}</ref>

The native name is ''Sakartvelo'' ([[wikt:საქართველო|საქართველო]]; "land of [[Kartvelian peoples|Kartvelians]]"), derived from the core central Georgian region of [[Kartli]], recorded from the 9th century, and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval [[Kingdom of Georgia]] by the 13th century. The self-designation used by [[Georgians|ethnic Georgians]] is ''Kartvelebi'' (ქართველები, i.e. "[[Kartvelian peoples|Kartvelians]]").

The medieval [[the Georgian Chronicles|Georgian Chronicles]] present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians, [[Kartlos]], a great-grandson of [[Japheth]]. However, scholars agree that the word is derived from the ''Karts'', the latter being one of the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a dominant group in ancient times.<ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia">{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1442241466|page=3|edition=2}}</ref> The name ''Sakartvelo'' (საქართველო) consists of two parts.

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Colchis and Iberia, VI-III centuries B.C..jpg|thumb|Ancient Georgian states of [[Colchis]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]], 500–400 BC]]

The [[classical antiquity|classical period]] saw the rise of a number of early Georgian states, the principal of which were [[Colchis]] in the west and [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]] in the east. In [[Greek mythology]], Colchis was the location of the [[Golden Fleece]] sought by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]]' epic tale ''[[Argonautica]]''. The incorporation of the Golden Fleece into the myth may have derived from the local practice of using fleeces to sift gold dust from rivers.<ref name="LOCge15">"Christianity and the Georgian Empire" (early history) Library of Congress, March 1994, webpage:[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ge0015) LCweb2-ge0015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175809/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+ge0015%29 |date=5 February 2017 }}.</ref> In the 4th century BC, a kingdom of Iberia – an early example of advanced state organization under one king and an aristocratic hierarchy – was established.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints|publisher=[[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary|St. Vladimir's Seminary Press]]|edition=2|year=1997|author=David Marshall Lang|isbn=978-0913836293|author-link=David Marshall Lang}}</ref>

After the [[Roman Republic]] completed its [[Pompey's Georgian campaign|brief conquest]] of what is now Georgia in 66 BC, the area became a primary objective of what would eventually turn out to be [[Roman–Persian Wars|over 700 years]] of protracted [[Roman–Iranian relations|Irano–Roman]] geo-political rivalry and warfare.<ref name="Armenia, Azerbaijan 1996, p. 158">[[Ronald Grigor Suny]].

=== Middle Ages up to early modern period ===
[[File:Ushguli towers in Svaneti, Georgia.png|thumb|[[Svaneti]] defensive [[tower house]]s in [[Ushguli]]]]
Located on the crossroads of protracted [[Roman–Persian Wars|Roman–Persian wars]], the early Georgian kingdoms disintegrated into various feudal regions by the early [[Middle Ages]]. This made it easy for the remaining Georgian realms to fall prey to the [[Arab rule in Georgia|early Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century.

==== Bagratid Iberia ====
The extinction of the different Iberian royal dynasties, such as [[Guaramid dynasty|Guaramids]] and the [[Chosroid dynasty|Chosroids]],<ref>Suny (1994), p. 29</ref> and also the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] preoccupation with their own civil wars and conflict with the [[Byzantine Empire]], led to the [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] family's growth in prominence. The head of the Bagrationi dynasty [[Ashot I of Iberia]] (r.813–826), who had migrated to the former southwestern territories of Iberia, came to rule over [[Tao-Klarjeti (historical region)|Tao-Klarjeti]] and restored the [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Principate of Iberia]] in 813. The sons and grandsons of Ashot I established three separate branches, frequently struggling with each other and with neighboring rulers. The Kartli line prevailed; in 888 [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]] (r.888–923) restored the indigenous royal authority dormant since 580. Despite the revitalization of the [[Bagratid Iberia|Iberian monarchy]], remaining Georgian lands were divided among rival authorities, with Tbilisi remaining in [[Emirate of Tbilisi|Arab hands]].

==== Kingdom of Abkhazia ====
An [[Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia|Arab incursion]] into western Georgia led by [[Marwan II]], was repelled by [[Leon I of Abkhazia|Leon I]] (r.720–740) jointly with his Lazic and [[Principality of Iberia|Iberian]] allies in 736. Leon I then married [[Mirian of Kakheti|Mirian]]'s daughter, and a successor, [[Leon II of Abkhazia|Leon II]] exploited this dynastic union to acquire [[Lazica]] in the 770s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nation-building in the post-Soviet borderlands|last=Smith|first=Graham|author2=Vivien Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-521-59968-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/nationbuildingin0000unse/page/56 56]|url=https://archive.org/details/nationbuildingin0000unse/page/56}}</ref> The successful defense against the Arabs, and new territorial gains, gave the Abkhazian princes enough power to claim more autonomy from the Byzantine Empire. Towards circa 778, [[Leon II of Abkhazia|Leon II]] (r.780–828) won his full independence with the help of the [[Khazars]] and was crowned as the [[Divan of the Abkhazian Kings|king of Abkhazia]]. After obtaining independence for the state, the matter of church independence became the main problem. In the early 9th century the Abkhazian Church broke away from the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and recognized the authority of the [[List of heads of the Georgian Orthodox Church#Catholicoi of Kartli (467–1010)|Catholicate of Mtskheta]]; Georgian language replaced [[Greek language|Greek]] as the language of literacy and culture.<ref>Alexei Zverev, ''Ethnic Conflicts in the Caucasus''; Graham Smith, Edward A Allworth, Vivien A Law et al., pages 56–58; ''Abkhaz'' by W.

A bitter [[civil war]] and feudal revolts which began under [[Demetrius III of Abkhazia|Demetrius III]] (r. 967–975) led the kingdom into complete anarchy under the unfortunate king [[Theodosius III of Abkhazia|Theodosius III the Blind]] (r. 975–978). A period of unrest ensued, which ended as Abkhazia and eastern Georgian states were [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|unified]] under a single [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian monarchy]], ruled by King [[Bagrat III of Georgia]] (r. 975–1014), due largely to the diplomacy and conquests of his energetic foster-father [[David III of Tao]] (r. 966–1001).

==== United Georgian monarchy ====

The stage of [[Georgian feudalism|feudalism]]'s development and struggle against common invaders as much as [[Georgian Orthodox Church|common belief]] of various Georgian states had an enormous importance for spiritual and [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|political unification]] of Georgia feudal monarchy under the [[Bagrationi dynasty]] in 11th century.[[File:Tamar (Vardzia fresco detail).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen [[Tamar of Georgia]] presided over the "Golden Age" of the medieval Georgian monarchy.

The [[Kingdom of Georgia]] reached its zenith in the 12th to early 13th centuries. This period during the reigns of [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] (r.1089–1125) and his granddaughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] (r.1184–1213) has been widely termed as [[Georgian Golden Age|Georgia's Golden Age]] or the Georgian Renaissance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern History of Soviet Georgia |author=David Marshall Lang|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=London|year=1976|page=29|isbn=978-0837181837|author-link=David Marshall Lang}}</ref> This early Georgian renaissance, which preceded its Western European analogue, was characterized by impressive military victories, territorial expansion, and a cultural renaissance in architecture, literature, philosophy and the sciences.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trust and Conflict: Representation, Culture and Dialogue|editor1= Ivana Marková |editor2=Alex Gillespie|page=43|series=Cultural Dynamics of Social Representation|year=2011|isbn=978-0415593465}}</ref> The Golden age of Georgia left a legacy of great cathedrals, romantic poetry and literature, and the epic poem ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'', the latter which is considered a [[national epic]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Georgian Literature and Culture|author1=Howard Aronson|author2=Dodona Kiziria|publisher=Slavica |year=1999|page=119|isbn= 978-0893572785}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|title=Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia|date=1996|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-2813-4|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2W1YOG3N10C|quote=The Knight in the Panther Skin occupies a unique position as the Georgian national epic.|access-date=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221175149/https://books.google.com/books?id=B2W1YOG3N10C|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

David suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1121, he decisively defeated much larger Turkish armies during the [[Battle of Didgori]] and [[Siege of Tbilisi (1122)|liberated Tbilisi]].<ref name="javaxisvili">{{in lang|ka}} [[Ivane Javakhishvili|Javakhishvili, Ivane]] (1982), ''k'art'veli eris istoria'' (The History of the Georgian Nation), vol. 2, pp. 184–187.

George V was the last great king of the unified Georgian state. After his death, different local rulers fought for their independence from central Georgian rule, until the total disintegration of the Kingdom in the 15th century. Georgia was further weakened by several [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|disastrous invasions]] by [[Timur|Tamerlane]]. [[Turkmen incursions into Georgia|Invasions continued]], giving the kingdom no time for restoration, with both [[Kara Koyunlu|Black]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu|White]] sheep Turkomans constantly raiding its southern provinces.

==== Tripartite division ====
[[File:Kingdom of Georgia after dissolution as a unified state, 1490 AD.svg|thumb|Map of Georgian [[List of historical states of Georgia|kingdoms and principalities]], 1490 AD]]
The Kingdom of Georgia [[Kingdom of Georgia#Final disintegration|collapsed]] into anarchy by 1466 and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi-independent principalities. Neighboring large empires subsequently exploited the internal division of the weakened country, and beginning in the 16th century up to the late 18th century, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Iran]] (and successive Iranian [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties) and [[Ottoman Turkey]] subjugated the eastern and western regions of Georgia, respectively.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1442241466|page=xxxi|edition=2}}</ref>

The rulers of regions that remained partly [[Autonomy|autonomous]] organized rebellions on various occasions. However, subsequent Iranian and Ottoman invasions further weakened local kingdoms and regions. As a result of incessant [[Ottoman–Persian Wars]] and deportations, the population of Georgia dwindled to 784,700 inhabitants at the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=ჯაოშვილი|first1=ვახტანგ|title=საქართველოს მოსახლეობა XVIII-XX საუკუნეებში: დემოგრაფიულ-გეოგრაფიული გამოკვლევა|date=1984|publisher=მეცნიერება|page=72|edition=1}}</ref> [[Eastern Georgia (country)|Eastern Georgia]] ([[Safavid Georgia]]), composed of the regions of [[Kartli]] and [[Kakheti]], had been under Iranian [[suzerainty]] since 1555 following the [[Peace of Amasya]] signed with neighbouring rivalling Ottoman Turkey.

In 1783, Russia and the eastern Georgian [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], by which Georgia abjured any dependence on [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] or another power, and made the kingdom a protectorate of Russia, which guaranteed Georgia's territorial integrity and the continuation of its reigning Bagrationi dynasty in return for prerogatives in the conduct of Georgian foreign affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/georgia.htm|script-title=ru:Георгиевский трактат|trans-title=Treaty of Georgievsk|date=24 July 1783|publisher=[[Moscow State University]]|access-date=1 February 2015|language=ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501155836/http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/georgia.htm|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]] was established with [[Nikolay Chkheidze]] acting as its president. The federation consisted of three nations: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. As the Ottomans advanced into the Caucasian territories of the crumbling Russian Empire, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918. The [[Menshevik]] [[Social Democratic Party of Georgia]] won the parliamentary election and its leader, [[Noe Zhordania]], became prime minister. Despite the Soviet takeover, Zhordania was recognized as the legitimate head of the [[Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Exile|Georgian Government]] by France, UK, Belgium, and Poland through the 1930s.<ref>Stefan Talmon (1998), ''Recognition of Governments in International Law'', p. 289–290.

The 1918 [[Georgian–Armenian War]], which erupted over parts of disputed provinces between Armenia and Georgia populated mostly by Armenians, ended because of British intervention. In 1918–1919, Georgian general [[Giorgi Mazniashvili]] led an attack against the [[White Army]] led by Moiseev and Denikin in order to claim the [[Black Sea]] coastline from [[Tuapse]] to [[Sochi]] and [[Adlersky City District|Adler]] for the independent Georgia.<ref name="shirokov">{{cite book|last1=Широков|first1=И.

In February 1921, during the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army advanced into Georgia]] and brought the local Bolsheviks to power. The Georgian army was defeated and the Social Democratic government fled the country. On [[Soviet Occupation Day, Georgia|25 February 1921]], the Red Army entered Tbilisi and established a government of workers' and peasants' [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] with [[Filipp Makharadze]] as acting head of state. Georgia was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], alongside [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]], in 1921 which in 1922 would become a founding member of the Soviet Union.

There remained significant opposition to the Bolsheviks in Georgia, which was unindustrialized and viewed as socially backward, and this culminated in the [[August Uprising]] of 1924. Soviet rule was firmly established only after the insurrection was swiftly defeated.<ref>Knight, Amy. ''Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant'', [[Princeton University Press]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]], p. 237, {{ISBN|978-0-691-01093-9}}.</ref> Georgia would remain an unindustrialized periphery of the USSR until the [[first five-year plan]] when it would become a major center for textile goods. Later, in 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved and Georgia emerged as a [[union republic]]: the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

[[Joseph Stalin]], an ethnic Georgian born Iosif Vissarionovich Jugashvili (იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი) in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], was prominent among the Bolsheviks.<ref>"[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ethnic-tensions-war-in-the-caucasus-is-stalins-legacy-899615.html Ethnic tensions: War in the Caucasus is Stalin's legacy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620180716/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ethnic-tensions-war-in-the-caucasus-is-stalins-legacy-899615.html |date=20 June 2018 }}".

In June 1941, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[Operation Barbarosa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on an immediate course towards Caucasian oil fields and munitions factories. They never reached Georgia, however, and almost 700,000 Georgians fought in the Red Army to repel the invaders and advance towards Berlin. Of them, an estimated 350,000 were killed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Georgian World War II hero's remains return home |url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2015/2165 |work=Agenda.ge |date=30 September 2015}}</ref> The [[Georgian uprising on Texel]] against the Germans was the last battle of the World War II in Europe.

After Stalin's death, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the leader of the Soviet Union and implemented a policy of [[de-Stalinization]]. This was nowhere else more publicly and violently opposed than in Georgia, where in 1956 riots broke out upon the release of Khruschev's [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|public denunciation of Stalin]] and led to the death of nearly 100 students.

Throughout the remainder of the Soviet period, Georgia's economy continued to grow and experience significant improvement, though it increasingly exhibited blatant corruption and alienation of the government from the people. With the beginning of [[perestroika]] in 1986, the Georgian Communist leadership proved so incapable of handling the changes that most Georgians, including [[wikt:Special:Search/rank and file|rank and file]] Communists, concluded that the only way forward was a break from the existing Soviet system.

On 9 April 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia|Supreme Council]] of Georgia declared independence after a [[Georgian independence referendum, 1991|referendum]] held on 31 March 1991.<ref name="GovtofGeorgia">{{cite web |url=http://gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=193 |title=Government of Georgia:About Georgia |publisher=gov.ge |access-date=9 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821030240/http://gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=193 |archive-date=21 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 26 May 1991, [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] was elected as the first President of independent Georgia.

He was soon deposed in a [[1991–92 Georgian coup d'état|bloody ''coup d'état'']], from 22 December 1991 to 6 January 1992. The coup was instigated by part of the National Guards and a paramilitary organization called "[[Mkhedrioni]]" ("horsemen"). The country became embroiled in a bitter [[Georgian Civil War|civil war]], which lasted until nearly 1995. [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1985 to 1991) returned to Georgia in 1992 and joined the leaders of the coup—[[Tengiz Kitovani]] and [[Jaba Ioseliani]]—to head a triumvirate called "The State Council".{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Following the Rose Revolution, a series of reforms were launched to strengthen the country's military and economic capabilities. The new government's efforts to reassert Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of [[Ajaria]] led to a major [[Ajaria Crisis|crisis]] early in 2004.

[[File:Parliament of Georgia in Kutaisi.jpg|thumb|Georgian parliament building in Kutaisi]]
[[Legislature|Legislative]] authority is vested in the [[Parliament of Georgia]]. It is unicameral and has 150 members, known as deputies, of whom 73 are elected by plurality to represent single-member districts, and 77 are chosen to represent parties by proportional representation. Members of parliament are elected for four-year terms. On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated a new Parliament building in the western city of [[Kutaisi]], in an effort to decentralise power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211070227/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 December 2018 |title=Georgia opens new parliament in Kutaisi, far from the capital |newspaper=Washington Post |date=26 May 2012 |access-date=26 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|elections in October 2012]] resulted in the victory for the opposition "[[Georgian Dream|Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia]]" [[Coalition#Politics and government|coalition]], which President Saakashvili acknowledged on the following day.<ref>{{Citation|title=Saakashvili Concedes Defeat in Parliamentary Election|newspaper=Civil|date=2 October 2012|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25299|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130107143326/http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25299|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 January 2013}}</ref>
 
Different opinions exist regarding the degree of political freedom in Georgia. Saakashvili believed in 2008 that the country is "on the road to becoming a European democracy."<ref name=misha>{{cite news|title=Georgia Leader: Country on Right Track |publisher=Fox News |date=7 January 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan07/0,4670,GeorgiaPresidentialElection,00.html |access-date=17 October 2008 |first=Lynn |last=Berry |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108095512/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan07/0%2C4670%2CGeorgiaPresidentialElection%2C00.html |archive-date=8 January 2008 }}</ref> [[Freedom House]] lists Georgia as a partly free country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2008 |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |access-date=23 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110131211403/http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |archive-date=31 January 2011 }}</ref>

In preparation for 2012 parliamentary elections, Parliament adopted a new electoral code on 27 December 2011 that incorporated many recommendations from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Venice Commission. However, the new code failed to address the Venice Commission's primary recommendation to strengthen the equality of the vote by reconstituting single-mandate election districts to be comparable in size. On 28 December, Parliament amended the Law on Political Unions to regulate campaign and political party financing. Local and international observers raised concerns about several amendments, including the vagueness of the criteria for determining political bribery and which individuals and organizations would be subject to the law. {{as of|2012|March|}}, Parliament was discussing further amendments to address these concerns.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5253.htm |title=Georgia |publisher=State.gov |date=2 April 2012 |access-date=5 September 2012 }}</ref>

The growing U.S. and European Union influence in Georgia, notably through proposed EU and NATO membership, the U.S. [[Georgia Train and Equip Program|Train and Equip]] military assistance program, and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] have frequently strained Tbilisi's relations with Moscow. Georgia's decision to boost its presence in the coalition forces in Iraq was an important initiative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=8271 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080812234954/http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=8271 |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 August 2008 |title=U.S. Announces New Military Assistance Program for Georgia |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=1 July 2001 |access-date=5 May 2009 }}</ref>

Georgia is currently working to become a full member of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]]. In August 2004, the Individual Partnership Action Plan of Georgia was submitted officially to NATO. On 29 October 2004, the [[North Atlantic Council]] of NATO approved the [[NATO#International Partnership Action Plans|Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) of Georgia, and Georgia moved on to the second stage of Euro–Atlantic Integration. In 2005, by the decision of the President of Georgia, a state commission was set up to implement the Individual Partnership Action Plan, which presents an interdepartmental group headed by the Prime Minister. The commission was tasked with coordinating and controlling the implementation of the Individual Partnership Action Plan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:268A5992 HDR.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tusheti]] region in northeast Georgia]]

The term Lesser Caucasus Mountains is often used to describe the mountainous (highland) areas of southern Georgia that are connected to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range by the Likhi Range.<ref name="Cac"/> The area can be split into two separate sub-regions; the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, which run parallel to the Greater Caucasus Range, and the [[Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland]], which lies immediately to the south of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The overall region can be characterized as being made up of various, interconnected mountain ranges (largely of volcanic origin) and plateaus that do not exceed {{convert|3400|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation. Prominent features of the area include the [[Javakheti Volcanic Plateau]], lakes, including Tabatskuri and Paravani, as well as mineral water and hot springs. Two major [[List of rivers of Georgia (country)|rivers in Georgia]] are the [[Rioni River|Rioni]] and the [[Mtkvari River|Mtkvari]]. The Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland is a young and unstable geologic region with high seismic activity and has experienced some of the most significant earthquakes that have been recorded in Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[Krubera Cave]] is the deepest known cave in the world. It is located in the [[Arabika Massif]] of the [[Gagra Range]], in Abkhazia. In 2001, a Russian–Ukrainian team had set the world depth record for a cave at {{convert|1710|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. In 2004, the penetrated depth was increased on each of three expeditions, when a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] team crossed the {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} mark for the first time in the history of [[speleology]].

=== Topography ===
[[File:Physical Map of Georgia (en).svg|thumb|Physical map of Georgia]]
The landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied. Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and [[temperate rainforest]]s to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of [[semi-arid]] plains. Forests cover around 40% of Georgia's territory while the [[alpine tundra|alpine]]/[[subalpine zone]] accounts for roughly around 10 percent of the land.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Much of the natural habitat in the low-lying areas of western Georgia has disappeared during the past 100 years because of the [[agricultural development]] of the land and [[urbanization]]. The large majority of the forests that covered the Colchis plain are now virtually non-existent with the exception of the regions that are included in the national parks and reserves (e.g. [[Lake Paliastomi]] area). At present, the forest cover generally remains outside of the low-lying areas and is mainly located along the foothills and the mountains. Western Georgia's forests consist mainly of deciduous trees below {{convert|600|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and contain species such as [[oak]], [[hornbeam]], [[Oriental Beech|beech]], [[elm]], [[ash tree|ash]], and [[Sweet Chestnut|chestnut]]. Evergreen species such as [[Buxus|box]] may also be found in many areas. Ca. 1000 of all 4000 higher plants of Georgia are [[endemic]] to this country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endemic-species-caucasus.info/ |title=Endemic Species of the Caucasus |publisher=Endemic-species-caucasus.info |date=7 January 2009 |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412080946/http://www.endemic-species-caucasus.info/ |archive-date=12 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Vardzia and Mtkvari valley, Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|View of the cave city of [[Vardzia]] and the valley of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] below]]

The west-central slopes of the [[Meskheti Range]] in [[Ajaria]] as well as several locations in Samegrelo and Abkhazia are covered by [[temperate rain forests]]. Between {{convert|600|-|1000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, the deciduous forest becomes mixed with both broad-leaf and coniferous species making up the plant life. The zone is made up mainly of beech, [[Caucasian Spruce|spruce]], and [[Nordmann Fir|fir]] forests. From {{convert|1500|-|1800|m|ft|0}}, the forest becomes largely coniferous. The tree line generally ends at around {{convert|1800|m|ft|0}} and the alpine zone takes over, which in most areas, extends up to an elevation of {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the 3,000-metre line.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Eastern Georgia's landscape (referring to the territory east of the [[Likhi Range]]) is considerably different from that of the west, although, much like the Colchis plain in the west, nearly all of the low-lying areas of eastern Georgia including the [[Mtkvari]] and [[Alazani]] River plains have been [[deforestation|deforested]] for agricultural purposes. In addition, because of the region's relatively drier climate, some of the low-lying plains (especially in Kartli and south-eastern Kakheti) were never covered by forests in the first place.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The general landscape of eastern Georgia comprises numerous valleys and gorges that are separated by mountains. In contrast with western Georgia, nearly 85 percent of the forests of the region are deciduous. Coniferous forests only dominate in the [[Borjomi Gorge]] and in the extreme western areas. Out of the deciduous species of trees, [[beech]], [[oak]], and [[hornbeam]] dominate. Other deciduous species include several varieties of [[maple]], [[aspen]], ash, and [[hazelnut]]. The Upper Alazani River Valley contains [[Taxus baccata|yew]] forests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

At higher elevations above {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (particularly in the [[Tusheti]], [[Khevsureti]], and [[Khevi]] regions), [[Scots Pine|pine]] and [[birch]] forests dominate. In general, the forests in eastern Georgia occur between {{convert|500|-|2000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, with the alpine zone extending from 2,000–2,300 to 3,000–3,500 metres (6,562–7,546 to 9,843–11,483&nbsp;ft). The only remaining large, low-land forests remain in the [[Alazani]] Valley of Kakheti. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the {{convert|3500|m|ft|0|adj=on}} line in most areas of eastern Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Georgia (country)}}
The climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size. There are two main climatic zones, roughly corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the country. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Batumi Botanical Garden. Black Sea.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Batumi]], western Georgia]]

Much of western Georgia lies within the northern periphery of the humid subtropical zone with annual precipitation ranging from {{convert|1000|–|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The precipitation tends to be uniformly distributed throughout the year, although the rainfall can be particularly heavy during the Autumn months. The climate of the region varies significantly with elevation and while much of the lowland areas of western Georgia are relatively warm throughout the year, the foothills and mountainous areas (including both the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains) experience cool, wet summers and snowy winters (snow cover often exceeds 2 meters in many regions). Ajaria is the wettest region of the [[Caucasus]], where the Mount Mtirala [[temperate rain forest|rainforest]], east of [[Kobuleti]], receives around {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Eastern Georgia has a transitional climate from humid subtropical to continental. The region's weather patterns are influenced both by dry Caspian air masses from the east and humid Black Sea air masses from the west. The penetration of humid air masses from the Black Sea is often blocked by mountain ranges ([[Likhi Range|Likhi]] and [[Meskheti]]) that separate the eastern and western parts of the nation. Annual precipitation is considerably less than that of western Georgia and ranges from {{convert|400|–|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The wettest periods generally occur during spring and autumn, while winter and summer months tend to be the driest. Much of eastern Georgia experiences hot summers (especially in the low-lying areas) and relatively cold winters. As in the western parts of the nation, elevation plays an important role in eastern Georgia where climatic conditions above {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}} are considerably colder than in the low-lying areas. The regions that lie above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0}} frequently experience frost even during the summer months.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Archaeological research demonstrates that Georgia has been involved in commerce with many lands and empires since ancient times, largely due its location on the Black Sea and later on the historical [[Silk Road]]. Gold, silver, copper and [[iron ore|iron]] have been mined in the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. [[Georgian wine]] making is a very old tradition and a key branch of the country's economy.

For much of the 20th century, Georgia's economy was within the Soviet model of [[command economy]]. Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, Georgia embarked on a major structural reform designed to transition to a [[free market]] economy. As with all other [[post-Soviet states]], Georgia faced a severe economic collapse. The civil war and military conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia aggravated the crisis. The agriculture and industry output diminished.

In recent years Georgia has invested large amounts of money in the modernization of its transport networks.

[[Islam in Georgia (country)|Islam]] is represented by both Azerbaijani [[Shia]] Muslims (in the south-east) ethnic Georgian [[Sunni]] Muslims in Adjara, and [[Laz language|Laz]]-speaking Sunni Muslims as well as Sunni [[Meskhetian Turks]] along the border with Turkey. In [[Abkhazia]], a minority of the Abkhaz population is also Sunni Muslim, alongside the faithful of the revived [[Abkhaz neopaganism|Abkhaz pagan faith]]. There are also smaller communities of [[Greek Muslims]] (of [[Pontic Greek]] origin) and [[Armenian Muslims]], both of whom are descended from Ottoman-era converts to Turkish Islam from [[Eastern Anatolia]] who settled in Georgia following the [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign]] that led to the Ottoman conquest of the country in 1578. Georgian Jews trace the history of their community to the 6th century BC; their numbers have dwindled in the last decades due to high levels of immigration to [[Israel]].<ref>Jacobs, Dan Norman.

=== Architecture and arts ===
[[File:Hpim3433.jpg|thumb|Old Tbilisi – Architecture in Georgia is in many ways a fusion of European and Asian.]]
[[Architecture of Georgia (country)|Georgian architecture]] has been influenced by many civilizations. There are several different [[architectural styles]] for [[castles]], [[tower]]s, [[fortifications]] and [[Church (building)|churches]]. The [[Upper Svaneti]] fortifications, and the castle town of [[Shatili]] in [[Khevsureti]], are some of the finest examples of medieval Georgian [[castle architecture]]. Other architectural aspects of Georgia include [[Rustavelis Gamziri|Rustaveli]] avenue in Tbilisi in the [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Haussmann style]], and the [[Old Tbilisi|Old Town District]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Georgian [[ecclesiastic]] art is one of the most notable aspects of Georgian [[Christian architecture]], which combines the classical [[dome]] style with the original [[basilica]] style, forming what is known as the Georgian cross-dome style. Cross-dome architecture developed in Georgia during the 9th century; before that, most Georgian churches were basilicas. Other examples of Georgian [[ecclesiastic]] [[architecture]] can be found outside Georgia: [[Bachkovo Monastery]] in Bulgaria (built in 1083 by the Georgian military commander Grigorii Bakuriani), [[Iviron monastery]] in Greece (built by Georgians in the 10th century), and the [[Monastery of the Cross]] in Jerusalem (built by Georgians in the 9th century). One of the most famous late 19th/early 20th century Georgian artists was [[primitivist]] painter [[Niko Pirosmani]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pirosmani.org/pirosmani/ |title=Niko Pirosmani – Short Biographical Information |publisher=Steele Communications |website=Niko Pirosmani |access-date=21 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228055000/http://www.pirosmani.org/pirosmani/ |archive-date=28 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Georgian polyphony is based on three vocal parts, a unique tuning system based on perfect fifths, and a harmonic structure rich in parallel fifths and dissonances.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Three types of polyphony have developed in Georgia: a complex version in Svaneti, a dialogue over a bass background in the Kakheti region, and a three-part partially-improvised version in western Georgia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Georgian Polyphonic Singing, "Chakrulo"|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&pg=33&id=1737|access-date=17 December 2016|work=UNESCO|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205180055/http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&pg=33&id=1737|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Georgian folk song "[[Chakrulo]]" was one of 27 musical compositions included on the [[Voyager Golden Record]]s that were sent into space on [[Voyager 2]] on 20 August 1977.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Untold Story of How "Chakrulo" Ended Up in Space|url=http://www.georgianjournal.ge/discover-georgia/28321-the-untold-story-of-how-chakrulo-ended-up-in-space.html|access-date=21 July 2016|work=Georgian Journal|date=25 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816081734/http://www.georgianjournal.ge/discover-georgia/28321-the-untold-story-of-how-chakrulo-ended-up-in-space.html|archive-date=16 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Georgian cuisine]] and [[Georgian wine|wine]] have evolved through the centuries, adapting traditions in each era. One of the most unusual traditions of dining is [[Supra (feast)|supra]], or ''Georgian table'', which is also a way of socialising with friends and family. The head of ''supra'' is known as [[tamada]]. He also conducts the highly philosophical toasts, and makes sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. Various historical regions of Georgia are known for their particular dishes: for example, [[khinkali]] (meat dumplings), from eastern mountainous Georgia, and [[khachapuri]], mainly from [[Imereti]], [[Samegrelo]] and Adjara. In addition to traditional Georgian dishes, the foods of other countries have been brought to Georgia by immigrants from Russia, Greece, and recently China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Georgia vs Romania 2011 RWC (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgia]] vs. [[Romania]] in the [[Rugby World Cup 2011]]]]
The most popular sports in Georgia are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[rugby union]], [[wrestling]], [[judo]], and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]]. Historically, Georgia has been famous for its physical education; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were fascinated with Georgians' physical qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]].<ref>Romans erected the statue of the Iberian King Pharsman after he demonstrated Georgian training methods during his visit to Rome; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'', LXIX, 15.3</ref> Wrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia, and some historians think that the [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman style of wrestling]] incorporates many Georgian elements.<ref>Williams, Douglas. ''Georgia in my Heart'', 1999.</ref>

Within Georgia, one of the most popularized styles of wrestling is the Kakhetian style. There were a number of other styles in the past that are not as widely used today. For example, the [[Khevsureti]] region of Georgia has three different styles of wrestling. Other popular sports in 19th century Georgia were [[polo]], and [[Lelo burti|Lelo]], a traditional Georgian game later replaced by rugby union.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Basketball]] was always one of the notable sports in Georgia, and Georgia had a few very famous [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union national team]] members, such as [[Otar Korkia]], [[Mikheil Korkia]], [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] and [[Levan Moseshvili]]. [[BC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] won the prestigious [[Euroleague]] competition in [[1961–62 FIBA European Champions Cup|1962]]. Georgia had five players in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]: [[Vladimir Stepania]], [[Jake Tsakalidis]], [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]], [[Tornike Shengelia]] and current [[Golden State Warriors]] center [[Zaza Pachulia]]. Other notable basketball players are two times Euroleague champion [[Giorgi Shermadini]] and Euroleague players [[Manuchar Markoishvili]] and [[Viktor Sanikidze]].
