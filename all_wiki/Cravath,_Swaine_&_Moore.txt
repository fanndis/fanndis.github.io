'''Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP''' (known as '''Cravath''') is an American [[law firm]] with its headquarters in [[New York City]], and an additional office in [[London]]. The firm is known for complex and high profile litigation and [[mergers & acquisitions]].

==History==
In 1854, former college classmates [[William H. Seward]] (later [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s Secretary of State) and [[Richard M. Blatchford (attorney)|Richard M. Blatchford]] merged their respective law firms, forming Blatchford, Seward and Griswald.<ref name="Lanman1876">{{cite book|author=Charles Lanman|title=Biographical Annals of the Civil Government of the United States: During Its First Century.

Blatchford served in the [[New York State Assembly]], and as [[United States Ambassador to the Holy See|U.S. Minister to the State of the Church]]. His son, [[Samuel Blatchford|Samuel]], also a partner at the firm, served as a [[United States district court|federal district court]] and appeals court judge, was appointed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], in 1882, by [[President Chester Arthur]], serving for 11 years until his death; he was the first person to serve at all three levels of the judiciary.

[[Paul Drennan Cravath]] joined the firm in 1899, and devised the "[[Cravath System]]", combining a distinct method of hiring, training, and compensating lawyers. His name was added to the firm name in 1901 and, in 1944, after a series of name changes, the Cravath, Swaine & Moore name was established and has not been altered since.

Cravath has represented noted American inventors [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], in the late 1840s; [[Cyrus McCormick]], [[Elias Howe]], and [[Charles Goodyear]] in the 1850s; and [[George Westinghouse]] in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite web | title =MIT Institute Archives & Special Collections, Historical Patent Records from the Blatchford, Seward & Griswold Collection (1841-1910) | url = https://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/blatchford/| website =libraries.mit.edu | access-date = April 13, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Friedman2005">{{cite book|author=Lawrence M.

In November 2014, Cravath handled three M&A transactions in one day, spanning advertising, spirits, and pharmaceutical industries; and acted as legal advisor in a recently announced deal backed by [[3G Capital]] and [[Berkshire Hathaway Inc.]] that will create the third-largest food and beverage company in North America.<ref>{{Citation|title =Cravath Handles Trio of Big-Ticket Deals| newspaper =Lawdragon| date =November 6, 2014| url= http://www.lawdragon.com/news-articles/cravath-handles-trio-of-big-ticket-deals/ | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141119103247/http://www.lawdragon.com/news-articles/cravath-handles-trio-of-big-ticket-deals/| archive-date =2014-11-19|url-status=dead| access-date = April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last = Giammona| first =Craig|last2 =Boyle| first2 =Matthew|title =Kraft Will Merge With Heinz in Deal Backed by 3G and Buffett|newspaper = BloombergBusiness|date =March 25, 2015|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-25/3g-capital-berkshire-to-buy-kraft-foods-merge-it-with-heinz | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150325130148/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-25/3g-capital-berkshire-to-buy-kraft-foods-merge-it-with-heinz| archive-date =2015-03-25|url-status = dead|access-date = April 20, 2015}}</ref> Other significant representations have included legal work necessary to form [[NBC]], [[United Airlines]] in its merger with [[Continental Airlines]], the world's largest airline, to [[Unilever]] in its acquisition of [[Alberto-Culver]]. In 2010, its litigation department won summary judgment for [[Morgan Stanley]] on its breach of contract claim against [[Discover Financial Services]]. In a subsequent settlement, Discover agreed to pay Morgan Stanley $775 million to resolve the litigation. In the same year they successfully represented [[Barnes & Noble]] in a landmark "[[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]]" trial. In the past several decades Cravath has represented [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] in its antitrust suit against [[Microsoft]], resulting in a $750 million settlement; major merger and acquisition deals, such as the [[DuPont]]-[[Conoco]] merger, the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]-[[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] merger, the [[Bristol-Myers-Squibb]] merger, the [[Time-Warner]] merger, and the [[AOL]]-[[Time-Warner]] merger; and two famed libel suits: defending [[Time Inc.]] against Israeli General [[Ariel Sharon]], and also defending [[CBS]] against [[U.S. Army]] [[General]] [[William Westmoreland]].

Unlike others, Cravath has remained a relatively small firm. Its approximately 500 lawyers are located primarily in the New York Office, with a few dozen in the London office, which opened in 1973. The firm opened a Hong Kong office in 1994, closing it nine years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Law Dragon|url=http://www.lawdragon.com/2006/03/05/new-york-story/}}</ref>

In 2015, Cravath, Swaine and Moore was the victim of what the company described as a "limited breach" of its computer network, which ''The New York Times'' connected to a 2016 court case against three Chinese hackers who had made more than $4 million from insider information about merger deals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/business/dealbook/new-york-hacking-law-firms-insider-trading.html|title=3 Men Made Millions by Hacking Merger Lawyers, U.S. Says|last=Picker|first=Leslie|date=2016-12-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-insidertrading-idUSKBN14G1D5 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |title=U.S. accuses Chinese citizens of hacking law firms, insider trading |first=Nate |last=Raymond |date=December 28, 2016 |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228183507/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-insidertrading-idUSKBN14G1D5 |quote=Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms, or five others they said the defendants targeted.

The indictment said that by using a law firm employee's credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm's servers to access emails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath declined to comment. In March, Cravath confirmed discovering a "limited breach" of its systems in 2015. |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In March 2019, the [[New-York Historical Society]] Museum & Library debuted an installation highlighting the firm, which illustrates legal milestones across two centuries, including obtaining patents for both the telegraph and the sewing machine, organizing [[NBC]], and securing equal access to locker rooms for women sports reporters, exhibited "through a collection of unique documents, photographs, and prints."<ref>[https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/two-centuries-law-cravath-swaine-moore# "Two Centuries of the Law: Cravath, Swaine & Moore", New-York Historical Society Museum & Library, 2019.

In the 1960s, Cravath lawyers wrote the U.S. Supreme Court brief on behalf of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]]’s Freedom rides protesting segregated buses, and were called upon by President [[John F.

==Hiring==
{{Main|Cravath System}}
Under the [[Cravath System]], the firm is known for focusing its hiring on associates straight from law school, with a strong emphasis on grades, then over years of apprenticeship rotations, immersing them in details of every aspect of corporate law practice.<ref>{{cite journal|author=William D. Henderson|date=July 2009|title=The Bursting of the Pedigree Bubble|url=https://www.law.indiana.edu/lawlibrary/services/bibliography/doc/NALPHenderson.pdf|journal=NALP Bulletin|volume=21|issue=7|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328145258/http://law.indiana.edu/lawlibrary/services/bibliography/doc/NALPHenderson.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-28}}</ref> Under this philosophy, lateral hires are rare, with some exceptions. In 2005, Cravath hired [[Andrew W. Needham]], formerly a [[Tax law|tax]] partner at [[Willkie Farr & Gallagher]],<ref>[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1110449112913 Cravath Hires Tax Partner, Its First Lateral in Decades]</ref> as the first lateral partner since Herbert L. Camp, also a tax partner, from the now-defunct [[Donovan Leisure Newton & Irvine]] in 1987. Camp, however, had previously been a Cravath associate and is therefore not considered a true lateral because he started his career there. Before that, [[Roswell Magill]], a former Treasury Department official, became a Cravath tax partner in 1943. In 2007, the firm brought in Richard Levin from [[Skadden, Arps]] to boost its new [[bankruptcy]] practice.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/05/09/the-horror-the-horror-cravath-starts-a-bankruptcy-practice/ Cravath starts a bankruptcy practice]</ref> In 2011, Cravath hired [[Christine A. Varney]], a former U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division for the [[Obama Administration]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/cravath-to-hire-d-o-j-s-top-antitrust-lawyer/ | title=Cravath to Hire Antitrust Chief | work=New York Times| date=June 6, 2011 | access-date=May 19, 2015 | author1=Lattman, Peter | author2=de la Merced, Michael}}</ref> This was criticized as a [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] case, as Cravath later had Varney represent AT&T in its acquisition of Time Warner, which the Antitrust Division let pass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizen.org/article/ftc-big-tech-revolving-door-problem-report/|title=75% of FTC Officials Have Revolving Door Conflicts With Tech Corporations and Other Industries|website=Public Citizen|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> In 2013, the firm hired [[David Kappos]], who served as the [[Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property]] and Director of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/cravath-hires-2nd-top-official-from-obama-administration/ | title=Cravath Hires a 2nd Official From Obama Administration | work=New York Times | date=February 6, 2013 | access-date=February 6, 2013 | author=Lattman, Peter}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2013/02/06/cravath-plucks-former-pto-chief-david-kappos/ | title=Cravath Plucks Former PTO Chief David Kappos | work=Wall Street Journal | date=February 6, 2013 | access-date=May 19, 2015 | author=Jones, Ashby}}</ref>

In addition, the system includes lockstep compensation on a published scale, which has tended to be matched by most leading US law firms and is known as the "Cravath Scale".<ref>https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/cravath-announces-associate-bonuses-did-the-firm-top-milbank</ref>
