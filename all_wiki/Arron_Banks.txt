==Early life==
Banks was born in [[Cheshire]], England, and raised by his mother in [[Basingstoke]], [[Hampshire]]; his father worked as a [[sugar plantation]] manager in various African countries. From the age of 13 he attended a boarding school in [[Berkshire]] called Crookham Court, before being expelled for "an accumulation of offences", including the sale of [[lead]] stolen from the roofs of school buildings, and "high-spirited bad behaviour". He then attended [[St Bartholomew's School]] in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] but was expelled again. He returned to Basingstoke, where he sold paintings, vacuum cleaners, and then houses.<ref name="Guardian 2018-06-10"/><ref name="New Statesman 2016-10-13">{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/10/arron-banks-man-who-bought-brexit |title=Arron Banks: The man who bought Brexit |first=Martin |last=Fletcher |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=13 October 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2018 }}</ref>

==Business career==
Banks was offered a junior job at the insurance market of [[Lloyd's of London]]. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', by the age of 27, he was running a division of [[Norwich Union]]. The article also claims that he spent a year working for [[Berkshire Hathaway]], the investment company of [[Warren Buffett]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Booth |first=Robert |date=27 March 2016 |title=Arron Banks: the millionaire hoping to bankroll UK into Brexit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/27/arron-banks-the-millionaire-hoping-to-bankroll-uk-into-brexit |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=23 September 2016}}</ref> However, in another investigation, both Norwich Union and Warren Buffett reject Banks' claim that he worked for them.<ref name="openDemocracy-20171015">{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brexitinc/adam-ramsay/how-did-arron-banks-afford-brexit|title=How did Arron Banks afford Brexit?|date=16 October 2017|website=openDemocracy|language=en|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref> Then, from an office above a bakery in [[Thornbury, Gloucestershire|Thornbury]], Gloucestershire, Banks started a motorcycle insurance broker, Motorcycle Direct, and within a few years the company was big enough to sell for "a few million".

He was previously CEO of AIM-listed [[Conister|Manx Financial Group]] from April 2008 to February 2009.<ref name="growthbusiness-20070515"/> According to [[Companies House]] records, Banks has set up 37 different companies using slight variations of his name. The names used by Banks are Aron Fraser Andrew Banks, Arron Andrew Fraser Banks, Arron Fraser Andrew Banks and Arron Banks. The profiles for the first three names all use the same date of birth but register different lists of companies. When asked by ''The Guardian'' about this, he declined to answer questions on the topic.<ref name=Syal>{{cite news |last=Syal |first=Rajeev |title=Ukip donor Arron Banks shows tax cheque sent to HMRC for £1.86m |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/04/ukip-donor-arron-banks-shows-tax-cheque-sent-hmrc|work=The Guardian |date=4 October 2014 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}</ref>

Banks also owns [[Eldon Insurance]], whose CEO Elizabeth Bilney was also in charge at Leave.EU. The company's profits leapt to £16.7m for the first half of 2017 after recording a £284,000 profit in 2015 and a loss of £22,500 in 2016 despite a 40% increase in revenue.

===Other business associations===
Following intensified media scrutiny after his initial donation to UKIP, it emerged that Banks was involved in mining in southern Africa and had connections to [[Belize]]. Banks also has connections to companies based in [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Isle of Man]], and close connections with family members of the Belizean Prime Minister.<ref name="Syal2014" /> However, following remarks made by ''[[The Thick of It]]'' creator [[Armando Iannucci]] on [[BBC One]]'s [[Question Time (TV series)|''Question Time'']] programme, Banks denied owning a company in Belize or seeking to avoid UK tax "via any device". Describing the comments as "clearly defamatory", he threatened legal action towards Iannucci if he did not get an apology within a week.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Chris|title=Armando Iannucci tax claim sparks UKIP donor legal threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31463868|accessdate=1 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=13 February 2015}}</ref>{{Update after|2015|03|01|reason=If we cannot state whether he followed up on the threat, we should remove this statement.

Asked if his companies paid full corporation tax, Banks said: "I paid over £2.5m of income tax last year ... My insurance business, like a lot of them, is based in Gibraltar but I've got UK businesses as well that deal with customers and pay tax like everyone else."<ref name="Syal2014" /> One of the UK businesses of which Banks is director, Rock Services Ltd, the name of which refers to The Rock of Gibraltar, had a turnover of £19.7m in 2013 and paid corporation tax of as little as £12,000. The company deducted £19.6m in "administrative expenses", and the main activity appears to be "recharge of goods and services" with Southern Rock Insurance Company.<ref name="Syal2014" /> Southern Rock Insurance states on its website that it underwrites policies for the customers of GoSkippy.com, which is run by Banks.

Rock Services and Southern Rock Insurance's ultimate holding company is Rock Holdings Ltd, a company based on the Isle of Man.<ref name="Syal2014" /> Banks has also been a "substantial" shareholder in STM Fidecs, of which Leave.EU is a subsidiary; the company claims to be specialising in "international wealth protection", maximising tax efficiencies for entrepreneurs and expatriates and of "structuring international groups, particularly separating and relocating intellectual property and treasury functions to low- or no-tax jurisdictions".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boffey|first1=Daniel|title=Tax-avoidance Gibraltar firm behind anti-EU campaign group|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/referendum-farage-leave-eu|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 November 2015}}</ref>

==Political career and donations==
Banks was previously a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] donor but in October 2014 decided to donate £100,000 to UKIP. In response to comments from [[William Hague]] that Banks had not been a major Conservative donor in past years, and that Hague had never heard of Banks, Banks increased his donation to £1 million to the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), directly referencing Hague's interview as his reasoning. Banks said that he had changed party allegiance because he agrees with UKIP's policies and its view that the [[European Union]] "is holding the UK back" because it's a "[[closed shop]] for bankrupt countries".<ref name=BBCUKIP>{{cite news|title=Ex-Tory donor Arron Banks gives £1m to UKIP|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29438653|accessdate=1 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=1 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="hague"/><ref name="BPUKIP">{{cite news|title=Bristol businessman ups UKIP donation to £1 million after Tory calls him a "nobody"|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-businessman-ups-UKIP-donation-1-million/story-23027035-detail/story.html|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=Bristol Post|date=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124041111/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-businessman-ups-UKIP-donation-1-million/story-23027035-detail/story.html#|archive-date=24 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Banks has been described as the "leading figure" behind the anti-EU [[Grassroots Out]] and [[Leave.EU]],<ref name="Wright2016">{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Oliver|title=Leave.EU group accused of avoiding strict rules on campaign spending|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-leaveeu-group-accused-of-avoiding-strict-rules-on-campaign-spending-a6984941.html|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=14 April 2016}}</ref> as well as the official [[Vote Leave]] campaign.<ref name="PEye1411">{{cite news |title=Sceptic Cranks |newspaper=[[Private Eye]] |issue=1411 |date=5 February 2016|page=13}}</ref><ref name=PEye1415>{{cite news |title=Rock & high rollers |url= http://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1415/hp-sauce |accessdate=1 June 2016 |newspaper=Private Eye |issue=1415|date=1 April 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160417012144/http://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1415/hp-sauce |url-status=dead |archivedate=17 April 2016}}</ref>

Banks claimed in March 2017 that he had been suspended from UKIP; he believed the reason was that he had criticised the leadership. UKIP said, however, that his membership had lapsed before this time.<ref name=laura/>

In May 2018, Banks attended a fundraising event for the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], alongside [[Nigel Farage]], and stated that he would support a bid by Farage to seek office as a DUP candidate after the end of his tenure as [[Member of the European Parliament]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|date=13 May 2018|title=Nigel Farage's Ukip backer Arron Banks bolsters his DUP bid|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nigel-farages-ukip-backer-arron-banks-bolsters-his-dup-bid-gvz8wqvnt}}</ref>

In August 2018, it was reported that Banks had applied to join the Conservative Party and had suggested that Leave.EU supporters do the same, with the aim of voting in the party's next leadership election. According to the report, [[Andy Wigmore]], Leave.EU's communications director, who had also applied to join the party, announced that they had received an email welcoming them, but the Conservative Party stated that their applications had not been approved.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45290206|website=BBC News |title=Leave.EU's Arron Banks denied Conservative membership |date=23 August 2018 }}</ref> A Conservative Party spokesman said that welcoming emails were automatic but applications were subsequently reviewed, and theirs had been rejected.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/23/tories-say-they-rejected-arron-banks-bid-to-join-party |work=The Guardian |title=Tories say Arron Banks' bid to join party has been rejected |date=23 August 2018  }}</ref>

===Conservative Party donations===
A spokesman for [[Nigel Farage]] said that Banks had funded the [[Chipping Sodbury]] office for the [[South Gloucestershire]] Conservatives "to the tune of £250,000". However, a Conservative spokesperson said the support was "nothing like the order of magnitude" of sums claimed, and estimated that the donations were "probably around the £22,000 mark".<ref name="hague"/>

A UKIP source told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Banks had also loaned £75,417 to [[Thornbury and Yate]] Conservative Party through Panacea Finance (his former company) in September 2007, registered on the [[Electoral Commission]] and to be paid back by 2022. However, [[Companies House]] records show that Banks resigned from the company in September 2005; therefore it was considered questionable as to whether Banks was controlling the company at the time, or whether he was "using the firm as a 'proxy donor'", according to ''The Guardian''.<ref name=Syal />

Banks said that Britain's EU membership "is like having a first class ticket on the [[Titanic]]". He also said that "Economically, remaining in the EU is unsustainable."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dearden |first1=Lizzie |title=Millionaire Tory donor defects to Ukip |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/millionaire-tory-donor-arron-banks-defects-to-ukip-with-100000-donation-9766314.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=1 June 2016|date=1 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Riley-Smith|first1=Ben|title=Tory donor defects to Ukip |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11132737/Tory-donor-defects-to-Ukip.html |accessdate=1 June 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 October 2014}}</ref>

Banks said in May 2016 that his strategy during the Brexit campaign was to "bore the electorate into submission", in the hope that a low turnout would favour Brexit.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Helm|first1=Toby|last2=Ratcliffe|first2=Rebecca|title=Youth vote targeted for registration before EU referendum|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/eu-referendum-youth-vote-registration-countdown|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Oliver|title=The head of the campaign to leave the EU wants to privatise the NHS|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/anti-eu-leave-campaign-chief-arron-banks-nhs-privatised-a7022306.html|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 May 2016}}</ref>

Banks threatened to sue the official [[Vote Leave]] campaign's candidacy as the official spokesperson for the "Leave" vote in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU referendum]], which may have possibly delayed the vote by two months. However, Banks has since rejected this and stated that he would not pursue a judicial review any further.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Rowena|title=Nigel Farage calls for end to Brexit campaign infighting|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/14/nigel-farage-calls-for-end-to-brexit-campaign-infighting|accessdate=8 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 April 2016}}</ref> Banks has also claimed that Vote Leave were lying when they claimed that the UK sends £350 million to the European Union, claiming this does not take into consideration the [[UK rebate|rebate which the UK receives]] from the EU, and that the £350 million is not actually sent to the EU headquarters in Brussels.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCann|first1=Kate|title=EU debate: Michael Gove condemns 'job-destroying' elites and 'racist' immigration rules as he appeals to Britons to back 'Project Hope' |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/03/eu-debate-michael-gove-faces-biggest-test-of-campaign-as-he-take1/|accessdate=8 June 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 June 2016}}</ref>

Following the murder of [[Jo Cox]], Arron Banks commissioned a poll on whether her murder had affected public opinion on voting. Asked whether the wording of the poll was "tasteless", Banks said "I don't think so",<ref>{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage: PM trying to link Jo Cox killing to Brexit campaign|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36574254|accessdate=28 June 2016|work=BBC News|date=20 June 2016}}</ref> adding that: "We were hoping to see what the effect of the event was.

A Channel 4 investigation also appeared to point to the conclusion that Banks' Leave.EU organisation faked migrant footage and photographs of "migrants" assaulting women. The photos were never used, but the fake video went viral. Banks accused Channel 4 News journalists of creating "fake news" themselves.<ref>{{cite news |title=Revealed: How Leave.EU faked migrant footage |url=https://www.channel4.com/news/revealed-how-leave-eu-faked-migrant-footage |work=Channel 4 News |date=16 April 2019}}</ref>

===Post-referendum events===
Following Britain's vote to leave the EU, Banks emailed a note to journalists attacking his critics. Banks described the United Kingdom's parliamentary [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] as "the legal division of the In campaign" and disagreed with their decision to enlist Vote Leave as the official campaign. Banks' response to the information commissioner, who in 2016 fined the campaign £50,000 for sending more than half a million unsolicited text messages, was a succinct "Whatever".<ref name="Ross2016a">{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Alice|title=Leave.EU co-chair Arron Banks takes swipe at critics after Brexit victory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/leave-eu-arron-banks-swipe-at-critics-brexit-victory|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 June 2016}}</ref><ref name="Cork2016a">{{cite news|last1=Cork|first1=Tristan|title=Leave.EU and Arron Banks issue unbelievable press release 'apologising' to their critics|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bite-me-arron-banks-astonishing-put-down-to-leave-eu-critics/story-29449144-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=Bristol Post|date=27 June 2016}}</ref> Banks views the Brexit vote as "a kind of halfhearted revolution" due to the fact that [[Theresa May]], who supported Britain remaining in the EU, would end up betraying those who voted to leave.<ref name="Erlanger-Freytas-tamura" />

In November 2017, the Electoral Commission announced that it was investigating whether election rules were broken during the EU referendum, in donations worth a total of £8.4 million to Leave.EU campaigners made by Banks and by Better for the Country Ltd, a company of which Banks is a registered director.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41829107|work=[[BBC News]]|date=1 November 2017|title=Arron Banks faces EU referendum finance investigation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8d532c46-beff-11e7-b8a3-38a6e068f464|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Arron Banks under investigation over Brexit campaign spending|date=1 November 2017}}</ref>

The [[National Crime Agency]] investigated Leave.EU, Banks and Bilney, as well as other individuals and entities, following the referral of material from a second Electoral Commission investigation. The referral was announced amid concerns that Banks was not the true source of £8m donated to Leave.EU.<ref>{{cite news|first=David |last=Pegg |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/13/met-to-take-no-further-action-over-leaveeu-spending-breaches-arron-banks |title=Met to take no further action over Leave.EU spending breaches |work=The Guardian |date=13 September 2018 |accessdate=27 September 2019}}</ref> In September 2019 the National Crime Agency said it had found no evidence of criminality after investigating a series of claims against the Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and Arron Banks.

For two years, Banks said his only contacts with the Russian government consisted of one "boozy lunch" with the ambassador.

In July 2018 when pressed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', he said there had been a fourth meeting. ''The Observer'' has seen evidence that suggests his Leave.EU campaign team met with Russian embassy officials as many as 11 times in the run-up to the EU referendum and in the two months beyond.<ref name="theguardian1"/>

It has been reported that on 12 November 2016, Arron Banks had a meeting with president-elect [[Donald Trump]] in Trump Tower and that upon return to London, Banks had lunch with the Russian ambassador where they discussed the Trump visit.<ref name="nytoffered" />

In August 2019 Banks was criticised by Labour MPs [[Tonia Antoniazzi]] and [[David Lammy]] after a tweet about the [[climate change]] activist [[Greta Thunberg]] as she set off on a two-week voyage in a zero carbon yacht. Banks tweeted: "Freak yachting accidents do happen in August". [[Tanja Bueltmann]], founder of the EU Citizens' Champion campaign, also strongly criticised the tweet.

Banks gave significant funds to LibLabCon.com, a [[satirical]] website dedicated to attacking the three major parties.

====Owners====
The official registered owners of the site are Heaver, who owns 50% of the website and is a daily editor,<ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a" /> and Better for the Country Ltd. Better for the Country Ltd is the company that ran [[Leave.EU]] (one of two main pro-Brexit campaigns, affiliated to Farage) and is directed by Leave.EU's chief executive, Elizabeth Bilney. Better for the Country Ltd is also registered to the same address as Westmonster.

====Early contributors and style====
Westmonster's welcome message stated that the political establishment had "taken one hell of a beating" in 2016, adding that "2017 might just be even bigger".<ref name="Bulman-19Jan2017a" /> The timing of this launch was seen as sign that the anti-establishment media which helped Trump to gain power was arriving in the UK, according to [[BBC News]]' media editor [[Amol Rajan]].<ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a" />

Although primarily a [[news aggregator]] website akin to the ''[[Drudge Report]]'', Westmonster does plan to publish original content<ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a" /><ref name="Jackson-19Jan17a" /> and enlist the support of celebrities and backbench MPs.<ref name="Bulman-19Jan2017a" /> Early contributions to the website include a piece written by [[Nigel Farage]] stating that the "political establishment" of the United Kingdom had not woken up to European [[populist]] movements, as well as articles showing majority British support for a [[burka ban]] and criticising "remoaners" for "trying to subvert the will of the people".<ref name="Bulman-19Jan2017a" />
