{{LGBT rights in the United Kingdom sidebar}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ''' ('''LGBT''') rights in the ''' United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''' have evolved dramatically over time.

Before and during the formation of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Christianity and homosexuality]] were seen to clash. Same-sex sexual activity was characterised as "sinful" and, under the ''[[Buggery Act 1533]]'', was outlawed and punishable by death. LGBT rights first came to prominence following the decriminalisation of sexual activity between men, [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|in 1967]] in [[England and Wales]], and later in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Sexual activity between women was never subject to the same legal restriction.

Since the turn of the 21st century, [[LGBT]] rights have increasingly strengthened in support. Some discrimination protections had existed for LGBT people since 1999, but were extended to all areas under the ''[[Equality Act 2010]]''. A ban on LGBT individuals serving openly in [[British Armed Forces|the armed forces]] was officially lifted in 2016, though a policy of non-enforcement had been in place since 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/21/contents|title=Armed Forces Act 2016|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom}}</ref> The [[age of consent]] was [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000|equalised]] at 16,{{efn|This was 17 in Northern Ireland at the time but has since been lowered in line with the rest of the UK.}} regardless of [[sexual orientation]], in 2001. Having been introduced in the 1980s, [[Section 28]], which prohibited the "promotion of homosexuality" by schools and local authorities, was repealed in 2003. Transgender people have had the ability to apply to change their legal gender [[Gender Recognition Act 2004|since 2005]]. The same year, same-sex couples were granted the right to enter into a [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]], a similar legal structure to marriage, and also to [[Same-sex adoption in the United Kingdom|adopt]] in England and Wales. Scotland later followed on adoption rights for same-sex couples in 2009, and Northern Ireland in 2013. [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|Same-sex marriage]] was legalised in England and Wales, and Scotland in 2014,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/12/10/government-announces-date-of-first-same-sex-marriages-in-england-and-wales/|title=Government announces date of first same-sex marriages in England and Wales|newspaper=Pink News|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref> and in Northern Ireland in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/22/enacted/data.htm|title=Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="nimarriage2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1514/contents/made/data.htm|title=The Marriage (Same-sex Couples) and Civil Partnership (Opposite-sex Couples) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2019|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref>

Today, LGBT citizens have most of the same legal rights as non-LGBT citizens and the UK provides one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world for its LGBT communities, although the UK has recently fallen behind other counties in international rankings. In [[ILGA-Europe]]'s 2015 review of LGBTI rights, the UK received the highest score in Europe, with 86% progress toward "respect of human rights and full equality" for LGBT people and 92% in Scotland alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/10/scotland-tops-league-for-gay-rights|title=Scotland tops league for gay rights|work=The Guardian}}</ref> However by 2020 the UK had dropped to ninth place in the ILGA-Europe rankings with a score of 66% and the executive also expressed concern about a "hostile climate on trans rights fuelled by opposition groups".<ref>{{Cite web|title=ILGA-Europe Rainbow Map Points To Make-or-Break Moment for LGBTI Rights in Europe {{!}} ILGA-Europe|url=https://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/rainbow-map-2020-points-make-or-break-moment-lgbti-rights-europe|access-date=2020-10-08|website=www.ilga-europe.org}}</ref> Meanwhile 86% of the UK agreed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, according to a 2019 [[Pew Research Center]] poll,<ref>{{cite web|date=25 June 2020|title=The Global Divide on Homosexuality Persists|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project}}</ref> and a 2017 poll showed that 77% of British people support same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite web|date=29 October 2018|title=Eastern and Western Europeans Differ on Importance of Religion, Views of Minorities, and Key Social Issues|url=https://www.pewforum.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/10/Eastern-Western-Europe-FOR-WEB.pdf|access-date=28 August 2020|work=Pew Research Center|page=12}}</ref>

== Same-sex sexual activity ==

===Homosexuality as an offence===
[[English law]] identified [[anal sex]] as an offence punishable by hanging as a result of the [[Buggery Act 1533]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=A timeline of gay rights in the UK|url=https://www.theweek.co.uk/87213/a-timeline-of-gay-rights-in-the-uk|access-date=2020-09-25|website=The Week UK|language=en}}</ref> which was pioneered by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=On sexuality, the law still caters to the norms of public disgust|url=https://theconversation.com/on-sexuality-the-law-still-caters-to-the-norms-of-public-disgust-79705|website=The Conversation}}</ref> The Act was the country's first civil [[sodomy law]], such offences having previously been dealt with by the [[ecclesiastical court]]s. While it was repealed in 1553 on the accession of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], it was re-enacted in 1563 under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two to be executed for sodomy in 1835.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Gay History of Britain: Love and Sex Between Men Since the Middle Ages | publisher=[[Greenwood World Publishing]] | last1=Cook |first1=Matt | last2=Mills |first2=Robert | last3=Trumback |first3=Randolph | last4=Cocks |first4=Harry | year=2007 |page=109| isbn=978-1846450020}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

Although section 61 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]] removed the death penalty for homosexuality, male homosexual acts remained illegal and were punishable by imprisonment. The [[Labouchere Amendment]], section 11 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], extended the laws regarding homosexuality to include any kind of sexual activity between males. [[Oscar Wilde]] was convicted under this law and sentenced to 2 years of [[penal labour]].<ref name=":1" /> Conversely, lesbians were never acknowledged or targeted by legislation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/31/turings-law-thousands-convicted-gay-bisexual-men-receive-posthumous/|title=Turing's Law: Oscar Wilde among 50,000 convicted gay men granted posthumous pardons|date=31 January 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

In Scotland, although there were no statutes making sex between men unlawful between 1424 and 1707,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/ |title=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland |publisher=Rps.ac.uk |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref> homosexual acts were punishable. One example is the commission for trial of Gavin Bell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=fetch_jump&filename=charlesi_ms&jump=charlesi_t1645_11_28_d6_trans&type=ms&fragment=m1645_11_28_d6_ms |title=Procedure: commission for the trial of Gavin Bell |publisher=Rps.ac.uk |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref>

In the early 1950s, the police actively enforced laws prohibiting sexual behaviour between men. By the end of 1954, there were 1,069 gay men in prison in England and Wales, with an average age of 37.<ref name="pinknews.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/07/15/the-pinknews-guide-to-the-history-of-england-and-wales-equal-marriage/2/ |title=The PinkNews Guide to the history of England and Wales equal marriage |publisher=Pinknews.co.uk |date=15 June 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref> There were a number of high-profile arrests and trials, including that of scientist, mathematician, and war-time code-breaker [[Alan Turing]], convicted in 1952 of "[[gross indecency]]". He accepted treatment with female hormones ([[chemical castration]]) as an alternative to prison. Turing committed suicide in 1954. Former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], in response to a petition, issued an apology on behalf of the British Government in 2009 for "the appalling way he was treated".<ref>{{Cite news |first=Hilary |last=Whiteman |title=Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing |publisher=CNN |date=1 September 2009 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/?imw=Y |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571 |title=Treatment of Alan Turing was "appalling"&nbsp;– PM |publisher=10 Downing Street |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100420212249/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571 |archive-date = 20 April 2010}}</ref> In 1954, the trial and eventual imprisonment of [[Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu|Edward Montagu]] (the 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu), [[Michael Pitt-Rivers]] and [[Peter Wildeblood]] for committing acts of "homosexual indecency" caused uproar and led to the establishment of a committee to examine and report on the law covering "homosexual offences" appointed by [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Sir David Maxwell Fyfe]] and [[Hugh Lucas-Tooth|Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth]].

===Wolfenden===
{{main|Wolfenden report}}
The Wolfenden Committee was set up on 24 August 1954 to consider UK law relating to "homosexual offences"; the Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution (better known as the [[Wolfenden report]]) was published on 3 September 1957. It recommended that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence", finding that "homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item107413.html|title=Wolfenden Report|website=bl.uk}}</ref>

In October 1957, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher]], spoke in support of the Wolfenden Report, saying that "There is a sacred realm of privacy... into which the law, generally speaking, must not intrude. This is a principle of the utmost importance for the preservation of human freedom, self-respect, and responsibility." The first parliamentary debate on the Wolfenden Report was initiated on 4 December 1957 by [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Pakenham]]. Of the seventeen peers who spoke in the debate, eight broadly supported the recommendations in the Wolfenden Report. [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Maxwell Fyfe]], by then ennobled as Lord Kilmuir and serving as [[Lord Chancellor]], speaking for the Government, doubted that there would be much public support for implementing the recommendations and stated that further research was required. The [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]] was founded on 12 May 1958, mainly to campaign for the implementation of the Wolfenden Committee's recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-legacy-of-1885-girls-and-the-age-of-sexual-consent|title=The legacy of 1885: girls and the age of sexual consent|last=Bates|first=Victoria|date=8 September 2015|website=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|access-date=12 July 2016}}</ref>

===Decriminalisation of homosexual acts===
In 1965, Conservative peer [[Arthur Gore, 8th Earl of Arran|Lord Arran]] proposed the decriminalisation of male homosexual acts (lesbian acts had never been illegal) in the [[House of Lords]]. This was followed by [[Humphry Berkeley]] in the House of Commons a year later, though Berkeley ascribed his defeat in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]] to the unpopularity of this action. However, in the newly elected Parliament, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Leo Abse]] took up the issue and the ''Sexual Offences Bill'' was put before Parliament in order to implement some of the Wolfenden Committee's recommendations after almost ten years of campaigning.<ref>{{cite news|author=Patricia Brent and Leo Abse|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12005.shtml|title=Why should homosexuality be decriminalised?|date=20 December 1966|work=[[BBC Archives]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818134241/http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12005.shtml|archive-date=18 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The ''[[Sexual Offences Act 1967]]'' ({{lang-cy|Deddf Troseddau Rhywiol 1967}}; {{lang-gd|Achd Eucoirean Feise 1967}}) was accordingly passed and received [[royal assent]] on 27 July 1967 after an intense late-night debate in the House of Commons. It maintained general prohibitions on [[buggery]] and [[Decency|indecency]] between men, but provided for a limited decriminalisation of homosexual acts where three conditions were fulfilled: 1) the act had to be consensual, 2) the act had to take place in private and 3) the act could involve only people that had attained the age of 21. This was a higher age of consent than that for [[heterosexual]] acts, which was set at 16. Further, "in private" limited participation in an act to two people. This condition was interpreted strictly by the courts, which took it to exclude acts taking place in a room in a hotel, for example, and in private homes where a third person was present (even if that person was in a different room). These restrictions were overturned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2000.<ref name="pinknews.co.uk"/>

The 1967 Act extended only to [[England and Wales]]. Organisations therefore continued to campaign for the goal of full equality in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] where all homosexual behaviour remained illegal. Same-sex sexual activities were legalised in Scotland on the same basis as in the 1967 Act, by section 80 of the ''[[Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980]]'', which came into force on 1 February 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1980/dec/17/the-criminal-justice-scotlandact-1980|title=THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND)ACT 1980 (Hansard, 17 December 1980)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|language=en-GB|access-date=4 September 2017}}</ref> An analogous amendment was also made to the law of Northern Ireland, following the determination of a case by the European Court of Human Rights (see ''[[Dudgeon v. United Kingdom]]''); the relevant legislation was an [[Order in Council]], the ''[[Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1007455 |title=The Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982 (No. 1536 (N.I. 19)) |date=27 October 1982 |work=The UK Statute Law Database |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130103644/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1007455 |archive-date=30 January 2010 }}</ref> which came into force on 8 December 1982.

===Equal age of consent===
{{See also|Ages of consent in Europe}}
In 1979, the Home Office Policy Advisory Committee's Working Party report, "Age of Consent in Relation to Sexual Offences", recommended that the age of consent for same-sex sexual activities be reduced from 21 to 18, but no such legislation was enacted as a result.

In February 1994, Parliament considered reform of the law on [[rape]] and other sexual offences during the passage of the ''Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill''. [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Edwina Currie]] proposed an amendment to equalise the [[age of consent]] of same-sex sexual activities to 16. Currie's amendment was defeated by 307 votes to 280. Those who supported it included [[Tony Blair]],<ref name=Blair1996>{{Cite book |last=Blair |first=Tony |year=1996 |title=New Britain: my vision of a young country |publisher=Fourth Estate |isbn=978-1-85702-436-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7k-IAAAAMAAJ |page=188 }}</ref> [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], [[Neil Kinnock]], [[Paddy Ashdown]] and [[William Hague]]. Those against included [[David Blunkett]] and [[Ann Taylor, Baroness Taylor of Bolton|Ann Taylor]]. There were angry scenes outside the [[Palace of Westminster]] at the defeat of the amendment, when those involved in a demonstration organised by the group [[OutRage!]] clashed with police. Another amendment proposed by Sir [[Anthony Durant]] suggested lowering the age of consent to 18, which passed by 427 votes to 162, and supporters included [[Michael Howard]] and [[John Major]]. It was opposed by such MPs as [[John Redwood]], [[Michael Heseltine]] and [[John Gummer]]. An amendment proposed by [[Simon Hughes]] which was intended to equalise the age of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals to 17 was not voted upon. The bill as a whole was given a second reading in the Lords by 290 votes to 247. [[Frank Pakenham|Lord Longford]] then sought to reintroduce 21 as the minimum age in the Lords, but this was defeated by 176 votes to 113. An amendment by the Deputy Labour Leader in the House of Lords, [[Lord McIntosh of Haringey|Lord MacIntosh of Haringey]], that would have equalised the age of consent to 16, was rejected by 245 votes to 71.

In its decision of 1 July 1997, in the case of ''[[Sutherland v. United Kingdom]]'', the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] found that Articles 8 and 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were violated by a discriminatory age of consent, on the ground that there was no objective and reasonable justification for maintaining a higher minimum age for male homosexual acts. On 13 October 1997, the Government submitted to the European Court of Human Rights that it would propose a bill to Parliament for a reduction of the age of consent for homosexual acts from 18 to 16. On 22 June 1998, the ''Crime and Disorder Bill'' was put before Parliament. [[Ann Keen]] proposed amendments to lower the age of consent to 16. The House of Commons accepted these provisions with a majority of 207, but they were rejected by the House of Lords with a majority of 168. Subsequently, the ''Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill'' was introduced on 16 December 1998 and, again, the equalisation of the age of consent was endorsed on 25 January 1999 by the House of Commons, but was rejected on 14 April 1999 by the House of Lords. Those campaigning against the amendment claimed they were simply acting to protect children. [[Janet Young, Baroness Young|Baroness Young]], the leader of the campaign against the amendment, said, "Homosexual practices carry great health risks to young people."

The Government reintroduced the bill in 1999. With the prospect of it being passed by the Commons in two successive sessions of Parliament, the ''[[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]'' were available to enact the bill should the Lords have rejected it a third time. The Lords passed the bill at second reading, but made an amendment during committee stage to maintain the age of consent for buggery at 18 for both sexes. However, as the bill had not completed its passage through the Lords at the end of the parliamentary session on 30 November 2000, then [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]] certified that the procedure specified by the Parliament Acts had been complied with. The bill received [[royal assent]] a few hours later, and was enacted as the ''[[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]]''. The provisions of the Act came into force throughout the UK on 8 January 2001, lowering the age of consent to 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1471128 |title=Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 |work=The UK Statute Law Database |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |at=Commencement Information |accessdate=27 March 2010 }}</ref> This Act also introduced, for the first time, an age of consent for lesbian sexual acts, as previously there had been no legislation concerning this.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1045383.stm |title=Q and A: The age of consent |publisher=BBC |date=29 November 2000 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>

On 1 May 2004, the ''[[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]'' entered into force, which swept away all of the previous sex-specific legislation, including the 1967 Act, and introduced instead neutral offences. Thus, the previous conditions relating to privacy were removed, and sexual acts were viewed by the law without regard to the sex of the participants.

With the passage of the ''Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008'', Northern Ireland, which had an age of consent of 17 regardless of one's sexual orientation, lowered the age to 16 in 2009 so it would match that of England, Wales, and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/history-age-consent-gay-couples-uk/|title=How the UK debated the age of consent for gay sex|work=inews.co.uk|date=16 September 2016|last=Sandhu|first=Serina}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/04/21/the-queens-turned-90-and-heres-all-the-lgbt-laws-she-signed/|title=The Queen turned 90 and here's all the LGBT laws she signed|work=PinkNews|date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fpa.org.uk/sites/default/files/northern-ireland-sex-and-the-law.pdf|title=SEX AND THE LAW|work=fpa.org.uk}}</ref>

===Annulment of convictions===
On 31 January 2017, the ''[[Policing and Crime Act 2017]]'' went into effect after being given royal assent. A section of the Act known as the "[[Alan Turing law]]" officially gave posthumous pardons to the thousands of homosexual men from England and Wales who had been convicted under those regions' old sodomy laws, and gave those still living the possibility to apply to have their conviction erased. Disregards have been available since 2012, removing the conviction from the person's criminal records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/uk-issues-posthumous-pardons-thousands-gay-men-alan-turing-law|title=UK issues posthumous pardons for thousands of gay men|first=Owen Bowcott Legal affairs|last=correspondent|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref> Scotland passed a more comprehensive law in June 2018, with pardons being automatic for those still living.<ref name="scotland pardon">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44372851|title=Thousands of gay Scots to be pardoned|work=BBC News|date=6 June 2018}}</ref> The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] passed a similar law in 2016, with it taking effect on 28 June 2018.<ref name="northern ireland pardon">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44637564|title=Gay men in Northern Ireland offered access to pardons|work=BBC News|date=28 June 2018}}</ref> Applications for pardons must be made with the [[Department of Justice (Northern Ireland)|Northern Irish Department of Justice]].

In June 2019, it was revealed that only two men had sought pardons for historic gay sex offences in Northern Ireland and that they both failed to have their convictions overturned. Across the UK, over half of those who applied for a pardon did not have their convictions overturned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/everyone-in-northern-ireland-who-applied-for-gay-pardon-turned-down/|title=Everyone in Northern Ireland who applied for 'gay pardon' turned down|date=25 June 2019|last=Capon|first=Tom|work=Gay Star News}}</ref>

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==

===Civil partnership===
{{See also|Civil partnership in the United Kingdom}}
There was no legal recognition of same-sex relationships in Britain until 2005, following the legalisation of [[Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]] under the passage of the ''[[Civil Partnership Act 2004|Civil Partnership Act]]'' ({{lang-cy|Deddf Partneriaeth Sifil 2004}}; {{lang-gd|Achd Com-pàirteachasan Sìobhalta 2004}}) on 18 November 2004. Civil partnerships are a separate union which give most (but not all) of the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage, but there are recognition issues in other countries and with the use of [[courtesy title]]s. Civil partnerships can take place on any approved premise in the UK and in approved religious venues in England and Wales since 2011 (though religious venues are not compelled), but cannot include religious readings, music or symbols.<ref name="equalities"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2661/made/data.htm|title=The Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Approved Premises) (Amendment) Regulations 2011|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom}}</ref> The ''Civil Partnership Act'' came into effect on 5 December 2005.

===Same-sex marriage===
[[File:Matrimonio nel Regno Unito del 2015.jpg|thumb|right|A [[same-sex marriage]] in the United Kingdom]]
{{See also|Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom}}
[[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom]] has been the subject of wide debate since the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Britain. Previous legislation in England and Wales had prevented same-sex marriage, including the ''[[Marriage Act 1949]]'' which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, the ''[[Nullity of Marriage Act 1971]]'' which explicitly banned same-sex marriages, and the ''[[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]]'' which reiterated the provisions of the ''Nullity of Marriage Act''.

While civil partnerships were established nationwide, marriage law is a devolved matter in the United Kingdom and therefore the legislative procedure of same-sex marriage differs by jurisdiction. The ''[[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]]'', which allows same-sex marriage in England and Wales, was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] in July 2013 and came into force on 13 March 2014, with the first same-sex marriages taking place on 29 March 2014.<ref name=wrecker>{{cite news|title=Gay marriage bill: Peers back government plans|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22764954|accessdate=4 June 2013|date=4 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="england">{{cite news|title=England's Gay Marriage Law To Become Legal After Lower House Approval|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/16/england-gay-marriage-law-_n_3606916.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=HuffPost|date=16 July 2013|agency=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage becomes law in England and Wale|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23338279|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=17 July 2013}}</ref> The ''[[Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014]]'', allowing same-sex marriage in Scotland, was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] in February 2014 and came into effect on 16 December 2014.<ref name="scotland">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18981287|title= Gay marriage to be introduced in Scotland |date=25 July 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22691285 |title=Scotland's gay marriage bill to come before Holyrood within a month |publisher=BBC |date=28 May 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref>

Same-sex marriages in the UK give all the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage and can be performed on approved premises. This also includes religious venues, providing the religious or belief body has opted-in. However, no religious or belief body is compelled to perform same-sex marriages; the [[Church of England]] and the [[Church in Wales]] are explicitly banned from doing so. For the purposes of the divorce of a same-sex marriage, the common law definition of adultery remains as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman only, although infidelity with a person of the same sex can be grounds for a divorce as "unreasonable behaviour."<ref name="legislation.gov.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/enacted |title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref> Non-[[consummation]] is also excluded as a ground for the annulment of a same-sex marriage.<ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/>

Between 2012 and 2015, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] voted five times on same-sex marriage, and although it was passed by a slim majority on the fifth attempt, it was vetoed by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] using the [[petition of concern]].<ref name="mortimer">{{cite news|last1=Mortimer|first1=Caroline|title=Northern Ireland same-sex marriage vote vetoed by DUP|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/northern-ireland-same-sex-equal-marriage-vote-vetoed-by-dup-a6718061.html|accessdate=1 February 2017|work=The Independent|date=2 November 2015}}</ref> Following the inconclusive [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election]] and failure to form a [[Northern Ireland Executive]] by the deadline of 21 October 2019, provisions in the ''[[Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019]]'', which was passed by the UK Parliament on 18 July 2019 and received royal assent on 24 July, mandated the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] to pass regulations legalising same-sex marriage by 13 January 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-50128860|title=Northern Ireland abortion and same-sex marriage laws change|first=Chris|last=Page|date=22 October 2019|accessdate=22 October 2019|website=BBC News}}</ref> The Secretary of State, [[Julian Smith (politician)|Julian Smith]] signed the regulations on 19 December 2019.<ref name="bt-signed-2019">{{cite news |title=Secretary of State Julian Smith signs regulations introducing same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/secretary-of-state-julian-smith-signs-regulations-introducing-same-sex-marriage-to-northern-ireland-38801141.html |accessdate=26 December 2019 |work=The Belfast Telegraph |publisher=Independent News & Media PLC |date=19 December 2019}}</ref> Same-sex marriage therefore became legal in Northern Ireland on 13 January 2020, with couples free to register their intent to marry and couples who had previously married elsewhere having their unions recognised from that date.<ref name=legalrecognition>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51086276|title=Same-sex marriage now legal in Northern Ireland|work=BBC News|date=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/uk/same-sex-marriage-legal-northern-ireland-intl-gbr/index.html|title=Same sex marriage is finally legal in Northern Ireland|publisher=CNN|date=13 January 2020}}</ref> The first same-sex marriage ceremony took place in [[Carrickfergus]] on 11 February 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Media|first=P.

==Adoption and family planning==
Under the ''[[Adoption and Children Act 2002]]'', Parliament provided that an application to adopt a child in England and Wales could be made by either a single person or a couple. The previous condition that the couple be married was dropped, thus allowing a same-sex couple to apply. The Lords rejected the proposal on one occasion before it was passed. Supporters of the move in Parliament stressed that adoption was not a "gay rights" issue but one of providing as many children as possible with a stable family environment rather than seeing them kept in care. Opponents raised doubts over the stability of relationships outside marriage, and how instability would impact on the welfare of adopted children. However, the law was successfully passed and went into effect on 30 December 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/section/21|title=Adoption and Children Act 2002|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtroomadvice.co.uk/adoption-children-act-2002-overview.html|title=The Adoption and Children Act 2002: An Overview|website=courtroomadvice.co.uk|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref> Similar legislation was adopted in Scotland, which came into effect on 28 September 2009.<ref name="scotlandadoption">{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2007/asp_20070004_en_3#pt1-ch2-pb7-l1g29 |title=Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007, 2007 asp 4, s. 29 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/new-legislation-sees-gay-scottish-couples-win-right-to-adopt-children-1.921121|title=New legislation sees gay Scottish couples win right to adopt children|last=Thomas|first=Ellen|date=20 September 2009|work=The Herald|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref> Northern Ireland followed suit in December 2013.<ref name="northernirelandadoption">[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-25332917 Gay adoption: Northern Ireland ban lifted], ''BBC News'', 11 December 2013</ref>

==Transgender rights==
{{main|Transgender rights in the United Kingdom}}
In December 2002, the Lord Chancellor's office published a "Government Policy Concerning Transsexual People" document that categorically states that transsexualism "is not a mental illness."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/transsex/policy.htm | title = Government Policy concerning Transsexual People | work = People's rights / Transsexual people | publisher = U.K. Department for Constitutional Affairs | year = 2003 | access-date = 16 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511211217/http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/transsex/policy.htm | archive-date = 11 May 2008 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

Since 4 April 2005, as per the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' ({{lang-cy|Deddf Cydnabod Rhywedd 2004}}; {{lang-gd|Achd Aithneachadh Gnè 2004}}), it has been possible for transgender people to change their legal gender in the UK, allowing them to acquire a new [[birth certificate]], affording them full recognition of their acquired sex in law for all purposes. Transgender people must present evidence to a [[Gender Recognition Panel]], which considers their case and issues a [[Gender Recognition Certificate]] (GRC); they must have [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioned]] two years before a GRC is issued. It is not a requirement for [[sex reassignment surgery]] to have taken place, although such surgery will be accepted as part of the supporting evidence for a case where it has taken place. There is formal approval of medical gender reassignment available either on the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) or privately.

However, there have been concerns regarding marriages and civil partnerships. Under the ''Gender Recognition Act 2004'', transgender people who are married have been required to divorce or annul their marriage in order for them to be issued with a GRC. The Government chose to retain this requirement in the Act as effectively it would have legalised a small category of same-sex marriages. The ''Civil Partnership Act 2004'' allowed the creation of civil partnerships between same-sex couples, but a married couple that includes a transgender partner cannot simply re-register their new status. They must first have their marriage dissolved, gain legal recognition of the new gender and then register for a civil partnership. This is like any divorce with the associated paperwork and costs.

With the legalisation of same-sex marriage in England and Wales, existing marriages will continue where one or both parties change their legal gender and both parties wish to remain married. The legislation also does not restore any of the marriages of transgender people that were forcibly annulled as a precondition for them securing a GRC and states that a GRC will not be issued unless the spouse of the transgender person has consented. If the spouse does not consent, the marriage must be terminated before a GRC may be issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/5/enacted |title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref>

==Discrimination protections==
[[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|Regulations were introduced]] for discrimination protections on sexual orientation in employment on 1 December 2003, following the adoption of [[Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation|an EC Directive]] in 2000, providing for the prohibition of discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2003/20031661.htm |title=Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, S.I. 2003/1661 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> The ''Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999'' created certain legal protections for transgender people for the first time in British history. The Regulations banned discrimination against individuals undergoing "gender reassignment" in employment and vocational training. Similar legislation, the ''Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999'', was passed in Northern Ireland. The ''Sex Discrimination (Amendment of Legislation) Regulations 2008'' extended these protections to cover discrimination in goods, facilities and services

On 30 April 2007, the [[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations|Sexual Orientation Regulations]] came into force, following the introduction of similar provisions in Northern Ireland in January 2007. They provided a general prohibition of discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the grounds of sexual orientation. Similar legislation had long previously been in force in respect of discrimination on the grounds of [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|sex]], [[Race Relations Act 1976|race]], [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|disability]] and [[marital status]]. The introduction of the Regulations was controversial and a dispute arose between the Government and the [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales]] over exemptions for Catholic adoption agencies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/ccb/content/pdf/501 |title=Note from Archbishop Peter Smith regarding Catholic adoption agencies and the current controversy |last=Smith |first=Peter |date=5 February 2007 |publisher=Catholic Church of England and Wales |accessdate=1 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231153244/http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/ccb/content/pdf/501 |archive-date=31 December 2008 }}</ref>

===Section 28===
{{Main|Section 28}}
The 1980s saw a setback for LGBT rights. The availability in the [[library|libraries]] of schools run by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] of a book considered by some to "promote" homosexuality led to protests and a campaign for new legislation.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Susanne |last=Bosche |title=Jenny, Eric, Martin . . . and me|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/31/booksforchildrenandteenagers.features11 |work=The Guardian|date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=10 October 2007 | location=London}}</ref> Consequently, the ''[[Local Government Act 1988]]'' included a provision prohibiting "the intentional promotion of homosexuality" by any [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]] and "the teaching in any [[state school|maintained school]] of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Godfrey|first1=Chris|title=Section 28 protesters 30 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/section-28-protesters-30-years-on-we-were-arrested-and-put-in-a-cell-up-by-big-ben|accessdate=31 March 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 March 2018}}</ref> The provision was known as [[Section 28]], and amended section 2A of the earlier ''Local Government Act 1986''. Changes in the structure of local government since that date led to some confusion over the precise circumstances in which the new law applied, including the question of whether or not it applied at all in state schools.

Section 28 (called Section 2A in Scotland) was repealed in Scotland within the first two years of the existence of the [[Scottish Parliament]], by the ''Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2000/asp_20000007_en_6#pt6-l1g34 |title=2000 asp 7, s. 34 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> A move to remove the provision in England and Wales was prevented following opposition in the House of Lords, led by [[Janet Young, Baroness Young|Baroness Young]]. Following her death in 2002, it was repealed by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government in the ''[[Local Government Act 2003]]'', which took effect on 18 November 2003. During the passage of the bill, no attempt was made to retain the section and an amendment seeking to preserve it using ballots was defeated in the House of Lords. In June 2009, [[David Cameron]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party Leader, formally apologised for his party introducing the law, stating that it was a mistake and offensive to gay people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-sorry-for-section-28-1728003.html |title=David Cameron apologises for Section 28 |work=The Independent|date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=2 June 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

===Public Order Act 1986===
Section 29AB of the ''Public Order Act 1986'' states:<ref name="publicorder"/>

:In this Part "hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation" means hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to sexual orientation (whether towards persons of the same sex, the opposite sex or both)

Section 29JA, titled "Protection of freedom of expression (sexual orientation)", of the Act states the following:<ref name="publicorder">{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64|title=Public Order Act 1986|work=Government of the United Kingdom}}</ref>

:(1) In this Part, for the avoidance of doubt, the discussion or criticism of sexual conduct or practices or the urging of persons to refrain from or modify such conduct or practices shall not be taken of itself to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred.

:(2) In this Part, for the avoidance of doubt, any discussion or criticism of marriage which concerns the sex of the parties to marriage shall not be taken of itself to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred.

===Homophobic chanting at football matches===
In July 2020, the UK government announced a new law to soon be introduced that amends the UK Football Offenses Act 1991<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/19/contents]</ref> to explicitly ban homophobic chanting at football matches.<ref>[https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/uk-government-wants-to-make-homophobic-chanting-at-soccer-matches-illegal/]</ref>

===BBC journalists pride marches ban===
In November 2020, it was announced that [[BBC]] journalists are banned from attending UK pride marches - so as not to be seen as politically biased (even at a "personal" individual capacity).<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/oct/29/bbc-no-bias-rules-prevent-staff-joining-lgbt-pride-protests]</ref><ref>[https://www.advocate.com/media/2020/10/29/bbc-staffers-banned-pride-black-lives-matter-events]</ref><ref>[https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/bbc-tells-news-staff-to-ask-permission-before-attending-lgbt-events-or-face-the-sack/]</ref>

==Bias-motivated violence and abuse==
Recorded reports of homophobic abuse in the UK increased from 5,807 in 2014–15 to 13,530 in 2018–19. The number of prosecutions fell from 1,157 to 1,058, which the National Police Chiefs' Council attributed to many cases with a lack of witnesses and evidence, including whether the assault was motivated by the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity or not. "Many of these non-violent offences present less evidential opportunities and victims often feel that there is a barrier between bringing the matter to court and prefer to make police aware of each offence", said a spokesman for the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]. [[North Yorkshire]] and [[South Yorkshire]] saw their reports increase from 172 to 961 and 73 to 375, respectively. The West Yorkshire Police said this increase was in part due to "improvements in the way we record crime and the fact that many victims have the confidence to come forward".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49509301|title=Homophobic hate crime charges fall as reports soar|work=BBC News|date=11 September 2019}}</ref>

==Military service==

{{See also|Sexual orientation and the military of the United Kingdom|Smith and Grady v United Kingdom}}
LGBT people have been allowed to serve openly in [[British Armed Forces|Her Majesty's Armed Forces]] since 2000, and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been forbidden since 2010.<ref name="equality act"/> It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to [[Coming out|come out]]. All personnel are subject to the same rules against intolerance, bullying and [[sexual harassment]], regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. The British military also recognises [[civil partnerships]] and grants same-sex couples the same rights to allowances and housing as opposite-sex couples.

The British military actively recruits LGBT people and have deployed recruiting teams to many Pride events: the [[Royal Navy]] advertises for recruits in gay magazines and has allowed gay sailors to hold civil partnership ceremonies on board ships and, since 2006, to march in full naval uniform at [[gay pride]] marches; [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] personnel could march but had to wear civilian clothes until 2008, now all military personnel are permitted to attend such marches in uniform.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4133763.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Soldiers can wear their uniforms with pride at gay parade says MoD | first1=Damian | last1=Barr | first2=Lucy | last2=Bannerman | date=14 June 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref>

The current policy was accepted at the lower ranks first, with many senior officers worrying for their troops without a modern acceptance of homosexuality that their personnel had grown up with. One [[Brigadier]] resigned but with little impact. Since the change, support at the senior level has grown. General Sir [[Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt|Richard Dannatt]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] (head of the Army), told members of the Army-sponsored Fourth Joint Conference on LGBT Matters that homosexuals were welcome to serve in the Army. In a speech to the conference in 2008, the first of its kind by any Army chief, General Sir Richard said that respect for LGBT officers and soldiers was now "a command responsibility" and was vital for "operational effectiveness."<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/3179261/Armys-top-general-makes-history-by-addressing-conference-on-homosexuality.html |work=The Telegraph |title=Army's top general makes history by addressing conference on homosexuality |date=11 October 2008 |location=London |first=Sean |last=Rayment}}</ref>

In 2009, on the tenth anniversary of the change of law that permitted homosexuality in the Armed Forces, newspapers reported that the lifting of the ban had no perceivable impact on the operational effectiveness on the military. The anniversary was widely celebrated, including in the Army's in-house publication ''[[Soldier Magazine]]'', with a series of articles including the July 2009 cover story and newspapers articles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-13439.html |title=Pride of the army: Soldier magazine honours gay servicemen and women |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020163400/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-13439.html/ |archive-date=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Conversion therapy ==
Peel, Clarke and Drescher wrote in 2007 that only one organisation in Britain could be identified with [[conversion therapy]], a religious organisation called "The Freedom Trust"<ref name="group nb">This is presumably a reference to [[True Freedom Trust]] which appears to have dissociated itself from Exodus and conversion therapy in 2000.</ref> (part of [[Exodus International]]): "whereas a number of organisations in the US (both religious and scientific/psychological) promote conversion therapy, there is only one in the UK of which we are aware". The paper reported that practitioners who did provide these sorts of treatments between the 1950s and 1970s now view homosexuality as healthy, and the evidence suggests that 'conversion therapy' is a historical rather than a contemporary phenomenon in Britain, where treatment for homosexuality has always been less common than in the US.<ref name=Exuk>{{Harvnb|Peel|2007|pp=18–19}}</ref>

In 2007, the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]], the main professional organisation of psychiatrists in Britain, issued a report stating that: "Evidence shows that LGBT people are open to seeking help for mental health problems. However, they may be misunderstood by therapists who regard their homosexuality as the root cause of any presenting problem such as depression or anxiety. Unfortunately, therapists who behave in this way are likely to cause considerable distress. A small minority of therapists will even go so far as to attempt to change their client's sexual orientation. This can be deeply damaging. Although there are now a number of therapists and organisations in the USA and in the UK that claim that therapy can help homosexuals to become heterosexual, there is no evidence that such change is possible."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/uploads/rcp.html |title=Thinking Anglicans |date=13 September 2008 }}</ref>

In 2008, the Royal College of Psychiatrists stated: "The Royal College shares the concern of both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association that positions espoused by bodies like the [[National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH) in the United States are not supported by science. There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Furthermore so-called treatments of homosexuality as recommended by NARTH create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish."<ref name=rcpsych.ac.uk>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pressparliament/pressreleases2009/statement.aspx |title=Statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Gay and Lesbian Mental Health Special Interest Group |date=13 September 2008 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428160120/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pressparliament/pressreleases2009/statement.aspx |archive-date=28 April 2009 }}</ref>

In 2009, a research survey into mental health practitioners in the United Kingdom concluded that "a significant minority of mental health professionals are attempting to help lesbian, gay and bisexual clients to become heterosexual. Given lack of evidence for the efficacy of such treatments, this is likely to be unwise or even harmful."<ref name=BMC>{{Harvnb|Bartlett|Smith|King|2009}}</ref> ''[[Scientific American]]'' reported on this: "One in 25 British psychiatrists and psychologists say they would be willing to help homosexual and bisexual patients try to convert to heterosexuality, even though there is no compelling scientific evidence a person can willfully become straight", and explained that 17% of those surveyed said they had tried to help reduce or suppress homosexual feelings, and 4% said they would try to help homosexual people convert to heterosexuality in the future.<ref name=Ballantyne>{{Harvnb|Ballantyne|2009}}</ref>

On 12 February 2018, the [[Church of England]]'s Education Office published a policy endorsing sex education which includes, among other things, LGBT education.<ref name=churchendorse>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2018-03/Relationships%20and%20Sex%20Education%20Response.pdf|title=Church of England Education Office Response|work=The Church of England Education Office}}</ref> Concerning sexuality, the policy states "sex education should include an understanding that all humans are sexual beings and that sexual desire is natural. Pupils should be taught that humans express their sexuality differently and that there is diversity in sexual desire".<ref name=churchendorse /> The policy also states that "pupils must be allowed to explore questions of identity and how we value our own identity and the uniqueness of other people. PSHE [Personal, Social, Health and Economic education] must help pupils recognise their true identity, and teach them that our media-framed, market-driven culture that often leads to body image anxiety can be challenged. This issue is the focus of the [[Rachel Treweek|Bishop of Gloucester]]'s #liedentity campaign which
aims to challenge negative body image and encouraging young people to look within to discover true value and beauty."<ref name=churchendorse />

In July 2018, Education Minister [[Damian Hinds]] announced new government regulations concerning sex education. Topics such as mental wellbeing, consent, keeping safe online, physical health and fitness, and LGBT issues will be covered under the new guidelines, which are the first changes to sex education regulations since 2000, and which will be mandatory in all primary and secondary schools in England from September 2020 onward. The move was welcomed by LGBT groups in particular, who cited statistics showing that only 13% of LGBT youth had been taught about healthy same-sex relationships in schools. In addition, parents will retain certain rights to veto sex education lessons, but by the age of 16, the child may attend the lessons regardless of the parents' wishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-education-lgbt/overhaul-of-sex-education-in-england-could-elevate-lgbt-rights-idUSKBN1K92TH|title=Overhaul of sex education in England could elevate LGBT rights|agency=Reuters|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref> The draft guidance states: "By the end of primary school, pupils should know that others' families, either in school or in the wider world, sometimes look different from their family, but that they should respect those differences and know that other children's families are also characterised by love and care for them." The guidance for secondary schools adds: "Pupils should be taught the facts and the law about sex, sexuality, sexual health and gender identity in an age-appropriate and inclusive way... All pupils should feel that the content is relevant to them and their developing sexuality."

This followed reports of some religious schools deliberately avoiding the issue, most notably an Orthodox Jewish school in north [[London]] which in 2018 had removed all references to the homosexual victims of [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution throughout their textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/06/26/ofcom-faith-school-censored-gay-holocaust-victims-textbooks/|title=Education watchdog rebukes school that redacted history textbooks to remove gay Holocaust victims|work=PinkNews|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref> According to the Department of Education, faith-based schools would no longer have a right to opt-out of sex education lessons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/lgbt-sex-ed-to-be-taught-in-england-including-in-faith-schools/#gs.WZqAqIw|title=LGBT sex ed to be taught in England, including faith schools|work=Gay Star News|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref> In September 2018, the UK's Chief Rabbi, [[Ephraim Mirvis]], agreed to comply with this new policy and published guidelines on how to teach LGBT sex education in British Jewish schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-45435583|title=Chief Rabbi publishes first LGBT guide for orthodox schools|work=BBC News|date=6 September 2018|last=Burns|first=Judith}}</ref>

The [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], founded on 12 May 1958, in response to the findings of the [[Wolfenden Report]] was one of the first [[LGBT rights organization|LGBT groups]] in the UK. Nowadays, [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] exists as the largest LGBT equality organisation in the UK and Europe.

LGBT people have been serving openly in politics since the 1970s. The first openly lesbian MP was [[Maureen Colquhoun]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], MP 1974–79), who was outed in 1976.

Following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], an estimated 54 openly LGBT MPs were elected to Parliament, of whom 24 were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], 19 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] 10 [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] and [[Layla Moran]] from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who became the first ever [[Pansexual]]<ref>https://mps.whoare.lgbt/</ref> MP.<ref name=":45">{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/12/13/uk-gay-parliament-world-2019-general-election-snp-conservatives-labour-lgbt/|title=The UK's parliament is still the gayest in the world after 2019 election|work=PinkNews|date=13 December 2019|last=Reynolds|first=Andrew}}</ref>

LGBT people are also allowed to serve openly in police and, in 1990, the Lesbian and Gay Police Association (LAGPA), now the [[Gay Police Association]] (GPA), was founded.

There are also large LGBT communities most noted in Birmingham ([[Birmingham Gay Village]]), Blackpool, Brighton ([[LGBT community of Brighton and Hove]]), Liverpool ([[LGBT culture in Liverpool]]), London ([[Old Compton Street]]) and Manchester ([[Canal Street (Manchester)|Canal Street]]), who all host annual [[pride parade|pride festivals]]. The neighbouring Yorkshire towns of [[Todmorden]] and [[Hebden Bridge]] have high lesbian populations.

Many pride festivals are hosted in the UK every year. The first gay marches were in London in 1970, followed by the debut of the UK Gay Pride Rally there in 1972. [[Pride in London]] is the biggest and oldest festival, and has been organised annually since. Pride festivals are very popular summer events in major cities, and have expanded to smaller communities in recent years.

On the 5th anniversary of the passing of the [[same-sex marriage]] referendum, [[Amnesty International]], Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and Rainbow Project announced the first mass demonstration in Belfast, Northern Ireland, protesting against the failure of the UK government in delivering full same-sex marriage rights. People wanting to convert their civil union into marriage are unable to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/northern-ireland-campaigners-criticise-uk-government-failure-deliver-full-marriage|title=Northern Ireland: Campaigners criticise UK Government failure to deliver full marriage equality|accessdate=22 May 2020|website=Amnesty International UK}}</ref>

==Role of the Council of Europe==
According to Juris Lavrikovs from [[ILGA-Europe]], the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[European Court of Human Rights]] has been a positive force for LGBT rights, especially with regards to decriminalising same-sex consensual activity, barring discrimination against transgender individuals in employment, equalising the age of consent, enabling LGBT people to serve openly in the military, allowing transgender people the right to marry, employment equality and the including pension right for transgender individuals.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lavrikovs|first1=Juris|title=How Europe has influenced the UK's journey on LGBT rights|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/06/06/comment-how-europe-has-influenced-the-uks-journey-on-lgbt-rights/|accessdate=6 April 2015|issue=ILGA-Europe|newspaper=Pink News|date=6 June 2014}}</ref>

In 1993, Stonewall conducted a survey of gay men and lesbians at work where they found two-thirds of respondents hid their sexuality at work and only 11% of respondents never hid their sexual orientation in the workplace. A follow up survey done in 2008 found that 20% of gay and lesbian people had experienced bullying at work.<ref name="TaylorEmir2012">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpdhrMKhvZkC&pg=PA328|title=Employment Law: An Introduction|author1=Stephen Taylor|author2=Astra Emir|date=22 March 2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-960489-0|page=328}}</ref>

Attitudes towards homosexuality amongst the British public have become more tolerant over time; according to the British Social Attitudes Survey, in 1983 approximately 50% to 70% of respondents of the three major political parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat) regarded homosexuality as "always wrong" or "mostly wrong" and in 1993 opposition to homosexuality was reported to have slightly increased amongst all parties. However, by 2003 attitudes had become more tolerant, with 25% to 50% of respondents regarding homosexuality as always or mostly wrong and by 2013, only around 20% to 35% of respondents in each party felt the same way. Liberal Democrat respondents tended to be less likely to regard homosexuality as wrong than Labour or Conservative respondents across each survey.<ref>''British Social Attitudes'', [http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-30/personal-relationships/homosexuality.aspx Homosexuality], 2013, ''NatCen''</ref>

In 2017, 108,000 people participated in the National LGBT Survey, making it one of the biggest survey of LGBT people in the world. LGBT people were found to be less satisfied with life compared to the wider UK population, with trans satisfaction notably lower. 68% of respondents said they avoided holding hands with their same-sex partner in public. 5% of respondents had been offered [[conversion therapy]], with 2% undergoing such therapies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/722314/GEO-LGBT-Survey-Report.pdf|title=National LGBT Survey|date=July 2018|publisher=Government Equalities Office|access-date=7 July 2018}}</ref> The findings from the National LGBT Survey have been used to inform a 75-point LGBT Action Plan to address the key issues identified, including bringing forward proposals to ban conversion therapy in the UK.<ref name=":0" />
