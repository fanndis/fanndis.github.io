The motion was carried with 232 deputies voting in favour, the draft was included into the agenda, immediately put to a vote and approved with the same 232 voting in favour. Repeal of the 2012 Law "On the principles of the state language policy" was met with great disdain in [[Crimea]] and [[Southern Ukraine|Southern]] and [[Eastern Ukraine]] provoking waves of anti-government protests,<ref>[http://www.newsru.com/world/26feb2014/ukr_russian.html Новости NEWSru.com :: На Украине протестуют против начатой новыми властями борьбы с русским языком<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->]</ref> ultimately culminating with the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]].
