Allred was visible in the 2010 California Gubernatorial race, going public as the lawyer for Nicky Diaz, a former domestic worker for Republican nominee [[Meg Whitman]]. Allred contended that Whitman employed Diaz for years while knowing that Diaz was an undocumented immigrant.<ref name="go">{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/attorney-gloria-allred-promises-prove-whitman-knew-housekeeper/story?id=11765470|title=Gloria Allred Releases Social Security Letter With Husband's Writing On It - ABC News|publisher=abcnews.go.com|access-date=2015-04-13|date=October 2010}}</ref>

On April 27, 2011, Allred appeared at a press conference with the family of Justin Quinn, who was allegedly threatened at a [[San Francisco Giants]] baseball game by [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] coach [[Roger McDowell]]. Quinn had objected to McDowell's uttering of [[homophobia|homophobic]] slurs and use of a baseball bat to simulate a sex act in the presence of his daughters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/28/BALF1J8UPH.DTL |date=28 April 2011 |last=Bulwa |first=Demian |title=Atlanta Braves coach apologizes for profane slurs |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/05/01/BA411J9S1D.DTL |date=1 May 2011 |first1=Phillip |last1=Matier |first2=Andrew |last2=Ross |title=Roger McDowell rant: Allred hits one out of park |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>

On October 18, 2011, Allred won court approval to represent nine former middle-aged cocktail waitresses who were fired from their jobs at [[Resorts Casino Hotel]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] after they "did not look good enough" in new uniforms modeled after 1920s-era [[Flapper]] outfits. Resorts had sought to bar Allred from the discrimination lawsuit, arguing in court papers that her "flamboyant and headline-grabbing antics" would add nothing to the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/press/atlantic_city/celebrity-attorney-gloria-allred-wins-fight-to-represent-former-resorts/article_12d4b58e-ff70-11e0-a64a-001cc4c03286.html |title=Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred wins fight to represent former Resorts cocktail servers |work=[[Press of Atlantic City]] |last=Wittkowski |first=Donald |date=26 Oct 2011 |access-date=2011-11-07}}</ref>

On March 9, 2012, Allred called for an investigation into whether radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]] should be prosecuted in Florida under a 19th-century law against "maliciously imputing to [any woman] a want of chastity" for [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy|derogatory remarks he made]] regarding [[Sandra Fluke]], who testified before House Democrats to advocate for free birth control. Allred commented: "Mr. Limbaugh targeted his attack on a young law student who was simply exercised [sic] her free speech and her right to testify before congress on a very important issue to millions of American women and he vilified her. ... He needs to face the consequences of his conduct in every way that is meaningful." Allred did not represent Fluke or have contact with her at the time of her remarks nor did the prosecutor's office respond to request for comment.<ref>Lee, MJ.

Lien ran over Mieses with his SUV while Lien was being surrounded and threatened by Mieses and his motorcycle gang on Manhattan's West Side Highway. Fellow bikers later caught up with Lien and assaulted him. Allred told the press that Mieses, who suffered spinal injuries and two broken legs, was an "innocent victim" who was trying to "defuse the situation".<ref>{{cite news|title=Injured Biker's Wife and Gloria Allred Say He Is 'Innocent Victim'|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/injured-bikers-wife-gloria-allred-innocent-victim/story?id=20467895|newspaper=ABC news|date=October 4, 2013}}</ref>

In 2017, former Allred client [[Kyle Hunter]] filed official complaints with both the [[State Bar of California]] and the [[District of Columbia Bar]], alleging conflict of interest because Allred was in negotiations with [[CBS]] at the same time she was representing him in a lawsuit against CBS for employment discrimination.<ref name="KyleHunter">

In 2019, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporters [[Jodi Kantor]] and [[Megan Twohey]] discussed the ways in which Allred and her firm profited from non-disclosure agreements they negotiated, which silenced victims of sexual misconduct through "secret settlements" and  "bur[ied] allegations of sexual harassment and assault." Allred's practice negotiated non-disclosures for a victim of [[Harvey Weinstein]], and victims of [[Fox News]] host [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O’Reilly]] and the Olympics gymnastics doctor [[Larry Nassar]]. Allred was vocal in her dislike of a proposed 2017 California bill that would ban non-disclosure clauses in agreements that silence victims of sexual harassment or assault.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/books/review/she-said-jodi-kantor-megan-twohey.html|title='She Said' Recounts How Two Times Reporters Broke the Harvey Weinstein Story|last=Faludi|first=Susan|date=2019-09-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement|date=September 10, 2019|isbn=978-0525560340|last1=Kantor|first1=Jodi|last2=Twohey|first2=Megan}}</ref>
