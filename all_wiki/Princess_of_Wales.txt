'''Princess of Wales''' ({{lang-cy|Tywysoges Cymru}}) is a [[British people|British]] [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] held by the wife of the [[Prince of Wales]], who is, since the 14th century, the [[heir apparent]] of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|English or British monarch]]. The first acknowledged title holder was Eleanor de Montfort, wife of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]. It has subsequently been used by wives of post-conquest princes of Wales.

The title is currently held by [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]] (the former Camilla Parker Bowles), second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], since their marriage on 9 April 2005.<ref name=parliament>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050404/text/50404w42.htm |title=House of Commons – Royal Marriage |publisher=parliament.uk |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> She does not use the title<ref name=parliament/> in due respect to the previous holder, Charles's first wife [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], who [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|died in 1997]]. Instead, she uses the title of [[Duchess of Cornwall]], the feminine form of her husband's highest-ranking [[subsidiary title]].

==Status of the title==
The Princess of Wales is not a [[princess]] in her own right. There have been some Princesses of Wales who were addressed as such: for example, [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary of Teck]] were called "Princess Alexandra" and "Princess Victoria Mary", respectively. However, that was because they were already princesses when they married. Diana, Princess of Wales, was commonly called "Princess Diana" following her marriage to the Prince of Wales, but this was incorrect because she was not a princess in her own right.

Although not granted the title in her own right, the future [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] was, during her youth, invested by her father, [[King Henry VIII]], with many of the rights and properties traditionally given to the Prince of Wales, including use of the official seal of Wales for correspondence. For most of her childhood, Mary was her father's only legitimate heir, and for this reason, she was often referred to as "the Princess of Wales", although Henry never formally created her as such. For example, Spanish scholar [[Juan Luis Vives]] dedicated his ''Satellitium Animi'' to "''Dominæ Mariæ Cambriæ Principi, Henrici Octavi Angliæ Regis Filiæ''".<ref>"To the Lady Mary, Prince of Wales, Daughter of Henry VIII, King of England" [https://books.google.com/books?id=L64RAAAAYAAJ&pg=1#PPA161,M1]</ref>

==Other titles of the Princess of Wales==
The Princess of Wales, by virtue of her marriage to the Prince of Wales, takes on the feminine equivalent of her husband's titles. Thus, upon marriage, the wife of the Prince of Wales assumes the styles and titles of Princess of Wales, [[Duchess of Cornwall]], [[Duchess of Rothesay]], and [[Earl of Chester|Countess of Chester]].

The Princess of Wales is known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, and the Prince of Wales is known as the [[Duke of Rothesay]] there, the dukedom being the title historically associated with the heir to the Scottish throne. She is known as the Duchess of Cornwall in the far south west of England, and as the Countess of Chester in Cheshire.

==Native princesses of Wales==
{{main|Wales in the High Middle Ages}}
Several consorts of Welsh princes of Wales were theoretically princesses of Wales while their husbands were in power. [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]'s consort, [[Joan, Lady of Wales]], used that title in the 1230s; [[Isabella de Braose]] and [[Elizabeth Ferrers]] were likewise married to princes of Wales, but it is not known if they assumed a title in light of their husbands' status.

The only consort of a Welsh prince definitively shown to have used the title was [[Eleanor de Montfort]], the English bride of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], the last native Prince of Wales. Their only child was [[Gwenllian of Wales|Gwenllian]], who was taken prisoner as an infant following her father's death. Gwenllian was the last native Welsh princess to actually be described as Princess of Wales, which was not an official title; [[Edward I]] had her raised in [[Sempringham Priory]] in Lincolnshire, far from where any Welsh rebels could find her, and once appealed to the Pope to increase funds to the priory by writing that "...herein is kept the Princess of Wales, whom we have to maintain."{{cn|date=December 2019}}

==Princesses of Wales==
''This is a list of Princesses of Wales.''<ref>[[Cecily Neville]], wife of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], is omitted from this list. Although her husband [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] was briefly given various titles, including Prince of Wales, by an Act of Parliament as part of his arrangement to succeed [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] as king instead of Henry's own son, he is not generally recognised as such and is not mentioned in any published summary of the topic.</ref>
