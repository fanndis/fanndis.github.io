In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two [[lead vocalist]]s and youngest member of [[NSYNC]], which eventually became one of the [[best-selling]] [[boy band]]s of all time. Timberlake won two [[Grammy Award]]s for his [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-focused debut solo album ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002) and its single "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]". Another single from the album, "[[Rock Your Body]]", was also successful. 

His critically acclaimed sophomore album ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' (2006), characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and produced the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number-one singles "[[SexyBack]]", "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]", and "[[What Goes Around... Comes Around]]". Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies, and he continued producing records and collaborating with other artists. From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus. He held starring roles in the films ''[[The Social Network]]'', ''[[Bad Teacher]]'', ''[[Friends with Benefits (film)|Friends with Benefits]]'', and ''[[In Time]]''.

Timberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' and ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2]]'', exploring [[neo soul]] styles, partly inspired by the expansive [[song structure]]s of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the [[List of best-selling albums by year in the United States|best-selling album of the year]] with the largest sales week in the US, and spawned the top-three singles "[[Suit & Tie]]" and "[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]", while the latter produced the top-ten song "[[Not a Bad Thing]]". For [[List of Justin Timberlake live performances|his live performances]], including the [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour|eponymous concert tour]] for the albums, he began performing with his band The Tennessee Kids, composed by instrumentalists and dancers.

His fifth studio album ''[[Man of the Woods]]'' (2018) became his fourth number-one album in the US. Supported by the two top ten singles, "[[Filthy (song)|Filthy]]" and "[[Say Something (Justin Timberlake song)|Say Something]]", it concluded 2018 as the sixth best-selling album of the year.<ref name="auto">{{cite magazine |last1=Caulfield |first1=Keith |title=Drake's 'Scorpion' Is Nielsen Music's Top Album Of 2018 in U.S., 'God's Plan' Most-Streamed Song |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8492663/nielsen-music-top-album-2018-drake-scorpion |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=January 14, 2019 |date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> In May 2019, Timberlake received an honorary [[Doctorate]] from [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref name="DeSantis">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/justin-timberlake-receives-honorary-doctorate-berklee/|title=Justin Timberlake Receives Honorary Doctorate from Berklee College of Music|first=Rachel|last=DeSantis|date=May 13, 2019|accessdate=August 24, 2020|work=People}}</ref>

In late 1999, Timberlake appeared in the [[Disney Channel]] movie ''[[Model Behavior]]''. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model.

|quote =[Michael] called me on the phone and said that he wanted to cut the record ("Gone"), but he wanted it to be a duet between himself and I. And I said, 'Well ... we've already cut the song as an 'N Sync record. Could we do, like, 'N Sync featuring Michael Jackson', or 'Michael Jackson featuring 'N Sync'?
