'''Diana, Princess of Wales''' (born '''Diana Frances Spencer'''; 1 July 1961&nbsp;– 31 August 1997), was a member of the [[British royal family]]. She was the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], the [[heir apparent]] to the British throne, and was the mother of [[Prince William]] and [[Prince Harry]]. Diana's activism and glamour made her an international icon and earned her an enduring popularity as well as an unprecedented public scrutiny, exacerbated by her tumultuous private life.

Diana was born into the [[British nobility]] and grew up close to the royal family on their [[Sandringham estate]]. The youngest daughter of [[John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer]], and [[Frances Shand Kydd]], she was strongly affected by their divorce in 1967. She did not distinguish herself academically, but was talented in music, dance, and sports. In 1978, she moved to London, where she lived with flatmates and took on various low-paying jobs.

Diana came to prominence in 1981 upon her engagement to Prince Charles, the eldest son of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], after a brief courtship. [[Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer|Their wedding]] took place at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1981 and made her [[Princess of Wales]], a role in which she was enthusiastically received by the public. The couple had two sons, the princes William and Harry, who were then second and third in the [[line of succession to the British throne]]. Diana's marriage to Charles, however, suffered due to their incompatibility and extramarital affairs. They separated in 1992, soon after the breakdown of their relationship became public knowledge. The details of their marital difficulties became increasingly publicised, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1996.

As Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions across the [[Commonwealth realms]]. She was celebrated in the media for her unconventional approach to charity work. Her patronages initially centred on children and youth but she later became known for her involvement with [[AIDS]] patients and campaign for the removal of landmines. She also raised awareness and advocated ways to help people affected with cancer and mental illness. As princess, Diana was initially noted for her shyness, but her charisma and friendliness endeared her to the public and helped her reputation survive the acrimonious collapse of her marriage. Considered to be very photogenic, she was a leader of fashion in the 1980s and 1990s. Media attention and public mourning were extensive after [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in a car crash]] in a Paris tunnel in 1997 and subsequent [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|televised funeral]]. Her legacy has had a deep impact on the royal family and British society.

==Early life==

After she became Princess of Wales, Diana automatically acquired rank as the third-highest female in the [[British order of precedence]] (after the Queen and the Queen Mother), and was fifth or sixth in the [[orders of precedence]] of her other realms, following the Queen, the relevant [[viceroy]], the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother, and the Prince of Wales.

===Problems and separation===

Five years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference of almost 13 years became visible and damaging.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=174}} Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend [[Camilla Parker Bowles]], and Diana later began one with Major [[James Hewitt]], the family's former riding instructor.

====Subject of government surveillance====
In 1999, after the submission of a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request filed by the Internet news service ''apbonline.com'', it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the [[National Security Agency]] until her death, and the organisation kept a [[top secret]] file on her containing more than 1,000 pages.<ref name="wapodiana">{{cite news|first=Vernon|last=Loeb|title=NSA Admits to Spying on Princess Diana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/dec98/diana12.htm|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=29 January 2018|date=12 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109051540/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/dec98/diana12.htm|archive-date=9 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="nsa-guardian">{{cite news|title=Top secret US files could hold clues to death of Diana|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/11/monarchy.jamiedoward|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 January 2004|access-date=29 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108062410/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/11/monarchy.jamiedoward|archive-date=8 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of [[national security]] concerns.<ref name="wapodiana"/> The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a "target of [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure."<ref name="wapodiana"/> Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]]—the NSA has refused to release the documents.<ref name="nsa-guardian"/>

In 2008, Ken Wharfe, a former bodyguard of Diana, claimed that her scandalous conversations with James Gilbey (commonly referred to as the [[Squidgygate]]) were in fact recorded by the [[GCHQ]], which intentionally released them on a "loop".<ref name="gchqdiana">{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Allen|title=Diana's Squidgygate tapes 'leaked by GCHQ'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575117/Dianas-Squidgygate-tapes-leaked-by-GCHQ.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=29 January 2018|date=9 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903193451/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575117/Dianas-Squidgygate-tapes-leaked-by-GCHQ.html|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> People close to Diana believed the action was intended to defame her.<ref name="gchqdiana"/> Wharfe said Diana herself believed that members of the royal family were all being monitored, though he also stated that the main reason for it could be the potential threats of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]].<ref name="gchqdiana"/>

On the first anniversary of Diana's death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/161493.stm|title=Diana: the people pay tribute|publisher=BBC|date=31 August 1998|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/161283.stm|title=Prayers for Diana|publisher=30 August 1998|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref> The royal family and the Prime Minister and his family went to [[Crathie Kirk]] for private prayers, while Diana's family held a private memorial service at Althorp.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/161464.stm|title=Princes say thank you|publisher=BBC|date=31 August 1998|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/161058.stm|title=Commemorating Diana|publisher=BBC|date=30 August 1998|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref> All [[flags at Buckingham Palace]] and other royal residences were flown at [[half-mast]] on the Queen's orders.<ref name="BBC-flags">{{cite news|title=Flags at half mast for Diana|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/138289.stm|date=23 July 1998|work=BBC News|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> The [[Union Jack]] was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace "even on the death of a monarch".<ref name="BBC-flags"/> Since 1997, however, the flag has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law: Text with Materials|author=David Pollard, Neil|page=22|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-199-28637-9}}</ref>

There were two memorials inside [[Harrods]] department store, commissioned by Dodi Fayed's father, who owned the store from 1985 to 2010.

Before and after her death, Diana has been depicted in [[contemporary art]].

In July 1999, [[Tracey Emin]] created a number of monoprint drawings featuring textual references about Diana's public and private life for ''Temple of Diana'', a themed exhibition at The Blue Gallery, London.

===Titles and styles===
[[File:Royal Monogram of Princess Diana of Wales.svg|thumb|upright|[[Royal monogram]]]]
* 1 July 1961&nbsp;– 9 June 1975: The Honourable Diana Frances Spencer
* 9 June 1975&nbsp;– 29 July 1981: Lady Diana Frances Spencer
* 29 July 1981&nbsp;– 28 August 1996: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales

* 28 August 1996&nbsp;– 31 August 1997: Diana, Princess of Wales

Posthumously, as in life, she is most popularly referred to as "Princess Diana", a title not formally correct and one she never held.{{efn|Often used by the public and media, the style "Princess Diana" is incorrect.
