'''UK Uncut''' was a network of United Kingdom-based [[Protest|protest groups]] established in October 2010 to protest against cuts to public services and [[tax avoidance]] in the UK.<ref name="Mark Townsend">{{cite news|author=Mark Townsend |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/19/uk-uncut-tax-avoidance-protests |title=High street stores hit in day of action over corporate tax avoidance |publisher=The Observer |date=19 December 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shackleton|first=Len|title=UK Uncut is wrong about tax avoidance|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/uk-uncut-is-wrong-about-tax-avoidance|publisher=IEA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Support high street protests on Saturday|url=http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/pcs_comment/index.cfm/id/328CB306-CC6F-49FB-AD50E7A095A95664|publisher=Public and Commercial Services Union}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hyde|first=John|title=Canary Wharf security expect peaceful UK Uncut protest|url=http://www.docklands24.co.uk/news/canary_wharf_security_expect_peaceful_uk_uncut_protest_1_855065|newspaper=The Docklands|date=5 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Uncut activists protest at bank for low tax payment|url=http://www.durhamtimes.co.uk/news/8865806.Uncut_activists_protest_at_bank_for_low_tax_payment/|date=21 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/|title=UK Uncut |publisher=UK Uncut |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> Various sources have described the group as [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] in its political orientation.<ref>{{cite news|last=May|first=Christian|title=UK Uncut to Pieces|url=http://www.thecommentator.com/index.php/article/39/uk_uncut_to_pieces|newspaper=The Commentator|date=5 April 2011}}</ref><ref name="TIME">{{cite news|last=Lee Adams|first=William|title=TIME|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2084083_2084082_2084343,00.html|newspaper=TIME|date=29 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hari|first=Johann|title=How to Build a Progressive Tea Party|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/158282/how-build-progressive-tea-party?page=full|date=21 February 2011}}</ref>

==History==
The idea of UK Uncut originated in October 2010 with a group of ten activists in a north London pub who claimed that clamping down on tax avoidance would be a credible alternative to public sector spending cuts. ''[[Private Eye]]'' had recently published an article alleging that [[Vodafone]] had reached a highly favourable settlement of a long-standing tax dispute with [[HM Revenue and Customs]] so they organised a protest against a store on [[Oxford Street]]. Protesters met at Piccadilly and successfully closed the store.<ref>{{cite news|author=Paul Lewis, Adam Gabbatt, Matthew Taylor and Simon Jeffery |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/03/uk-uncut-protests-undercover-police |title=UK Uncut protesters spied upon by undercover police |publisher=The Guardian |date=3 December 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

==Tactics and targets==
The group uses [[direct action]] to disrupt the business of high street stores and banks that they believe have a connection with tax avoidance.<ref name="Mark Townsend"/> Actions are organised independently by local UK Uncut groups and promoted through the UK Uncut website.

[[Vodafone]] was targeted after ''[[Private Eye]]'' alleged that a deal they made with [[HM Revenue and Customs]] substantially reduced the amount of back taxes that they had to pay. Private Eye alleged that Vodafone were originally found liable for £6 billion, but negotiated the amount to be paid down to under £2 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=hp_sauce&issue=1276|title=Vodafone-a-Friend at HMRC|publisher=Private Eye|accessdate=29 December 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vKwilM40?url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=hp_sauce&issue=1276|archive-date=29 December 2010}}</ref> However, the National Audit Office said that the settlement represented reasonable value for the British taxpayer.<ref name="nao.org.uk">[http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/1213/settling_large_tax_disputes.aspx Settling large tax disputes |National Audit Office]. Nao.org.uk (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.</ref>

The [[Arcadia Group]]'s shops including [[Topshop]], [[British Home Stores|BHS]], and [[Burton (clothing)|Burton]] have been targeted as the group is owned by Tina Green, the wife of Sir Phillip Green. Tina Green is a resident of [[Monaco]] and was able to receive a dividend of £1.2bn from the group free of UK [[income tax]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12027256|title=Tax protesters step up protest against stores|date=18 December 2010|website=BBC News}}</ref>

[[Boots UK|Boots]] was targeted on 30 January 2011 as the protesters claimed it avoided UK tax by being registered in Switzerland. Three people needed hospital treatment after police used [[CS spray]] when attempting to arrest a protester.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Matthew Taylor  |author2=Jonathan Paige  |name-list-style=amp |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/30/police-cs-spray-tax-protesters |title=Police use CS spray on tax protesters |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8291528/Police-use-CS-gas-on-tax-protesters.html |title=Police use CS gas on tax protesters |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-12318896 |title=BBC News - CS spray used on UK Uncut protest |publisher=BBC News |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref>

[[Fortnum & Mason]] was targeted during [[2011 anti-cuts protest in London|the 26 March 2011 anti-cuts protests]]. UK Uncut claimed that the parent company, [[Wittington Investments]] was "guilty of tax avoidance".<ref name="UK Uncut press release">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/press-release-uk-uncut-occupy-tax-dodgers-fortnum-and-mason |title=Cuts protesters claim police tricked them into mass arrest |publisher=Ukuncut.org.uk |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> This took the form of a mass [[sit-in]].

In November 2011, the legal arm of UK Uncut took HM Revenue & Customs to court. HMRC had been accused of failing to provide substantial reasons for not collecting billions of pounds in tax revenue.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tom Nicolson |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/270046/20111220/uk-uncut-takes-hmrc-court.htm |title=UK Uncut Takes HMRC to Court |publisher=International Business Times UK |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref>

HMRC are unable to comment on specific taxpayers' tax affairs. Instead, the National Audit Office (NAO) were asked to review the settlements in question, one being Vodafone, as mentioned above. The NAO found that "the settlements reached by HMRC in these five cases were all reasonable".<ref name="nao.org.uk"/>

===Banks===
Through meetings on Twitter at the end of January it was decided that the next UK Uncut targets would be banks that were alleged to have caused the financial crisis and had been bailed out by the government with billions of pounds. UK Uncut called for people to stage "bail-ins" to turn banks into things that UK Uncut perceived as being threatened by the cuts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/targets/banks |title=Targets - Banks |publisher=UK Uncut |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

[[HSBC]] have also been accused of avoiding £2 billion worth of tax by ''Private Eye'' magazine by using a complicated system of channeling profits through the Netherlands,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=in_the_back&issue=1275|title=Going Dutch|publisher=Private Eye|date=November 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vKvbZkBg?url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=in_the_back&issue=1275|archive-date=29 December 2010}}</ref>

On 19 February 2011, [[Barclays]] was targeted. The date was arranged to coincide with their bonus announcements. It was also alleged that Barclays was only paying 1% corporation tax in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8335415/Uncut-protesters-target-Barclays-bank.html |title=Uncut protesters target Barclays bank |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

On 26 February, a day of action was called against the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and their subsidiary [[NatWest]]. The protest was arranged to coincide with the banks' bonus announcements. Once again protestors turned bank branches into services that they considered were threatened by the cuts.<ref>{{cite news|author=Amelia Hill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/27/uk-uncut-rbs-protests-us |title=UK Uncut turns ire on RBS as protests spread to US |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 February 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
On 9 October 2011, 2,000 health workers and activists took part in a sit-down protest on [[Westminster Bridge]] organised by UK Uncut in opposition to the proposed [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Bill]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/09/anti-nhs-reforms-protest-block-bridge?newsfeed=true | work=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Taylor | title=Protesters against NHS reforms occupy Westminster Bridge | date=9 October 2011}}</ref>

The group has also targeted [[Atos]], an IT company whose healthcare division operates a program for the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] to assess workers claiming [[disability benefits]] to see if they are "incapable" of work. Critics have felt that its program has lacked integrity and that its real goal is to divert funding from the disabled due to a lowered budget.{{cn|date=July 2020}} The group also felt that it was inappropriate for Atos to sponsor the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London, a complementary event to the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] for the disabled given how its operation of the program has impacted the lives of many disabled workers through the denial of benefits. UK Uncut held a week of protests dubbed "The Atos Games" during the last week of August to coincide with the start of the Paralympics ending with a joint demonstration with [[Disabled People Against Cuts]] on 31 August outside the London headquarters of Atos and the Department for Work and Pensions.<ref name=guardian-atos-3>{{cite news|title=Paralympic sponsor Atos hit by protests|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/paralympic-sponsor-atos-hit-protests?newsfeed=true|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2012|first=Esther|last=Addley|date=31 August 2012}}</ref>

UK Uncut protesters, who were unimpressed by [[Starbucks]]' offer to pay £20 million corporation tax in the next two years, took part in protests in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Starbucks hit by UK Uncut protests as tax row boils over|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/08/starbucks-uk-stores-protests-tax|accessdate=8 December 2012|newspaper=Guardian|date=8 December 2012|first1=Roxanne|last1=Escobales|first2=Tracy|last2=McVeigh}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20624857 |title=BBC News - Starbucks agrees to pay more corporation tax |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 6 December 2012|accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>
