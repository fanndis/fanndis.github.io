Dowd's columns have been described as letters to her mother, whom friends credit as "the source, the fountain of Maureen's humor and her Irish sensibilities and her intellectual take."<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/> Dowd herself has said, "She is in my head in the sense that I want to inform and amuse the reader."<ref name="freshdialogues.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/04/03/maureen-dowd-talks-green/|title=Maureen Dowd talks green – from Emerald Isle to Eco-Issues|website=freshdialogues.com}}</ref> Dowd's columns are distinguished by an acerbic, often [[polemical]] writing style.<ref name="stiletto">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/04/AR2005110401996.html | title=Sex &amp; the Single Stiletto | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | author-link=Howard Kurtz | date=2005-10-05 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | pages=C01 | access-date=2007-08-08}}</ref> Her columns display a critical and irreverent attitude towards powerful, mostly political, figures such as former [[president of the United States|Presidents]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Dowd also tends to refer to her subjects by nicknames. For example, she has often referred to Bush as "W." and former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] as "Big Time".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/08/opinion/liberties-west-wing-chaperone.html | title=Liberties; West Wing Chaperone | first=Maureen | last=Dowd | date=2000-10-08 | website=[[The New York Times]] | access-date=2009-05-24}}</ref>  She has called former President [[Barack Obama]] "[[Spock]]"<ref name="spock">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/opinion/30dowd.html | title=As the Nation's Pulse Races, Obama Can't Seem to Find His | last=Dowd | first=Maureen | date=December 30, 2009 | work=[[The New York Times]] | pages=A27 | access-date=January 3, 2010 }}</ref> and "Barry". Dowd's interest in candidates' personalities earned her criticism early in her career: "She focuses too much on the person but not enough on policy."<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/>

Dowd, who perceives her columns to be an exploration of politics, Hollywood, and gender-related topics, often uses popular culture to support and metaphorically enhance her political commentary.<ref name="stiletto" /> In a ''Times'' video debate, she said of the [[North Korean government]], "... you could look at a movie like ''[[Mean Girls]]'' and figure out the way these North Koreans are reacting; you know it's like high school girls with nuclear weapons—they just want some attention from us, you know?"<ref>{{cite video | people=[[David Brooks (journalist)|Brooks, David]]; Dowd, Maureen; [[Frank Rich|Rich, Frank]] (speakers) | url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2006/07/19/opinion/1194817112243/2-bushs-circle-of-trust.html | title=U.S. Politics: What's Next?<!-- see beginning of first video in the series -->—2: Bush's Circle of Trust | format=[[Flash Video]] | website=The New York Times | time=5:05 | date=2006-07-19 | access-date=2009-05-19 }}</ref>

Dowd's columns have also been described as often being political cartoons that capture a caricatured view of the current political landscape with precision and exaggeration.<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/> For example, in the run-up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] Dowd wrote that [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate "[[Al Gore]] is so feminized and diversified and [[ecology|ecologically]] correct that he's practically [[lactation|lactating]],"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2007/11/6238_maureen_down_re.html | title=Maureen Dowd Rehashes the "Presidential Candidate X is a Wuss" Construct | last=Stein | first=Jonathan | work=MoJo (blog) | publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones and the Foundation for National Progress]] | date=2007-11-19 | access-date=2009-05-19 }}</ref> while referring to the Democratic party as the "mommy party".<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/> In a Fresh Dialogues interview years later she said, "I was just teasing him a little bit because he was so earnest and he could be a little righteous and self important.
