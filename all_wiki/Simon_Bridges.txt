===Election to Parliament: 2008–2011===
In 2008 the incumbent National MP for Tauranga Bob Clarkson announced his intention not to stand for re-election. Bridges then announced his candidacy for the party's selection to stand in the electorate, and he resigned from his roles within the party. In June 2008 Bridges was selected as the party's candidate for the Tauranga electorate.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stage set for tussle in Tauranga |publisher=ONE News |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425823/1846203 |date=14 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520121211/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425823/1846203 |archive-date=20 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was placed at No. 51 on National's [[party list]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Humer |first=Tim |title=Newcomers on the stage and a veteran Act |work=Sunday Star Times|date=9 November 2008}}</ref> Several opinion polls during the campaign suggested Bridges was likely to win the seat by a large margin.<ref>{{cite news |title=Peters' popularity wanes in latest poll |publisher=ONE News |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/413551/1994320 |date=10 August 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520121622/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/413551/1994320 |archive-date=20 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=NZPA |title=Poll shows Winston Peters' chances in Tauranga near hopeless |publisher=3 News |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Poll-shows-Winston-Peters-chances-in-Tauranga-near-hopeless/tabid/419/articleID/78148/Default.aspx?ArticleID=78148 |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521015227/http://www.3news.co.nz/Poll-shows-Winston-Peters-chances-in-Tauranga-near-hopeless/tabid/419/articleID/78148/Default.aspx?ArticleID=78148 |archive-date=21 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bridges won the seat with a majority of 11,742 votes, against a field of 11 candidates, including [[New Zealand First]] leader [[Winston Peters]]. As New Zealand First did not meet the 5% party vote threshold nationally, it was reliant on at least one candidate winning an electorate seat to be represented in Parliament, and Winston Peters' Tauranga candidacy had been its best chance that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/electorate-51.html|title=Official Count Results – Tauranga|publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry of Justice]]|accessdate=25 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522140439/http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/electorate-51.html|archive-date=22 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

A by-election was held in the Northland electorate on 28 March 2015.

He withdrew from the election process when it became clear Paula Bennett had the numbers to win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/87427846/paula-bennett-has-won-the-battle-for-deputy-prime-minister-and-will-team-up-with-bill-english|title=Paula Bennett has won the battle for deputy Prime Minister and will team up with Bill English|website=Stuff|access-date=10 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230082301/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/87427846/paula-bennett-has-won-the-battle-for-deputy-prime-minister-and-will-team-up-with-bill-english|archive-date=30 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

New Prime Minister [[Bill English]] made changes to the Cabinet effective 20 December 2016, and Bridges became Minister for Economic Development, Minister for Communications, and Associate Minister of Finance. He retained his role as Minister of Transport and was no longer Minister of Energy and Resources, and Associate Minister of Justice, and Climate Change Issues.<ref name="parliament.nz"/>

====MP expenses saga====
On 13 August 2018 [[Newshub]] reported that Bridges had spent $113,000 in taxpayer money on limousines and hotels between April and June 2018. (His expenses were higher than normal because he was travelling around New Zealand on a 'getting to know Simon' road-show.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}) Information on Bridges' spending emerged as a result of a leak of MPs' expenses.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Brien |first1=Tova |title=Simon Bridges' roadshow cash splash: $113k in taxpayer money on limos and hotels |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/08/simon-bridges-road-show-cash-splash-more-than-100-000-taxpayer-money-on-limos-and-hotels.html |accessdate=28 August 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=13 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813143246/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/08/simon-bridges-road-show-cash-splash-more-than-100-000-taxpayer-money-on-limos-and-hotels.html |archive-date=13 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=MPs' spending expenses revealed |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/364227/mps-spending-expenses-revealed |accessdate=28 August 2018 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=16 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829035032/https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/364227/mps-spending-expenses-revealed |archive-date=29 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In response, the National Party demanded an independent inquiry into the source of the leak.

At a press conference on 15 October 2018 Bridges implied that National MP [[Jami-Lee Ross]] had leaked his (Bridges') expenses. Bridges cited a [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] report which strongly suggested that Ross had been the leaker, based on text messages sent to a Radio New Zealand reporter, the Speaker of the House, and a police officer in the [[Botany (New Zealand electorate)|Botany]] electorate during the leak. Bridges also rejected claims made by Ross in a series of tweets alleging that Bridges had been trying to pin the blame on him for questioning his leadership decisions. Bridges also indicated that National would seek disciplinary action against Ross.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Bennett |first1= Lucy |last2= Walls |first2= Jason |title= National MP Jami-Lee Ross identified as Simon Bridges' expenses leaker |url= https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12142614 |accessdate= 15 October 2018 |work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |date= 15 October 2018 |quote= National leader Bridges called a press conference for 1&nbsp;pm and told reporters an inquiry by PwC had concluded Ross was the person who leaked the information. |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181015114426/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12142614 |archive-date= 15 October 2018 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Watkins |first1=Tracy |title=National Party leader Simon Bridges points finger at Jami-Lee Ross in expenses leak inquiry |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/107848792/National-Party-leader-Simon-Bridges-points-finger-at-Jami-Lee-Ross-in-expenses-leak-inquiry |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=15 October 2018 |quote=National may move to suspend MP Jami-Lee Ross after an inquiry into who leaked leader Simon Bridges expenses' found he was the most likely culprit. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015080300/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/107848792/National-Party-leader-Simon-Bridges-points-finger-at-Jami-Lee-Ross-in-expenses-leak-inquiry |archive-date=15 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 16 October 2018, Ross alleged that Bridges had violated election law several times, including accepting an illegal NZ$100,000 donation in May 2018, which Ross claimed that Bridges had told him to cover up. The donation came from a businessman, Yikun Zhang, connected to the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/New-Zealand-scandal-renews-fears-of-China-s-United-Front-influence|title= New Zealand scandal renews fears of China's 'United Front' influence|last= Meshino|first= Katsuhiko|date= 12 November 2018|website= Nikkei Asian Review|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181112073118/https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/New-Zealand-scandal-renews-fears-of-China-s-United-Front-influence|archive-date= 12 November 2018|access-date= 10 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2018/10/16/279660?slug=zhang-yikun-and-the-alleged-100k-donation|title= Zhang Yikun and the alleged $100k donation|last= Walters|first= Laura|date= 17 October 2018|website= Newsroom|access-date= 10 June 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181017193033/https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2018/10/16/279660?slug=zhang-yikun-and-the-alleged-100k-donation|archive-date= 17 October 2018|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://sinopsis.cz/en/new-zealand-united-frontlings-bearing-gifts/|title= New Zealand: United Frontlings bearing gifts|last= Lulu|first= Jichang|date= 16 November 2018|website= Sinopsis|access-date= 18 January 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191119233158/https://sinopsis.cz/en/new-zealand-united-frontlings-bearing-gifts/|archive-date= 19 November 2019|url-status= live}}</ref> In addition, Ross alleged that Bridges and Deputy Leader Paula Bennett had tried to smear him with allegations that he had sexually harassed several women.

On 29 January 2020, the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] filed criminal charges against four people in relation to an alleged NZ$100,000 donation paid into a National Party electorate bank account.

====2020 COVID-19 pandemic====
On 24 March, it was reported that Simon Bridges would lead a cross-party select committee that would scrutinise the Government's response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand]]. The cross-party [[Epidemic Response Committee]] would run in the absence of the [[New Zealand Parliament]], which would adjourn for five weeks on 25 March.
