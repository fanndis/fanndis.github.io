'''Obesity in the United States''' is a major health issue resulting in numerous diseases, specifically increased risk of certain types of [[cancer]], [[coronary artery disease]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[stroke]], as well as significant increases in early mortality and economic costs.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] defines an adult (a person aged 20 years or greater) with a [[body mass index]] (BMI) of 30 or greater as obese and an adult with a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 as overweight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html|access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref> Obesity in adults is divided into three categories. Adults with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 have class 1 obesity; adults with a BMI of 35 to 39.9 have class 2 obesity; adults with a BMI of 40 or greater have class 3 obesity, which is also known as extreme or severe obesity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html|access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref> Children (persons aged 2 to 19 years) with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile of children of the same age and sex are defined as obese, and children with a BMI at or above the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percentile are defined as overweight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/defining.html|website=CDC|access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref>

Compared to non-obese Americans, obese Americans incur an average of $1,429 more in medical expenses annually, and the obese American population spends approximately $147&nbsp;billion per year in added medical expenses.

The obesity rate has steadily increased since the initial 1962 recording of 23%.

==Epidemiology==
{{Main|Epidemiology of obesity}}
Obesity is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] health problem. It is one of the biggest factors for [[Diabetes mellitus|type II diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]. It is also associated with cancer (e.g. [[colorectal cancer]]), [[osteoarthritis]], [[liver disease]], [[sleep apnea]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and other medical conditions that affect mortality and morbidity.<ref name="Rippe, Obesitiy">{{cite book |last=Rippe |first=James |title=Obesity: Prevention and Treatment |location=Boca Raton |publisher=CRC Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4398-3671-2 }}</ref>

According to NHANES data, African American and Mexican American adolescents between 12 and 19 years old are more likely to be overweight than non-Hispanic White adolescents. The prevalence is 21%, 23% and 14% respectively. Also, in a national survey of American Indian children 5–18 years old, 39 percent were found to be overweight or at risk for being overweight.<ref name="Childobe">{{cite web|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/child_obesity/|title=Childhood Obesity |access-date=2010-03-31}}</ref> As per national survey data, these trends indicate that by 2030, 86.3% of adults will be overweight or obese and 51.1% obese.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Beydoun MA, Liang L, Caballero B, Kumanyika SK | title = Will all Americans become overweight or obese? estimating the progression and cost of the US obesity epidemic | journal = Obesity | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 2323–30 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18719634 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2008.351 }}</ref>

A 2007 study found that receiving food stamps long term (24 months) was associated with a 50% increased obesity rate among female adults.<ref name="USDAfat">{{cite web|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/32855/PDF|title=The Effects of Food Stamps on Obesity|access-date=2012-06-02}}</ref>

Looking at the long-term consequences, overweight adolescents have a 70 percent chance of becoming overweight or obese adults, which increases to 80 percent if one or more parent is overweight or obese. In 2000, the total cost of obesity for children and adults in the United States was estimated to be US$117&nbsp;billion (US$61&nbsp;billion in direct medical costs). Given existing trends, this amount is projected to range from US$860.7-956.9&nbsp;billion in healthcare costs by 2030.<ref name=":1" />

Food consumption has increased over time. Annual per capita consumption of cheese was {{convert|4|lb}} in 1909; {{convert|32|lb}} in 2000; the average person consumed {{convert|389|g}} of carbohydrates daily in 1970; {{convert|490|g}} in 2000; {{convert|41|lb}} of fats and oils in 1909; {{convert|79|lb}} in 2000. In 1977, 18% of an average person's food was consumed outside the home; in 1996, this had risen to 32%.<ref>{{Cite magazine |first=Peter |last=Smith |date=August 2011 |title=Eat your veggies |journal=Sky (Delta) |pages=52–53 }}</ref>

==Contributing factors==
[[File:Adult female obesity in the United States.svg|thumb|Obesity rates of adult females, 1960–2015]]

Numerous studies have attempted to identify contributing factors for obesity in the United States. Common factors include an overconsumption of food and an insufficient amount of physical exercise. Dieting properly can lower a person's body weight, but the public often fails to correctly determine what to eat and what not to eat as well as how much or how little they should. For example, while dieting, people tend to consume more low-fat or fat-free products, even though those items can be just as damaging to the body as the items containing fat. For the contributing factor of too little exercise, only a small amount (20%) of jobs require physical activity.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |url=https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/obesity/ |title=Why are Americans Obese?|website=PublicHealth.org|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>

==Prevalence ==
The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] estimates that, for 2015–2016 in the U.S., 39.8% of adults aged 20 and over were obese (including 7.6% with severe obesity) and that another 31.8% were overweight.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_adult_15_16/obesity_adult_15_16.pdf|title=Prevalence of Overweight, Obesity, and Severe Obesity Among Adults Aged 20 and Over: United States, 1960–1962 Through 2015–2016|author=Cheryl D.

There have been similar increases seen in children and adolescents, with the prevalence of overweight in pediatric age groups nearly tripling over the same period. Approximately nine million children over six years of age are considered obese.  Several recent studies have shown that the rise in obesity in the US is slowing, possibly explained by saturation of health-oriented media.<ref name="latimes.com" />

===Age===
Historically, obesity primarily affected adults.  From the mid-1980s to 2003, obesity roughly doubled among U.S. children ages 2 to 5 and roughly tripled among young people over the age of 6, but statistics show that obesity in 2-6-year-olds has dropped, from 14.6% to 8.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-turning-discovery-into-health/childrens-health-obesity|title=Children's Health: Obesity|date=March 16, 2015|publisher=NIH}}</ref> In recent years from 2015 to 2016, U.S. adults was 39.8% (crude). Overall, the prevalence among adults aged 40–59 (42.8%) was higher than among adults aged 20–39 (35.7%). No significant difference in prevalence was seen between adults aged 60 and over (41.0%) and younger age groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db288.pdf}}</ref>

====Newborns====
Mothers who are obese and become pregnant have a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and during birth, and their newborns are at greater risk for preterm birth, birth defects, and perinatal death. There are more possible risks to children born to obese mothers than pregnant women who are not obese. Newborns are also at risk for neurodevelopmental issues. Obese women are in the position to possibly put their child at risk for compromised [[neurodevelopmental]] outcomes. It is not known the whole effect that obesity can have on the neurodevelopment of the child.

Data from [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey|NHANES]] surveys (1976–1980 and 2003–2006) show that the prevalence of obesity has increased: for children aged 2–5 years, prevalence increased from 5.0% to 12.4%; for those aged 6–11 years, prevalence increased from 6.5% to 19.6%; and for those aged 12–19 years, prevalence increased from 5.0% to 17.6%.<ref name="Over">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/index.html|title=Childhood Overweight and Obesity|website=Cdc.gov|access-date=2010-03-31}}</ref>

In 2000, approximately 39% of children (ages 6–11) and 17% of adolescents (ages 12–19) were overweight and an additional 15% of children and adolescents were at risk of becoming overweight, based on their [[Body mass index|BMI]].<ref name="Obestatistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.overweightteen.com/statistics.html|title=Obesity Statistics|website=Overweightteen.com|access-date=2010-03-31}}</ref>

Analyses of the trends in high BMI for age showed no statistically significant trend over the four time periods (1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, and 2005–2006) for either boys or girls. Overall, in 2003–2006, 11.3% of children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years were at or above the 97th percentile of the 2000 BMI-for-age [[growth charts]], 16.3% were at or above the 95th percentile, and 31.9% were at or above the 85th percentile.<ref name="JAMA">{{cite journal|author-link3=Katherine Flegal|vauthors=Ogden CL, Carroll MD, Flegal KM|date=May 2008|title=High body mass index for age among US children and adolescents, 2003-2006|journal=JAMA|volume=299|issue=20|pages=2401–5|doi=10.1001/jama.299.20.2401|pmid=18505949|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In summary, between 2003 and 2006, 11.3% of children and adolescents were obese and 16.3% were overweight. A slight increase was observed in 2007 and 2008 when the recorded data shows that 11.9% of the children between 6 and 19 years old were obese and 16.9% were overweight. The data recorded in the first survey was obtained by measuring 8,165 children over four years and the second was obtained by measuring 3,281 children.

Care should be taken in interpreting these numbers, because they are based on self-report surveys which asked individuals (or, in case of children and adolescents, their parents) to report their height and weight. Height is commonly overreported and weight underreported, sometimes resulting in significantly lower estimates. One study estimated the difference between actual and self-reported obesity as 7% among males and 13% among females as of 2002, with the tendency to increase.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ezzati M, Martin H, Skjold S, Vander Hoorn S, Murray CJ|date=May 2006|title=Trends in national and state-level obesity in the USA after correction for self-report bias: analysis of health surveys|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=99|issue=5|pages=250–7|doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.5.250|pmc=1457748|pmid=16672759}}</ref>

The long-running REGARDS study, published in the journal of ''Obesity'' in 2014, brought in individuals from the nine census regions and measured their height and weight. The data collected disagreed with the data in the CDC's phone survey used to create the following chart. REGARDS found that the  West North Central region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa), and East North Central region (Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana) were the worst in obesity numbers, not the East South Central region (Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky) as had been previously thought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regardsstudy.org/content/geographic-distribution-obesity-us-and-potential-regional-differences-misreporting-obesity|title=The Geographic Distribution of Obesity in the US and the Potential Regional Differences in Misreporting of Obesity|website=Regardsstudy.org|access-date=14 October 2017|quotation=Note: study disagrees with findings of CDC cell phone survey, and obesity prevelence by state chart}}</ref> Dr. P.H., professor in the Department of Biostatistics in the UAB School of Public Health George Howard explains that "Asking someone how much they weigh is probably the second worst question behind how much money they make," "From past research, we know that women tend to under-report their weight, and men tend to over-report their height." Howard said as far as equivalency between the self-reported and measured data sets, the East South Central region showed the least misreporting. "This suggests that people from the South come closer to telling the truth than people from other regions, perhaps because there's not the social stigma of being obese in the South as there is in other regions."<ref>{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Nicole|url=http://www.uab.edu/news/latest/item/3350-south-not-the-fattest-part-of-us-after-all-study-says|title=South not the fattest part of U.S. after all, study say|date=April 11, 2013|work=UAB News|publisher=[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]}}</ref>

===In the military===
An estimated 16% percent of active duty [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] personnel were obese in 2004, with the cost of remedial [[bariatric surgery]] for the military reaching US$15&nbsp;million in 2002. Obesity is currently the largest single cause for the discharge of uniformed personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centerforaps.com/militaryobesity.html|title=Military Not Immune From Obesity Epidemic|last=Basu|first=Sandra|date=March 25, 2004|publisher=U.S. Medicine|access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref> A financial analysis published in 2007 further showed that the treatment of diseases and disorders associated with obesity costs the military $1.1&nbsp;billion annually. Moreover, the analysis found that the increased absenteeism of obese or overweight personnel amounted to a further 658,000 work days lost per year. This lost productivity is higher than the productivity loss in the military due to high alcohol consumption which was found to be 548,000 work days. Problems associated with obesity further manifested itself in early discharge due to inability to meet weight standards. Approximately 1200 military enlistees were discharged due to this reason in 2006.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dall|first=Timothy M.|last2=Zhang|first2=Yiduo|last3=Chen|first3=Yaozhu J.|last4=Wagner|first4=Rachel C.

The rise in obesity has led to fewer citizens able to join the military and therefore more difficulty in recruitment for the armed forces. In 2005, 9&nbsp;million adults aged 17 to 24, or 27%, were too overweight to be considered for service in the military.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shalikashvili|first=John M.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/29/AR2010042903669.html|title=The new national security threat: obesity|date=30 April 2010|work=[[Washington Post]]|location=Washington, DC|page=A19}}</ref> For comparison, just 6% of military aged men in 1960 would have exceed the current weight standards of the U.S. military.

Under pressure from parents and anti-obesity advocates, many school districts moved to ban [[soft drink|sodas]], junk foods, and candy from [[vending machine]]s and cafeterias.<ref>{{cite web |title = Soda Ban Means Change at Schools |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050302399_pf.html |first1 = Mary |last1 = Otto |first2 = Lori |last2 = Aratani | work = Washington Post |date = May 4, 2006 |access-date = 2008-03-08}}</ref>  State legislators in [[California]], for example, passed laws banning the sale of machine-dispensed snacks and drinks in elementary schools in 2003, despite objections by the California-Nevada Soft Drink Association.

For two years, [[Duke University]] psychology and global health professor Gary Bennett and eight colleagues followed 365 obese patients who had already developed hypertension.

Major United States manufacturers of [[Convenience food|processed food]], aware of the possible contribution of their products to the obesity epidemic, met together and discussed the problem as early as April 8, 1999; however, a [[Proactivity|proactive strategy]] was considered and rejected. As a general rule, optimizing the amount of salt, sugar and fat in a product will improve its [[palatability]], and profitability. Reducing salt, sugar and fat, for the purpose of public health, had the potential to decrease palatability and profitability.<ref name="NYTMag022013">{{cite news|title=The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=all |access-date=March 1, 2013|work=The New York Times Magazine |date=February 20, 2013 |first=Michael |last=Moss}}</ref>

Media influence may play an important role in prevention of obesity as it has the ability to boost many of the main prevention/intervention methods used nowadays including lifestyle modification. The media is also highly influential on children and teenagers as it promotes healthy body image and sets societal goals for lifestyle improvement. Examples of media influence are support for the "Let's Move!" campaign and the MyPlate program initiated by Michelle Obama, and the NFL's Play60 campaign.
