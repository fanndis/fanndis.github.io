<!--Overview of discipline:-->'''Psychology''' is the [[science]] of [[mind]] and [[behavior]]. Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, as well as [[feeling]] and [[thought]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader [[Neuroscience|neuro-scientific]] group of researchers. As a social science, it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<ref name="Fernald">Fernald LD (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7p-J4-SWuQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Psychology: Six perspectives''] (pp.12–15). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.</ref><ref name="Psychology">Hockenbury & Hockenbury. Psychology. Worth Publishers, 2010.</ref>

In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a [[psychologist]] and can be classified as a social, [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]], or [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientist]]. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and [[social behavior]], while also exploring the [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[neurobiology|biological]] processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.

<!--Subjects and methods:-->Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|subjective experiences]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], and [[personality psychology|personality]]. This extends to interaction between people, such as [[interpersonal relationship]]s, including [[psychological resilience]], [[family resilience]], and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name ="reference_name_A">Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In [[eclecticism|addition]], or in [[antipositivism|opposition]], to employing empirical and deductive methods, some—especially [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[counseling psychology|counseling]] psychologists—at times rely upon [[Hermeneutics#Psychology|symbolic interpretation]] and other [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] techniques. Psychology has been described as a "hub science" in that medicine tends to draw psychological research via neurology and [[psychiatry]], whereas social sciences most commonly draws directly from [[List of psychology disciplines|sub-disciplines within psychology]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2007/september-07/psychology-is-a-hub-science.html |title=Psychology is a Hub Science|journal=Aps Observer|volume=20|issue=8|quote=psychology is a hub discipline — that is, a discipline in which scientific research is cited by scientists in many other fields.

<!--Application and scope:-->While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity.

== Etymology and definitions ==
The word ''[[wikt:psychology|psychology]]'' derives from Greek roots meaning study of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], or [[soul (spirit)|soul]] ([[wikt:ψυχή|ψυχή]] ''psychē'', "breath, spirit, soul" and -λογία [[wikt:-logia|''-logia'']], "study of" or "research").<ref name="OED">Online Etymology Dictionary.

In 1890, [[William James]] defined ''psychology'' as "the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions". This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as [[John B. Watson]], who in his 1913 manifesto defined the discipline of psychology as the acquisition of information useful to the control of behavior. Also since James defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of [[scientific experimentation]].<ref>[[Derek Russell Davis]] (DRD), "psychology", in Richard L.

== History ==
{{Main|History of psychology}}
The ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology. In Ancient Egypt the [[Ebers papyrus|Ebers Papyrus]] mentioned [[clinical depression|depression]] and thought disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Okasha |first1=Ahmed  |date=2005 |title=Mental Health in Egypt |journal=The Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=116–25 |pmid=16342608  }}</ref> Historians note that Greek philosophers, including [[Thales]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]] (especially in his ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'' treatise),<ref>"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ Aristotle's Psychology]".

Westport, Connecticut: Praeger.</ref> As early as the 4th century BC, Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] theorized that [[mental disorder]]s had physical rather than supernatural causes.<ref>T.L. Brink.

In China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of [[Laozi]] and [[Confucius]], and later from the doctrines of [[Buddhism]]. This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin–yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, "China", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>

Distinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by [[Hinduism]]. A central idea of the [[Upanishads]] is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[Ātman (Hinduism)|eternal unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit corpus]] was suppressed under the [[British East India Company]] followed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the [[Theosophical Society]], a [[New Age]] group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, "From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref>

Psychology was a popular topic in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum—most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia rationalis'' in 1734. This notion advanced further under [[Immanuel Kant]], who established the idea of [[History of anthropology|anthropology]], with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of [[experimental psychology]], writing that "the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object." In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Old University of Münster was discontinued by Prussian authorities.<ref>Schwarz, K. A., & Pfister, R.: ''Scientific psychology in the 18th century: a historical rediscovery.'' In: ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', Nr. 11, p. 399-407.</ref> Having consulted philosophers [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], however, in 1825 the [[Prussia]]n state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential [[Prussian education system|educational system]]. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.<ref name=Horst>Horst U.K. Gundlach, "Germany", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> In England, early psychology involved [[phrenology]] and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country's well-populated mental asylums.<ref>Alan Collins, "England", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>

=== Beginning of experimental psychology ===
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]

[[Gustav Fechner]] began conducting [[psychophysics]] research in [[Leipzig]] in the 1830s, articulating the principle ([[Weber–Fechner law]]) that human perception of a stimulus varies [[logarithmically]] according to its intensity.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), p. 61.</ref> Fechner's 1860 ''Elements of Psychophysics'' challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind.<ref>Fechner, G. T. (1860). Elemente der Psychophysik. Breitkopf u. Härtel. (Elements of Psychophysics)</ref><ref name=Horst /> In Heidelberg, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological [[laboratory]] which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material.<ref name="WundtStanford">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-wundt/ "Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt"].</ref> [[Paul Flechsig]] and [[Emil Kraepelin]] soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.<ref name=Horst />

Psychologists in Germany, Denmark, Austria, England, and the United States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratories.<ref name=BenjaminBaker /> [[G. Stanley Hall]] who studied with Wundt, formed a psychology lab at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Maryland, which became internationally influential. Hall, in turn, trained [[Yūjirō Motora|Yujiro Motora]], who brought experimental psychology, emphasizing psychophysics, to the [[Imperial University of Tokyo]].<ref name=Takasuna>Miki Takasuna, "Japan", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> Wundt's assistant, [[Hugo Münsterberg]], taught psychology at Harvard to students such as [[Narendra Nath Sen Gupta]]—who, in 1905, founded a psychology department and laboratory at the [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=Paranjpe /> Wundt students [[Walter Dill Scott]], [[Lightner Witmer]], and [[James McKeen Cattell]] worked on developing tests for mental ability. Catell, who also studied with [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Francis Galton]], went on to found the [[Psychological Corporation]]. Wittmer focused on mental testing of children; Scott, on selection of employees.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), p. 60.</ref>

Another student of Wundt, [[Edward Titchener]], created the psychology program at [[Cornell University]] and advanced a doctrine of "[[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]]" psychology. Structuralism sought to analyze and classify different aspects of the mind, primarily through the method of [[introspection]].<ref name=Goodwin /> William James, [[John Dewey]] and [[Harvey Carr]] advanced a more expansive doctrine called [[Functional psychology|functionalism]], attuned more to human–environment actions. In 1890, James wrote an influential book, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', which expanded on the realm of structuralism, memorably described the human "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]", and interested many American students in the emerging discipline.<ref name=Goodwin /><ref>''The Principles of Psychology'' (1890), with introduction by George A. Miller, Harvard University Press, 1983 paperback, {{ISBN|0-674-70625-0}} (combined edition, 1328 pages)</ref><ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), pp. 178–182.</ref> Dewey integrated psychology with social issues, most notably by promoting the cause [[progressive education]] to assimilate immigrants and inculcate moral values in children.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), pp. 196–200.</ref>

[[File:One of Pavlov's dogs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|One of the dogs used in Pavlov's experiment with a surgically implanted [[cannula]] to measure [[saliva]]tion, [[taxidermy|preserved]] in the Pavlov Museum in [[Ryazan]], Russia]]

A different strain of experimentalism, with more connection to physiology, emerged in South America, under the leadership of Horacio G. Piñero at the [[University of Buenos Aires]].<ref>Cecilia Taiana, "Transatlantic Migration of the Disciplines of Mind: Examination of the Reception of Wundt's and Freud's Theories in Argentina", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref> Russia, too, placed greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology, beginning with [[Ivan Sechenov]]'s 1873 essay, "Who Is to Develop Psychology and How?" Sechenov advanced the idea of brain [[reflexes]] and aggressively promoted a [[determinism|deterministic]] viewpoint on human behavior.<ref name=SirotkinaSmith>Irina Sirotkina and Roger Smith, "Russian Federation", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>

[[Wolfgang Kohler]], [[Max Wertheimer]] and [[Kurt Koffka]] co-founded the school of [[Gestalt psychology]] (not to be confused with the [[Gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]]). This approach is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. Rather than [[Reductionism|breaking down]] thoughts and behavior into smaller elements, as in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts. Other 19th-century contributors to the field include the German psychologist [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], a pioneer in the experimental study of memory, who developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting at the [[University of Berlin]],<ref>Wozniak, R.H. (1999). Introduction to memory: Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913). [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/wozniak.htm Classics in the history of psychology]</ref> and the Russian-Soviet [[physiologist]] [[Ivan Pavlov]], who discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed "[[classical conditioning]]" and applied to human beings.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Windholz |first=G. |year=1997 |title=Ivan P.

=== Consolidation and funding ===
One of the earliest psychology societies was ''La Société de Psychologie Physiologique'' in France, which lasted 1885–1893. The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the [[International Union of Psychological Science]] took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|the World's Fair]] celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. William James was one of three Americans among the four hundred attendees. The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) was founded soon after, in 1892. The International Congress continued to be held, at different locations in Europe, with wider international participation. The Sixth Congress, Geneva 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese, as well as [[Esperanto]]. After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans. In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the APA.<ref name=BenjaminBaker>Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr., and David B.

American psychology gained status during World War I, during which a standing committee headed by [[Robert Yerkes]] administered mental tests ("[[Army Alpha]]" and "[[Army Beta]]") to almost 1.8 million soldiers.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> Subsequent funding for behavioral research came in large part from the [[Rockefeller family]], via the [[Social Science Research Council]].<ref>Franz Samuelson, "Organizing for the Kingdom of Behavior: Academic Battles and the Organizational Policies in the Twenties"; ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' 21, January 1985.</ref><ref>Hans Pols, "The World as Laboratory: Strategies of Field Research Developed by Mental Hygiene Psychologists in Toronto, 1920–1940" in Theresa Richardson & Donald Fisher (eds.), ''The Development of the Social Sciences in the United States and Canada: The Role of Philanthropy''; Stamford, CT: Ablex Publishing, 1999; {{ISBN|1-56750-405-1}}</ref> Rockefeller charities funded the National Committee on Mental Hygiene, which promoted the concept of mental illness and lobbied for psychological supervision of child development.<ref name=Tomes2008 /><ref>Sol Cohen, "The Mental Hygiene Movement, the Development of Personality and the School: The Medicalization of American Education"; ''History of Education Quarterly'' 23.2, Summer 1983.</ref> Through the Bureau of Social Hygiene and later funding of [[Alfred Kinsey]], Rockefeller foundations established sex research as a viable discipline in the U.S.<ref>Vern L. Bullough, "The Rockefellers and Sex Research"; ''Journal of Sex Research'' 21.2, May 1985. "Their importance is hard to overestimate. In fact, in the period between 1914 and 1954, the Rockefellers were almost the sole support of sex research in the United States. The decisions made by their scientific advisers about the nature of the research to be supported and how it was conducted, as well as the topics eligible for research support, shaped the whole field of sex research and, in many ways, still continue to support it."</ref> Under the influence of the Carnegie-funded [[Eugenics Record Office]], the Draper-funded [[Pioneer Fund]], and other institutions, the [[Eugenics in the United States|eugenics movement]] also had a significant impact on American psychology; in the 1910s and 1920s, eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes.<ref name=GuthrieChapter4>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 4: "Psychology and Race" (pp. 88–110). "Psychology courses often became the vehicles for eugenics propaganda. One graduate of the Record Office training program wrote, 'I hope to serve the cause by infiltrating eugenics into the minds of teachers. It may interest you to know that each student who takes psychology here works up his family history and plots his family tree.' Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Wisconsin, and Northwestern were among the leading academic institutions teaching eugenics in psychology courses."</ref>

During World War II and the Cold War, the U.S. military and intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology—through the armed forces and in the new [[Office of Strategic Services]] intelligence agency. University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university researchers began large-scale propaganda research in 1939–1941, and "the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week-by-week-propaganda policy for the United States Government." Cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy.<ref>Dorwin Cartwright, "Social Psychology in the United States During the Second World War", ''Human Relations'' 1.3, June 1948, p. 340; quoted in Cina, "Social Science For Whom?" (1981), p. 269.</ref> The Army rolled out its new [[Army General Classification Test|General Classification Test]] and engaged in massive studies of troop morale. In the 1950s, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[Ford Foundation]] collaborated with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to fund research on [[psychological warfare]].<ref>Catherine Lutz, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=hwVWpV6jBzoC&pg=PA245 Epistemology of the Bunker: The Brainwashed and Other New Subjects of Permanent War]", in Joel Pfister & Nancy Schnog (eds.), ''Inventing the Psychological: Toward a Cultural History of Emotional Life in America''; Yale University Press, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06809-3}}</ref> In 1965, public controversy called attention to the Army's [[Project Camelot]]—the "Manhattan Project" of social science—an effort which enlisted psychologists and anthropologists to analyze foreign countries for strategic purposes.<ref>Cina, "Social Science For Whom?" (1981), pp. 315–325.</ref><ref>Herman, "Psychology as Politics" (1993), p. 288. "Had it come to fruition, CAMELOT would have been the largest, and certainly the most generously funded, behavioral research project in U.S. history. With a $4–6 million contract over a period of 3 years, it was considered, and often called, a veritable Manhattan Project for the behavioral sciences, at least by many of the intellectuals whose services were in heavy demand."</ref>

In Germany after World War I, psychology held institutional power through the military, and subsequently expanded along with the rest of the military under the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=Horst /> Under the direction of [[Hermann Göring]]'s cousin [[Matthias Göring]], the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]] was renamed the Göring Institute. [[Freudian psychoanalysis|Freudian psychoanalysts]] were expelled and persecuted under the anti-Jewish policies of the [[Nazi Party]], and all psychologists had to distance themselves from Freud and Adler.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), pp. 75–77.</ref> The Göring Institute was well-financed throughout the war with a mandate to create a "New German Psychotherapy". This psychotherapy aimed to align suitable Germans with the overall goals of the Reich; as described by one physician: "Despite the importance of analysis, spiritual guidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the ''[[Volk]]'' and the ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|Gemeinschaft]]''." Psychologists were to provide ''Seelenführung'', leadership of the mind, to integrate people into the new vision of a German community.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), p. 93.</ref> [[Harald Schultz-Hencke]] melded psychology with the Nazi theory of biology and racial origins, criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), pp. 86–87. "For Schultz-Hencke in this 1934 essay, life goals were determined by ideology, not by science. In the case of psychotherapy, he defined health in terms of blood, strong will, proficiency, discipline, (''Zucht und Ordnung''), community, heroic bearing, and physical fitness. Schultz-Hencke also took the opportunity in 1934 to criticize psychoanalysis for providing an unfortunate tendency toward the exculpation of the criminal."</ref> [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]], a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of [[autogenic training]], prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable, and devised techniques for facilitating this process.<ref>Jürgen Brunner, Matthias Schrempf, & Florian Steger, "[http://doctorsonly.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2008_4_5.pdf Johannes Heinrich Schultz and National Socialism]", ''Israel Journal of Psychiatry & Related Sciences'' 45.4, 2008. "Bringing these people to a right and deep understanding of every German's duty in the New Germany, such as preparatory mental aid and psychotherapy in general and in particular for persons to be sterilized, and for people having been sterilized, is a great, important and rewarding medical duty."</ref> After the war, some new institutions were created and some psychologists were discredited due to Nazi affiliation. [[Alexander Mitscherlich (psychologist)|Alexander Mitscherlich]] founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called ''Psyche'' and with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University. In 1970, psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), Chapter 14: "Reconstruction and Repression", pp. 351–375.</ref>

After the [[Russian Revolution]], psychology was heavily promoted by the [[Bolsheviks]] as a way to engineer the "New Man" of socialism. Thus, university psychology departments trained large numbers of students, for whom positions were made available at schools, workplaces, cultural institutions, and in the military. An especial focus was [[Pedology (children study)|pedology]], the study of child development, regarding which [[Lev Vygotsky]] became a prominent writer.<ref name=SirotkinaSmith /> The Bolsheviks also promoted [[free love]] and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual repression.<ref name=Kozulin1984Pages84to86>Kozulin, ''Psychology in Utopia'' (1984), pp. 84–86. "Against such a background it is not at all surprising that psychoanalysis, as a theory that ventured to approach the forbidden but topical theme of sexual relations, was embraced by the newborn Soviet psychology. Psychoanalysis also attracted the interest of Soviet psychology as a materialist trend that had challenged the credentials of classical introspective psychology.

This approach may be traced back to the assertion of Wilhelm Humboldt that it is not man who has language as an attribute, but rather language that 'possesses' man. [...] Schedrovitsky's activity approach has been applied successfully to the design of man-machine systems and to the evaluation of human factors in urban planning."</ref>

Twentieth-century Chinese psychology originally modeled the U.S., with translations from American authors like William James, the establishment of university psychology departments and journals, and the establishment of groups including the Chinese Association of Psychological Testing (1930) and the [[Chinese Psychological Society]] (1937). Chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning, with the aspiration that education would enable modernization and [[nationalization]]. John Dewey, who lectured to Chinese audiences in 1918–1920, had a significant influence on this doctrine. Chancellor [[Cai Yuanpei|T'sai Yuan-p'ei]] introduced him at [[Peking University]] as a greater thinker than Confucius. [[Zing-Yang Kuo|Kuo Zing-yang]] who received a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, became President of [[Zhejiang University]] and popularized [[behaviorism]].<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 5–9.</ref> After the [[Chinese Communist Party]] gained control of the country, the Stalinist Soviet Union became the leading influence, with [[Marxism–Leninism]] the leading social doctrine and Pavlovian conditioning the approved concept of behavior change. Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenin's model of a "reflective" consciousness, envisioning an "active consciousness" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=tzu-chueh neng-tung-li}}) able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle. They developed a concept of "recognition" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=jen-shih}}) which referred the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview (failure to correspond with party doctrine was "incorrect recognition").<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 9–17. "The Soviet psychology that Peking modeled itself upon was a Marxist-Leninist psychology with a philosophical base in dialectical materialism and a newly added label, Pavlovianism. This new Soviet psychology leaned heavily on Lenin's theory of reflection, which was unearthed in his two volumes posthumously published in 1924. Toward the late twenties, a group of Soviet research psychologists headed by Vygotskii, along with Luria and Leont'ev, laid the groundwork for a Marxist-Leninist approach to psychic development."</ref> Psychology education was centralized under the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], supervised by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. In 1951, the Academy created a Psychology Research Office, which in 1956 became the Institute of Psychology. Most leading psychologists were educated in the United States, and the first concern of the Academy was re-education of these psychologists in the Soviet doctrines. Child psychology and pedagogy for nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline.<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 18–24.</ref>

=== Boundaries ===

Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from [[parapsychology]], which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed great popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William James), and indeed constituted the bulk of what people called "psychology". Parapsychology, hypnotism, and [[Psychic|psychism]] were major topics of the early International Congresses. But students of these fields were eventually ostractized, and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900–1905.<ref name=BenjaminBaker /> Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University, with publications such as ''Clairvoyance and Thoughtography'' by Tomokichi Fukurai, but here too it was mostly shunned by 1913.<ref name=Takasuna />

As a discipline, psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a "soft" science. Philosopher of science [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm state, lacking the agreement on overarching theory found in mature sciences such as chemistry and physics.<ref>T.S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 1st. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1962.</ref> Because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and questionnaires, critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science. Skeptics have suggested that personality, thinking, and emotion, cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self-reports, which may be problematic. Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities.<ref name="Beveridge_subj">{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/pb.26.3.101 |title=Time to abandon the subjective–objective divide? |journal=Psychiatric Bulletin |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=101–103 |year=2002 |last1=Beveridge |first1=Allan |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Peterson_subj">Peterson, C.

Divisions still exist within the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans, which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population. Critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a "cult of empiricism" which limits the scope of its study by using only methods derived from the physical sciences.<ref>Teo, ''The Critique of Psychology'' (2005), pp. 36–37. "Methodologism means that the method dominates the problem, problems are chosen in subordination to the respected method, and psychology has to adopt without question, the methods of the natural sciences. [...] From an epistemological and ontological-critical as well as from a human-scientific perspective the experiment in psychology has limited value (for example, only for basic psychological processes), given the nature of the psychological subject matter, and the reality of persons and their capabilities."</ref> Feminist critiques along these lines have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of (historically mostly male)<ref name=Tomes2008 /> researchers. Jean Grimshaw, for example, argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a [[patriarchal]] agenda through its efforts to control behavior.<ref>Teo, ''The Critique of Psychology'' (2005), p. 120. "Pervasive in feminist critiques of science, with the exception of feminist empiricism, is the rejection of positivist assumptions, including the assumption of value-neutrality or that research can only be objective if subjectivity and emotional dimensions are excluded, when in fact culture, personality, and institutions play significant roles (see Longino, 1990; Longino & Doell, 1983). For psychology, Grimshaw (1986) discussed behaviorism's goals of modification, and suggested that behaviorist principles reinforced a hierarchical position between controller and controlled and that behaviorism was in principle an antidemocratic program."</ref>

Psychologists generally consider the organism the basis of the mind, and therefore a vitally related area of study. Psychiatrists and neuropsychologists work at the interface of mind and body.<ref>Edwin R. Wallace, IV, "Two 'Mind'–'Body' Models for a Holistic Psychiatry" and "Freud on 'Mind–Body' I: The Psychoneurobiological and 'Instinctualist' Stance; with Implications for Chapter 24, and Two Postscripts", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref>
Biological psychology, also known as physiological psychology,<ref name=ThompsonZola /> or [[neuropsychology]] is the study of the biological substrates of behavior and mental processes. Key research topics in this field include [[comparative psychology]], which studies humans in relation to other animals, and perception which involves the physical mechanics of sensation as well as neural and mental processing.<ref>Michela Gallagher & Randy J. Nelson, "Volume Preface", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 3: ''Biological Psychology''.</ref> For centuries, a leading question in biological psychology has been whether and how mental functions might be [[Functional specialization (brain)|localized in the brain]]. From [[Phineas Gage]] to [[Henry Molaison|H.M.]] and [[Clive Wearing]], individual people with mental issues traceable to physical damage have inspired new discoveries in this area.<ref name=ThompsonZola>Richard F. Thompson & Stuart M. Zola, "Biological Psychology", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 1: ''History of Psychology''.</ref> Modern neuropsychology could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France [[Paul Broca]] traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function. Soon after, [[Carl Wernicke]] identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech.<ref>Luria, "The Working Brain" (1973), pp. 20–22.</ref>

The contemporary field of [[behavioral neuroscience]] focuses on physical causes underpinning behavior. For example, physiological psychologists use animal models, typically rats, to study the neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pinel |first=John |title=Biopsychology |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-205-83256-9}}</ref> Cognitive neuroscientists investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools, and neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine, for instance, specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease. The [[biopsychosocial model]] is an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness, behavior, and social interaction. It assumes that any given behavior or mental process affects and is affected by dynamically interrelated biological, psychological, and social factors.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Richard Frankel |author2=Timothy Quill |author3=Susan McDaniel |title=The Biopsychosocial Approach: Past, Present, Future |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58046-102-3}}</ref>

[[Evolutionary psychology]] examines cognition and personality traits from an evolutionary perspective. This perspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. Evolutionary psychology offers complementary explanations for the mostly proximate or developmental explanations developed by other areas of psychology: that is, it focuses mostly on ultimate or "why?" questions, rather than proximate or "how?" questions. "How?" questions are more directly tackled by [[behavioral genetics]] research, which aims to understand how genes and environment impact behavior.<ref name="Behavior Genetics">{{Cite book |vauthors= McGue M, Gottesman II | date= 2015| chapter= Behavior Genetics |journal= The Encyclopedia of Clinical Psychology | doi= 10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp578 | pages=1–11| isbn= 978-1-118-62539-2}}</ref>

The search for biological origins of psychological phenomena has long involved debates about the importance of race, and especially the relationship between race and intelligence. The idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by Europeans.<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 1: "'The Noble Savage' and Science" (pp. 3–33)</ref> [[Carl von Linnaeus]]'s four-fold classification of humans classifies Europeans as intelligent and severe, Americans as contented and free, Asians as ritualistic, and Africans as lazy and capricious. Race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as ''[[drapetomania]]'' and ''[[dysaesthesia aethiopica]]''—the behavior of uncooperative African slaves.<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 5: "The Psychology of Survival and Education" (pp. 113–134)</ref> After the creation of experimental psychology, "ethnical psychology" emerged as a subdiscipline, based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans.<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 2: "Brass Instruments and Dark Skins" (pp. 34–54)</ref>

Psychologists take human behavior as a main area of study. Much of the research in this area began with tests on mammals, based on the idea that humans exhibit similar fundamental tendencies. Behavioral research ever aspires to improve the effectiveness of techniques for behavior modification.

[[File:Little Albert experiment (1920).webm|250px|thumb|thumbtime=192|The film of the Little Albert experiment]]Early behavioral researchers studied stimulus–response pairings, now known as classical conditioning. They demonstrated that behaviors could be linked through repeated association with stimuli eliciting pain or pleasure. Ivan Pavlov—known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously linked with food—became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans.<ref name=SirotkinaSmith /> In the United States, [[Edward Lee Thorndike]] initiated "[[connectionism]]" studies by trapping animals in "puzzle boxes" and rewarding them for escaping. Thorndike wrote in 1911: "There can be no moral warrant for studying man's nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts."<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), pp. 212–215.</ref> From 1910–1913 the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion, away from [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]] and towards "behavioralism", and in 1913 John B. Watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), pp. 218–227.</ref> Watson's famous [[Little Albert experiment]] in 1920 demonstrated that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill [[phobia]]s (aversions to other stimuli) in an infant human.<ref name=Watson1913 /><ref>J.B.

Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes underlying mental activity. Perception, attention, reasoning, thinking, problem solving, memory, learning, language, and emotion are areas of research. Classical cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and experimental psychology.

[[File:Working memory model.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Baddeley's model of working memory]]]]
Starting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques developed by Wundt, James, Ebbinghaus, and others re-emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist—concerned with information and its processing—and, eventually, constituted a part of the wider cognitive science.<ref name=Mandler /> Some called this development the [[cognitive revolution]] because it rejected the anti-mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis.<ref name=Mandler>Mandler, G.

[[File:Müller-Lyer illusion.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The [[Müller–Lyer illusion]]. Psychologists make inferences about mental processes from shared phenomena such as optical illusions.]]
Technological advances also renewed interest in mental states and representations. English neuroscientist [[Charles Sherrington]] and Canadian psychologist [[Donald O. Hebb]] used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena with the structure and function of the brain. The rise of computer science, cybernetics and artificial intelligence suggested the value of comparatively studying information processing in humans and machines. Research in cognition had proven practical since World War II, when it aided in the understanding of weapons operation.<ref name="Aidman 2002 et al.">{{cite journal | last1 = Aidman | first1 = Eugene | last2 = Galanis | first2 = George | last3 = Manton | first3 = Jeremy | last4 = Vozzo | first4 = Armando | last5 = Bonner | first5 = Michael | year = 2002 | title = Evaluating human systems in military training | journal = Australian Journal of Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 168–173 | doi = 10.1080/00049530412331312754 }}</ref>

A popular and representative topic in this area is [[cognitive bias]], or irrational thought. Psychologists (and economists) have classified and described a [[List of cognitive biases|sizeable catalogue of biases]] which recur frequently in human thought. The [[availability heuristic]], for example, is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind.<ref>{{Citation|last=Juslin|first=Peter|title=Availability Heuristic|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Mind|year=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452257044.n39|isbn=978-1-4129-5057-2}}</ref>

Elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and American psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]].

On a broader level, cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise of cognitive psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, researchers in artificial intelligence, linguists, human–computer interaction, [[computational neuroscience]], logicians and social scientists. The discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as philosophy of mind, computer science, and neuroscience.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest.

Social psychology is the study of how humans think about each other and how they relate to each other. Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[persuasion]]), and the formation of beliefs, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[stereotype]]s about other people. [[Social cognition]] fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of [[group dynamics]] reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the [[microsociology|microsocial]] level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in [[Implicit Association Test|implicit]] measures, [[mediation (statistics)|mediational]] models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. The study of human society is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. Some sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role, sick role, social class, life event, culture, migration, social, and [[total institution]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Dr Abha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RknmDwAAQBAJ&q=Some+sociological+concepts+applied+to+psychiatric+disorders+are+the+social+role,+sick+role,+social+class,+life+event,+culture,+migration,+social,+and+total+institution&pg=PA20|title=Sports Psychology|last2=Nisha|first2=Ms|date=2020-05-22|publisher=Friends Publications India|isbn=978-93-88457-75-0|language=en}}</ref>

[[Psychoanalysis]] comprises a method of investigating the mind and interpreting experience; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of psychotherapy to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially conflict originating in the unconscious mind.<ref>Moore, B.E.; Fine, B.D. (1968), A Glossary of Psychoanalytic Terms and Concepts, Amer Psychoanalytic Assn, p. 78, {{ISBN|978-0-318-13125-2}}</ref> This school of thought originated in the 1890s with Austrian medical doctors including [[Josef Breuer]] (physician), [[Alfred Adler]] (physician), [[Otto Rank]] (psychoanalyst), and most prominently [[Sigmund Freud]] (neurologist). Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, [[introspection]] and clinical observations. It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[psychological repression|repression]], and the unconscious. These subjects were largely taboo at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for their open discussion in polite society.<ref name=Kozulin1984Pages84to86 /> Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] and a therapeutic interest in [[dream interpretation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Freud, S|year=1900|title=The Interpretation of Dreams|edition= 2nd|publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955|volume=IV and V}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Freud, S |title=The Unconscious |year=1915 |edition= 2nd |volume=XIV |publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955}}</ref>

Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, influenced by Freud, elaborated a theory of the [[collective unconscious]]—a primordial force present in all humans, featuring [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] which exerted a profound influence on the mind. Jung's competing vision formed the basis for [[analytical psychology]], which later led to the [[archetypal psychology|archetypal]] and [[Process Oriented Psychology|process-oriented]] schools. Other well-known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid-20th century include [[Erik Erikson]], [[Melanie Klein]], [[Donald Winnicott|D.W. Winnicott]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[John Bowlby]], and Sigmund Freud's daughter, [[Anna Freud]]. Throughout the 20th century, psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought which could be called [[Neo-Freudian]]. Among these schools are [[ego psychology]], [[object relations]], and [[interpersonal psychoanalysis|interpersonal]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]], and [[relational psychoanalysis]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Psychologists such as [[Hans Eysenck]] and philosophers including [[Karl Popper]] criticized psychoanalysis. Popper argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline,<ref name="Popper">Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations, London: Routledge and Keagan Paul, 1963, pp. 33–39; from Theodore Schick, ed., Readings in the Philosophy of Science, Mountain View, CA: Mayfield Publishing Company, 2000, pp. 9–13. [http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/Popper.doc Faculty.washington.edu]</ref> whereas Eysenck said that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by [[experiment]]al data. By the end of 20th century, psychology departments in [[Higher education in the United States|American universities]] mostly marginalized Freudian theory, dismissing it as a "desiccated and dead" historical artifact.<ref name=Cohen>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/weekinreview/25cohen.html?_r=3&ref=education&oref&oref=slogin June 2008 study] by the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]], as reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department" by Patricia Cohen, 25 November 2007.</ref> However, researchers in the emerging field of [[neuro-psychoanalysis]] today defend some of Freud's ideas on scientific grounds,<ref name="reference_name_C">For example, scientists have related brain structures to Freudian concepts such as [[libido]], [[motivation|drives]], the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], and [[psychological repression|repression]].

Later, [[positive psychology]] opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration.

The ''American Association for Humanistic Psychology'', formed in 1963, declared:

<blockquote>Humanistic psychology is primarily an orientation toward the whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or school. It stands for respect for the worth of persons, respect for differences of approach, open-mindedness as to acceptable methods, and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behavior. As a "third force" in contemporary psychology, it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems: e.g., love, creativity, self, growth, organism, basic need-gratification, self-actualization, higher values, being, becoming, spontaneity, play, humor, affection, naturalness, warmth, ego-transcendence, objectivity, autonomy, responsibility, meaning, fair-play, transcendental experience, peak experience, courage, and related concepts.<ref>A.J.

In the 1950s and 1960s, influenced by philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] and, psychoanalytically trained American psychologist [[Rollo May]] pioneered an [[existential]] branch of psychology, which included [[existential therapy|existential psychotherapy]]: a method based on the belief that inner conflict within a person is due to that individual's confrontation with the givens of existence. Swiss psychoanalyst [[Ludwig Binswanger]] and American psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] may also be said to belong to the existential school.<ref name="Hergenhahn3">{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, California |year=2005 |pages=528–536}}</ref> Existential psychologists differed from more "humanistic" psychologists in their relatively neutral view of human nature and their relatively positive assessment of anxiety.<ref name="Hergenhahn4">{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, California |year=2005 |pages=546–547}}</ref> Existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death, free will, and meaning, suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths, or narrative patterns,<ref name="Hergenhahn">{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, California |year=2005 |pages=523–532}}</ref> and that it can be encouraged by an acceptance of the free will requisite to an [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]], albeit often anxious, regard for death and other future prospects.

=== Personality ===
{{main|Personality psychology}}
Personality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion—commonly referred to as personality—in individuals. Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools and orientations. They carry different assumptions about such issues as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the [[id, ego, and super-ego]].<ref>Carver, C., & Scheier, M. (2004). Perspectives on Personality (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.</ref> In order to develop a taxonomy of personality constructs, [[trait theorist]]s, in contrast, attempt to describe the personality sphere in terms of a discrete number of key traits using the statistical data-reduction method of [[factor analysis]]. Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, an early biologically-based model proposed by Hans Eysenck, the 3rd mostly highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century (after Freud, and Piaget respectively), suggested that at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality structure: [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion–introversion]], [[neuroticism]]-stability, and [[psychoticism]]-normality. [[Raymond Cattell]], the 7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century (based on the scientific peer-reviewed journal literature)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=139–152 |year=2002 |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle |s2cid=145668721 |url=http://creativity.ipras.ru/texts/top100.pdf }}</ref> empirically derived a theory of [[16 personality factors]] at the primary-factor level, and up to 8 broader second-stratum factors (at the Eysenckian level of analysis), rather than the "Big Five" dimensions.<ref>Cattell, R.B.

An early example of personality assessment was the [[Woodworth Personal Data Sheet]], constructed during World War I.

Behaviorist resistance to introspection led to the development of the [[Strong Interest Inventory|Strong Vocational Interest Blank]] and [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI), in an attempt to ask empirical questions that focused less on the psychodynamics of the respondent.<ref>Leslie C. Morey, "Measuring Personality and Psychopathology" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> However, the MMPI has been subjected to critical scrutiny, given that it adhered to archaic psychiatric nosology, and since it required individuals to provide subjective, introspective responses to the hundreds of items pertaining to psychopathology.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.3.453 |title=A perspective on developments in assessing psychopathology: A critical review of the MMPI and MMPI-2 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=453–471 |year=1993 |last1=Helmes |first1=Edward |last2=Reddon |first2=John R. }}</ref>

=== Unconscious mind ===
{{see also|Unconscious mind#Psychology}}
Study of the unconscious mind, a part of the psyche outside the awareness of the individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology. In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, [[C.S. Peirce]] and [[Joseph Jastrow]] found in 1884 that subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference.<ref>Charles Sanders Peirce & Joseph Jastrow, "[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm On Small Differences in Sensation]", ''Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences'' 3, 17 October 1884; cited in William P.

His 1901 text ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'' catalogues hundreds of everyday events which Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. [[Pierre Janet]] advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the scrutiny of the subject.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999>John F. Kihlstrom, "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iXMQq7wg-qkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA424 The Psychological Unconscious]", in Lawrence Pervin & Oliver John (eds.), ''Handbook of Personality''; New York: Guilford Press, 1999.

Behaviorism notwithstanding, the unconscious mind has maintained its importance in psychology. Cognitive psychologists have used a "filter" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]'' of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999 /> A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between ''[[implicit memory|implicit]]'' and ''[[explicit memory|explicit]]'' memory. In another approach, one can also describe a [[subliminal stimulus]] as meeting an ''objective'' but not a ''subjective'' threshold.<ref name=BanksFarber>William P. Banks & Ilya Farber, "Consciousness", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 4: ''Experimental Psychology''.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>

=== Motivation ===
{{Main|Motivation}}
Psychologists such as William James initially used the term ''motivation'' to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of ''[[Will (philosophy)|will]]'' in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<ref name=ForgasEtAl>Forgas, Williams, & Laham, "Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview", in Forgas, Williams, & Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).</ref> According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, "The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation" (pp. 9–84).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P. Godsil, Matthew R. Tinsley, & Michael S. Fanselow, "Motivation", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 4: ''Experimental Psychology''.</ref> [[Clark Hull]] formalized the latter idea with his [[Drive reduction theory (learning theory)|drive reduction]] model.<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 3, "Drive Theory" (pp. 85–138).</ref>

Hunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation all seem to constitute fundamental motivations for animals.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Humans also seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations—though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from primordial instincts—including desires for belonging, self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and control.<ref>[[E. Tory Higgins]], ''Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works''; Oxford University Press, 2012; {{ISBN|978-0-19-976582-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref><ref>Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008), entire volume.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>

Motivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. Researchers have found that [[eating]], for example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for [[homeostasis]]—an important factor causing the experience of hunger—but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as ''goal contagion'': the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.<ref>Hank Aarts, Ap Dijksterhuis, & Giel Dik, "Goal Contagion: Inferring goals from others' actions—and what it leads to", in Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008). "In short, then, the studies presented above indicate that humans are keen to act on the goals of other social beings that are implied in behavioral scenarios or scripts."

They suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and sleep.<ref>Kathleen D. Vohs & [[Roy F. Baumeister]], "Can Satisfaction Reinforce Wanting?

[[File:Baby with book.jpg|thumb|upright|Developmental psychologists would engage a child with a book and then make observations based on how the child interacts with the object.]]

Mainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== Genes and environment ===
{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}

All researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702–709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |s2cid=205349969 |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160–164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric |s2cid=2861437 }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental [[behavioral genetic]] research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name="Behavior Genetics" /> Traditionally this research has been conducted using [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly [[polygenic]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.029 |pmid=22243964 |pmc=3257326 |title=Five Years of GWAS Discovery |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=7–24 |year=2012 |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Brown |first2=Matthew A. |last3=McCarthy |first3=Mark I. |last4=Yang |first4=Jian}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature13595 |pmid=25056061 |pmc=4112379 |title=Biological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci |journal=Nature |volume=511 |issue=7510 |pages=421–427 |year=2014 |bibcode=2014Natur.511..421S |last1=Ripke |first1=Stephan |last2=Neale |first2=Benjamin M. |last3=Corvin |first3=Aiden |last4=Walters |first4=James T.

{{further|Outline of psychology|List of psychology disciplines|Applied psychology|Subfields of psychology}}
Psychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior:

=== Mental testing ===
{{see also|Psychometrics|social statistics}}
Psychological testing has ancient origins, such as [[imperial examination|examinations for the Chinese civil service]] dating back to 2200 BC. Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41–42.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]—judgment of character based on the face—described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 42–43.</ref>

When experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as ''[[psychometrics]]'').<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 44–45.</ref> James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term "mental test".<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 45–46.</ref> In 1901, Cattell's student [[Clark Wissler]] published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance.<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46 /> In response to 1904 orders from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]], French psychologists [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Théodore Simon]] elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905–1911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H. Goddard]] put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as ''imbecile'' and ''feebleminded''. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford–Binet scale]]) and introduced the [[intelligence quotient]] as a score report.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 50–56.</ref> From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation "represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial."<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 3: "Psychometric Scientism" (pp. 55–87)</ref>

Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests for soldiers in World War I, mental testing became popular in the US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the [[College Entrance Examination Board]] created the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] to standardize college admissions.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 61.</ref> The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions—i.e. the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a [[Horace Mann Bond]] and [[Allison Davis]].<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3 /> Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded.<ref name=GuthrieChapter4 /> In the United States, tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Berry | first1 = Robert M. | title = From Involuntary Sterilization to Genetic Enhancement: The Unsettled Legacy of Buck v. Bell | url = http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndjlepp/vol12/iss2/3/| journal = Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics, & Public Policy | volume = 12 | year = 2012 }}</ref>

Today mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in Western societies.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 2. "From birth to old age, we encounter tests at almost every turning point in life. […] Tests are used in almost every nation on earth for counseling, selection, and placement. Testing occurs in settings as diverse as schools, civil service, industry, medical clinics, and counseling centers. Most persons have taken dozens of tests and thought nothing of it. Yet, by the time the typical individual reaches retirement age, it is likely that psychological test results will have helped to shape his or her destiny."</ref> Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, [[reliability (psychometrics)|consistency of results]], output of an interpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, [[test validity|effective prediction]] of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 4–6.</ref>

=== Mental health care ===
The provision of psychological health services is generally called ''clinical psychology'' in the U.S. The definitions of this term are various and may include school psychology and counseling psychology. Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of ''[[professional psychology]]''. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or [[mental illness]] and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name="brain">Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}</ref>

Credit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer, who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was [[Morton Prince]].<ref name=StrickerWidiger>George Stricker & Thomas A. Widiger, "Volume Preface", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> For the most part, in the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is [[transference]], in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, "Psychodynamic Psychotherapy", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>

Psychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]] and [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, "Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>

Mental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram Brown (physician)|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of "intense competition and role confusion".<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, "The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900–1980s", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PhD or PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. This degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.<ref name=HallHurley />

Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury—this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, "Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office—Get into the Field!" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). "...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition."</ref>

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223–1233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377–400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |s2cid=142840311 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124–130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

Diagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM), a handbook first published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1952. New editions over time have increased in size and focused more on medical language.<ref>Peter E. Nathan & James Langenbucher, "Diagnosis and Classification", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> The study of mental illnesses is called [[abnormal psychology]].

=== Education ===
{{Main|Educational psychology|School psychology}}
[[File:Figural Relationships.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test used in educational psychology.]]
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of [[school]]s as organizations. The work of child psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

School psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments. School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Association of School Psychologists |title=Who are school psychologists? |url=http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |access-date=1 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517055058/http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |archive-date=17 May 2008 }}</ref>

=== Work ===
{{see also|Industrial and organizational psychology|Organizational behavior}}
Industrialists soon brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of [[scientific management]] techniques for improving workplace efficiency. This field was at first called ''economic psychology'' or ''business psychology''; later, ''industrial psychology'', ''employment psychology'', or ''psychotechnology''.<ref name=Koppes>Laura L. Koppes, "Industrial-Organizational Psychology", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 1: ''History of Psychology''.</ref> An important early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924–1932. With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist [[Elton Mayo]], Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term [[Hawthorne effect]] is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.<ref>Yeh Hsueh, "The Hawthorne experiments and the introduction of Jean Piaget in American industrial psychology, 1929–1932"; ''History of Psychology'' 5.2, May 2002.</ref>

The name industrial and organizational psychology (I–O) arose in the 1960s and became enshrined as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]], Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, in 1973.<ref name=Koppes /> The goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I–O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. I–O psychology's other subfield, [[organizational psychology]], examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity.<ref>Myers (2004). Motivation and work. ''Psychology''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers</ref> The majority of I–O psychologists work outside of academia, for private and public organizations and as consultants.<ref name=Koppes /> A psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about their industry, their target markets, and the organization of their company.<ref>Steven Williams, "Executive Management: Helping Executives Manage Their Organizations through Organizational and Market Research" in Morgan et al.

=== Military and intelligence ===
One role for psychologists in the military is to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel. In the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia|Fort Oglethorpe]] in Georgia, to provide psychological training for military staff military.<ref name=Tomes2008 /><ref>[[Robert M. Yerkes]], "[http://www.pnas.org/content/4/10/295.full.pdf Measuring the Mental Strength of an Army]"; ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 4.10, 15 October 1918.</ref> Today, U.S Army psychology includes psychological screening, clinical psychotherapy, [[suicide prevention]], and treatment for post-traumatic stress, as well as other aspects of health and workplace psychology such as smoking cessation.<ref>Joshua N. Friedlander, "Military Psychology: An Army Clinical Psychologist" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005).</ref>

Psychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfare. Psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. In the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed to seem like it originates from a different source.<ref>[[Cordwainer Smith|Paul M.A. Linebarger]], ''Psychological Warfare''; Washington: Combat Forces Press, 1954.</ref> The [[CIA]]'s [[MKULTRA]] program involved more individualized efforts at [[mind control]], involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of [[LSD]].<ref>See "[https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/13inmate_ProjectMKULTRA.pdf Project MKULTRA, the CIA's Program of Research in Behavioral Modification]"; Joint Hearing before the Senate Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources, United States Senate, Ninety Fifth Congress, First Session, 3 August 1997; and [[John D.

=== Health, well-being, and social change ===
{{see also|health psychology|Biopsychosocial model}}
Medical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles. A prominent aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.<ref>Marilu Price Berry, "Interdisciplinary Medical Setting: The Multiple Roles of a Health Psychologist" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005).</ref>

Psychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies. Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole [[population]]s of people.<ref>Monica L. Baskin, "Public Health: Career Opportunities for Psychologists in Public Health", in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). "Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001)."</ref>

Black American psychologists [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954).<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 7: "Production of Black Psychologists in America" (pp. 155–213).</ref>

Positive psychology is the study of factors which contribute to human happiness and well-being, focusing more on people who are currently healthy. In 2010, ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[gratitude journal]]ing and the physical expression of gratitude. Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their effects are thought to be superior to that of [[placebo]]s, especially with regard to helping people with body image problems.

== Research methods ==
{{Main|Psychological research|List of psychological research methods}}

[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data.<ref>John A. Schinka & Wayne F. Velicer, "Volume Preface" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> These include the [[Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient]], the [[analysis of variance]], [[multiple linear regression]], [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[hierarchical linear modeling]]. The measurement and [[operational definition|operationalization]] of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs.

A [[true experiment]] with [[randomized controlled trial|random]] allocation of subjects to conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships. In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.

[[Repeated-measures experiment]]s are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable. The dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.<ref>Evelyn S. Behar & Thomas D. Borkovec, "Psychotherapy Outcome Research", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> Using [[crossover study|crossover design]], researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.

[[Quasi-experimental design]] refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, "Program Evaluation" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.

Experimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific [[hypothesis]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the [[null hypothesis]] that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely used standard ascribes [[statistical significance]] to results which have less than 5% [[p-value|probability of being explained by random variation]].<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], "Experimental Design" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>

=== Other forms of statistical inference ===
[[Statistical survey]]s are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.

[[Neuropsychological tests]], such as the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler scales]] and [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. These can be used in experiments, as in the case of [[lesion]] experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.<ref>Russell M. Bauer, Elizabeth C. Leritz, & Dawn Bowers, "Neuropsychology", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>

[[Observational studies]] analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; [[multivariate statistics]] are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. [[Cross-sectional studies|Cross-sectional]] observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas [[longitudinal studies]] are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as ''selective attrition'' (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).

[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]], or hypothesis formation.<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, "Exploratory Data Analysis" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.<ref>Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, "Meta-Analysis", ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>

=== Technological assays ===
[[File:EEG cap.jpg|alt=|thumb|An EEG recording setup]]
A classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain. [[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature "brain waves": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the [[delta wave]] observed during non-REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rösler | first1 = Frank | title = From Single-Channel Recordings to Brain-Mapping Devices: The Impact of Electroencephalography on Experimental Psychology | url = http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.95 | pmid = 16021767 | pages = 95–117 | access-date = 24 April 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150907211752/http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | archive-date = 7 September 2015 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Newer [[functional neuroimaging]] techniques include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]], both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic [[neural network]] model rather than a localized function model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Joseph M. | last2 = Zaki | first2 = Jamil | title = Functional Neuroimaging and Psychology: What Have You Done for Me Lately? | url = http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518| journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 6| year = 2013 | doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00380 | pages=834–842 | pmid=23469884| s2cid = 12546790 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Berntson | first2 = Gary G. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = Howard C. | title = Neuroimaging as a New Tool in the Toolbox of Psychological Science | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00550.x | pages = 62–67 | s2cid = 14565940 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031185051/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | archive-date = 31 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aue | first1 = Tatjana | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = Leah A. | last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = John T. | title = Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena? | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.12.017 | pages = 10–16 | pmid = 19232374 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109084331/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | archive-date = 9 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Psychiatric interventions such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and drugs also provide information about brain–mind interactions. [[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.

[[File:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]

=== Computer simulation ===
{{See also|Computational cognition}}
Computational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.

=== Animal studies ===
[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]

Animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |access-date= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archive-date= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

Comparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.

=== Qualitative and descriptive research ===
Research designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as ''descriptive research''. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. ''Qualitative research'' is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.

[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or [[critical theory|critiques]] of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--> or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].

[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P. Gage]] survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and is remembered for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior.<ref>[[Phineas Gage#References|Harlow (1868)]], Fig. 2, p. 347 Harlow, John Martyn (1868). "Recovery from the Passage of an Iron Bar through the Head." Publications of the Massachusetts Medical Society 2:327–347 (Republished in Macmillan 2000).</ref>]]

Just as [[Jane Goodall]] studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct [[naturalistic observation]] of ongoing human social, professional, and family life. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.

===Program Evaluation===
[[Program Evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>

Fanelli argues that this is because researchers in "softer" sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases.

==== Replication ====
{{Further|Replication crisis#In psychology}}

Arnett (2008), Altmaier and Hall (2008), and Morgan-Consoli et al.

From an anthropological perspective, scholars applied the WEIRD model to European history, arguing that a powerful Christian Church forced a radical change away from incest and cousin marriages that undermined the role of clans and created individualism in Europe by 1500 CE.  They argue that a distinctive Western psychology thus emerged that valued agency, autonomy, and kindness towards strangers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schulz |first1=Jonathan F. |last2=Bahrami-Rad |first2=Duman |last3=Beauchamp |first3=Jonathan P. |last4=Henrich |first4=Joseph |title=The Church, intensive kinship, and global psychological variation |journal=Science |date=8 November 2019 |volume=366 |issue=6466 |pages=eaau5141 |doi=10.1126/science.aau5141|pmid=31699908 |s2cid=207943472 }}</ref> Historians were not involved in that project, and have since pointed out its historical fallacies regarding an all-powerful Church at too early a point in time, and a rejection of cousin marriage that did not happen.<ref> Brian Connolly, Hans Hummer, and Sara McDougall, "Weird Science: Incest and History" [https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-2020/weird-science-incest-and-history ''Perspectives on History'' (May 2020)]</ref>

== Ethics ==
Ethical standards in the discipline have changed over time. Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] (the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]).

The most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.

=== Humans ===
University psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>

The ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as "Ethical Standards of Psychologists". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between "aspirational" ethical standards and "enforceable" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, "Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>

Some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.<ref name=HandbookJones />

=== Other animals ===
Current ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291–305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.
* An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants. It measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience.<ref>Milgram, Stanley. (1974), Obedience to Authority; An Experimental View. Harpercollins ({{ISBN|0-06-131983-X}}).</ref>
* Comparative psychologist [[Harry Harlow]] drew moral condemnation for [[pit of despair|isolation experiments]] on rhesus macaque monkeys at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in the 1970s.<ref>Blum 1994, p. 95, Blum 2002, pp. 218–219. Blum 1994, p. 95: "... the most controversial experiment to come out of the Wisconsin laboratory, a device that Harlow insisted on calling the 'pit of despair.{{'"}}</ref> The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression. Harlow also devised what he called a "rape rack", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture.<ref>Blum, Deborah. Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection. Perseus Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7382-0278-9}}</ref> In 1974, American literary critic [[Wayne C. Booth]] wrote that, "Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties." He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.<ref>Booth, Wayne C. ''Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent'', Volume 5, of University of Notre Dame, Ward-Phillips lectures in English language and literature, University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 114. Booth is explicitly discussing this experiment. His next sentence is, "His most recent outrage consists of placing monkeys in 'solitary' for twenty days—what he calls a 'vertical chamber apparatus .... designed on an intuitive basis' to produce 'a state of helplessness and hopelessness, sunken in a well of despair.{{'"}}</ref>
