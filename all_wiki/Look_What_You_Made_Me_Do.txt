"'''Look What You Made Me Do'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], released on August 24, 2017, by [[Big Machine Records]], as the [[lead single]] from her sixth studio album ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). Swift wrote and produced the song with her co-producer [[Jack Antonoff]]. "Look What You Made Me Do" is a [[dance-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[electroclash]] song, with lyrics about various issues that built Swift's reputation. [[Right Said Fred]] members [[Richard Fairbrass]], Fred Fairbrass and Rob Manzoli received songwriting credits because its hook samples the melody of their 1991 song "[[I'm Too Sexy]]". Released by Swift after a year of public hiatus, several publications have noted the song to be one of pop music's most memorable comebacks, buoyed by its accompanying music video.

Breaking a string of records, "Look What You Made Me Do" became Swift's fifth number-one single on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song amassed the most plays in a single day on [[Spotify]] and topped the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. It also debuted atop the [[Digital Songs|''Billboard'' Digital Song Sales]] and [[Streaming Songs]] charts, with 353,000 [[Music download|song downloads]] and 84.4 million streams, respectively. The song debuted and peaked at number-one in several countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Scotland and the United Kingdom.  The song received polarized reviews from music critics—some complimented Swift's new direction and praised it as a fierce return, while others labeled the change of style a disappointment. 

The music video, directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], premiered at the [[2017 MTV Video Music Awards]], three days after the song's release. Upon its release on [[YouTube]], the music video garnered 43.2 million views in its first 24 hours, breaking the record for [[List of most viewed online videos in the first 24 hours|the most views in its first 24 hours of release]], at that time; it also broke the [[24-Hour Vevo Record|24-hour Vevo record]], which is now held by Swift's own 2019 single "[[Me!]]". The video garnered critical acclaim, and was ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as one of the best music videos of 2017. As of July 2018, "Look What You Made Me Do" is certified [[RIAA certification|4× Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for exceeding 4 million units in the US. The song has also received platinum or multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, Poland and Sweden, and a diamond certification in Brazil.

|title= "Look What You Made Me Do"
|description="Look What You Made Me Do" is a dark [[dance-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[electroclash]] song, that moves from sparse verses to a [[crescendo]] build in the pre-chorus, and then drops into the [[downtempo]] chorus with a dynamic shift. The chorus is largely [[a capella]] with percussions, sampling the melody of the 1991 song "[[I'm Too Sexy]]" by British group [[Right Said Fred]].}}

[[Maura Johnston]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote a negative review of the song, faulting the "sloppy" lyrics and blaming Swift for not giving a clear context in the lyrics.<ref name="the guardian"/> Lindsay Zolad of [[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] said "Unleashed on a deeply confused public late Thursday night, the song is a strange collage of retro reference points: mid-aughts Gossip Girl placement pop, the soundtrack to Disney's live-action Maleficent, and — yes, really — Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy, except devoid of the self-effacing humor and wit. Yes, the new Taylor Swift song just made me compliment Right Said Fred." Brittany Spanos of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' believed that the song marked a continuation of the feud between Swift and rapper [[Kanye West]]; the latter had previously name-dropped Swift in his song "[[Famous (Kanye West song)|Famous]]" by using the line, "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? / I made that bitch famous".

===Synopsis===
[[File:Taylor Swift - Look What You Made Me Do (music video screenshot).png|left|thumb|The bathtub scene in the music video. The diamonds used were said to be authentic and worth over $10&nbsp;million, and a lone dollar bill can be seen.]]

Swift has said that part of the premise of the video is rooted in the idea that, "If everything you write about me was true, this is how ridiculous it would look."<ref>Apple Music</ref> It is a satirical send-up of media theories about her true intentions that have little validity. The video begins with a [[zombie]] Swift crawling out of a grave, where the [[headstone]] reads "Here Lies Taylor Swift's reputation", and digging another grave for her Met Gala 2014 self. The next scene shows Swift in a bathtub filled with diamonds. She is then seen seated on a throne while snakes surround her and serve tea. Swift later crashes her golden [[Bugatti Veyron]] on a post and sings the song's chorus holding a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] as the [[paparazzi]] take photos. She is also seen swinging inside a golden cage, robbing a streaming company in a cat mask, and leading a motorcycle gang. Afterwards, she gathers a group of women at "Squad U" and dances with a group of men in another room. Then, she is seen standing on top of the wing of a plane in an airport hangar, sawing off the wing in half and spray-painting "reputation" in pink on the side of the plane. At the video's climax, Swift is seen standing on a T-shaped throne while clones of herself (from her past music videos, stage performances and red carpet appearances) struggle and fight against each other trying to reach her. The video concludes with a scene of a line up of surviving Swift clones bowing in the hangar while Swift stands and watches on the wing of the plane. The clones bicker with one another, describing each other as "so fake" and "[[playing the victim]]". The 2009 VMA Swift clone then says "I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative", resulting in the other Swifts yelling at her to "shut up!" in unison.<ref name="rolling-stone-video">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/taylor-swifts-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-is-self-parody-w499753|title=Watch Taylor Swift Mock Herself in Dark 'Look What You Made Me Do' Video|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 27, 2017|access-date=August 31, 2017|archive-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830204641/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/taylor-swifts-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-is-self-parody-w499753|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Yahr|first1=Emily|title=Taylor Swift knows you've been making fun of her.

===Analysis===
True to Swift's tradition, the video contains numerous hidden meanings and references. In the opening scene, there is a subtle "Nils Sjöberg" tombstone shown when Swift is digging up a grave, referencing the pseudonym she used for a songwriting credit on [[Calvin Harris]]' 2016 single "[[This Is What You Came For]]".<ref name="huffpost">{{cite web|title=8 Things You Might Have Missed in Taylor's 'Look What You Made Me Do' Video|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/08/27/8-things-you-might-have-missed-in-taylors-look-what-you-made-me-do-video_a_23187446|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=August 28, 2017|access-date=August 31, 2017|first=Mat|last=Whitehead|archive-date=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831074408/http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/08/27/8-things-you-might-have-missed-in-taylors-look-what-you-made-me-do-video_a_23187446/|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, Swift—masked as a cadaveric version of herself in the "[[Out of the Woods (song)|Out of the Woods]]" music video—was shown digging a grave for herself in the gown worn to the 2014 [[Met Gala]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Acuna |first1=Kirsten |title=We decoded all the different looks in Taylor Swift's music video — here's what they mean |url=https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-looks-2017-8 |access-date=July 6, 2020 |work=Insider |date=August 30, 2017}}</ref> A single dollar bill in the bathtub full of diamonds that she bathes in was also speculated to symbolize the dollar she was awarded for winning a sexual assault trial earlier in 2017.<ref name="huffpost"/> Interpretations for the bathtub scene were contrasting. Some believe that it is a response to media statements teasing that she "cries in a marble bathtub surrounded by pearls."<ref name="bathtub-scene">{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/marcusjones/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-bathtub-jewels|title=Here's Why Some People Are Mad at Taylor Swift's New Video|last=Jones|first=Marcus|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=August 31, 2017|date=August 28, 2017|archive-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830092147/https://www.buzzfeed.com/marcusjones/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-bathtub-jewels|url-status=live}}</ref> Others speculate that the bathtub scene is a jibe at [[Kim Kardashian]], wife of Swift's long-time feuding partner, [[Kanye West]]. Some viewers took the scene as a reference to Kardashian's 2016 robbery, in which she was robbed of jewelry worth over $10&nbsp;million while held at gunpoint at a hotel in [[Paris, France]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Roisin|title=Taylor Swift's diamond bath in the LWYMMD video was worth more than $10&nbsp;million|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-lwymmd-video-diamonds-bath-snake-ring-kim-kardashian-paris-robbery-gun-diss-a7919421.html|access-date=February 25, 2018|work=The Independent|date=August 30, 2017|archive-date=February 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226043015/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-lwymmd-video-diamonds-bath-snake-ring-kim-kardashian-paris-robbery-gun-diss-a7919421.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Serhan|first1=Yasmeen|title=The $10 Million Robbery of Kim Kardashian West|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/10/kim-kardashian-robbery/502673/|access-date=February 25, 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=October 3, 2016|archive-date=February 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226032555/https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/10/kim-kardashian-robbery/502673/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a separate scene, Swift is shown sitting atop a golden throne, where a carving of a phrase "[[Et tu, Brute?]]" could be seen on the armrest, a reference to Shakespeare's drama ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.<ref name="huffpost"/> Swift's infamous title as a "snake" during her hiatus<ref>{{cite web|title=Taylor Swift and snakes: The backstory|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/22/entertainment/taylor-swift-snakes/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=August 23, 2017|access-date=August 31, 2017|first=Lisa Respers|last=France|archive-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830003006/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/22/entertainment/taylor-swift-snakes/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> was also represented when a snake slithers onto the throne to serve Swift some tea. The scene where Swift's car crashes and is surrounded by paparazzi was speculated by some to be a [[Diss (music)|jab]] at [[Katy Perry]], as Swift's hairstyle is similar to Perry's in the scene and the car crash itself is reminiscent of the one in Perry's music video for "[[Unconditionally]]" (2013). The sports car was also suspected to be a reminder of a car in Perry's "[[Waking Up in Vegas]]" (2009) video, which Kahn also directed. However, given the video's theme of mocking the media, the car crash scene likely makes fun of the theory that Swift's real fallout with Perry was a dramatized act for publicity and album material. Swift is ridiculing the idea that she would damage her friendships for business gains, with the car crash being a metaphor for her feud with Perry and the [[Grammy Award]] in her hands in the wreckage symbolizing the awards won from the songs "inspired" by the aforementioned feud. Swift's withdrawal of her entire music catalog from [[streaming media|streaming services]] and the media's claims that she was doing this for greed and to start her own streaming company were hinted when Swift and her crew robbed a streaming company's money vault in the video.<ref name="analysis-1"/><ref name="analysis-2"/>

Swift leading an army of tall, skinny, and robotic women at a "Squad U" gathering poked fun at the media's accusations that her close group of friends were artificial and had unrealistic body shapes.<ref name="huffpost"/> During the second chorus, Swift is seen with eight men, each of whom revealed an "I Heart TS" crop top after unbuttoning a jacket at her command. This scene mocks the idea that Swift forced her then-boyfriend [[Tom Hiddleston]] to wear an "I Heart TS" tank top. During the bridge, Swift stands on a mountain of clones of her past selves, which reiterates that she is leaving behind her "America's Sweetheart" image and embracing her newfound role as an evil "snake". The clones are wearing various noteworthy outfits that Swift herself previously wore. The shirt that her "[[You Belong with Me]]" music video clone wears, however, is slightly different from the original one: this time, the names of her current close friends are scribbled on it.<ref name="analysis-1">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swifts-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-decoded-w499918|title=Taylor Swift's 'Look What You Made Me Do' Video Decoded: 13 Things You Missed|last=Chen|first=Joyce|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=August 31, 2017|date=August 28, 2017|archive-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830233634/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swifts-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-decoded-w499918|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="analysis-2">{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/28/each-and-every-single-dig-that-taylor-swift-makes-in-the-look-what-you-made-me-do-music-video-6883910/|title=Each and every single dig that Taylor Swift makes in the Look What You Made Me Do music video|last=Wood|first=Lucy|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=August 31, 2017|date=August 28, 2017|archive-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830211338/http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/28/each-and-every-single-dig-that-taylor-swift-makes-in-the-look-what-you-made-me-do-music-video-6883910/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The video's ending features an assembly of "old Taylors" in front of a private jet who are talking amongst one another and making snide references to the many false and exaggerated media portrayals of her over the course of her career. These include claims that Swift fakes her classic surprised face at award shows; that her "nice girl" façade masks a truly mean, manipulative personality; accusations that Swift always play the victim instead of taking responsibility for her own actions and decisions; and numerous mentions of her 2016 feud with [[Kanye West]] and [[Kim Kardashian]].

A cover version of "Look What You Made Me Do" was recorded by band Jack Leopards & the Dolphin Club, and produced by Antonoff and Nils Sjöberg, the latter being a [[pseudonym]] that Swift first used as a co-writer for the song "[[This Is What You Came For]]" by [[Calvin Harris]] featuring [[Rihanna]]. The cover was featured in the opening credits of "[[List of Killing Eve episodes#ep23|Beautiful Monster]]", an episode of the television show ''[[Killing Eve]]'' that aired on May 24, 2020, and subsequently released on digital music platforms.
