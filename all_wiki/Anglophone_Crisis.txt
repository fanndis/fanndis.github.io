Britain ceded the area to the [[German Empire|German]] territory of [[Kamerun]] in 1887. Germany had some trouble establishing control over the hinterlands of Victoria, and fought the [[Bafut Wars]] against local [[Fon (title)|fondoms]] until 1907.<ref>The Cameroon Tribune, No. 600, p. 2, 26 December 1996</ref>

Following [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Kamerun was divided between a [[France|French]] and a British [[League of Nations Mandate]]. The French mandate was known as Cameroun, and comprised most of the former German territory. The British mandate was an elongated strip of land along the border of [[Colonial Nigeria]], consisting of Northern Cameroons and Southern Cameroons, including the historical Ambas Bay Protectorate. This territory was organized as [[British Cameroons]].<ref>Lee, Alexander, and Kenneth A. Schultz. ''Comparing British and French colonial legacies: A discontinuity analysis of Cameroon'', p. 10 APSA 2011 Annual Meeting Paper. 2011.</ref>

The British administered the territories through [[indirect rule]], allowing native authorities to administer the population according to their own traditions. In 1953, the Southern Cameroons delegation at a conference in London asked for a separate region. The British agreed, and Southern Cameroons became an autonomous region with its capital still at Buea. Elections were held in 1954 and the parliament met on 1 October 1954, with [[E. M. L. Endeley]] as Premier.<ref>DeLancey, Mark W., and Mark Dike DeLancey (2000): ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'' (3rd ed.). Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press.</ref>

The United Nations organised a [[British Cameroons referendum, 1961|plebiscite in the region on 11 February 1961]] which put two alternatives to the people: union with Nigeria or union with Cameroon. The third option, independence, was opposed by the British representative to the UN Trusteeship Council, [[Andrew Cohen (statesman)|Sir Andrew Cohen]], and as a result was not listed. In the plebiscite, 60% of voters in the Northern Cameroons voted for union with Nigeria, while 70% of voters in the Southern Cameroons opted for union with Cameroon.<ref>Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p177 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}</ref> The results owed partly to a fear of domination by much larger Nigeria.<ref>Amaazee, Victor Bong.

Southern Cameroons became part of Cameroon on 1 October 1961 as "West Cameroon", with its own [[List of Prime Ministers of Cameroon|prime minister]]. However, the English-speaking peoples of the Southern Cameroons did not believe that they were fairly treated by the French-speaking government of the country. Then-president [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] feared that Southern Cameroons would secede from the union, taking its natural resources with it. Following a French Cameroon [[Cameroonian constitutional referendum, 1972|unilateral referendum]] on 20 May 1972, a new constitution was adopted in Cameroon which replaced the [[Federal republic|federal]] state with a [[unitary state]], and also gave more power to the president.<ref>[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cm.html Elections in Cameroon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903053954/http://africanelections.tripod.com/cm.html |date=3 September 2011 }} African Elections Database</ref> Southern Cameroons lost its autonomous status and became the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest Region]] and the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]] of the Republic of Cameroon. Pro-independence groups claimed that this violated the constitution, as the majority of deputies from West Cameroon had not consented to legitimize the constitutional changes.<ref>Roger, Jules, and Sombaye Eyango.

African Books Collective, 2009.</ref> Shortly afterwards, French Cameroun's political leadership changed the constitution again, appointed French-speaking Paul Biya as Prime Minister and successor to Ahmadou Ahidjo ostensibly to deny the Speaker of the House of Assembly [[Salomon Tandeng Muna]] - an Anglophone the possibility of becoming president by succession.

In a memorandum dated 20 March 1985, Anglophone lawyer and President of the Cameroon Bar Association [[Fongum Gorji Dinka]] wrote that the Cameroonian government led by [[Paul Biya]] was unconstitutional and announced the former Southern Cameroons should become independent as the Republic of Ambazonia. Dinka was incarcerated the following January without trial.<ref>Nkwi; Nchoji, Paul (2015). The Anthropology of Africa: Challenges for the 21st Century (illustrated, reprint ed.), p. 478.

In 1993, representatives of Anglophone groups convened the first All Anglophone Conference (AAC1) in Buea. The conference issued the "Buea Declaration", which called for constitutional amendments to restore the 1961 federation. This was followed by the second All Anglophone Conference (AAC2) in [[Bamenda]] in 1994. This conference issued the "Bamenda Declaration", which stated that if the federal state was not restored within a reasonable time, Southern Cameroons would declare its independence. The AAC was renamed the Southern Cameroons Peoples Conference (SCPC), and later the Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO), with the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] (SCNC) as the executive governing body. Younger activists formed the Southern Cameroons Youth League (SCYL) in Buea on 28 May 1995. The SCNC sent a delegation, led by John Foncha, to the United Nations, which was received on 1 June 1995 and presented a petition against the 'annexation' of the Southern Cameroons by French Cameroon. This was followed by a signature referendum the same year, which the organisers claim produced a 99% vote in favour of independence with 315,000 people voting.<ref>[http://www.ambazania.org/referendum11.htm Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230920/http://www.ambazania.org/referendum11.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

SCNC activities were routinely disrupted by police.<ref name=Murison>{{cite book|title=Africa South of the Sahara 2004|year=2003|publisher=Europa Publications|pages=163–164|isbn=9781857431834|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jj4J-AXGDaQC&pg=PA163|editor=Katharine Murison}}</ref> On 23 March 1997, about ten people were killed in a raid on a gendarme camp in [[Bamenda]].

In October 1999, when many of the accused were found guilty in the 1997 trial, the faction led by Mukete became more assertive. On 1 October 1999, militants took over Radio Buea to proclaim the independence of Southern Cameroons, but failed to do so before security forces intervened.<ref>Elong, Eric Ebolo.

In 2006, Nigeria ceded the [[Bakassi|Bakassi Peninsula]] to Cameroon, ending a decade-long territorial dispute. Local militias opposing the border change took up arms against the Cameroonian government, starting the [[Bakassi conflict]]. The conflict was a sea-based insurgency where the rebels used pirate tactics, attacking ships, abducting sailors and carrying out seaborne raids as far away as [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]] and [[Douala]]. While some movements (such as [[Bakassi Movement for Self-Determination|BAMOSD]]) sought to make Bakassi an independent state, others came to tie their cause to that of Ambazonia. In November 2007, the "Liberators of the Southern Cameroon People", a previously unknown group, killed 21 Cameroonian soldiers. Most militias in Bakassi laid down their arms in September 2009.<ref name="bakassi">[https://www.refworld.org/docid/4cf4dafc2.html Cameroon Rebels Threaten Security in Oil-Rich Gulf of Guinea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329001435/https://www.refworld.org/docid/4cf4dafc2.html |date=29 March 2019 }}, Ref World, 24 November 2010.

Two weeks into the protests, more than 100 protesters had been arrested, and six were reported dead. Unconfirmed videos released over social media showed various violent scenes, including the beating of protesters by policemen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38078238|title=Arrests in Cameroon language protests|date=23 November 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=13 September 2017|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911183649/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38078238|archive-date=11 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In January 2017, the Cameroonian government set up a committee to initiate a dialogue with the lawyer activists. The lawyers refused to talk, demanding that all arrested activists be released before any dialogue. The lawyers submitted a draft for a federal state, and the government responded by banning their movements altogether. The protesters were now openly regarded as a security threat by the Cameroonian government, and more arrests followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thestandardtribune.com/2017/01/17/the-government-just-banned-scnc-and-consortium/|title=The Government Just Banned SCNC and Consortium ‹ The Standard Tribune|website=thestandardtribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903034357/http://thestandardtribune.com/2017/01/17/the-government-just-banned-scnc-and-consortium/|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The government also implemented an Internet blockade in cities across the Anglophone regions.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=http://pctechmag.com/2017/01/just-in-internet-blocked-in-bamenda-regions-of-cameroon/|title=JUST IN: Internet Blocked in Bamenda Regions of Cameroon|date=18 January 2016|website=pctechmag.com|access-date=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120103538/http://pctechmag.com/2017/01/just-in-internet-blocked-in-bamenda-regions-of-cameroon/|archive-date=20 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At this point, the crisis began to attract international responses. More than 13,000 Anglophone Cameroonians living in Maryland protested against the Cameroonian government crackdown. On 27 June, United States Congressman [[Anthony G.

The government crackdown on the protests contributed to mainstream separatist movements. In September 2017, Ambazonian separatists began to take up arms against the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/english-speakers-protest-in-cameroon-demand-equal-rights-amid-calls-for-secession/a-40649852|title=English speakers protest in Cameroon, demand equal rights amid calls for secession – News – DW – 22.09.2017|website=DW.COM|access-date=5 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125091747/http://www.dw.com/en/english-speakers-protest-in-cameroon-demand-equal-rights-amid-calls-for-secession/a-40649852|archive-date=25 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 1 October, the [[Southern Cameroons Ambazonia Consortium United Front]] (SCACUF), an umbrella movement consisting of several independence movements, unilaterally declared the independence of Ambazonia. This declaration was followed by mass demonstrations across the Anglophone regions. The separatists strategically chose this date, as it is the anniversary for the unification of Cameroon and Southern Cameroons. SCACUF would later transform itself into the [[Interim Government of Ambazonia]] (IG). Several months into the war, the IG would reject the idea of an armed struggle, preferring instead a diplomatic campaign and [[civil disobedience]]. This stance would eventually change.<ref>[https://allafrica.com/stories/201712220550.html Cameroon: Anglophone Crisis - Dialogue Remains the Only Viable Solution], AllAfrica, 7 December 2017.

{{Main|Timeline of the Anglophone Crisis (2019)}}

2019 started off with further escalation of the war. On 6 January, Anglophone Cameroonians in the diaspora organized protests to mark the first anniversary of the arrest of the Ambazonian leadership. Throughout the day, armed clashes took place in [[Muyuka]], [[Bafut, Cameroon|Bafut]]. Mundum and [[Mamfe]].<ref>[https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/cameroon-protests-ghost-towns-marked-anniversary-celebrations-of-detained-ambazonia-leaders/ Cameroon: Protests, ghost towns mark anniversary celebrations of detained ‘Ambazonia leaders’] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107170427/https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/cameroon-protests-ghost-towns-marked-anniversary-celebrations-of-detained-ambazonia-leaders/ |date=7 January 2019 }}, Journal du Cameroun, 7 January 2019.

January also saw the start of the trials of the Ambazonian leaders, including Ayuk Tabe, who had spent a year in prison. The trial was complicated by all the Ambazonian leaders rejecting their Cameroonian nationality, which the court ultimately ignored. The leaders then refused to be tried by Francophone judges. On 1 March, the trial took a diplomatic twist; a Nigerian court determined that the deportation of the Ambazonian leadership had been unconstitutional, and ordered their return to Nigeria. Nevertheless, the trial resumed.<ref name="mar12019abuja">[https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/cameroon-nigerian-court-orders-return-of-ambazonia-leaders/ Cameroon: Nigerian Court orders return of Ambazonia leaders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301205941/https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/cameroon-nigerian-court-orders-return-of-ambazonia-leaders/ |date=1 March 2019 }}, Journal du Cameroun, 1 March 2019.

A [[2020 Cameroonian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] was held in February, and was marked by unprecedented escalation on both sides. Hundreds of additional troops were deployed to combat separatist attempts to sabotage the election, while the separatists abducted 120 politicians within the two weeks preceding the election. Efforts by the Cameroonian government to prevent a repeat of the debacle surrounding the 2018 presidential election ultimately failed, as the turnout in the Anglophone regions was very low. The Ambazonians, who claimed that 98 percent of the population boycotted the election, hailed this as a great victory.<ref name="cnafeb92020">[http://cameroonnewsagency.com/low-turnout-frustrates-election-in-north-west-south-west-regions/ Low Turnout Frustrates Election In North West, South West Regions], Cameroon News Agency, 9 February 2020.

At the start of the war, the separatists struggled with gaining access to firearms, having to rely on [[Rifle|hunting rifles]] and in some cases single-shot pistols. As the war went on, they gradually gained limited access to some more sophisticated weapons, capturing some from the Cameroonian Army and buying some in Nigeria (where they enjoyed the support of officers in the Nigerian Army). They also benefitted from fundraising campaigns (including the introduction of their own [[cryptocurrency]], the [[AmbaCoin]]), launched by diaspora activists to purchase guns for the separatist militias.

Retired American diplomat [[Herman Jay Cohen]] has argued that Cameroon's military approach to the conflict plays straight into the strategy of the separatists.

According to Millan Atam, chairperson of the Southern Cameroonians Congress of the People, the separatists are building up support for their cause through two distinct phases. The first phase was to build internal capability to resist the Cameroonian Army and raise faith in the cause. Once a significant portion of the population of Southern Cameroons clearly wanted separation, the separatists would approach the international community with their cause.<ref>[http://www.thedailyvox.co.za/black-on-black-colonialism-the-divide-between-francophone-cameroon-and-anglophone-ambazonia-nolwandle-zondi/ Black-On-Black Colonialism: The Divide Between Francophone Cameroon And Anglophone Ambazonia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608004454/http://www.thedailyvox.co.za/black-on-black-colonialism-the-divide-between-francophone-cameroon-and-anglophone-ambazonia-nolwandle-zondi |date=8 June 2018 }}, The Daily Vox, 4 June 2018.
