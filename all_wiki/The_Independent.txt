'''''The Independent''''' is a British [[newspaper]] that was established in 1986 as a national morning printed paper and is now an [[online newspaper]] only. Nicknamed the ''Indy'', it began as a [[broadsheet]] and changed to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-launches-tabloid-version-to-give-readers-a-choice-581355.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=27 September 2003 | title='The Independent' launches tabloid version to give readers a choice}}</ref> The last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016, leaving only the online edition.<ref name="BBC ind stop">{{cite news|title=Independent to cease as print edition |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35561145|access-date=12 February 2016 |work=[[BBC News]]|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>

==History==

===1986 to 1990===
Launched in 1986, the first issue of ''The Independent'' was published on 7 October in [[broadsheet]] format.<ref name="Griffiths">Dennis Griffiths (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422–1992'', London & Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p. 330</ref> It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by [[Andreas Whittam Smith]], [[Stephen Glover (columnist)|Stephen Glover]] and [[Matthew Symonds]]. All three partners were former journalists at ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' who had left the paper towards the end of [[Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell|Lord Hartwell]]'s ownership. [[Marcus Sieff]] was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing, and Whittam Smith took control of the paper.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glover|first=Stephen|title=The Independent: Reflections on the last 20 years|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-reflections-on-the-last-20-years-418944.html|access-date=3 December 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 October 2006}}</ref>

The paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in British newspaper publishing. [[Rupert Murdoch]] was challenging long-accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the [[Wapping dispute]]. Consequently, production costs could be reduced which, it was said at the time,{{by whom|date=October 2016}} created openings for more competition. As a result of controversy around Murdoch's move to Wapping, the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside. ''The Independent'' attracted some of the staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company's new headquarters. Launched with the advertising slogan "It is. Are you?", and challenging both ''[[The Guardian]]'' for centre-left readers and ''[[The Times]]'' as the newspaper of record, ''The Independent'' reached a circulation of over 400,000 by 1989.

Competing in a moribund market, ''The Independent'' sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as, within a few years, a price war in the market sector.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} When ''The Independent'' launched ''The Independent on Sunday'' in 1990, sales were less than anticipated, partly due to the launch of the ''[[Sunday Correspondent]]'' four months prior, although this direct rival closed at the end of November 1990. Some aspects of production merged with the main paper, although the Sunday paper retained a largely distinct editorial staff.

===1990–1999 ===
In the 1990s, ''The Independent'' was faced with price cutting by the Murdoch titles, and started an advertising campaign accusing ''The Times'' and ''The Daily Telegraph'' of reflecting the views of their proprietors, Rupert Murdoch and [[Conrad Black]]. It featured spoofs of the other papers' [[Masthead (British publishing)|mastheads]] with the words ''The Rupert Murdoch'' or ''The Conrad Black'', with ''The Independent'' below the main title.

{{notatypo|Newspaper Publishing}} had financial problems. A number of other media companies were interested in the paper. [[Tony O'Reilly]]'s media group and [[Trinity Mirror|Mirror Group Newspapers]] (MGN) had bought a stake of about a third each by mid-1994. In March 1995, Newspaper Publishing was restructured with a rights issue, splitting the shareholding into O'Reilly's [[Independent News & Media]] (43%), [[Trinity Mirror|MGN]] (43%), and [[PRISA|Prisa]] (publisher of ''[[El País]]'') (12%).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Justin|last2=Williams|first2=Andrew|last3=Franklin|first3=Bob|last4=Thomas|first4=James|last5=Mosdell|first5=Nick|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/jomec/resources/QualityIndependenceofBritishJournalism.pdf|title=The Quality and Independence of British Journalism: Tracking the Changes Over 20 Years|publisher=Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University|location=Cardiff|page=61}}</ref>

In April 1996, there was another refinancing, and in March 1998, O'Reilly bought the other shares of the company for £30&nbsp;million, and assumed the company's debt. Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News, [[Andrew Marr]] was appointed editor of ''The Independent'', and [[Rosie Boycott]] became editor of ''The Independent on Sunday''. Marr introduced a dramatic if short-lived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure, partly as a result of a limited promotional budget. Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book, ''My Trade''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/my-trade-a-short-history-of-british-journalism-by-andrew-marr-6161917.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=My Trade: A short history of British journalism by Andrew Marr | date=12 September 2004}}</ref>

Boycott left in April 1998 to join the ''[[Daily Express]]'', and Marr left in May 1998, later becoming the [[BBC]]'s political editor. [[Simon Kelner]] was appointed as the editor. By this time the circulation had fallen below 200,000. Independent News spent heavily to increase circulation, and the paper went through several redesigns. While circulation increased, it did not approach the level which had been achieved in 1989, or restore profitability. Job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists and the quality of the product.<ref name="Mad eyes">{{cite news|last=Lelic|first=Sarah|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518124835/http://www.mad.co.uk/Logon/ArticleLogon.aspx?uiArticleID=ef7c2624-7002-45f7-96ed-21a040523aef&uiNavigationItemID=&uiPageID=8453a00f-9d1a-404a-beda-339905b6b8b4&PipelinedPage=%2FMain%2FNews%2FArticlex%2Fef7c2624700245f796ed21a040523aef%2FINM-eyes-emIndependentem-profit.html&PipelinedQueryString=uiArticleID%3Def7c2624-7002-45f7-96ed-21a040523aef%26uiNavigationItemID%3Dd8f9fd23-813a-47b2-9696-31d9ca23a265%26|archive-date=18 May 2007|url=http://www.mad.co.uk/Logon/ArticleLogon.aspx?uiArticleID=ef7c2624-7002-45f7-96ed-21a040523aef&uiNavigationItemID=&uiPageID=8453a00f-9d1a-404a-beda-339905b6b8b4&PipelinedPage=/Main/News/Articlex/ef7c2624700245f796ed21a040523aef/INM-eyes-emIndependentem-profit.html&PipelinedQueryString=uiArticleID%3def7c2624-7002-45f7-96ed-21a040523aef%26uiNavigationItemID%3dd8f9fd23-813a-47b2-9696-31d9ca23a265%26|title=INM eyes Independent profit|url-access=subscription |publisher=mad.co.uk|date=19 September 2006|access-date=28 November 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===2000–2009 ===
Ivan Fallon, on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at ''The Sunday Times'', replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News & Media in July 2002. By mid-2004, the newspaper was losing £5&nbsp;million per year. A gradual improvement meant that by 2006, circulation was at a nine-year high.<ref name="Mad eyes" />

In November 2008, following further staff cuts, production was moved to Northcliffe House, in Kensington High Street, the headquarters of [[Associated Newspapers Ltd|Associated Newspapers]].<ref name="Northcliffe move">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/28/independent-titles-associated-newspapers-northcliffe-house |title= Independent titles to relocate to Associated Newspapers HQ |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date =28 November 2008 |first=Mark |last=Sweney |date=28 November 2008}}</ref> The two newspaper groups' editorial, management and commercial operations remained separate, but they shared services including security, information technology, switchboard and payroll.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===2010–2016 ===
On 25 March 2010, Independent News & Media sold the newspaper to a new company owned by the family of [[Russian oligarchs|Russian oligarch]] [[Alexander Lebedev]] for a nominal £1 fee and £9.25m over the next 10 months, choosing this option over closing ''The Independent'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'', which would have cost £28m and £40m respectively, due to long-term contracts. Alexander's son Evgeny became Chairman of the new company, with Alexander becoming a board director.<ref name="i2010-03-25" /><ref name=bintliff>{{cite news |last=Bintliff |first=Esther |title=Lebedev scoops up The Independent for £1 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4081652-373c-11df-b542-00144feabdc0.html |access-date=20 September 2011 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=25 March 2010 |first2=Ben |last2=Fenton |location=London}}</ref> In 2009, Lebedev had bought a controlling stake in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]''.

In July 2011, ''The Independent''{{'}}s columnist [[Johann Hari]] was stripped of the [[Orwell Prize]] he had won in 2008 after claims, to which Hari later admitted,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hari|first1=Johann|title=A personal apology|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html|work=The Independent|date=15 September 2011}}</ref> of plagiarism and inaccuracy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johann Hari: George Orwell prize 'stripping' announcement delays amid plagiarism row|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/8660473/Johann-Hari-George-Orwell-prize-stripping-announcement-delays-amid-plagiarism-row.html|work=Telegraph.co.uk|language=en}}</ref> In January 2012, [[Chris Blackhurst]], editor of ''The Independent'', told the [[Leveson inquiry]] that the scandal had "severely damaged" the newspaper's reputation. He nevertheless told the inquiry that Hari would return as a columnist in "four to five weeks".<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Carroll|first1=Lisa|title=Independent editor: Johann Hari scandal 'severely damaged' paper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/10/independent-editor-johann-hari-scandal|work=The Guardian|date=10 January 2012}}</ref> Hari later announced that he would not return to ''The Independent''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Journalist Johann Hari rejects Independent return|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-16663180|work=BBC News|date=21 January 2012}}</ref> [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]] contrasted ''The Independent''{{'}}s reaction to the scandal unfavourably with the reaction of American newspapers to similar incidents such as the [[Jayson Blair]] case, which led to resignations of editors, "deep soul-searching", and "new standards of exactitude being imposed".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Foreman|first1=Jonathan|title=Dirty Hari – Commentary Magazine|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/dirty-hari/|work=Commentary Magazine}}</ref> The historian [[Guy Walters]] suggested that Hari's fabrications had been an open secret amongst the newspaper's staff and that their internal inquiry was a "facesaving exercise".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walters|first1=Guy|title=An Open Letter to Andreas Whittam Smith|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/guy-walters/2011/07/johann-hari-independent-prize|work=www.newstatesman.com|language=en}}</ref> A proportion of articles are now behind a pay wall, that section is titled, 'Independent Minds'.

''The Independent'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'' endorsed "Remain" in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum of 2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/the-right-choice-is-to-remain-a7090326.html|title=The right choice is to remain|date=19 June 2016|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref>

=== From 2016 ===
In March 2016 ''The Independent'' decided to close its print edition and become an [[online newspaper]]; the last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016. ''The Independent on Sunday'' published its last print edition on 20 March 2016 and was closed following that.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35561145|title=Independent to cease as print edition|date=12 February 2016|publisher=BBC News|access-date=22 February 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Content==

===Format and design===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Independent front page.jpg|thumb|right|''The Independent''{{'}}s front page,<br />15 February 2014]] -->
''The Independent'' began publishing as a broadsheet, in a series of celebrated designs. The final version was designed by Carroll, Dempsey and Thirkell following a commission by [[Nicholas Garland]] who, along with [[Alexander Chancellor]], was unhappy with designs produced by Raymond Hawkey and Michael McGuiness – on seeing the proposed designs, Chancellor had said "I thought we were joining a serious paper". The first edition was designed and implemented by Michael Crozier, who was Executive Editor, Design and Picture, from pre-launch in 1986 to 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Making-Independent-Michael-Crozier/9780340500613|title=The Making of the "Independent" : Michael Crozier : 9780340500613|website=www.bookdepository.com|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref>

From September 2003, the paper was produced in both broadsheet and tabloid-sized versions, with the same content in each. The tabloid edition was termed "compact" to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with "tabloid" newspapers in the UK.<ref name="Bus Week">{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004121_9347_db016.htm|title=British papers shrink to conquer|last=Carney|first=Beth|date=1 December 2004|work=Business Week |access-date=2 May 2009}}</ref> After launching in the London area and then in [[North West England]],<ref name="Indy northwest">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-announces-launch-of-compact-version-in-northwest-734372.html|title=The Independent announces launch of compact version in North-west|date=3 November 2003|work=The Independent |location=UK |access-date=2 May 2009 }}</ref> the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the UK. Soon afterwards, Rupert Murdoch's ''Times'' followed suit, introducing its own tabloid-sized version.<ref name="Brand Rep">{{cite news|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/197504/Times-tabloid-pushes-sales-50000/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|title=Times tabloid pushes up sales|last=Billings|first=Claire|date=5 December 2003|publisher=Brand Republic|access-date=2 May 2009}}</ref> Prior to these changes, ''The Independent'' had a daily circulation of around 217,500, the lowest of any major national British daily, a figure that climbed by 15% as of March 2004 (to 250,000). Throughout much of 2006, circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million. On 14 May 2004, ''The Independent'' produced its last weekday broadsheet, having stopped producing a Saturday broadsheet edition in January. ''The Independent on Sunday'' published its last simultaneous broadsheet on 9 October 2005, and thereafter followed a compact design until the print edition was discontinued.

On 12 April 2005, ''The Independent'' redesigned its layout to a more European feel, similar to France's ''[[Libération]]''. The redesign was carried out by a Barcelona-based design studio. The weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper, double-page feature articles became common in the main news sections, and there were revisions to the front and back covers.<ref name="Guard redesign">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/12/theindependent.pressandpublishing|title=Independent redesign takes it forward|last=Brook|first=Stephen|date=12 April 2005|work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=2 May 2009 }}</ref> A new second section, "Extra", was introduced on 25 April 2006. It is similar to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s "G2" and ''The Times''{{'}}s "Times2", containing features, reportage and games, including [[sudoku]]. In June 2007, ''The Independent on Sunday'' consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business, and a magazine focusing on life and culture.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=37809|title=News magazine look for relaunched Independent on Sunday|author=Dominic Ponsford|magazine=Press Gazette|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229200804/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=37809|archive-date=29 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 23 September 2008, the main newspaper became full-colour, and "Extra" was replaced by an "Independent Life Supplement" focusing on different themes each day.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/23/theindependent.pressandpublishing |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Independent goes full colour |first=Oliver |last=Luft |date=23 September 2008 |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref>

Three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by [[Alexander Lebedev]] and [[Evgeny Lebedev]] in 2010, the paper was relaunched with another redesign on 20 April. The new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout "Viewspaper" section, which contained the paper's comment and feature articles.<ref name="pgazette">{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=45328&c=1 |title=Independent relaunch |last=Ponsford |first=Dominic |date=20 April 2010 |work=Press Gazette |access-date=20 April 2010 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422175929/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=45328&c=1 |archive-date=22 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> From 26 October 2010, the same day as its sister paper, ''i'', was launched, ''The Independent'' was printed on slightly thicker paper than before and ceased to be full-colour throughout, with many photographs and pictures (though none of those used in adverts) being printed in black and white only. On 11 October 2011, ''The Independent'' unveiled yet another new look, featuring a red, sans-serif masthead. In November 2013, the whole newspaper was overhauled again, including new custom fonts and a vertical masthead in black.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Front pages===
Following the 2003 switch in format, ''The Independent'' became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages, which frequently relied on images, graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content. For example, following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005, it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund, and following the publication of the [[Hutton Inquiry|Hutton Report]] into the death of British government scientist [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], its front page simply carried the word "Whitewash?"<ref name="PR week">{{cite news|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/article/521627/Independent-breaks-front-page-mould-again-earthquake-appeal-coupon |title=Independent breaks front page mould again |last=Whitehead |first=Jennifer |date=12 October 2005 |work=[[PRWeek]] |access-date=1 May 2009 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214001222/http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/article/521627/Independent-breaks-front-page-mould-again-earthquake-appeal-coupon |archive-date=14 February 2012 }}</ref> In 2003, the paper's editor, Simon Kelner, was named "Editor of the Year" at the ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' awards, partly in recognition of, according to the judges, his "often arresting and imaginative front-page designs".<ref name="Indy award">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/independent-editor-wins-top-award-from-what-the-papers-say-judges-for-second-time-576954.html |title=Independent editor wins top award |last=Burrell |first=Ian |date=18 December 2003 |work=The Independent |access-date=1 May 2009 | location=London}}</ref> In 2008, however, as he was stepping down as editor, he stated that it was possible to "overdo the formula" and that the style of the paper's front pages perhaps needed "reinvention".<ref name="Guard Kelner">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/05/theindependent.pressandpublishing |title=Kelner says it's time to rethink "viewspaper" front pages |last=Brook |first=Stephen |date=5 June 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=1 May 2009 }}</ref>

Under the subsequent editorship of [[Chris Blackhurst]], the campaigning, poster-style front pages were scaled back in favour of more conventional news stories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/chris-blackhurst-independents-new-editor-lays-line/1100483|title=Chris Blackhurst: The Independent's new editor lays it on the line|access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref>

===Online presence===
On 23 January 2008, ''The Independent'' relaunched its online edition, [https://www.independent.co.uk/ www.independent.co.uk].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/service/welcome-to-the-independents-new-website-771573.html "Welcome to The Independent's new website"].

The paper launched [[podcast]] programmes such as "The Independent Music Radio Show", "The Independent Travel Guides", "The Independent Sailing Podcasts", and "The Independent Video Travel Guides". Since 2009, the website has carried short video news bulletins provided by the [[Al Jazeera English]] news channel.<ref name="Guard al Jazeera">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/15/independent-al-jazeera-video-tie-up |title=Independent in al-Jazeera video tie-up |last=Fitzsimmons |first=Caitlin |date=15 January 2009 |work=guardian.co.uk (web only) |access-date=1 May 2009 |location=London}}</ref>

In 2014, ''The Independent'' launched a sister website, ''i100'', a "shareable" journalism site with similarities to [[Reddit]] and [[Upworthy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/-not-just-another-newspaper-website-why-the-independent-launched-i100/s2/a557405/|title=Why The Independent launched the new user-focused i100|work=journalism.co.uk}}</ref>

==Political views==
When the paper was established in 1986, the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from ''The Times'' and ''The Daily Telegraph''. It has been seen as leaning to the left wing of the political spectrum, making it more a competitor to ''[[The Guardian]]''. However, ''The Independent'' tends to take a [[Liberalism|liberal]], pro-market stance on economic issues.<ref name="Wilby"/> The ''Independent on Sunday'' referred to itself as a "proudly liberal newspaper".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/editorial-a-liberal-gamble-too-far-8468336.html |title= Editorial: a liberal gamble too far |date= 27 January 2013 |work=The Independent |location =London}}</ref>

The paper took a strong editorial position against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and aspects of US and UK foreign policy related to the [[War on Terrorism]] following the {{nowrap|[[11 September attacks]]}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In addition, ''The Independent'' has highlighted what it refers to as [[war crime]]s being committed by pro-government forces in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur]] region of Sudan.<ref name="Indy Darfur">{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/darfur-the-evidence-of-war-crimes-459922.html |title=Darfur: The evidence of war crimes |last=Grice |first=Andrew |date=2 August 2007 |work=The Independent |access-date=1 May 2009 |location=London}}</ref>

The paper has been a strong supporter of [[electoral reform]].<ref name=lead2010may5/> The paper has also taken strong positions on environmental issues, campaigned against the introduction of [[British national identity card|ID cards]], and campaigned against the restriction of mass immigration to the UK.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1997, ''The Independent on Sunday'' launched a campaign for the decriminalisation of cannabis. Ten years later, it reversed itself, arguing that skunk, the cannabis strain  "smoked by the majority of young Britons" in 2007, had become "25 times stronger than [[hashish|resin]] sold a decade ago".<ref name="Indy cannabis">{{cite news |last1=Owen |first1=Jonathan |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/cannabis-an-apology-440730.html |title=Were we out of our minds?

In 2007, [[Alan Rusbridger]], editor of ''The Guardian'', said of ''The Independent'': "The emphasis on views, not news, means that the reporting is rather thin, and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/what-happened-when-the-guardian-editor-met-piers-morgan-442870.html |title= What happened when the Guardian editor met Piers Morgan |work=The Independent |author=Morgan, Piers |location =London |date= 2 April 2007}}</ref> In a 12 June 2007 speech, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] called ''The Independent'' a "viewspaper", saying it "was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news. That was why it was called the Independent. Today it is avowedly a viewspaper not merely a newspaper".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6744581.stm |title= Blair on the media |work=BBC News |date=12 June 2007}}</ref> ''The Independent'' criticised Blair's comments the following day<ref>Grice, Andrew (13 June 2007).

A leader published on the day of the [[2008 London mayoral election]] compared the candidates and said that, if the newspaper had a vote, it would vote first for the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] candidate, [[Sian Berry]], noting the similarity between her priorities and those of ''The Independent'', and secondly, with "rather heavy heart", for the incumbent, [[Ken Livingstone]].<ref name="London endorsement">{{cite news |title=If newspapers had a vote, this one would put its cross beside...

An [[Ipsos MORI]] poll estimated that in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], 44% of regular readers voted [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 32% voted [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2476&view=wide|title=Ipsos MORI}}</ref> and 14% voted [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], compared to 23%, 29%, and 36%, respectively, of the overall electorate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voting by Newspaper Readership 1992–2010 |url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2476/Voting-by-Newspaper-Readership-19922010.aspx?view=wide|work=Ipsos MORI General Election aggregates|publisher=Ipsos MORI|access-date=21 September 2011|author=Ipsos MORI|author-link=Ipsos MORI|date=24 May 2010}}</ref> On the eve of the 2010 general election, ''The Independent'' supported the Liberal Democrats, arguing that
<blockquote>
[T]hey are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties, sound economics, international co-operation on the great global challenges and, of course, fundamental electoral reform. These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear. That is why we argue that there is a strong case for progressively minded voters to lend their support to the Liberal Democrats wherever there is a clear opportunity for that party to win.<ref name=lead2010may5>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-this-historic-opportunity-must-not-be-missed-1962527.html |title= This historic opportunity must not be missed |date= 5 May 2010 |work=The Independent |location =London}}</ref>
</blockquote>
However, before the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], ''The Independent on Sunday'' desisted from advising its readers how to vote, writing that "this does not mean that we are a bloodless, value-free news-sheet. We have always been committed to social justice", but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to "make up [their] own mind about whether you agree with us or not". Rather than support a particular party, the paper urged all its reader to vote as "a responsibility of common citizenship".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/general-election-2015-every-vote-matters--as-a-responsibility-of-citizenship-10221727.html|title=General Election 2015: Every vote matters – as a responsibility of|date=2 May 2015 |work=The Independent}}</ref> On 4 May 2015, the weekday version of ''The Independent'' said that a continuation of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/in-defence-of-liberal-democracy-10224221.html|title=Editorial: In defence of liberal democracy|work=The Independent|date=4 May 2015}}</ref>

At the end of July 2018, ''The Independent'' led a campaign they called the "Final Say" – a [[change.org]] petition by editor [[Christian Broughton]], for a binding referendum on the [[Brexit]] deal between the UK and the European Union.<ref name="People's Vote">{{cite news | last = The Independent Voices | title = The referendum gave sovereignty to the British people, so now they deserve a final say on the Brexit deal | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/referendum-final-say-no-deal-brexit-peoples-vote-chequers-white-paper-will-of-british-people-a8461331.html | work = The Independent | date = 24 July 2018 |no-pp=yes |page=Editorial|access-date=30 July 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===''The Independent on Sunday''===
''The Independent on Sunday'' (''IoS'') was the Sunday sister newspaper of ''The Independent''. It ceased to exist in 2016, the last edition being published on 20 March; the daily paper ceasing print publication six days later.

===The ''i''===
{{Main|i (newspaper)}}
In October 2010, the ''i'', a compact sister newspaper, was launched. The ''i'' is a separate newspaper but uses some of the same material. It was later sold to regional newspaper company [[Johnston Press]], becoming that publisher's flagship national newspaper. The ''i''{{'}}s online presence, ''i100'', was restyled as ''indy100'' and retained by Independent News & Media.
