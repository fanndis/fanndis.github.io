Schumer served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1981 to 1999, first representing [[New York's 16th congressional district]] before being redistricted to the [[New York's 10th congressional district|10th congressional district]] in 1983 and [[New York's 9th congressional district|9th congressional district]] ten years later. In 1998, was elected as a U.S. Senator after defeating three-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Al D'Amato]].

==State assembly and congressional tenure==

In 1974, Schumer ran for and was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]], filling a seat previously held by Schumer's mentor, Congressman [[Stephen Solarz]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/nyregion/washington-at-work-side-by-side-by-solarz-and-schumer-a-rivalry.html|title=Washington at Work; Side by Side by Solarz and Schumer: A Rivalry|first=Richard L.|last=Berke|date=April 7, 1991|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=February 19, 2017|issn=0362-4331|via=}}</ref> Schumer served three terms, from 1975 to 1981, sitting in the [[181st New York State Legislature|181st]], [[182nd New York State Legislature|182nd]] and [[183rd New York State Legislature]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/s000148/|title=Chuck Schumer|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 4, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407215329/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/s000148/|archivedate=April 7, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S000148|title=Schumer, Charlie Ellis (Chuck)|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=April 4, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://schumer.senate.gov/SchumerWebsite/about_chuck/time-popups/time-nys_assembly.html|title=About Chuck: Timeline|website=schumer.senate.gov |accessdate=April 4, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327024614/http://schumer.senate.gov/SchumerWebsite/about_chuck/time-popups/time-nys_assembly.html |archivedate=March 27, 2008}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> He has never lost an election.

In 1980, 16th district [[United States House of Representatives|Congresswoman]] [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] won the Democratic nomination for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat of [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Jacob Javits]]. Schumer ran for Holtzman's vacated [[United States House of Representatives|House]] seat and won.<ref name=":0" />

He was re-elected eight times from the Brooklyn and [[Queens]]-based district, which changed numbers twice in his tenure (it was numbered the 16th from 1981 to 1983, the 10th from 1983 to 1993 and the 9th from 1993). In 1982, as a result of [[redistricting]], Schumer faced a potential matchup with Solarz, although the matchup did not actually materialize.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=Solarz>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2010/11/steve-solarz-1940-2010-and-the-making-of-senator-schumer-067223|title=Steve Solarz (1940–2010) and the Making of Senator Schumer|work=[[Politico]]|date=November 30, 2010|first=Steve|last=Kornacki|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> In preparation, Schumer "set about making friends on [[Wall Street]], tapping the city's top law firms and securities houses for campaign donations. 'I told them I looked like I had a very difficult reapportionment fight. If I were to stand a chance of being re-elected, I needed some help,' he would later tell the [[Associated Press]]."<ref name=Solarz/>

Schumer introduced The [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (also known as RFRA) on March 11, 1993<ref>Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488 (November 16, 1993), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb through 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-4</ref>

As a member of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]], Schumer was one of four congressional members who oversaw the House investigation (leading the Democratic defense of the [[Clinton administration]]),<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/03/us/in-waco-hearings-parties-undergo-a-role-reversal.html | title =In Waco Hearings, Parties Undergo a Role Reversal | first=Neil A.|last=Lewis | work=[[The New York Times]] | date =August 3, 1995}}</ref> of the [[Waco siege]] hearings in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/28/us/house-investigators-visit-texas-to-prepare-for-waco-hearings.html|title=House Investigators Visit Texas To Prepare for Waco Hearings |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 28, 1995}}</ref>

==United States senator==
[[File:Charles Schumer official portrait.jpg|thumb|Schumer's Senate portrait]]
In 1998, Schumer [[United States Senate election in New York, 1998|ran for the Senate]]. He won the Democratic Senate primary with 51 percent of the votes against [[Geraldine Ferraro]] (21 percent) and [[Mark J. Green|Mark Green]] (19 percent). He received 54 percent of the vote in the [[general election]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1998/98senate.htm|title=Federal Elections 98: U.S. Senate Results by State|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission|FEC]]|date=|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref> defeating three-term [[incumbent]] Republican [[Al D'Amato]] (44 percent).

In November 2001, Schumer announced hearings on the decision of President [[George W. Bush]] to try terrorists in military tribunals amid Washington concerns that Bush would skip the American legal system in regards to his handling of such cases. Schumer said the two goals of the hearings were to ascertain if Bush had the power to form a tribunal apart from an attempt at interacting with Congress, and if a military tribunal was the most efficient instrument to ensure a trial that would not only protect national security information but also guarantee fairness for the suspect.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2001/11/27/DOJ-scrambles-to-defend-tribunals/59561006898198/?spt=rel_sp&cnt=&or=tn|title=DOJ scrambles to defend tribunals|first1=Mark|last1=Benjamin|first2=Nicholas|last2=Horrock|date=November 27, 2001|work=[[United Press International|UPI]]|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In March 2002, as the Senate worked on a compromise to save an election reform bill that stalled due to Republicans' believing it was not combative enough against voter fraud, Schumer and [[Ron Wyden]] led a successful effort in protecting an amendment allowing first-time voters to be verified with only a signature.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Election-reform-bill-stalls-in-Senate/28471015001803/|title=Election reform bill stalls in Senate|first=P.

In April 2002, during a Senate speech, Schumer referred to the Middle East policy of the Bush administration as "muddled, confused and inconsistent" and said the planned meeting between Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and [[Yasser Arafat]] would be against the president's stated stand against terrorists and those harboring them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/11/world/mideast-turmoil-schumer-criticizes-bush-on-mideast.html|title=MIDEAST TURMOIL; Schumer Criticizes Bush on Mideast|date=April 11, 2002|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

In 2002, Schumer authored a provision to an industry-sponsored bill intended to harden the ease by which individuals erase their debts through bankruptcy filing. The measure had opposition from anti-abortion activists who charged it with restricting their ability to use the bankruptcy courts to write off court fines. After the bill appeared to die in May, [[J. Dennis Hastert]] spokesman John Feehery opined, "Schumer really was pretty obnoxious about how this provision was going to hurt people who were pro-life and that really got some of our folks ginned up." In response, Schumer said the provision was a compromise with Henry J. Hyde and other colleagues and that it was met by opposition from people who did not properly read the law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/15/us/anti-abortion-lawmakers-kill-house-bankruptcy-bill.html|title=Anti-Abortion Lawmakers Kill House Bankruptcy Bill|author=Shenon, Philip|date=November 15, 2002|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In January 2004, after President Bush renominated Charles Pickering for federal appeals court along with 30 other nominees who had failed to win confirmation under the previous Democratic-controlled Senate, Schumer stated his intent to prevent Pickering's confirmation and said the US could do better.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/08/congress.pickering/|title=Democrats vow fight on Pickering|date=January 20, 2004|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>

In March 2004, along with [[Jon Corzine]], [[Ted Kennedy]], and [[Frank Lautenberg]], Schumer signed a letter to [[G W Bush|President Bush]] urging him to instruct staff to avoid taking action against whistleblower Richard Foster after Foster spoke out on the subject of White House efforts intended to keep Congress unaware of alternative higher cost estimates for the new Medicare prescription drug program.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2004/03/16/Dems-urge-White-House-restraint-on-whistleblower/37291079458772/?sl=2|title=Dems urge White House restraint on whistleblower|date=March 16, 2004|publisher=[[United Press International|UPI]]}}</ref>

In August 2004, after American officials leaked the arrest of [[Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan]] to reporters, Schumer stated that he was troubled by the decision to reveal Khan's identity, citing the fact that the public had learned little of Khan's role in providing the information that led Homeland Security Secretary [[Tom Ridge]] to announce a higher terror alert level.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/08/08/terror.wrap/index.html|title=U.S. leak 'ends al Qaeda sting'|date=August 9, 2004|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>

In 2004, Schumer won re-election against Republican [[New York Legislature|assemblyman]] [[Howard Mills]] of [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] and [[Conservative Party of New York|conservative]] Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were dismayed by the selection of Mills over the conservative [[Michael Benjamin Bonheur|Michael Benjamin]], who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization.<ref name="alb">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=222422&category=CAPITOL&BCCode=&newsdate=2%2F25%2F2004 |title=Senate hopeful claims GOP bosses snubbed him |author=Benjamin, Elizabeth|accessdate=August 7, 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040807054126/http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=222422&category=CAPITOL&BCCode=&newsdate=2%2F25%2F2004 |archivedate=August 7, 2004 }}.

In March 2006, the House Appropriations Committee voted to block an amendment allowing Dubai Ports World to operate some terminals at U.S. ports...an amendment that was inserted into the emergency supplemental funding bill for military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The same day, Schumer introduced an amendment barring companies from operating in a U.S. port if the company was owned by a country that recognized the Taliban's regime in Afghanistan, the amendment being touted as similar to the House measure. Senate majority leader [[Bill Frist]] subsequently asked for a quorum call that effectively gnarled proceedings, Schumer afterward opining that the Democrats had "bent over backwards to try and accommodate the Republican schedule" and this meant Republicans did not want a vote at all.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/03/08/port.security/index.html|title=Congress declares war on ports deal|date=March 8, 2003|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>

In July 2006, [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] [[Nouri al-Maliki]] stated that Iraq was urging the international community "to take a quick and firm stance to stop this aggression against Lebanon, to stop the killing of innocent people and to stop the destruction of infrastructure." In response, Schumer, Harry Reid, and [[Dick Durbin]] signed a letter to al-Maliki in which they charged him with failing to condemn the aggression of Hezbollah as well as Israel's right to defend itself, arguing the oversight raised serious concern over whether Iraq under his reign could "play a constructive role in resolving the current crisis and bringing stability to the Middle East."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/07/25/congress.iraq/|title=Senate Democrats press Iraqi PM on Israel remarks|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=July 25, 2006}}</ref>

=== Drugs ===
In May 2001, Schumer and Republican [[John McCain]] introduced legislation intended to make it more difficult for makers of brand-name drugs to keep cheaper generic drugs off the market.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://buffalonews.com/2001/05/02/mccain-schumer-aim-for-lower-priced-drugs/|title=MCCAIN, SCHUMER AIM FOR LOWER-PRICED DRUGS|first=Douglas|last=Turner|date=May 2, 2001|publisher=buffalonews.com}}</ref> The legislation was supported by a coalition of consumer groups and Schumer told reporters that the legislation's enactment would reduce prescription drug costs by over 60 percent per prescription in addition to saving consumers $71 billion over the following decade.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/05/01/senate.genericdrugs/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=May 1, 2001|title=McCain, Schumer introduce generic drug bill|author=Bash, Dana|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In October 2001, during a press conference, Schumer stated his desire for generic [[ciprofloxacin]] to be available for government use. At that time Bayer was holding exclusive patent rights for its commercial product Cipro. Schumer also said he believed the federal government had the authority to order the immediate production of generic ciproflaxin to expand the government stockpile of the drug.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/10/16/news/generic_cipro/|title=Senator seeks generic Cipro|date=October 16, 2001|work=CNN Money|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In July 2002, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Schumer and McCain that could lower the costs of generic drugs more rapidly available to U.S. consumers and thereby lead to savings of billions of dollars in drug costs. The legislation also attempted to prevent frivolous lawsuits filed by brand-name drug manufacturers claiming generic drugs are infringing their patients.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Senate-passes-generic-drug-bill/32911028151347/|title=Senate passes generic drug bill|first=Steve|last=Mitchell|work=UPI|date=July 31, 2020|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

=== FBI ===
In November 2001, Schumer joined fellow New York senator [[Hillary Clinton]] to call for legislation encouraging the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] to share information on terrorism with local and state police by removing legal barriers to such cooperation, citing reports by New York mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] that federal authorities did not tell city police what they were aware of.

=== Supreme Court ===
In September 2005, following the nomination of [[John Roberts]] by President [[George W. Bush]], Schumer outlined the positives of Roberts as his brilliance, his being "a lawyer above all", and "judicial philosophy and modesty and stability" during the confirmation hearings for Roberts by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Schumer said Roberts had negatives on "the question of compassion and humanity", the Bush administration declining to show documents written by Roberts during his tenure as deputy solicitor general, and Roberts declining to answer many questions posed to him by the committee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/15/roberts.schumer/index.html|title=Schumer: 'What kind of justice will John Roberts be?'|date=September 15, 2005|publisher=CNN}}</ref> In June 2018, Schumer stated that Roberts was demeaning the Supreme Court as it was becoming more political, citing the court ruling in favor of anti-abortion clinics in California. Schumer said the court had "affirmed a plainly discriminatory travel ban, unleashed a flood of dark unlimited money in our politics and has scrapped a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act" and thereby aligned itself with goals of what he called "the hard right".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/394436-schumer-roberts-is-demeaning-the-supreme-court|title=Schumer: Roberts is 'demeaning' the Supreme Court|date=June 27, 2018|work=The Hill|author=Carney, Jordain|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In October 2005, Schumer stated that Bush Supreme Court nominee [[Harriet Miers]] "would not get a majority either in the Judiciary Committee or the floor" and that her confirmation hearings would cause her to gather either support or opposition in a way that had not been seen by another other prior nominee in recent memory.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Schumer-Miers-doesnt-have-enough-support/59171130124286|title=Schumer: Miers doesn't have enough support|date=October 23, 2005|publisher=UPI}}</ref>

In May 2009, he told reporters that the confirmation process for Obama Supreme Court nominee [[Sonia Sotomayor]] would be "more of a test of the Republican Party than it is of Judge Sotomayor", citing Sotomayor as a "mainstream justice" that Republicans had no reason to oppose.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/schumer-oppose-her-at-your-peril-022971|title=Schumer: Oppose her at your peril|date=May 26, 2009|work=Politico|author=Raju, Manu|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In March 2016, after Obama nominated [[Merrick Garland]] to replace the deceased [[Antonin Scalia]], Schumer called for [[Mitch McConnell]] and [[Chuck Grassley]] to hold hearings "so America can make its own judgment as to whether Merrick Garland belongs on the court."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/03/16/republicans-democrats-merrick-garland-supreme-court-nomination|title=Here's What Republicans and Democrats Are Saying About Obama's Supreme Court Nomination|date=March 16, 2016|work=Fortune}}</ref> In July 2018, it was reported that Schumer had advocated for President Trump to nominate Garland during a phone conversation as a way of attracting bipartisan support, as opposed to Trump's nominating a person opposed to the Affordable Care Act and ''Roe v.

In March 2017, at the end of Senate hearings for Trump Supreme Court nominee [[Neil Gorsuch]], Schumer stated he would vote against the nomination and called for Democrats to join him in waging a block of an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch. In his floor speech, Schumer said, "If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes — a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees and George Bush's last two nominees — the answer isn't to change the rules. It's to change the nominee."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gorsuch-confirmation-hearing-to-focus-today-on-testimony-from-friends-foes/2017/03/23/14d21116-0fc7-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html|title=Schumer: Democrats will filibuster Gorsuch nomination|date=March 23, 2017|work=The Washington Post|first1=Robert|last1=Barnes|first2=Ed|last2=O'Keefe|first3=Ann E.|last3=Marimow|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> Though the Democrats conducted the filibuster, it was broken by Republicans using the "[[nuclear option]]", and Gorsuch was confirmed the following day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Adam Liptak|author-link=Adam Liptak|last2=Matt Flegenheimer|title=Neil Gorsuch Confirmed by Senate as Supreme Court Justice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 8, 2017|page=A1}}</ref>

In July 2018, after President Trump nominated [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to replace the retiring [[Anthony Kennedy]], Schumer said Kavanaugh should be asked direct questions about the precedent set by ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and other cases. Schumer noted Kavanaugh's expressed opinion on the possible incorrect decision in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' and that this could mean he would not hold President Trump accountable after being confirmed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/398258-schumer-kavanaugh-should-answer-direct-questions-on-roe-because-he-weighed-in|title=Schumer: Kavanaugh should answer direct questions on Roe because he weighed in on other decisions|date=July 22, 2018|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

On August 21, Schumer stated that he was requesting documents from Kavanaugh's White House tenure be shared with the Senate, arguing that "withholding documents from the Senate and the American people under the bogus label of committee confidential is a dark development for the Senate."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/402771-schumer-share-confidential-kavanaugh-documents-with-entire-senate|title=Schumer: Share 'confidential' Kavanaugh documents with entire Senate|date=August 20, 2018|work=The Hill|author=Greenwood, Max|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> After meeting with Kavanaugh, Schumer stated that he had asked him if he believed ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Casey v. Planned Parenthood'' were properly decided and that the nominee had not responded and the lack of an answer "should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women." He furthered that Kavanaugh had a special obligation to make his views clear due to his unique position as the only person nominated by a president for the Supreme Court after the president said "I will only nominate someone who overturns ''Roe v Wade''."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/402950-schumer-kavanaugh-wouldnt-say-roe-v-wade-was-correctly-decided|title=Schumer: Kavanaugh wouldn't say Roe v.

At a pro-choice rally outside the Supreme Court in March 2020, Schumer stated "I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions". Chief Justice John Roberts subsequently issued a statement describing Schumer's comments as "threatening", "inappropriate" and "dangerous".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/schumer-roberts-threats-supreme-court/index.html|title=Chief Justice John Roberts rebukes Chuck Schumer for comments about Kavanaugh and Gorsuch|work=CNN|author=de Vogue, Ariane|date=March 5, 2020|access-date=March 6, 2020}}</ref> Senator [[Josh Hawley]] also moved a motion calling for Schumer to be [[List of United States senators expelled or censured|censured]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barreett |first1=Ted |last2=Foran|first2=Clare|title=Graham opposes censuring Schumer over Supreme Court quote, worries it could lead to censure of Trump |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/05/politics/graham-schumer-scotus-controversy-censure/index.html |accessdate=10 March 2020 |work=[[CNN]] |date=5 March 2020}}</ref>

=== Net neutrality ===
In November 2017, Schumer said, "Just as our free highway system helped build jobs in America in the 20th century, Net Neutrality will help build jobs in the 21st century. To take a step back hurts our economy, our job growth and middle-class and working people. It is a disaster."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/11/27/2017/schumer-statement-on-net-neutrality|title=Schumer Statement on Net Neutrality|date=November 21, 2017|publisher=democrats.senate.gov}}</ref> In December, after the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules, Schumer stated the internet could start resembling "a toll road, with the highest bidders cruising along private 'fast lanes' while the rest of us inch along a single, traffic-choked public lane; and we could be forced to purchase internet packages much like cable packages, paying more for popular sites" and the resolution he was introducing would undo the effects of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-fcc-vote-to-end-net-neutrality_allowing-access-to-the-web-to-be-blocked-or-slowed-for-millions-of-americans----simply-cannot-stand-repeal-of-net-neutrality-will-turn-internet-into-a-toll-road-where-only-the-highest-paying-customers-will-rule-senator-pushes-plan-to-overturn-decision-with-a-majority-vote-by-congress|title=SCHUMER: FCC VOTE TO END NET NEUTRALITY – ALLOWING ACCESS TO THE WEB TO BE BLOCKED OR SLOWED FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS -- SIMPLY CANNOT STAND; REPEAL OF NET NEUTRALITY WILL TURN INTERNET INTO A TOLL ROAD, WHERE ONLY THE HIGHEST PAYING CUSTOMERS WILL RULE; SENATOR PUSHES PLAN TO OVERTURN DECISION WITH A MAJORITY VOTE BY CONGRESS|date=December 15, 2017|publisher=schumer.senate.gov}}</ref>

In January 2018, Schumer announced that all 49 members of the Democratic caucus supported a resolution overturning the FCC vote on net neutrality and said congressional Republicans "have the opportunity to right the administration's wrong and show the American people whose side they're on: Big ISPs and major corporations or consumers, entrepreneurs, and small business owners."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/net-neutrality-fcc-democrats-restoring-rules-1202665062/|title=Senate Democrats Close to Majority on Vote to Restore Net Neutrality Rules|date=January 16, 2018|work=Variety|author=Johnson, Ted|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> In May, the Senate adopted a measure to revive Obama-era internet regulations enforcing equal treatment for all web traffic, Schumer describing the vote as "our best chance to make sure the internet stays accessible and affordable to all Americans."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/senate-democrats-push-to-reinstate-net-neutrality-rules/|title=Senate backs effort to restore 'net neutrality' rules|date=May 16, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|author=Freking, Kevin|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> In June, in response to the Republican-controlled House not taking up the Senate resolution restoring net neutrality rules, Schumer said "House Republican leaders gave a green light to the big ISPs to charge middle-class Americans, small business owners, schools, rural Americans, and communities of color more to use the internet."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/391667-schumer-blames-congressional-gop-for-net-neutrality-repeal|title=Schumer blames congressional GOP for net neutrality repeal|date=June 11, 2018|work=The Hill|author=Neidig, Harper|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In 2013, Schumer said the death penalty would be "appropriate" in the case of the [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]], the perpetrator of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]. "The federal law allows the death penalty," "I wrote the law in 1994 when I was head of the crime subcommittee in the House. This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to". "Given the facts that I've seen, it would be appropriate to use the death penalty in this case," he said.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Killough |first1=Ashley |title=Schumer says death penalty 'appropriate' in Boston case |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/21/schumer-says-death-penalty-appropriate-in-boston-case/ |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Drusch|first1=Andrea|title=Schumer says death penalty 'appropriate' |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2013/04/schumer-says-death-penalty-appropriate-162207 |website=Politico |language=en|date=April 21, 2013|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

===Donald Trump===
[[File:President Trump Meets With Congressional Leadership (45966024294).jpg|thumb|Schumer attended the Congressional leadership meeting with Trump in the White House [[Situation Room]] on January 2, 2019]]
In a November 2016 interview conducted in the weeks following Trump's victory, Schumer said that he and the president-elect were not friends and had "civil conversations a couple of times" when Trump had contacted him. Trump had said earlier that year that he believed he would get along with Schumer and that he was "close to Schumer in many ways."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/chuck-schumer-interview-donald-trump-2017-231640|title=Schumer on Trump: 'He was not my friend'|date=November 19, 2016|work=Politico|first1=Burgess|last1=Everett|first2=John|last2=Bresnahan|first3=Elena|last3=Schor|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In February 2017, ahead of Trump's [[Donald Trump speech to joint session of Congress, February 2017|speech to a joint session of Congress]], Schumer predicted that the speech would be less memorable than ones delivered by Trump's predecessors due to what he called "a yawning gap between what he says and what his administration actually does for working Americans." Though acknowledging Trump's populist campaigning style, Schumer said Trump "governs like a pro-corporate, pro-elite, hard-right ideologue."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/321606-schumer-trump-speech-less-important-that-past-presidents-addresses|title=Schumer: Trump speech 'less important' that past presidents' addresses|date=February 28, 2017|work=The Hill|author=Carney, Jordain|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In March 2017, Schumer released a statement calling for Trump to apologize for claiming the Obama administration had wiretapped him during his presidential campaign. He advocated for Trump to stop tweeting to better focus on working on behalf of the United States and said Trump had "severely damaged his credibility" through promoting conspiracy theories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/324773-schumer-trump-must-apologize-for-wiretapping-claim|title=Schumer: Trump must apologize for wiretapping claim|date=March 20, 2017|work=The Hill|author=Carney, Jordain|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In June 2018, Schumer delivered a Senate floor speech decrying a call by Congresswoman [[Maxine Waters]] to harass members of the Trump administration as protest of the administration's policies: "I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don't agree with you. If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office. But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That's not right.

In August 2018, in response to President Trump's charge that American Jews who vote for Democrats are "disloyal," Schumer tweeted, "When he [Trump] uses a [[antisemitic trope|trope that’s been used against the Jewish people]] for centuries with dire consequences, he is encouraging — wittingly or unwittingly — [[anti-Semites]] throughout the country and world."<ref>{{cite web|author=Sullivan, Eileen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/trump-jews-disloyalty.html|title=Trump Again Accuses American Jews of Disloyalty|work=The New York Times|date=August 21, 2019|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

===Financial industry regulation===
In 1987, then-congressman Schumer wrote an op-ed in ''The New York Times'' opposing the repeal of the [[Glass–Steagall Act of 1933]], which was entitled "Don't Let Banks Become Casinos''"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/26/opinion/don-t-let-banks-become-casinos.html|author=Schumer, Charles E.|title=Don't Let Banks Become Casinos|work=The New York Times|date=August 26, 1987}} p.

Since 2010, the securities and investment industry has been the largest donor to Schumer's senatorial campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00001093&cycle=2010|title=Charles E Schumer: Campaign Finance/Money – Summary – Senator 2010|work=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref>

On December 14, 2008, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on Schumer's role in the Wall Street meltdown stated that he embraced the industry's free-market, deregulatory agenda more than any other Democrat in Congress, backing measures blamed for contributing to the financial crisis. A review of his record showed that he took steps to protect the industry from government oversight and tougher rules. Over the years, he helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in higher taxes or fees. The article charged that Schumer succeeded in limiting efforts to reform and regulate credit-rating agencies reforms proposed by the [[George W. Bush Administration]] and the Cox SEC.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite web|first1=Eric|last1=Lipton|first2=Raymond|last2=Hernandez|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/business/14schumer.html|title=A Champion of Wall Street Reaps Benefits|work=The New York Times|date=December 13, 2008|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Schumer was a supporter of the [[Iraq War Resolution]], and a strident pro-Israel member of Congress, although he was very critical of President [[George W. Bush]]'s strategy in the [[Iraq War]]; he suggested that a commission of ex-generals be appointed to review it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/story/373961p-317920c.html |title=Let ex-generals rate war, W told|accessdate=January 4, 2006 |author=McAuliff, Michael|work=New York Daily News|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515192146/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/story/373961p-317920c.html |archivedate=May 15, 2006 }}</ref> In October 2002, he voted for the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/who-voted-to-authorize-fo_b_85652|title=Who voted to authorize force in Iraq October 2002?|first=James|last=Love|date=February 8, 2008|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> [[Nat Hentoff]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]'', however, wrote in November 2006 that "the loquacious Schumer has been indifferent to the administration's war on the Constitution and on our laws and treaties", particularly on the issue of [[torture]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hentoff|first=Nat|authorlink=Nat Hentoff|url=http://villagevoice.com/news/0648,hentoff,75131,2.html|title=What the Democrats Must Do|work=The Village Voice|date=November 26, 2006|accessdate=January 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513180819/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0648%2Chentoff%2C75131%2C2.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008}}</ref>

The senator also is involved with legislation to address the [[Darfur genocide]]. In 2009, he co-sponsored two bills calling for peace in Darfur. Both bills, S.455 and S.684, passed in the Senate. He also voted in favor of measures to help increase the efficiency of peace keepers serving in Darfur.

Schumer, along with Republican senator [[Lindsey Graham]] of [[South Carolina]], has been highly critical of the [[trade imbalance]] between the United States and [[China]], and its alleged cause of Chinese [[currency intervention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5345474|title=Chinese Currency Stirs Debate in U.S. Congress|author=Flintoff, Corey|work=NPR|date=April 17, 2006|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref> They have asked the White House, under both the Bush and Obama administrations, to find China "guilty of currency manipulation" under a 1988 law. Schumer and Graham have introduced legislation in three successive Congresses to apply [[tariff]]s onto Chinese goods for the purpose of raising the value of the [[Chinese yuan]].

In 2009, Schumer criticized Scotland's release of convicted [[Pan Am Flight 103]] bomber [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]], and called for the United States to impose economic sanctions on the United Kingdom if Megrahi's release was tied to a massive oil deal between the United Kingdom and [[Libya]].<ref name="Schumer rips">{{cite news | title=Schumer rips BP's Libya tie | first=Frank | last=Rosario | date=July 19, 2020 | url=https://nypost.com/2010/07/19/schumer-rips-bps-libya-tie/ | work=New York Post | accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref>

In April 2017, after the [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|Shayrat missile strike]], Schumer said a "pinpointed, limited action to punish and hopefully deter Assad from doing this again is appropriate" while warning against the United States becoming further involved in [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/383138-schumer-says-trump-strikes-appropriate-warns-against-greater-involvement-in|title=Schumer says Trump strikes 'appropriate,' warns against greater involvement in Syria|date=April 13, 2018|work=The Hill|author=Greenwood, Max|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

Schumer became the first senator to call for U.S. support for [[Kurdish independence]] following the results of the [[2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum]], releasing a resolution calling for the U.S. government to change its policy to "support a political process that addresses the aspirations of the Kurds for an independent state". He called upon [[Iraq]] to "engage in a dialogue and peacefully determine the best way to accommodate the well-deserved and legitimate aspirations of the Iraqi Kurds".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/us-senate-democratic-leader-declares-support-for-kurdish-independence-1.662245|title=US Senate Democratic leader declares support for Kurdish independence|work=The National|author=Joyce Karam|date=28 September 2017}}</ref>

Before the Trump Administration took concrete [[2018 China–United States trade war|measures against China]] in late March 2018, Schumer and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on [[China]]. Schumer said "China has stolen millions of jobs and trillions of dollars" but "administrations from both parties haven't been strong enough to fight back".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/chuck-schumer-calls-trump-weakling-china-236915|title=Schumer: Trump a '98-pound weakling' on China|website=[[POLITICO]]|date=2017-04-05|first1=Elana|last1=Schor|first2=Doug|last2=Palmer|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schumer-threatens-to-block-trump-commerce-nominees-over-china-trade-probe-delay|title=Schumer threatens to block Trump Commerce nominees over China trade probe delay|website=[[Fox News]]|date=2017-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chuck-schumer-trump-acts-like-a-lap-dog-to-china|title=Chuck Schumer: Trump 'acts like a lap dog' to China|website=[[Washington Examiner]]|date=2017-11-12|author=Barrón-López, Laura|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In July 2018, after Trump criticized at the NATO Summit in Brussels [[Germany]]'s decision to approve a [[Nord Stream 2|new Russian-German gas pipeline]] under the Baltic Sea bypassing [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi released a joint paradoxical statement condemning the president's comments as an embarrassment and his behavior was "another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/11/trump-germany-comments-reaction-708853|title=Pelosi, Schumer blast Trump's criticism of Germany|first=Rebecca|last=Morin|date=July 11, 2018|work=Politico|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

==== Afghanistan ====
In October 2009, Schumer said, "It cost us $6 trillion and 4,500 lives, approximately, to bring stability to Iraq. Just in terms of the loss of life and treasure, do we want to do the same exercise in Afghanistan?" He opined the United States could potentially be able to keep itself safe without bringing stability to Afghanistan and advocated for American forces to be scaled back in Afghanistan in favor of more reliance on unmanned drone attacks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/64937-schumer-stability-in-afghanistan-isnt-a-must|title=Schumer: True cost of Afghan stability could be too high for America|date=October 27, 2009|work=The Hill|author=Zimmermann, Eric|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In August 2013, after Russia granted asylum to [[Edward Snowden]], Schumer said Putin was behaving like a "school-yard bully" and added, "The relationship between the United States and Russia is more poisonous than any time since the Cold War because of all of this."<ref>{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Scott|title=Schumer calls Putin a 'school-yard bully'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2013/08/schumer-putin-a-schoolyard-bully-169886.html|date=August 4, 2013|work=Politico|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}</ref>

In December 2016, Schumer joined John McCain, [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[Jack Reed (Rhode Island politician)|Jack Reed]] in a letter to Senate Majority Leader McConnell urging the formation of a Senate select committee on cyber. Schumer stated that the panel would focus on Russian meddling and potential threats from other countries such as China and Iran.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/mccain-calls-on-special-committee-for-cyber-warfare-calls-drone-taking-gross-violation-of-international-law-232787|title=McCain, Schumer double down on Russia probe|date=December 18, 2016|work=Politico|first1=Seung Min|last1=Kim|first2=Rebecca|last2=Morin|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In a May 2017 Senate floor speech, Schumer called for the release of unedited transcripts of the meeting between Trump and Russian officials the previous week by the White House, saying the continued confidentiality would ensure "the American people will rightly doubt if their president can handle our nation's most closely kept secrets."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/16/trump-russia-intelligence-chuck-schumer-238444|title=Schumer demands transcript of Trump-Russia meeting|date=May 16, 2017|work=Politico|author=Kim, Seung Min|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> In July, Schumer disavowed claims that the Democratic Party considered Russia its top priority and named health care and economic stability for working-class families as their primary concerns.

Schumer spearheaded a non-binding resolution in July 2018 "warning President Trump not to let the Russian government question diplomats and other officials". The resolution states the United States "should refuse to make available any current or former diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by the government of [[Vladimir Putin]]".

===Gun laws===
While serving in the House of Representatives, Schumer, along with California senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], authored the 1994 [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]] which expired in 2004. Supporters of gun control legislation, however, give him much of the credit for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brady Law {{!}} United States law|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brady-Law|access-date=2020-07-21|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the [[Vitter Amendment]], which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Senate: U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 109th Congress - 2nd Session|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00202|access-date=2020-07-21|website=www.senate.gov}}</ref>

While a target of gun rights organizations, Schumer has supported hunters, sponsoring legislation to provide millions in outdoor recreation grants to landowners who allow hunting and fishing on their private property. For these efforts, [[Field & Stream|''Field and Stream'']] magazine honored Schumer in its "Hero Awards" in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldandstream.com/pages/governator-reprises-his-role-villain-wins-top-honors|title=The Governator Reprises His Role as a Villain, Wins Top Honors|work=Field and Stream|date=November 24, 2008|first1=Dave|last1=Hurteau|first2=Chad|last2=Love|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref> Schumer is a supporter of providing hunters with tax deductions for donating venison and other game to feeding programs.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.uticaod.com/news/x441561970/Schumer-proposes-hunter-tax-break|title=Schumer proposes hunter tax break|work=Observer-Dispatch|date=November 30, 2009|accessdate=March 18, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130205091808/http://www.uticaod.com/news/x441561970/Schumer-proposes-hunter-tax-break|archivedate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> In response to a question in a debate during his 2010 reelection campaign, Schumer has denied having a handgun or a permit for one and has produced a letter from NYPD stating that neither he nor his wife (Iris Weinshall) has a handgun license from NYC. In a statement from Brian Fallon, a Schumer aide, he "insisted that except for winning an NRA marksmanship award at age 14, the senator does not own a gun or have a license to carry one".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalobserver.com/archive.php?aid=10104/|title=Chuck Schumer says he's not armed (updated) – Monday, October 25, 2010 – Albany Times Union, Capitol Confidential<!-- Bot generated title -->|work=federalobserver.com|access-date=November 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907205311/http://www.federalobserver.com/archive.php?aid=10104%2F|archive-date=September 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In February 2018, after the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], Schumer was one of four Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump asserting that were he "to endorse legislation to require a background check on every gun purchase, without other poison pill provisions attached, we could finally move much closer towards the comprehensive system that you called for after the Stoneman Douglas attack" and that there was no justification in allowing individuals denied firearms by federally licensed dealers being able to "simply visit a gun show or go online to purchase the same gun that they were denied at the store".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/376006-senate-dems-call-on-trump-to-support-stricter-background-checks|title=Senate Dems call on Trump to support stricter background checks|first=Jordain|last=Carney|work=The Hill|date=February 28, 2018|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In January 2019, Schumer was one of forty senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill's background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one's immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/u-s-senator-tammy-baldwin-helps-introduce-background-check-expansion-act-to-reduce-gun-violence/|title=U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Helps Introduce Background Check Expansion Act To Reduce Gun Violence|date=January 9, 2019|publisher=urbanmilwaukee.com}}</ref>

===Health care reform===
Schumer supported President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; he voted for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in December 2009,<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00396 U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote].

In 2009, Schumer also proposed that any new government-run health insurance programs follow all the standards applicable to private insurance. He did this to "address fears that a public program would drive private insurers from the market". Schumer commented, saying he wanted "a level playing field for competition".<ref name="Middle Ground">{{cite news|last=Pear|first=Robert|title=Schumer Offers Middle Ground on Health Care|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/health/policy/05health.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 5, 2009}}</ref>

In May 2017, in response to an amendment by [[Fred Upton]] to the [[American Health Care Act]], Schumer released a statement saying the amendment "leaves Americans with pre-existing conditions as vulnerable as they were before under this bill" and compared it to "administering cough medicine to someone with stage 4 cancer".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/331747-schumer-new-obamacare-proposal-like-giving-cough-medicine-to-cancer|title=Schumer: GOP healthcare proposal like giving 'cough medicine' to a cancer patient|date=May 3, 2017|work=The Hill|author=Carney, Jordain|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showed the American Health Care Act would cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, Schumer said, "Republicans in Washington and the president should read this report cover to cover, throw their bill in the trash can and begin working with Democrats on a real plan to lower costs for the American people."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/335040-schumer-on-health-plan-republicans-should-throw-their-bill-in-the-trash-can|title=Schumer: Republicans should throw their health bill 'in the trash'|first=Alexander|last=Bolton|date=May 24, 2017|work=The Hill|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> In June, Schumer sent a letter to Majority Leader McConnell requesting a meeting between all senators for a discussion on the American Health Care Act, citing the need for both parties to "come together to find solutions to America's challenges."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/338125-schumer-wants-all-senate-meeting-next-week-on-healthcare|title=Schumer wants all-Senate meeting on healthcare|first=Jordain|last=Carney|work=The Hill|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> Later that month, Schumer estimated the bill had a "50/50" chance of passing in the Senate and added that Democrats were doing everything they could to fight the measure, referring to the legislation as "devastating for the middle class".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/339356-schumer-on-gop-healthcare-plan-i-think-its-50-50|title=Schumer on GOP healthcare plan: 'I think it's 50/50'|first=Rebecca|last=Savransky|work=The Hill|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

===Homeland security===
As a senator from New York, Schumer has worked to secure homeland security funds for New York State and City and provide resources to its first responders. He delivered over $20 billion to support the state's security and recovery efforts after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] on New York City and worked to deliver $200 million in Homeland Security funds to protect New York City mass transit.<ref name="Schumer Washington Post Bio">{{cite news|title=Charles E.

The program allows fire departments and first responders nationwide to apply for grant funding for major purchases that localities have difficulty providing, namely apparatus and emergency vehicles. When the Bush administration pushed a plan to reduce the program from $1 billion to just under $300 million, Schumer helped lead an effort with local firefighters to block the cuts.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Doherty|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060826/NEWS/608260332|title=Schumer lobbies for Maybrook FD|publisher=recordonline.com|date=|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref>

In 2006, Schumer led a bipartisan effort, with the help of Republicans like Congressman [[Peter T. King]] (NY), to stop a deal approved by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] to transfer control of six United States ports to a corporation owned by the government of [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), [[Dubai Ports World]] (see [[Dubai Ports World controversy]]). The [[9/11 Commission]] reported that, despite recent alliances with the U.S., the UAE had strong ties to [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al Qaeda]] prior to the 9/11 attacks. The measure in the House was H.R 4807, and in the Senate, S. 2333; these were introduced to require a 45-day review of this transfer of ownership. On March 9, 2006, Dubai Ports World withdrew its application to operate the ports.

In 1995, Schumer sponsored the [[Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995]] (H.R. 896) in the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lewis, Neil A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/21/us/terror-oklahoma-congress-anti-terrorism-bill-blast-turns-snail-into-race-horse.html|title=TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: IN CONGRESS; Anti-Terrorism Bill: Blast Turns a Snail Into a Race Horse|work=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1995|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}</ref>

===Immigration===
Schumer is one of the [[Gang of Eight (immigration)|Gang of Eight]], a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who wrote and sponsored a [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013|2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill]]. At the time, Schumer was the chairman of the [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest|Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security subcommittee]] of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Weiner, Rachel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/01/28/immigrations-gang-of-8-who-are-they/|title=Immigration's Gang of 8: Who are they?|work=The Washington Post|date=January 28, 2013|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref> In June 2013, the immigration bill passed the Senate with a strong majority—68-32, with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats—but the House of Representatives under Speaker [[John Boehner]] refused to take up the bill, and the legislation died.<ref>{{cite web|first1=David|last1=Nakamura|first2=Ed|last2=O'Keefe|authorlink=David Nakamura|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/06/26/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-immigration-reform/|title=Timeline: The rise and fall of immigration reform|work=The Washington Post|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

In April 2012, he introduced a bill that would kill Arizona's anti-immigration law, [[Arizona SB 1070|SB 1070]] and ones like it if the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of the states. He backed his position, saying: "States like Arizona and Alabama will no longer be able to get away with saying they are simply 'helping the federal government' to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws and knowingly deploying untrained officers with a mission of arresting anyone and everyone who might fit the preconceived profile of an illegal immigrant."<ref>{{cite news|title=Chuck Schumer Plans To Kill Arizona Immigration Law If Supreme Court Backs SB 1070|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/24/chuck-schumer-arizona-immigration-law-supreme-court-sb1070_n_1449370.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=April 24, 2012|first=Elise|last=Foley}}</ref>

===IndyMac Bank controversy===
On June 26, 2008, Schumer took the extraordinary step of publicly releasing letters he had written to regulators regarding [[IndyMac Bank]], the seventh largest [[savings and loan association]] and the ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States, which he considered to be a severely troubled institution. Schumer wrote he was "concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac." Many depositors at IndyMac panicked or from another perspective justifiably acted and withdrew funds in the 11 days before IndyMac failed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jO9e6j2O9_2Tu4DmdpmVTtESO3eA|title=US bank IndyMac seized amid intensifying crisis|publisher=AFP|accessdate=July 14, 2008|date=July 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717044546/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jO9e6j2O9_2Tu4DmdpmVTtESO3eA|archivedate=July 17, 2008}}</ref>

An audit by the Treasury Department's Inspector General would find that the primary causes of IndyMac's failure were associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing [[Alt-A]] loans on a large scale. When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the [[secondary mortgage market]] collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. IndyMac's reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a "run" on the thrift following the public release of the letter. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Final Report - IndyMac MLR _2-26-2009_.doc |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2009 }}</ref>

Director of the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS) [[John M. Reich|John Reich]] immediately blamed IndyMac's failure on the release of the letter. Reich said Schumer gave the bank a "heart attack" and opined, "Would the institution have failed without the deposit run? We'll never know the answer to that question."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121581435073947103|title=Crisis Deepens as Big Bank Fails|first1=Damian|last1=Paletta|first2=David|last2=Enrich|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=July 14, 2008|date=July 12, 2008}}</ref> Reich and top deputies later resigned or were removed amidst a Treasury Department audit and investigation revealing that Indymac had been allowed to backdate its financial reports.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-03-27/treasury-s-watchdog-reviewing-backdating-of-capital-at-thrifts|title=Treasury's Watchdog Reviewing Backdating of Capital at Thrifts|author=Chadbourn, Margaret|work=Bloomberg|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

Schumer conceded his actions may have caused some depositors to withdraw their money prematurely, but suggested that "if OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac's poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn't be where we are today. Instead of pointing false fingers of blame, OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs." He pointed out that "IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks ... It was a spinoff from the old [[Countrywide financial political loan scandal|Countrywide]], and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have.

Despite IndyMac's condition before the failure, the financial media criticized the senator sharply.

In 2007, after Bush nominated former federal judge [[Michael Mukasey]] to become [[United States Attorney General|attorney general of the United States]] (replacing Gonzales, who had resigned), Schumer expressed support for Mukasey. Despite appearing troubled by Mukasey's refusal to declare in public that [[waterboarding]] was illegal [[torture]], Schumer announced on November 2 that he would vote to confirm Mukasey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/02/leahy.mukasey/index.html|title=Bush attorney general nominee gets key Democratic support|work=CNN|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref> Schumer said that Mukasey assured him in a private meeting that he would enforce any law declaring waterboarding illegal.

Following the [[United States housing bubble#Subprime mortgage industry collapse|meltdown]] of the [[subprime lending|subprime]] mortgage industry in March 2007, Schumer proposed a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers in order to save homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values.<ref name="Reuters Dodd">{{cite news|title=Top five US subprime lenders asked to testify-Dodd|first=John|last=Poirier|work=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bankingfinancial-SP/idUSN1930923820070320|date=March 19, 2007|accessdate=March 17, 2008 }}</ref> As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer has pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] to relocate from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/03/senate_mortgage_brokers.html|title=Schumer Offers Bill To Regulate Mortgage Brokers|publisher=Consumeraffairs.com|date=|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref>

===Taxes on high incomes===
Schumer had been a staunch defender of low taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers in the past, arguing that this was necessary to protect the industry. Serving on both the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, Schumer was in a position to block attempts to tax their financial gains at the rate other taxpayers pay for income.<ref>{{cite journal| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/washington/30schumer.html|

In February 2012, Schumer said that he disagreed with the Obama administration's call to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year, calling for a million-dollar level instead. According to Schumer, "there are a lot of people who make above 250 who aren't rich."<ref>[http://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearing/?id=87332fcd-5056-a032-5233-927bbd110bdd The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2013] at 02:03:20 ''[[United States Senate Committee on Finance]]'' February 14, 2012</ref>

In June 2011, the senator and colleague [[Joe Manchin]] (D-WV) sought a crackdown on [[Bitcoin]] currency, saying it facilitated [[illegal drug trade]] transactions.

As chair of the [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts|Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts]], Schumer took a lead role in the investigation of the [[dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]].<ref>

On March 11, 2007, Schumer became the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] to resign for [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|the firing]] of eight [[United States Attorney]]s.

Schumer, like other members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] from both parties, was angered during Gonzales' testimony on April 19, 2007; Gonzales answered many times that he didn't know or couldn't recall details about the controversy. When Schumer's turn came to ask his last round of questions, he instead repeated his call for Gonzales to resign, saying that there was no point to further questioning since Gonzales had "answered, 'I don't know' or 'I can't recall' to close to a hundred questions" concerning the firings (most press reports counted 71 instances) and didn't seem to know about the inner workings of his own department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give "a full, complete and convincing explanation" for why the eight attorneys were fired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Iezc2kIcw|title=YouTube – Schumer 4|publisher=Youtube.com|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref>

==Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee==
Schumer was the chairman of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]], part of the Democratic senate leadership, with primary responsibility for raising funds and recruiting Democratic candidates in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 Senate election]]. When he took this post, he announced that he would not run for [[Governor of New York]] in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|2006]], as many had speculated he would. This step avoided a potentially divisive gubernatorial [[primary election]] in 2006 between Schumer and [[Eliot Spitzer]], then New York's [[attorney general]].

While chairman in 2006, staffers of the committee obtained a copy of Maryland's 2006 Republican senate candidate [[Michael Steele]]'s [[credit report]]. A staff researcher used Steele's social security number to obtain his credit report from [[TransUnion]]. The report was paid for with the DSCC credit card issued to the researcher's supervisor. After an internal investigation, the Maryland Democratic Party determined the credit report was obtained illegally and reported the incident to the [[U.S. Attorney]].<ref>{{cite news

Under Schumer, in the 2006 elections, the Democratic Party gained six seats in the senate, defeating incumbents in each of those races and regaining control of the senate for the first time since 2002. Of the closely contested races in the Senate in 2006, the Democratic Party lost only [[Tennessee]]. The incoming [[Senate Majority Leader]], Harry Reid, persuaded Schumer to continue to serve another term as DSCC chair.

In 2009, for the [[111th Congress]], Schumer was succeeded as the DSCC chair by senator [[Bob Menendez]] of New Jersey.

The [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Senate Democratic caucus]] elected Schumer [[Minority Leader of the United States Senate|minority leader]] in November 2016.
