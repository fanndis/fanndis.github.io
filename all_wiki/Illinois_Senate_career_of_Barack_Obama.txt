In 1994, Senator [[Alice Palmer (Illinois politician)|Alice Palmer]] decided to run for the [[United States House of Representatives]], leaving the Senate's 13th district seat open. When filing opened in 1995 for her seat, Obama entered the race. Eventually, his challengers were disqualified and he won the Democratic primary unopposed in 1996. He won re-election in 1998 and 2002. During his Senate tenure, Obama was involved with a wide range of legislation. 

While serving, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in the [[2000 Illinois's 1st congressional district election|2000 elections]]. In the redistricting following [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], the Democrats gained control of the Illinois Senate, and Obama became more active in his legislation, which included work in areas such as [[health care]], labor, [[law enforcement]], [[campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]], [[welfare]], and community reinvestment.

Rush had been badly defeated in the February 1999 Chicago mayoral election by [[Richard M. Daley]] â€” who won 45% of the African-American vote and even won Rush's own ward â€” and was thought to be vulnerable.<ref name=Kleine20000317>{{cite news |author=Kleine, Ted |newspaper=Chicago Reader| date=March 17, 2000 |accessdate=July 26, 2008| url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/obama/000317 |title=Is Bobby Rush in trouble?}}</ref> The support of some veteran Democratic fundraisers who saw Obama as a rising star, along with support of African-American entrepreneurs, helped him keep pace with Rush's fundraising in the district's most expensive race ever.<ref>{{cite news |author=Osnos, Evan | authorlink = Evan Osnos |date=February 20, 2000 |title=Rush could face his toughest test; 2 key state senators among primary foes |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=1 (Metro) |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/49867226.html?dids=49867226:49867226&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT |accessdate=November 2, 2008}}</ref>

During the campaign, Rush charged that Obama was not sufficiently rooted in Chicago's black neighborhoods to represent constituents' concerns, and also benefitted from an outpouring of sympathy when his son{{whose|date=September 2020}} was shot to death shortly before the election.<ref name=Kleine20000317/> Obama said Rush was a part of "a politics that is rooted in the past" and said he himself could build bridges with whites to get things done. 

But while Obama did well in his own Hyde Park base, he didn't get enough support from the surrounding black neighborhoods.<ref name=jbcdnyt/> Starting with just 10 percent name recognition, Obama went on to get only 31 percent of the votes, losing by a more than 2-to-1 margin despite winning among white voters.<ref>Federal Election Commission, [http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/ilh.htm 2000 U.S. House of Representatives Results]</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Gonyea, Don |date=September 19, 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14502364|title=Obama's loss may have aided White House bid |work=Morning Edition |publisher=NPR |accessdate=April 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Janny |last=Scott |title=A streetwise veteran schooled young Obama |date=September 9, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/us/politics/09obama.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A1 |accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=McClelland20070212>{{cite news |first=Edward |last=McClelland |title=How Obama learned to be a natural |date=February 12, 2007 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/02/12/obama_natural/ |work=Salon |accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref>

==Later Senate career==
After losing the primary for U.S. Congress to Bobby Rush, Obama worked to repair relations with black politicians and clergy members, telling them he bore no grudges against the victor. He also became more responsive to requests for state funding, getting money for churches and community groups in his district. Senator Trotter, then the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in 2008 that he knew Obama was responding more to funding requests "because the community groups in his district stopped coming to me".<ref name=jbcdnyt/>

In September 2001, Democrats won a lottery to redraw legislative districts that had been drawn ten years earlier by Republicans and had helped ensure ten uninterrupted years of Republican control of the Illinois Senate.<ref name="Redistricting Lottery">{{cite news |author=Pearson, Rick |date=September 6, 2001 |title=Democrats win lottery for remap; Bilandic to break deadlock on state redistricting |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=1 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-09-06/news/0109060300_1_democrats-lottery-legislative-districts |accessdate=January 18, 2009}}</ref> At the November 2002 election, the Democratic remap helped them win control of the Illinois Senate and expand their majority in the Illinois House to work with the first Democratic Illinois governor in 26 years.<ref>{{cite news |author=Finke, Doug |date=October 21, 2002 |title=Democrats try to sweep state elections; Legislative control comes down to just a few contests |newspaper=The State Journal-Register |page=1 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=JR&p_theme=jr&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_text_search-0=Democrats%20AND%20try%20AND%20to%20AND%20sweep%20AND%20state%20AND%20elections&s_dispstring=Democrats%20try%20to%20sweep%20state%20elections%20AND%20date(10/21/2002%20to%2010/21/2002)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=10/21/2002%20to%2010/21/2002)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no |accessdate=October 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Finke, Doug |date=November 6, 2002 |title=Democrats take charge of General Assembly |newspaper=The State Journal-Register |page=5 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=JR&p_theme=jr&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_text_search-0=Democrats%20AND%20take%20AND%20charge%20AND%20of%20AND%20General%20AND%20Assembly&s_dispstring=Democrats%20take%20charge%20of%20General%20Assembly%20AND%20date(11/6/2002%20to%2011/6/2002)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=11/6/2002%20to%2011/6/2002)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no |accessdate=October 17, 2008}}</ref> 

In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, after six years on the committee and four years as its minority spokesman. The new Democratic majority allowed Obama to write and help pass more legislation than in previous years. He sponsored successful efforts to expand children's health care, create a plan to provide equal health care access for all Illinois residents, and create a "Hospital Report Card" system, and worker's rights laws that protected whistleblowers, domestic violence victims, equal pay for women, and overtime pay.<ref name="factcheck.barackobama.com"/> 

His most public accomplishment was a bill requiring police to videotape interrogations and confessions in potential death penalty cases. Obama was willing to listen to Republicans and police organizations and negotiate compromises to get the law passed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Peters |title=Judge him by his laws |date=January 4, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303303.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=A21 |accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref>  That helped him develop a reputation as a pragmatist able to work with various sides of an issue.<ref name=jbcdnyt/> Obama also led the passage of a law to monitor [[racial profiling]] by requiring police to record the race of drivers they stopped.<ref name=Scott20070730>{{cite news |first=Janny |last=Scott |title=In Illinois, Obama proved pragmatic and shrewd |date=July 30, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/us/politics/30obama.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A1 |accessdate=January 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Pearson, Rick; Long, Ray |author2=Ray Long |title=Careful steps, looking ahead |date=May 3, 2007 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0705030101may03,1,7439904.story |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=1 |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216014957/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0705030101may03%2C1%2C7439904.story |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In February 2002, Obama introduced SB 1789, which would have adopted [[instant-runoff voting]] (IRV) for congressional and state primary elections in Illinois and authorized IRV for local elections, although it did not ultimately pass.<ref>[http://www.ilga.gov/reports/static/92Sponsor.pdf Record of Illinois 92nd General Assembly Bills]</ref> He resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.<ref>{{cite news |author=. |url=http://www.senatedem.state.il.us/obama/index.html |title=13th District: Barack Obama |format=archive |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |date=August 24, 2000 |publisher=Illinois State Senate Democrats |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824102110/http://www.senatedem.state.il.us/obama/index.html |archivedate=August 24, 2000 }}</ref>
