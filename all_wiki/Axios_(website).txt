'''''Axios''''' is an American news website based in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. It was founded in 2016 and launched the following year by former ''[[Politico]]'' team members [[Jim VandeHei]], [[Michael Allen (journalist)|Mike Allen]] and Roy Schwartz. The site's name is based on the {{lang-el|ἄξιος}} ({{transl|el|áxios}}), meaning "worthy".<ref name="VF1">{{Cite web|last=Ellison|first=Sarah|authorlink=Sarah Ellison|date=2016-11-30|title=Exclusive: Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei Reveal Their Plan for Media Domination|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/mike-allen-and-jim-vandehei-reveal-their-plan-for-media-domination-axios|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204045748/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/mike-allen-and-jim-vandehei-reveal-their-plan-for-media-domination-axios|archive-date=2018-12-04|access-date=2020-09-15|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|language=en-us}}</ref>
