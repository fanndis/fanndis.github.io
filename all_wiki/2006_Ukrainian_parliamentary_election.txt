The '''Ukrainian parliamentary election''' took place on 26 March 2006.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/26/world/fg-ukraine26 Ukraine Is the Winner as Nation Heads to the Polls], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (March 26, 2006)</ref> Election campaigning officially began on 7 July 2005. Between November 26 and 31 December 2005 party lists of candidates were formed.

The election to the Ukrainian parliament, [[Verkhovna Rada]], was held according to the [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list proportional election system]]—that is, in a single nationwide electoral district<ref name="Ukrelectionsystem199820021994">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uD-9tyD2KrMC&pg=PA93&dq=2006+ukrainian+elections+district&hl=en&ei=rSZcTqadM42cOpHD8ZIM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=2006%20ukrainian%20elections%20district&f=false Against All Odds: Aiding Political Parties in Georgia and Ukraine (UvA Proefschriften)] by [[Max Bader]], [[Vossiuspers UvA]], 2010, {{ISBN|90-5629-631-0}} (page 93)</ref> with votes being allocated to the political parties or election blocs rather than to individual candidates. In the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|previous parliamentary elections]] half of parliamentary representatives (deputies) were elected on proportional basis, while the other half were elected in single-mandate constituencies.<ref name="Ukrelectionsystem199820021994"/>

Following the [[Orange Revolution]] and the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential elections]] in December 2004 [[Ukrainian parliament]] adopted significant changes (amendments) to the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] by introducing concepts of [[political coalition]], coalition government, imperative mandate as well as transferred some power from the [[President of Ukraine|President]] to the parliament, making Ukraine a [[semi-presidential system|parliamentary-presidential democracy]]. Those amendments were to enter into force on 1 January 2006. The new constitutional amendment also abolished single member-districts and replacing them with an increased multi-member proportional representation. According to the election law and the system adopted, the political parties or election blocs need to collect at least 3% of the national vote in order to gain seats in parliament.<ref name="ukrainianweek223538b">[https://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/223538 Parliamentary chronicles], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (30 November 2018)</ref>

==Results==
According to the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]] 67.13% of registered voters participated in the election.

On April 10 the Central Election Commission (CVK) announced the final results of vote counting; the results can be seen at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224829/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vnd2006/w6p001e.html Commission's website]. As a result of the election, out of 45 parties, only 5 passed the required 3% [[electoral threshold]] (see the table below).

Comparing the results with [[#Polls before the election day|early polls]] (but not with 2005 opinion polls<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1061785.html Ukraine:Has Yushchenko Betrayed The Orange Revolution?], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (30 September 2005)</ref>{{ref|uv1}}), it was unexpected that President [[Viktor Yushchenko]]'s party  "[[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]" received less than 14% of the national vote, coming third after the [[Party of Regions]], and the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]. 
<!-- Again, this is (1) is not directly related to the election, and (2) is an unsourced personal opinion: There have already been calls for Viktor Yushchenko to distance himself from party politics and resign from the Our Ukraine party and to govern for all of Ukraine and not just 14%. With the move to a parliamentary democracy, the role of the President is as Ukraine's head of state and no longer head of the government. Public opinion has been on the rise for the president to distance himself from party politics and to play more of the role of a statesman and mentor for the development of democracy in Ukraine. There is increasing support and belief that the President can best serve Ukraine as the nation's independent umpire then as a leader of a minor party. If Yushchenko was to take such a move and distance himself from Our Ukraine his standing in the public polls would likely increase. Some are calling for the President's withdrawal from Our Ukraine to be part of any negotiation in the formation of any possible government coalition.-->

As per preliminary results, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Ukrainian Communist Party]] was soundly trounced, getting less than 4% of the vote and 21 deputies as a result, as opposed to their 20% in the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2002 elections]].

The [[People's Opposition Bloc of Natalia Vitrenko]] did not pass the electoral threshold collecting only 2.93% of total votes recorded, 0.07% short of the required 3% [[electoral threshold]]. According to the law the threshold is calculated based on the total number of the voted ballots, including the general non-confidence votes (i.e. ballots of those who voted ''against all parties'' listed) as well as invalid votes (e.g. votes for more than one party as such option is not provided by electoral law). If such votes were excluded from the total, then Vitrenko party would have received over 3% of the formal vote. Commenting the preliminary results the leader of the Opposition Bloc, Natalia Vitrenko expressed: "Based on what grounds CVK shows the total number of actual voters as 25,250 thousands? According to CVK data, 2% of votes are invalid, and 1.8% are "against all", therefore these numbers should be excluded. The base for calculations should not be more than 24,500 thousand; and that is 3% out of the votes that CVK counted for out Bloc."[http://www.vitrenko.org/start.php?lang=1&part_id=1&article_id=1994] Nonetheless, according to the Law on Election, Article 1.4 "The mandates are distributed to the parties (blocs) that obtained no less than three percent of votes of voters that ''participated'' in the election"

A set of parties which did not pass the electoral threshold, notably [[People's Opposition Bloc of Natalia Vitrenko]] and the [[Opposition Bloc "Ne Tak"]] have made claims of the elections being highly falsified and asked for vote recount. Recent reports in the media have indicated that Ukraine's President has also suggested that if necessary a partial recount of the 26 March ballot should be made. If significant mistakes were made in the tally of votes there is a chance for Opposition Block of Natalia Vitrenko to exceed the 3% threshold required by law.

Over 22% of voters who supported minor candidates (with less than the 3%) will not be represented by the parties elected due to the electoral method used ([[party list proportional representation]] with an [[election threshold]]).

==Parties and electoral blocs registered==
A record number of forty five parties registered for the election, with only five securing the minimum 3% quota required to elect representatives to the Ukrainian parliament. Seats in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] are allocated among those parties securing the 3% quota according to the [[largest remainder method]] of seat allocation, using the [[Hare quota]]. Each party meeting the 3% quota is entitled to appoint one representative for every 1/450 (approximately 0.22%) of the total vote allocated to all parties exceeding the 3% threshold, with remaining seats being awarded to the parties with the largest remaining fractions of 1/450 of the total vote allocated to all parties meeting the 3% threshold.

==Polls before the election day==
According to earlier polls, front-runners where [[Party of Regions]] on 34%, [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] on 24%, as well as President [[Viktor Yushchenko|Yushchenko's]] [[People's Union Our Ukraine]].

Two other political forces that where virtually assured to pass a 3% barrier where the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] headed by [[Oleksander Moroz]] and the bloc of the current [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of Verkhovna Rada, [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] (based on his former Agrarian Party of Ukraine renamed to the [[People's Party (Ukraine)|People's Party]]).

The [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], which has progressively received fewer and fewer votes with each election (25% in 1998, 20% in 2002), was expected to continue their decline in voter support.

Whilst some parties have nominated over 400 candidates, it was always unlikely that any single Party would elect over 200 members. In order to form a Government, under Ukraine's constitution, parties will need to form a coalition with two or more voting blocks within the first month following the declaration of the polls.

===Razumkov Centre Poll===
Each 2 weeks [[Razumkov Centre]] held a representative national survey.

The latest Razumkov poll shows a consolidation of voter opinion and if the results of the poll are a true indication of voter intention the voter participation rate will be above 90% of registered voters. Voting in Ukraine is not compulsory. Votes below the 3% threshold are discarded which increases the proportional share of seats allocated to the remaining party/blocs. There is still 10.5% of voters undecided.

According to Arabic newsmedia [[Aljazeera]], Party of the regions had alleged that the general elections had been marred by irregularities and poor organisation as the first exit polls were published. But while acknowledging some organisational problems, most other parties and Western observers have given the vote a largely clean bill of health. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060516125558/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E183CA1E-0E78-4572-A47B-664542C06E56.htm]

Russian newspaper [[Izvestia]] predicts that Ukraine can expect more political instability and worsening economic situation. [https://web.archive.org/web/20061214032321/http://www.izvestia.ru/world/article3091429/]

According to Russian Gazeta.ru, Tymoshenko, Yushchenko and the Socialists can form a coalition. [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] was sure she will become a new PM. Yushchenko and Georgian President Saakishvili already congratulated her with victory. [http://gazeta.ru/2006/03/27/last193554.shtml],[http://gazeta.ru/2006/03/27/last193551.shtml],[http://gazeta.ru/2006/03/27/last193555.shtml]

According to Russian RIAN, Tymoshenko promised to reconsider the Russian-Ukrainian gas deal. [https://archive.is/20121221144142/http://www.rian.ru/economy/economic_crimes/20060327/44821283.html]

''[[The Washington Post]]'' informed that [[Yushchenko]]'s party was beaten into a humiliating third place in parliamentary elections as the pro-Russian party of the man he defeated for the presidency 16 months ago appeared headed for a clear victory, according to exit polls. The Party of Regions, led by [[Viktor Yanukovych]], who was defeated by Yushchenko in 2004 following massive street protests known as the [[Orange Revolution]], secured a commanding 33.3 percent of the vote, according to one poll. A second exit poll gave his party 27.5 percent. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/26/AR2006032600624.html]

On 27 March, Arabic [[Aljazeera]] reported that [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], the former PM, had scored a triumph in parliamentary elections with her own bloc coming second and placing her in a position to form a coalition government. [[Viktor Yanukovich]]'s pro-Russian Regions party won the most seats, but Tymoshenko emerged as a rejuvenated political figure, saying that "[[Orange Revolution]]" liberals could close ranks to keep the pro-Russian party in opposition. The outcome was a double humiliation for [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the president, who defeated Yanukovich in a presidential poll re-run after December's 2004 street protests, and later fell out with Tymoshenko, his former Orange Revolution comrade. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060418203816/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/70155A2E-DC29-4235-940F-1499986B8C3B.htm]

According to Forbes.com, Tymoshenko urged her estranged Orange Revolution allies to form a united front against their old pro-Russian nemesis, who was leading in early results from a weekend parliamentary election. Proposed coalition talks, which were supposed to get under way Monday, were delayed indefinitely.[https://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/ap/2006/03/27/ap2624506.html]

Russian online media Lenta.ru reported that activists of Vitrenko's party erected tents and started boycotting the premises of Ukrainian Central Election Commission in protest of alleged violations. [http://lenta.ru/news/2006/04/01/opposition/]. According to [[Interfax-Ukraine]][http://www.interfax.com.ua], the tents are mostly empty. [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2006/4/1/40517.htm]

==Coalition and government==
{{see also|2006 Ukrainian political crisis|2007 Ukrainian political crisis}}
Following the 2004 constitutional amendments, a concept of coalition government replaced the existing concept of [[majority government]].

The formation of coalition government was delayed and triggered post-election political "trade offs". On 22 June 2006 there finally was signed a coalition agreement between Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko, Bloc "Our Ukraine", and the Socialist Party of Ukraine forming the Coalition of Democratic Forces. However, political trading continued on and appointment of new government was getting suspended. Because of delay, the Socialist Party withdrew its signature from the coalition agreement and on 7 July 2006 signed new coalition agreement with the Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine forming the so-called [[Alliance of National Unity]]. That led to re-appointment of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] as [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] on 4 August, with the backing of 30 deputies of the "Our Ukraine" Bloc, after the parties agreed on the principals of state policy expressed in the [[Universal of National Unity]].

The political scandal led to early parliamentary elections after the President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] dissolved the parliament.
