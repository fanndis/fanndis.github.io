== History ==
[[File:Emil Stang.jpg|thumb|Emil Stang, founder]]
The Conservative Party of Norway (''Høire'', now spelled ''Høyre'', lit. "The Right") was founded in 1884 after the implementation of [[parliamentarism]] in Norway. The jurist [[Emil Stang]] was elected the first chairman of the party. Stang underlined important principles for the work in Høyre. The party was to be a social party of reforms that worked within the constitutional frames set by a parliamentary democracy. Høyre's electoral support has varied. In the 1981-election, Høyre got 31.7%. It was the best election since 1924. The result in 1993 was 17%. This election was influenced by the EU membership issue which divided the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]]. The 1997 parliamentary election resulted in the lowest support since 1945, with only 14.3% of the votes. Høyre has since then seen increased popular support, and got 21.3% in the 1999 local elections and 21.2% in the 2001 parliamentary election.

=== Early 1900s ===
In the beginning of the 20th century Høyre took the initiative to construct a modern Norwegian [[communications network]]. After the devastating [[First World War]] it was important for Høyre to work for the reconstruction of sound, economic politics. An example of this is the resolution Høyre passed in 1923 introducing [[Social security|old-age insurance]]. But because of the [[Sovereign state|State's]] finances it was not possible to continue this effort. Høyre was the leading party in opposition in the [[Norway#Post-war history|post-war years]] in Norway. Høyre fought against the Labour Party's regulating policy. Høyre wanted another future for Norway consisting of [[Private ownership|private]] initiative and [[Creativity|creative]] forces.

Høyre has been a [[protagonist]] in the construction of the [[Nordic model|welfare system]] in Norway, and has on several occasions taken the initiative to correct injustices in [[social care]] regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Additionally, Høyre has advocated that the state's activity must concentrate on its basic problems and their solutions.

=== Post-war years ===
During the [[Norway#Post-war history|post-war years]] Høyre has consolidated its position as a party with appeal to all parts of the [[Norway|nation]]. Non-socialist co-operation as an alternative to [[socialism]] has always been one of Høyre's main aims. Høyre has led several [[List of Norwegian governments|coalition governments]]. The Christian Democratic Party was one of Høyre's coalition partners both in 1983–86 and 1989–90.

The party strongly supported the [[Western bloc|Western alignment]] of Norway during the [[Cold War]]; it strongly supports [[NATO]], which Norway co-founded in 1949, and has consistently been the most outspokenly [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European Union]] party in Norway, supporting Norwegian membership during both the [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994 referendums]].<ref name="snl"/>

At the parliamentary election in 1993, it was impossible to present a credible non-socialist government alternative, because Høyre's former coalition parties, The Christian Democrats and the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]], both campaigned strongly against Norwegian membership of the EU.

Before the parliamentary election in 1997 the Labour party proclaimed that they would not be willing to govern the country if they did not obtain more than 36.9% of the votes. As it turned out, they got 35%, and other parties had to form a government. Originally, there were serious discussions between Høyre, The Christian Democrats and Venstre to take on this task, but the end result was that the two latter parties joined forces with the Centre Party to create a minority government without Høyre.

=== Today ===
In the [[2001 Norwegian parliamentary election|parliamentary election in September 2001]], Høyre obtained 21.2 percent of the votes. After a series of discussions Høyre was once again able to take part in a coalition government, this time with the Christian Democratic Party (KrF), and the Liberal Party (V). The total percentage obtained for these three parties at last general election was 37.5. Høyre, as the largest party in the coalition government, had 38 members in the present Storting, and 10 of the 19 ministers in the [[Government of Norway|Government]] were Høyre representatives. Høyre's three focal areas this period were to establish a rise in quality in Norway's educational system, lower taxes and produce a higher service level in state sectors.

In the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 parliamentary election]], Høyre obtained 14.1% of the votes. The election outcome put Høyre back in opposition, and the party got 23 members in the present Storting.

In the [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|2009 parliamentary election]], Høyre obtained 17.2% of the votes, and 30 members in the present Storting.

During the [[2011 Norwegian local elections|local elections of 2011]], however, the party gained 27.6 percent of the vote, and it has since then, without exceptions, polled first and second.

In the [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election|2013 parliamentary election]], Høyre obtained 26.8 percent of the votes, and 48 members in the present [[Stortinget|Storting]]. Høyre formed a minority government, with confidence and supply from KrF and V. The Government was reelected in 2017 and became a majority Government in 2019.

==Ideology==
Høyre defines itself as a party pursuing a "conservative progressive policy based on Christian cultural values, constitutional government and democracy."<ref name="hoyre-eng">[https://hoyre.no/om-hoyre/partiet/international/information-in-english/ Information about Høyre]</ref>

Høyre is considered a reform party profess to the moderately conservative political tradition, adhering to the thoughts of [[Edmund Burke]]. The party is committed to fiscal [[free-market]] policies, including [[tax cut]]s and relatively little government involvement in the [[Economic system|economy]]. However, it does support the continued existence of the Norwegian [[welfare state]].

Høyre is also the only party in the [[Storting]] which proposes a reduction in public spending. The party is often associated with wealth and has historically been attacked by the left for defending the country's richest, although this argument is rarely presented any more.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The Conservative Party's [[Social policy|social policies]] are [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] and the party voted in 2008 for a law that recognised [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|same-sex marriage]] and [[Gay adoption in Norway|gay adoption rights]].<ref>John Kaare Bjerkan: [http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.5969210 Historisk vedtak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311105800/http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.5969210 |date=11 March 2014 }} NRK, 11 June 2008</ref>

==Membership and voter demographic==
The party has around 30,000 registered members (2018). The Central Board of the Conservative Party meets seven times a year to discuss important matters such as budget, organisational work, plans, party platforms, and drawing up political lines.

The party traditionally caters to the educated elite; it has the most highly educated voters of all parties, and is the most popular party among elite groups.<ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto"/>
