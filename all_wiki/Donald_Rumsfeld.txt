'''Donald Henry Rumsfeld''' (born July 9, 1932) is a retired American politician. Rumsfeld served as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] from 1975 to 1977 under [[Gerald Ford]], and again from January 2001 to December 2006 under [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="Historical Office Rumsfeld Ford Administration">{{cite web |url=https://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/Article/571288/donald-h-rumsfeld/ |title=Donald H. Rumsfeld – Gerald Ford Administration |publisher=Office of the Secretary of Defense – Historical Office}}</ref> He is both the youngest and the second-oldest person to have served as Secretary of Defense. Additionally, Rumsfeld was a three-term [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] from [[Illinois]] (1963–69), director of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (1969–70), [[Counselor to the President|counsellor <!-- This is the correct spelling per Rumsfeld's 2011 memoir --> to the president]] (1969–73), the [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO]] (1973–74), and [[White House Chief of Staff]] (1974–75). Between his terms as Secretary of Defense, he served as the CEO and chairman of several companies.

Born in Illinois, Rumsfeld attended [[Princeton University]], graduating in 1954 with a degree in [[political science]]. After serving in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for three years, he mounted a campaign for Congress in Illinois's 13th Congressional District, winning in 1962 at the age of 30. While in Congress, he was a leading co-sponsor of the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. Rumsfeld reluctantly accepted an appointment by President [[Richard Nixon]] to head the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969; appointed counsellor by Nixon and entitled to Cabinet-level status, he would also head up the [[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970|Economic Stabilization Program]] before being appointed ambassador to NATO. Called back to Washington in August 1974, Rumsfeld was appointed chief of staff by President Ford. Rumsfeld recruited a young one-time staffer of his, [[Dick Cheney]], to succeed him when Ford nominated him to be Secretary of Defense in 1975. When Ford lost the 1976 election, Rumsfeld returned to private business and financial life, and was named president and CEO of the [[pharmaceutical]] corporation [[G. D. Searle & Company]]. He was later named CEO of [[General Instrument]] from 1990 to 1993 and chairman of [[Gilead Sciences]] from 1997 to 2001.

Rumsfeld was appointed Secretary of Defense for a second time in January 2001 by President [[George W. Bush]]. As Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld played a central role in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. Before and during the Iraq War, he claimed that Iraq had an active [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] program; yet no stockpiles were ever found.<ref name="Frontline who said">{{Cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/truth/why/said.html |title=Truth, War And Consequences: Why War? – In Their Own Words – Who Said What When |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]]|publisher=[[PBS]]  |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name="FactCheck 2005-09-02">{{Cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2005/09/anti-war-ad-says-bush-cheney-rumsfeld/|title=Anti-war Ad Says Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld & Rice "Lied" About Iraq|last=Jackson|first=Brooks|date=September 2, 2005|website=[[FactCheck.org]] |language=en-US|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref> A Pentagon Inspector General report found that Rumsfeld's top policy aide "developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and [[Al-Qaeda|al Qaida]] relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]], to senior decision-makers".<ref name="McClatchy 2007-02-07">{{Cite news |date=February 8, 2007 |url=https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/special-reports/iraq-intelligence/article24461020.html |title=Pentagon office produced 'alternative' intelligence on Iraq |last=Landay |first=Jonathan S. |publisher=[[McClatchy]] |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref> Rumsfeld's tenure was controversial for [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|its use of torture]] and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal.<ref>{{Cite news |last1= Shanker |first1= Thom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/04/politics/rumsfeld-says-he-offered-to-quit.html |title= Rumsfeld Says He Offered to Quit|newspaper=The New York Times|date= February 4, 2005 |accessdate=June 28, 2017}}</ref> Rumsfeld gradually lost political support and he resigned in late 2006.

As director, Rumsfeld sought to reorganize the Office to serve as "a laboratory for experimental programs".<ref name="memoir" />{{rp|125}} Several beneficial [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty programs]] were saved by allocating funds to them from other less-successful government programs. During this time, he hired [[Frank Carlucci]] and [[Dick Cheney]] to serve under him.

He was the subject of one of legendary writer [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]]'s columns, alleging that "anti-poverty czar" Rumsfeld had cut programs to aid the poor while spending thousands to redecorate his office. Rumsfeld dictated a four-page response to Anderson, labeling the accusations as falsehoods, and invited Anderson to tour his office. Despite the tour, Anderson did not retract his claims, and would only much later admit that his column was a mistake.<ref name="memoir" />{{rp|125}}

When he left OEO in December 1970, Nixon named Rumsfeld [[Counselor to the President]], a general advisory position; in this role, he retained Cabinet status.<ref name="own rules" />{{rp|75}} He was given an office in the [[West Wing]] in 1969 and regularly interacted with the [[Nixon administration]] hierarchy.

In February 1973, Rumsfeld left Washington to serve as [[Ambassadors from the United States|U.S. Ambassador]] to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in [[Brussels]], Belgium. He served as the United States' Permanent Representative to the [[North Atlantic Council]] and the [[Defense Planning Committee]], and the [[Nuclear Planning Group]]. In this capacity, he represented the United States in wide-ranging military and diplomatic matters, and was asked to help mediate a conflict on behalf of the United States between [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name="memoir" />{{rp|157}}

===Ford Administration===

In August 1974, after Nixon resigned as president in the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal]], Rumsfeld was called back to Washington to serve as transition chairman for the new president, [[Gerald Ford]]. He had been Ford's confidant since their days in the House, before Ford was House minority leader. As the new president became settled in, Ford appointed Rumsfeld [[White House Chief of Staff]], where he served from 1974 to 1975.

=== Secretary of Defense (1975-1977) ===
[[File:Ford-rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|left|Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld shares a laugh with President Ford in a Cabinet meeting, 1975]]

In October 1975, Ford reshuffled his cabinet in the [[Halloween Massacre]]. He named Rumsfeld to become the 13th U.S. Secretary of Defense; [[George H. W. Bush]] became [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. According to [[Bob Woodward]]'s 2002 book ''[[Bush at War]]'', a rivalry developed between the two men and "Bush senior was convinced that Rumsfeld was pushing him out to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to end his political career."<ref>{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Bob|title=Bush at War|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7432-4461-9|url=https://archive.org/details/bushatwar00wood|url-access=registration|quote=rumsfeld ford bush cia director.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bushatwar00wood/page/21 21]–22}}</ref>

At [[the Pentagon]], Rumsfeld oversaw the transition to an all-volunteer military. He sought to reverse the gradual decline in the defense budget and to build up U.S. strategic and conventional forces, skillfully undermining Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] at the SALT talks.<ref name="NYTInfighter">{{cite news|title=Defense Choice Made a Name As an Infighter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/08/us/defense-choice-made-a-name-as-an-infighter.html |first1=Elaine |last1=Sciolino |first2=Eric |last2=Schmitt |date=January 8, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=August 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714182443/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/08/us/defense-choice-made-a-name-as-an-infighter.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> He asserted, along with [[Team B]] (which he helped to set up),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hnn.us/articles/18668.html |author=Sidney Blumenthal |title=The Long March of Dick Cheney |publisher=[[History News Network|HNN]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217110948/http://hnn.us/articles/18668.html |archivedate=December 17, 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref> that trends in comparative U.S.-[[Soviet armed forces|Soviet]] military strength had not favored the United States for 15 to 20 years and that, if continued, they "would have the effect of injecting a fundamental instability in the world".<ref name="defenselink1" /> For this reason, he oversaw the development of [[cruise missile]]s, the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1 bomber]], and a major naval shipbuilding program.<ref name="NYTInfighter" />

==Return to the private sector (1977–2000)==
===Business career===
In early 1977 Rumsfeld briefly lectured at Princeton's [[Woodrow Wilson School]] and Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]], located in Chicago, Illinois. His sights instead turned to business, and from 1977 to 1985 Rumsfeld served as chief executive officer, president, and then chairman of [[G. D. Searle & Company]], a worldwide pharmaceutical company based in [[Skokie, Illinois]]. During his tenure at Searle, Rumsfeld led the company's financial turnaround, thereby earning awards as the Outstanding Chief Executive Officer in the Pharmaceutical Industry from the ''Wall Street Transcript'' (1980) and ''Financial World'' (1981). In 1985, Searle was sold to [[Monsanto Company]].

Rumsfeld served as chairman and chief executive officer of [[General Instrument Corporation]] from 1990 to 1993. A leader in broadband transmission, distribution, and access control technologies for cable, satellite and terrestrial broadcasting applications, the company pioneered the development of the first all-digital [[high-definition television]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]) technology. After taking the company public and returning it to profitability, Rumsfeld returned to private business in late 1993.

From January 1997 until being sworn in as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as chairman of [[Gilead Sciences|Gilead Sciences, Inc.]] Gilead Sciences is the developer of Tamiflu ([[Oseltamivir]]), which is used in the treatment of [[H5N1|bird flu]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |publisher=[[Gilead Sciences]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619044137/http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |archivedate=June 19, 2007 |title=Donald H. Rumsfeld Named Chairman of Gilead Sciences |date= January 3, 1997}}</ref> As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when avian flu became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld [[recusal|recused]] himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's [[General Counsel]] to issue instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roche, Gilead Sciences resolve Tamiflu conflict|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-11-16-tamiflu-usat_x.htm |work=USA Today|first1=Julie|last1=Schmit |date=November 17, 2005|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=October 31, 2005 |url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/10/31/news/newsmakers/fortune_rumsfeld/ |department=[[CNNMoney]] |title=Rumsfeld's growing stake in Tamiflu |first1=Nelson D. |last1=Schwartz |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314083340/https://money.cnn.com/2005/10/31/news/newsmakers/fortune_rumsfeld/ |archivedate=March 14, 2010 |url-status=live |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Part-time public service===
During his business career, Rumsfeld continued part-time public service in various posts. In November 1983, Rumsfeld was appointed Special Envoy to the Middle East by President [[Ronald Reagan]], at a turbulent time in modern Middle Eastern history when Iraq was fighting Iran in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The United States wished for the conflict to end, and Rumsfeld was sent to the Middle East to serve as a mediator on behalf of the President.

[[File:Saddam rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|right|As President Reagan's Special Envoy to the Middle East, Rumsfeld met with [[Saddam Hussein]] during a visit to [[Baghdad]] in December 1983, during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (see video [[:File:Shakinghands high.OGG|here]]).]]

When Rumsfeld visited [[Baghdad]] on December 20, 1983, he met Saddam Hussein at Saddam's palace and had a 90-minute discussion. They largely agreed on opposing Syria's occupation of [[Lebanon]]; preventing Syrian and Iranian expansion; and preventing arms sales to Iran. Rumsfeld suggested that if U.S.-Iraq relations could improve the U.S. might support a new [[oil pipeline]] across [[Jordan]], which Iraq had opposed but was now willing to reconsider. Rumsfeld also informed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] that "Our efforts to assist were inhibited by certain things that made it difficult for us ... citing the use of chemical weapons."<ref name="own rules" />{{rp|159–60}}

Rumsfeld wrote in his memoir ''Known and Unknown'' that his meeting with Hussein "has been the subject of gossip, rumors, and crackpot conspiracy theories for more than a quarter of a century ... Supposedly I had been sent to see Saddam by President Reagan either to negotiate a secret oil deal, to help arm Iraq, or to make Iraq an American [[client state]]. The truth is that our encounter was more straightforward and less dramatic."<ref name="memoir" />{{rp|6}}

In addition to taking the position of Middle East envoy, Rumsfeld served as a member of the President's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control (1982–1986); President Reagan's Special Envoy on the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] (1982–1983); a senior adviser to President Reagan's Panel on Strategic Systems (1983–1984); a member of the Joint Advisory Commission on U.S./Japan Relations (1983–1984); a member of the National Commission on the Public Service (1987–1990); a member of the [[National Economic Commission]] (1988–1989); a member of the board of visitors of the [[National Defense University]] (1988–1992); a member of the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s High Definition Television Advisory Committee (1992–1993); a member of the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission (1999–2000); a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]; and chairman of the U.S. Commission to Assess National Security Space Management and Organization (2000). Among his most noteworthy positions was chairman of the nine-member [[Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States]] from January to July 1998. In its findings, the commission concluded that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea could develop intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities in five to ten years and that U.S. intelligence would have little warning before such systems were deployed.<ref>{{cite web |first=Donald |last=Rumsfeld |display-authors=etal |url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/missile/rumsfeld/ |title=Report of the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States |date=July 15, 1998 |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=May 29, 2019}}</ref>

During the 1980s, Rumsfeld became a member of the [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)|National Academy of Public Administration]], and was named a member of the boards of trustees of the Gerald R. Ford Foundation, the [[Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships]], the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] and the [[National Park Foundation]]. He was also a member of the U.S./Russia Business Forum and chairman of the Congressional Leadership's National Security Advisory Group.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bush Selects Rumsfeld for Another Term as Secretary of DefenseBoth Men Stress Importance of Missile Defense System|url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/4000/rumsfeld-picked-as-us-defense-secretary-(dec.-29).html|access-date=2020-07-30|website=www.defense-aerospace.com}}</ref> Rumsfeld was a member of the [[Project for the New American Century]], a think-tank dedicated to maintaining U.S. primacy. In addition, he was asked to serve the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] as a foreign policy consultant from 1990 to 1993. He also sat on European engineering giant [[Asea Brown Boveri]]'s board from 1990 to 2001, a company that sold two light-water nuclear reactors to the [[Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization]] for installation in [[North Korea]], as part of the [[Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|1994 agreed framework]] reached under President [[Bill Clinton]]. Rumsfeld's office said that he did not "recall it being brought before the board at any time" though ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reported that "board members were informed about this project".<ref name="Rummy2">{{cite news|title=Rummy's North Korea Connection; What did Donald Rumsfeld know about ABB's deal to build nuclear reactors there? And why won't he talk about it?|work=Fortune|date=May 12, 2003|page=75}}</ref>

===Presidential and vice presidential aspirations===
During the [[1976 Republican National Convention]], Rumsfeld received one vote for Vice President of the United States, although he did not seek the office, and the nomination was easily won by Ford's choice, Senator [[Bob Dole]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59886 |title=US Vice President - R Convention Race - Aug 16, 1976|work=OurCampaigns |accessdate=May 29, 2019}}</ref> During the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] he also received one vote for vice president.<ref>{{cite web|title=US Vice President - R Convention Race - Jul 14, 1980|publisher=OurCampaigns|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59877 |accessdate=May 29, 2019}}</ref> Economist [[Milton Friedman]] later noted that he, Friedman, regarded Reagan's pick of Bush as "the worst decision not only of his campaign but of his presidency", and that Rumsfeld was instead his preference. "Had he been chosen," Friedman said, "I believe he would have succeeded Reagan as president and the sorry Bush-Clinton period would never have occurred."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/twoluckypeopleme00frie |url-access=registration |title=Two Lucky People: Memoirs|first1=Milton |last1=Friedman |authorlink=Milton Friedman |first2=Rose |last2=Friedman |authorlink2=Rose Friedman|date=June 8, 1998|place=Chicago|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/twoluckypeopleme00frie/page/391 391]|isbn=978-0226264141}}</ref>

Rumsfeld briefly sought the presidential nomination [[1988 United States presidential election|in 1988]], but withdrew from the race before [[primary election|primaries]] began.<ref>{{cite web|title=US President - R Primaries Race - Feb 01, 1988|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55211 |publisher=OurCampaigns |accessdate=May 29, 2019}}</ref> During the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]] season, he initially formed a [[presidential exploratory committee]], but declined to formally enter the race.

Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense soon after President [[George W. Bush]] took office in 2001 despite Rumsfeld's past rivalry with the previous President Bush. Bush's first choice, [[FedEx]] founder [[Frederick W. Smith|Fred Smith]], was unavailable and Vice President-elect Cheney recommended Rumsfeld for the job.{{sfn|George W. Bush|2010|p=83–84}}
Rumsfeld's second tenure as Secretary of Defense cemented him as the most powerful Pentagon chief since [[Robert McNamara]] and one of the most influential Cabinet members in the Bush administration.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2002-12-09-1a-cover_x.htm|work=USA Today |date=December 9, 2002 |author=Moniz, Dave |title=Rumsfeld's abrasive style sparks conflict |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> His tenure would prove to be a pivotal and rocky one that led the United States military into the 21st century. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], Rumsfeld led the military planning and execution of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] and the subsequent [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He pushed hard to send as small a force as soon as possible to both conflicts, a concept codified as the [[Rumsfeld Doctrine]].<ref name="https://ndupress.ndu.edu">{{cite web |url=https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/Books/lessons-encountered/lessons-encountered_Ch1.pdf?ver=2015-09-29-125128-023.|title=Initial Planning and Execution in Afghanistan and Iraq By Joseph J. Collins|publisher=National Defense University Press |accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref>

Throughout his time as defense secretary, Rumsfeld was noted for his candor and quick wit when giving weekly press conferences or speaking with the press.<ref name="candor">{{cite news|date=January 20, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/opinion/rumsfeld-s-moment.html |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Wright, Robert |title=Rumsfeld's Moment |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |archivedate=May 14, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514141146/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/opinion/rumsfeld-s-moment.html}}</ref> ''U.S. News & World Report'' called him "a straight-talking Midwesterner" who "routinely has the press corps doubled over in fits of laughter".<ref name="candor" /> By the same token, his leadership was exposed to much criticism through provocative books covering the Iraq conflict, like Bob Woodward's ''State of Denial'', Thomas E. Ricks' ''Fiasco'', and Seymour Hersh's ''Chain of Command''.

Rumsfeld addressed the nation in a press conference at the Pentagon, just eight hours after the [[September 11 attacks]] and stated, "It's an indication that the United States government is functioning in the face of this terrible act against our country.

In the first emergency meeting of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] on the day of the attacks, Rumsfeld asked, "Why shouldn't we go against Iraq, not just al-Qaeda?" with his deputy [[Paul Wolfowitz]] adding that Iraq was a "brittle, oppressive regime that might break easily—it was doable," and, according to [[John Kampfner]], "from that moment on, he and Wolfowitz used every available opportunity to press the case."<ref name="BWARS">{{cite book

The idea was initially rejected, at the behest of Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], but, according to Kampfner, "Undeterred Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz held secret meetings about opening up a second front—against Saddam.

Clarke then stated, "We all said, 'No, no, al-Qa'ida is in Afghanistan.'" Clarke also revealed that Rumsfeld complained in the meeting, "there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan and there are lots of good targets in Iraq."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/rumsfeld-wanted-to-bomb-iraq-after-911-65340.html|title=Rumsfeld 'wanted to bomb Iraq' after 9/11|work=The Independent|date=March 21, 2004|accessdate=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

Rumsfeld wrote in ''Known and Unknown'', "Much has been written about the Bush administration's focus on Iraq after 9/11. Commentators have suggested that it was strange or obsessive for the President and his advisers to have raised questions about whether Saddam Hussein was somehow behind the attack. I have never understood the controversy. I had no idea if Iraq was or was not involved, but it would have been irresponsible for any administration not to have asked the question."<ref name="memoir" />{{rp|347}}

===War in Afghanistan===
Rumsfeld directed the planning for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]] after the September 11, attacks.<ref name="https://ndupress.ndu.edu" /> On September 21, 2001 [[United States Central Command|USCENTCOM]] Commander General [[Tommy Franks]], briefed the President on a plan to destroy al Qaeda in Afghanistan and remove the Taliban government. General Franks, also initially proposed to Rumsfeld that the U.S. invade Afghanistan using a conventional force of 60,000 troops, preceded by six months of preparation. Rumsfeld, however feared that a conventional invasion of Afghanistan could bog down as had happened to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviets]] and the [[1842 retreat from Kabul|British]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Special forces and horses|url=http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/special-forces-and-horses/ |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref> Rumsfeld rejected Franks's plan, saying "I want men on the ground now!"

Our objective is to defeat those who use terrorism and those who house or support them.

You cannot defend at every place at every time against every conceivable, imaginable, even unimaginable terrorist attack. And the only way to deal with it is to take the battle to where they are and to root them out and to starve them out by seeing that those countries and those organizations and those non-governmental organizations and those individuals that are supporting and harboring and facilitating these networks stop doing it and find that there's a penalty for doing it".<ref name="https://archive.defense.gov" /> Rusmfeld in another press conference at the Pentagon on October 29, 2001 stated "As the first weeks of this effort proceed, it bears repeating that our goal is not to reduce or simply contain terrorist acts, but our goal is to deal with it comprehensively. And we do not intend to stop until we've rooted out terrorist networks and put them out of business, not just in the case of the Taliban and the Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, but other networks as well. And as I've mentioned, the Al Qaeda network crosses some 40, 50-plus countries."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/rumsfeldtext_102901.html|title=Text: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld|work=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2001|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref> Rumsfeld announced in November 2001, that he received "authoritative reports" that Al-Qaeda's number three [[Mohammed Atef]], bin Laden's primary military chief and a planner of the September 11 attacks on America, was killed by a U.S. airstrike.<ref name="www.orlandosentinel.com">{{cite news |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2001-11-17-0111170104-story.html |title=U.S. Thinks Bomb Killed Bin Laden's Top Aide |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=November 17, 2001 |accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/rumsfeldtext_111901.html|title=Text:Pentagon Briefing with Secretary Rumsfeld|work=The Washington Post|date=November 19, 2001|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name="archive.defense.gov">{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2444|title=DoD News Briefing – Secretary Rumsfeld|date=November 19, 2001|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref> "He was very, very senior," Rumsfeld said.

On May 1, 2003, Rumsfeld during a visit to Afghanistan meeting with U.S. troops stationed in Kabul told the press "General Franks and I have been looking at the progress that's being made in this country and  have concluded that we are at a point where we clearly have moved from major combat activity to a period of stability and stabilization and reconstruction and activities." "I should underline however, that there are still dangers, there are still pockets of resistance in certain parts of the country and General McNeal and General Franks and their, the cooperation they have with the President Karzai's government and leadership and Marshall Fayheems assistance.

===Iraq War===

Rumsfeld (left) and the Commander of [[U.S. Central Command]] General [[Tommy Franks]], listen to a question at the close of a Pentagon press conference on March 5, 2003. Rumsfeld and Franks gave reporters an operational update and fielded questions on the possible conflict in Iraq.]]

Before and during the [[Iraq War]], Rumsfeld claimed that Iraq had an active weapons of mass destruction program; in particular during his famous phrase [[There are known knowns]] in a press conference at the Pentagon on February 12, 2002<ref name="defense.gov-transcript">{{cite web |url=http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636 |title=Defense.gov News Transcript: DoD News Briefing – Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen. Myers |publisher=United States Department of Defense |accessdate=}}</ref>
no stockpiles were ever found.<ref name="Frontline who said" /><ref name="FactCheck 2005-09-02" /> Bush administration officials also claimed that there was an operational relationship between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. A Pentagon Inspector General report found that Rumsfeld's top policy aide, [[Douglas J. Feith]], "developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers".<ref name="McClatchy 2007-02-07" />

The job of finding WMD and providing justification for the attack would fall to the intelligence services, but, according to Kampfner, "Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz believed that, while the established security services had a role, they were too bureaucratic and too traditional in their thinking." As a result, "they set up what came to be known as the 'cabal', a cell of eight or nine analysts in a new [[Office of Special Plans|Office of Special Plans (OSP)]] based in the U.S. Defense Department." According to an unnamed Pentagon source quoted by Hersh, the OSP "was created in order to find evidence of what Wolfowitz and his boss, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, believed to be true—that Saddam Hussein had close ties to [[Al Qaeda]], and that Iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical, biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons that threatened the region and, potentially, the United States".<ref name="Hersh" />

On January 22, 2003, after the German and French governments voiced opposition to invading Iraq, Rumsfeld labeled these countries as part of "[[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]]", implying that countries that supported the war were part of a newer, modern Europe.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 23, 2003 |title=Outrage at 'old Europe' remarks |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2687403.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421002430/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2687403.stm |archivedate=April 21, 2010 |url-status=live |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

After the war in Afghanistan was launched, Rumsfeld participated in a meeting in regard to the review of the Department of Defense's Contingency Plan in the event of a war with Iraq. The plan, as it was then conceived, contemplated troop levels of up to 500,000, which Rumsfeld felt was far too many. Gordon and Trainor wrote:

{{quote|As [General] Newbold outlined the plan ... it was clear that Rumsfeld was growing increasingly irritated. For Rumsfeld, the plan required too many troops and supplies and took far too long to execute. It was, Rumsfeld declared, the "product of old thinking and the embodiment of everything that was wrong with the military".<ref name="inside">Id.Gordon, Michael R. and Bernard E. Trainor, Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, 2006. Book excerpt from the Denver Post</ref>}}

Rumsfeld in a press conference at the Pentagon on February 27, 2003, told reporters after being asked a question that Army Chief of Staff General [[Eric Shinseki]] suggested it would take several hundred thousand troops on the ground to secure Iraq and provide stability. Is he wrong?. Rumsfeld replied "the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U.S. forces I think is far from the mark. The reality is that we already have a number of countries that have offered to participate with their forces in stabilization activities, in the event force has to be used."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=1957|title=Secretary Rumsfeld Media Availability with Afghan President Karzai |publisher=United States Department of Defense |date=February 27, 2003|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

Rumsfeld addressed the nation in a press conference at the Pentagon on March 20, 2003, just hours after the launch of the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], where he announced the first strike of the war to liberate Iraq and that "The days of the Saddam Hussein regime are numbered," and "We continue to feel there is no need for a broader conflict if the Iraqi leaders act to save themselves and act to prevent such a conflict."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=29267|title=Saddam's Days Numbered, Rumsfeld Says|publisher=United States Department of Defense |date=March 20, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref>

Rumsfeld's role in directing the [[Iraq War]] included a plan that was the [[Shock and Awe]] campaign,<ref name="sorties">"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2003/uscentaf_oif_report_30apr2003.pdf Operation Iraqi Freedom – By the Numbers]", [[USCENTAF]], April 30, 2003, 15.</ref> which resulted in a lightning invasion with 145,000 soldiers on the ground that took Baghdad in well under a month with very few American casualties.<ref name="sorties" /> Many government buildings, plus major museums, electrical generation infrastructure, and even oil equipment were looted and vandalized during the transition from the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime to the establishment of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]. A violent [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurrection]] began shortly after the military operation started.

On March 30, 2003, Rumsfeld in an interview with [[George Stephanopoulos]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[This Week (American TV program)|This Week program]], answered a question by Stephanopoulos about finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Rumsfeld stated "We know where they are. They're in the area around [[Tikrit]] and [[Baghdad]] and east, west, south and north somewhat."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/international/worldspecial/comments-by-donald-rumsfeld-on-this-week.html|title=Comments by Donald Rumsfeld on 'This Week'|work=The New York Times|date=March 30, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref>

On April 9, 2003, at a press conference at the Pentagon, Rumsfeld addressed reporters during the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Fall of Baghdad]], and stated "The scenes of free Iraqis celebrating in the streets, riding American tanks, tearing down the statues of Saddam Hussein in the center of Baghdad are breathtaking."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2339|title=DoD News Briefing - Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen.

After the Iraq invasion, U.S. troops were criticized for not protecting the historical artifacts and treasures located at the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. On April 11, 2003, at a press conference at the Pentagon, when asked at the time why U.S. troops did not actively seek to stop the lawlessness, Rumsfeld replied, "Stuff happens ... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They're also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that's what's going to happen here."<ref name="StuffHappens">{{cite web |url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2367 |title=DoD News Briefing – Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen.

On July 24, 2003, at a press conference at the Pentagon, Rumsfeld commented on the release of photographs of the deceased [[Uday Hussein]] and [[Qusay Hussein]]. "It is not a practice that the United States engages in on a normal basis," Rumsfeld said. "I honestly believe that these two are particularly bad characters and that it's important for the Iraqi people to see them, to know they're gone, to know they're dead, and to know they're not coming back." Rumsfeld also said, "I feel it was the right decision, and I'm glad I made it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2894|title=DoD News Briefing - Secretary Rumsfeld and Ambassador Bremer|publisher=United States Department of Defense |date=July 24, 2003 |accessdate=July 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=28678|title=Photos of Hussein Brothers' Bodies Provide Proof to Iraqis|publisher=United States Department of Defense |date=July 24, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/24/international/worldspecial/images-of-husseins-sons-met-with-joy-and.html|title=Images of Hussein's Sons Met With Joy and Skepticism|work=The New York Times|date=July 24, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref>

In October 2003, Rumsfeld approved a secret Pentagon "roadmap" on public relations, calling for "boundaries" between information operations abroad and the news media at home. The Roadmap advances a policy according to which as long as the U.S. government does not intentionally target the American public, it does not matter that [[psychological operations]] reach the American public.<ref>{{cite book

On December 14, 2003, Rumsfeld in an interview with journalist [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' after U.S. forces captured [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]], stated, "Here was a man who was photographed hundreds of times shooting off rifles and showing how tough he was, and in fact, he wasn't very tough, he was cowering in a hole in the ground, and had a pistol and didn't use it, and certainly did not put up any fight at all. I think that ... he resulted in the death of an awful lot of Iraqi people, In the last analysis, he seemed not terribly brave."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/exclusive-rumsfeld-on-saddam/|title=Exclusive: Rumsfeld On Saddam|publisher=CBS News|date=December 14, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2020}}</ref>

As Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld was deliberate in crafting the public message from the Department of Defense. People will "rally" to the word "sacrifice", Rumsfeld noted after a meeting. "They are looking for leadership. Sacrifice = Victory." In May 2004, Rumsfeld considered whether to redefine the war on terrorism as a fight against "worldwide insurgency". He advised aides "to test what the results could be" if the war on terrorism were renamed.<ref name="FromDesk">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/31/AR2007103103095.html?hpid=topnews|title=From the Desk of Donald Rumsfeld ... |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 1, 2007|first=Robin|last=Wright}}</ref> Rumsfeld also ordered specific public Pentagon attacks on and responses to U.S. newspaper columns that reported the negative aspects of the war.

During Rumsfeld's tenure, he would regularly visit U.S. troops stationed in Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=26486|title=Rumsfeld Arrives in Baghdad to Visit Troops, Meet with Leaders|publisher=United States Department of Defense |date=May 13, 2004|accessdate=July 5, 2020}}</ref>

The Australia Broadcasting Corporation reported that though Rumsfeld didn't specify a withdrawal date for troops in Iraq, "He says it would be unrealistic to wait for Iraq to be peaceful before removing US led forces from the country, adding that Iraq had never been peaceful and perfect."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-09-25/us-troops-can-leave-before-iraq-peaceful-rumsfeld/557522 |newspaper=Australia Broadcasting Corporation |title=US troops can leave before Iraq peaceful: Rumsfeld |date=September 24, 2004 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 }}</ref>

On August 2, 2006, at a press conference at the Pentagon, Rumsfeld commented on the [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–2009)|Sectarian violence in Iraq]]
where he stated "there's sectarian violence; people are being killed. Sunnis are killing Shi'a and Shi'a are killing Sunnis.  Kurds seem not to be involved.  It's unfortunate, and they need a reconciliation process."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=3692|title=DoD News Briefing with Secretary of Defense Donald H.

On October 26, 2006 at a press conference at the Pentagon after the failure of [[Operation Together Forward]] in Iraq, Rumsfeld stated "Would defeat in Iraq be so bad?" Well, the answer is: Yes, it would be. Those who are fighting against the Iraqi government want to seize power so that they can establish a new sanctuary and a base of operations for terrorists and any idea that U.S. military leaders are rigidly refusing to make adjustments in their approaches is just flat wrong. the military is continuing to adapt and to adjust as required.

As a result, Rumsfeld stirred controversy as to whether the forces that did invade Iraq were enough in size.<ref name="inside" /> In 2006, Rumsfeld responded to a question by [[Brit Hume]] of Fox News as to whether he pressed General [[Tommy Franks]] to lower his request for 400,000 troops for the war:

{{quote|Absolutely not. That's a mythology. This town [Washington, D.C] is filled with this kind of nonsense.

Throughout his tenure, Rumsfeld sought to remind the American people of the 9/11 attacks and threats against Americans, noting at one time in a 2006 memo to "[m]ake the American people realize they are surrounded in the world by violent extremists".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=MCJYFVHYHCMGNQFIQMGSFGGAVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2007/11/02/wgulf402.xml |title=Rumsfeld 'kept up fear of terror attacks' |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 11, 2007 |location=London |first=Boris |last=Johnson |url-status=live |archivedate=November 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116052736/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Bjsessionid%3DMCJYFVHYHCMGNQFIQMGSFGGAVCBQWIV0?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F11%2F02%2Fwgulf402.xml}}</ref><ref name="FromDesk" /> According to ''The Guardian'' report, Rumsfeld was allegedly including [[Bible|biblical]] quotes in top secret briefing papers to appeal George W Bush, known for his devout religious beliefs, to invade Iraq as more like "holy war" or "a religious crusade" against Muslims.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/18/rumsfeld-gq-iraq-bible-quotes-bush Iraq war briefings headlined with biblical quotes, reports US magazine] ''The Guardian''</ref>

In a September 2007 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]], the head of the [[British army]] during the invasion, criticized Rumsfeld's plans for the invasion of Iraq as "intellectually bankrupt", adding that Rumsfeld is "one of those most responsible for the current situation in Iraq", and that he felt that "the US approach to combating global terrorism is 'inadequate' and too focused on military might rather than [[nation building]] and diplomacy."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/01/wirq601.xml |author1=Robert Watts |author2=Tim Shipman |title=Gen Sir Mike Jackson's attack draws US ire |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |date=September 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017092732/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F09%2F01%2Fwirq601.xml |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |location=London |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Condolence letters ===
In December 2004, Rumsfeld was heavily criticized for using a [[Autopen|signing machine]] instead of personally signing over 1000 letters of condolence to the families of soldiers killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. He promised to personally sign all letters in the future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/rumsfeld-to-personally-sign-all-condolence-letters-1.27255|title=Rumsfeld to personally sign all condolence letters|date=December 17, 2004|work=Stars and Stripes|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref>

===Prisoner abuse and torture concerns===

{{Further|Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse}}
The Department of Defense's preliminary concerns for holding, housing, and interrogating captured prisoners on the battlefield were raised during the military build-up prior to the Iraq War. Because Saddam Hussein's military forces surrendered when faced with military action, many within the DOD, including Rumsfeld and United States Central Command General [[Tommy Franks]], decided it was in the best interest of all to hand these prisoners over to their respective countries. Additionally, it was determined that maintaining a large holding facility was, at the time, unrealistic. Instead, the use of many facilities such as [[Abu Ghraib]] would be used to house prisoners of interest prior to handing them over, and Rumsfeld defended the Bush administration's decision to detain [[enemy combatant]]s. Because of this, critics, including members of the [[U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee]], would hold Rumsfeld responsible for the ensuing [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal. Rumsfeld himself said: "These events occurred on my watch as Secretary of Defense. I am accountable for them."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/09/iraq.abuse.main.int/ |publisher=CNN |title=Rumsfeld 'the best' |date=May 9, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040511033734/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/09/iraq.abuse.main.int/ |archivedate=May 11, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He offered his resignation to President Bush in the wake of the scandal, but it was not accepted.<ref>Bush, George W.

In a memo read by Rumsfeld detailing how Guantanamo interrogators would induce stress in prisoners by forcing them to remain standing in one position for a maximum of four hours, Rumsfeld scrawled a handwritten note on the memo reading: "I stand for 8–10 hours a day.

Rumsfeld was awarded the "Defender of the Constitution Award" at the 2011 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in Washington, D.C., on February 10, 2011.

After his retirement from government, Rumsfeld criticized former fellow Cabinet member [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in his memoir, asserting that she was basically unfit for office. In 2011, she responded, saying that Rumsfeld "doesn't know what he's talking about.

In October 2011, Rumsfeld conducted an interview with [[Al Jazeera]]'s Washington, D.C. bureau chief [[Abderrahim Foukara]]. Foukara asked Rumsfeld whether, in hindsight, the Bush administration had sent enough troops into Iraq to secure the borders of the country, and whether that made the United States culpable in the death of innocent Iraqis. Foukara said people in the Pentagon told Rumsfeld the quantity of troops sent into Iraq was insufficient.
Rumsfeld said, "You keep making assertions which are fundamentally false. No one in the Pentagon said they were not enough," Foukara pressed Rumsfeld repeatedly. Rumsfeld then asked "Do you want to yell or do you want to have an interview?" Foukara then asked "Do you think the numbers that you went to Iraq with did absolve you from the responsibility of tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis killed by the Coalition and those criminals that you talked about?" Rumsfeld called the question "pejorative", said Foukara was "not being respectful" (Foukara disagreed) and was "just talking over, and over, and over again".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/1011/Rumsfelds_second_Al_Jazeera_interview_less_cordial.html|title=Rumsfeld's second Al Jazeera interview less cordial|work=Politico|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=July 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/10/donald-rumsfelds-hate-love-hate-relationship-al-jazeera/337117/|title=Donald Rumsfeld's Hate-Love-Hate-Relationship with Al Jazeera|work=The Atlantic|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=July 6, 2020}}</ref>
