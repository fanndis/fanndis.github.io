The '''National Association for the Advancement of Colored People''' ('''NAACP'''){{efn|NAACP is usually pronounced "N double-A C P."}} is a [[civil rights]] organization in the United States, formed in 1909 as an interracial endeavor to advance justice for [[African Americans]] by a group including [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Mary White Ovington]],  [[Moorfield Storey]] and [[Ida B. Wells]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Colored-People|title=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People {{!}} History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref><ref>Kwame Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., eds.

Its mission in the 21st century is "to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination". National NAACP initiatives include political lobbying, publicity efforts and litigation strategies developed by its legal team.<ref name="History and Geography">{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/NAACP_intro.shtml |title=NAACP History and Geography |website=Mapping American Social Movements Through the 20th Century |publisher=University of Washington |date= |accessdate=April 13, 2017}}</ref> The group enlarged its mission in the late 20th century by considering issues such as [[police misconduct]], the status of black foreign refugees and questions of economic development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/about/mission/ |title=NAACP – Our Mission |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611053922/http://www.naacp.org/about/mission/ |archivedate=June 11, 2008 }}</ref> Its name, retained in accordance with tradition, uses the once common term ''[[colored people]],'' referring to those with some African ancestry.

The NAACP bestows annual awards on African Americans in two categories: [[NAACP Image Awards|Image Awards]] are for achievement in the arts and entertainment, and [[Spingarn Medal]]s are for outstanding achievement of any kind. Its headquarters is in [[Baltimore]], Maryland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/about/contact/form/ |title=Contact Us |publisher=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People |accessdate=November 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109213340/http://www.naacp.org/about/contact/form/ |archivedate=November 9, 2009 }}</ref> On June 29, 2020 Washington, D.C. radio station [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] reported that the NAACP intends to relocate its national headquarters from its longtime home in Baltimore, Maryland to the Franklin D.

==Organization==
The NAACP is headquartered in Baltimore, with additional regional offices in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Michigan]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Maryland, [[Texas]], [[Colorado]] and [[California]].<ref>NAACP, "[http://naacp.3cdn.net/1b6e74deb6b68ca8e3_67m6be3cp.pdf Youth and College – Advisor's Manual] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723000320/http://naacp.3cdn.net/1b6e74deb6b68ca8e3_67m6be3cp.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}", p 9.</ref> Each regional office is responsible for coordinating the efforts of state conferences in that region. Local, youth, and college chapters organize activities for individual members.

In the U.S., the NAACP is administered by a 64-member board, led by a chairperson. The board elects one person as the president and one as chief executive officer for the organization. [[Julian Bond]], [[civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] activist and former Georgia State Senator, was chairman until replaced in February 2010 by health-care administrator [[Roslyn Brock]].<ref>Ian Urbina, "Health Executive Named Chairwoman of N.A.A.C.P.", ''The New York Times'', February 21, 2010, p. 4.</ref> For decades in the first half of the 20th century, the organization was effectively led by its executive secretary, who acted as chief operating officer. [[James Weldon Johnson]] and [[Walter F. White]], who served in that role successively from 1920 to 1958, were much more widely known as NAACP leaders than were presidents during those years.

The organization has never had a woman president, except on a temporary basis, and there have been calls to name one. [[Lorraine C. Miller]] served as interim president after [[Benjamin Jealous]] stepped down. [[Maya Wiley]] was rumored to be in line for the position in 2013, but [[Cornell William Brooks]] was selected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/us/amid-tumult-naacp-elects-18th-leader.html|title=Amid Tumult, N.A.A.C.P.

Departments within the NAACP govern areas of action. Local chapters are supported by the 'Branch and Field Services' department and the 'Youth and College' department. The 'Legal' department focuses on [[court case]]s of broad application to minorities, such as systematic [[discrimination]] in employment, government, or education. The [[Washington, D.C.]], bureau is responsible for [[lobbying]] the U.S. government, and the Education Department works to improve [[public education]] at the local, state and federal levels. The goal of the Health Division is to advance health care for minorities through public policy initiatives and education.

{{as of|2007}}, the NAACP had approximately 425,000 paying and non-paying members.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-04-naacp_N.htm |title=NAACP president to step down, cites discord with board |first=Erin |last=Texeira |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |accessdate=March 4, 2007 | date=March 5, 2007}}</ref>

The NAACP's non-current records are housed at the [[Library of Congress]], which has served as the organization's official repository since 1964.

==Predecessor: The Niagara Movement==
{{Main|Niagara Movement}}

The [[Pan-American Exposition]] of 1901 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York featured many American innovations and achievements, but also included a disparaging caricature of slave life in the South as well as a depiction of life in Africa, called "Old Plantation" and "Darkest Africa," respectively.<ref name="Expo">{{cite book|last1=Goldman|first1=Mark|title=City on the edge : Buffalo, New York|date=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=9781591024576|pages=19–22}}</ref> A local African-American woman, [[Mary Burnett Talbert|Mary Talbert]] of [[Ohio]], was appalled by the exhibit, as [[Paris World's Fair|a similar one in Paris]] highlighted black achievements.  She informed [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] of the situation, and a coalition began to form.<ref name="Expo" />

In 1905, a group of thirty-two prominent African-American leaders met to discuss the challenges facing African Americans and possible strategies and solutions.  They were particularly concerned by the [[American South|Southern states]]' [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of blacks starting with [[Mississippi]]'s passage of a new constitution in 1890.  Through 1908, Southern legislatures, dominated by white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], ratified new constitutions and laws creating barriers to voter registration and more complex election rules.  In practice, this caused the exclusion of most blacks and many poor whites from the political system in southern states, crippling the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in most of the South.  Black voter registration and turnout dropped markedly in the South as a result of such legislation.  Men who had been voting for thirty years in the South were told they did not "qualify" to register.  White-dominated legislatures also passed segregation and [[Jim Crow]] laws.

Because hotels in the US were segregated, the men convened in [[Canada]] at the Erie Beach Hotel<ref name="eriebeach">{{cite web |url=http://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b004-i088 |title=Niagara Movement First Annual Meeting |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> on the Canadian side of the [[Niagara River]] in [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]], Ontario.  As a result, the group came to be known as the [[Niagara Movement]].  A year later, three non-African-Americans joined the group: journalist [[William English Walling]], a wealthy socialist; and social workers [[Mary White Ovington]] and [[Henry Moskowitz (civil rights leader)|Henry Moskowitz]].  Moskowitz, who was Jewish, was then also Associate Leader of the [[New York Society for Ethical Culture]].  They met in 1906 at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], West Virginia, and in 1907 in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Massachusetts.<ref name="niagarahistory">{{cite web |url=http://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b157-i205 |title=The story of the Niagara Movement and the N.A.A.C.P.}}</ref>

The fledgling group struggled for a time with limited resources and internal conflict, and disbanded in 1910.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.umass.edu/spcoll/digital/niagara.htm |title=Niagara Movement |work=W.E.B.

Historically, it is considered to have had a more radical platform than the NAACP.  The Niagara Movement was formed exclusively by African Americans.  Three European Americans were among the founders of the NAACP.

The [[Springfield Race Riot of 1908|Race Riot of 1908]] in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], Illinois, the state capital and President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s hometown, was a catalyst showing the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. In the decades around the turn of the century, the rate of [[lynchings]] of blacks, particularly men, was at an all-time high. [[Mary White Ovington]], journalist [[William English Walling]] and [[Henry Moskowitz (civil rights leader)|Henry Moskowitz]] met in [[New York City]] in January 1909 to work on organizing for black civil rights.<ref name="NAACP Timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.naacp.org/about/history/timeline/ |title=NAACP Timeline |work=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617133445/http://www.naacp.org/about/history/timeline/ |archivedate=June 17, 2010  }}</ref> They sent out solicitations for support to more than 60 prominent Americans, and set a meeting date for February 12, 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the first large meeting did not take place until three months later, the February date is often cited as the founding date of the organization.

The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909, by a larger group including African Americans [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Ida B. Wells]], [[Archibald Grimké]], [[Mary Church Terrell]], and the previously named whites [[Henry Moskowitz (civil rights leader)|Henry Moskowitz]], [[Mary White Ovington]], [[William English Walling]] (the wealthy Socialist son of a former slave-holding family),<ref name="NAACP Timeline" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAwalling.htm |title=William English Walling biography |author=Simkin, John |publisher=Spartacus Educational |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104220140/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAwalling.htm |archivedate=January 4, 2014  }}</ref> [[Florence Kelley]], a social reformer and friend of Du Bois;<ref>Kathryn Kish Sklar, "Florence Kelley", in Rima Lunin Schultz and Adele Hast (eds), ''Women Building Chicago, 1790–1990: A Biographical Dictionary'', Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 2001, p. 463.</ref> [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], and [[Charles Edward Russell]], a renowned [[muckraker]] and close friend of Walling.

On May 30, 1909, the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's [[Henry Street Settlement]] House; they created an organization of more than 40, identifying as the [[National Negro Committee]].<ref name=Marlin>{{cite news|last=Marlin|first=John Tepper|title=NAACP, Happy 100th Birthday|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-tepper-marlin/naacp-happy-100th-birthda_b_166264.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}</ref>  Among other founding members was [[Lillian Wald]], a nurse who had founded the Henry Street Settlement where the conference took place.
 
Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings.  Also in attendance was [[Ida B. Wells-Barnett]], an African-American journalist and anti-[[lynching]] crusader. Wells-Barnett addressed the conference on the history of lynching in the United States and called for action to publicize and prosecute such crimes.<ref>Wells-Barnett, Ida A., "Lynching:  Our National Cause",  [http://moses.law.umn.edu/darrow/documents/Proceedings%20of%20the%20National%20Negro%20Conference%201909_%20New%20York_%20May%2031%20and%20June_1.pdf ''Proceedings of the National Negro Conference''], p. 174.

The NAACP was incorporated a year later in 1911. The association's charter expressed its mission:

{{quote|text=To promote equality of rights and eradicate caste or race prejudice among citizens of the United States; to advance the interest of colored citizens; to secure for them impartial suffrage; and to increase their opportunities for securing justice in the courts, education for their children, employment according to their ability, and complete equality before the law.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Snowden-McCray |first1=Lisa |title=The NAACP Was Established February 12, 1909 |url=https://www.thecrisismagazine.com/single-post/2019/02/12/The-NAACP-Was-Established-Febuary-12-1909 |website=[[The Crisis]] |accessdate=July 28, 2020 |date=February 13, 2019}}</ref>}}

The larger conference resulted in a more diverse organization, where the leadership was predominantly white. [[Moorfield Storey]], a white attorney from a Boston abolitionist family, served as the president of the NAACP from its founding to 1915. At its founding, the NAACP had one African American on its executive board, Du Bois. Storey was a long-time classical liberal and [[Grover Cleveland]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' free markets, the [[gold standard]], and [[anti-imperialism]]. Storey consistently and aggressively championed [[civil rights]], not only for blacks but also for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and immigrants (he opposed immigration restrictions). Du Bois continued to play a pivotal leadership role in the organization, serving as editor of the association's magazine, ''[[The Crisis]],'' which had a circulation of more than 30,000.

''The Crisis'' was used both for news reporting and for publishing African-American poetry and literature. During the organization's campaigns against lynching, Du Bois encouraged the writing and performance of plays and other expressive literature about this issue.

The Jewish community contributed greatly to the NAACP's founding and continued financing.<ref name="myjewishlearning1" /> Jewish historian [[Howard Sachar]] writes in his book ''A History of Jews in America'' that "In 1914, Professor Emeritus [[Joel Elias Spingarn|Joel Spingarn]] of [[Columbia University]] became chairman of the NAACP and recruited for its board such Jewish leaders as [[Jacob Schiff]], [[Jacob Billikopf]], and Rabbi [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen Wise]]."<ref name="myjewishlearning1">{{cite web

===Jim Crow and disenfranchisement===
[[File:ColoredDrinking.jpg|thumb|An African American drinks out of a segregated water cooler designated for "colored" patrons in 1939 at a streetcar terminal in [[Oklahoma City]].]]
[[File:JimCrowInDurhamNC.jpg|thumb|Sign for the "colored" waiting room at a bus station in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], North Carolina, 1940]] In its early years, the NAACP was based in New York City. It concentrated on litigation in efforts to overturn disenfranchisement of blacks, which had been established in every southern state by 1908, excluding most from the political system, and the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow statutes]] that legalized [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]].

In 1913, the NAACP organized opposition to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s introduction of racial segregation into federal government policy, workplaces, and hiring. African-American women's clubs were among the organizations that protested Wilson's changes, but the administration did not alter its assuagement of Southern cabinet members and the Southern block in Congress.

By 1914, the group had 6,000 members and 50 branches. It was influential in winning the right of African Americans to serve as military officers in [[World War I]]. Six hundred African-American officers were commissioned and 700,000 men registered for the draft. The following year, the NAACP organized a nationwide protest, with marches in numerous cities, against [[D. W. Griffith]]'s silent movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation]],'' a film that glamorized the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. As a result, several cities refused to allow the film to open.

The NAACP began to lead lawsuits targeting disfranchisement and racial segregation early in its history. It played a significant part in the challenge of ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915) to [[Oklahoma]]'s discriminatory [[grandfather clause]], which effectively disenfranchised most black citizens while exempting many whites from certain voter registration requirements. It persuaded the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to rule in ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' in 1917 that state and local governments cannot officially segregate African Americans into separate residential districts. The Court's opinion reflected the jurisprudence of property rights and freedom of contract as embodied in the earlier precedent it established in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]''.

In 1916, chairman Joel Spingarn invited [[James Weldon Johnson]] to serve as field secretary. Johnson was a former U.S. consul to [[Venezuela]] and a noted African-American scholar and columnist. Within four years, Johnson was instrumental in increasing the NAACP's membership from 9,000 to almost 90,000. In 1920, Johnson was elected head of the organization. Over the next ten years, the NAACP escalated its lobbying and litigation efforts, becoming internationally known for its advocacy of equal rights and equal protection for the "American Negro."

The NAACP devoted much of its energy during the [[interwar years]] to fighting the [[lynching]] of blacks throughout the United States by working for legislation, lobbying and educating the public. The organization sent its field secretary [[Walter Francis White|Walter F. White]] to [[Phillips County, Arkansas|Phillips County]], Arkansas, in October 1919, to investigate the [[Elaine Race Riot]]. More than 200 black tenant farmers were killed by roving white vigilantes and federal troops after a deputy sheriff's attack on a union meeting of [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] left one white man dead. White published his report on the riot in the ''Chicago Daily News''.<ref>Kenneth Robert Janken, ''Walter White: Mr. NAACP'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2006, p.49</ref> The NAACP organized the appeals for twelve black men sentenced to death a month later based on the fact that testimony used in their convictions was obtained by beatings and electric shocks. It gained a groundbreaking Supreme Court decision in ''[[Moore v. Dempsey]]'' {{ussc|261|86|1923}} that significantly expanded the Federal courts' oversight of the states' criminal justice systems in the years to come. White investigated eight race riots and 41 lynchings for the NAACP and directed its study ''Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States''.<ref>Kenneth Robert Janken, ''Walter White: Mr. NAACP'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2006, p.2 and 42</ref>

[[File:NAACP leaders with poster NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|NAACP leaders Henry L. Moon, [[Roy Wilkins]], [[Herbert Hill (labor director)|Herbert Hill]], and [[Thurgood Marshall]] in 1956.]]
The NAACP also worked for more than a decade seeking federal anti-lynching legislation, but the [[Solid South]] of white Democrats voted as a bloc against it or used the filibuster in the Senate to block passage. Because of disenfranchisement, African Americans in the South were unable to elect representatives of their choice to office. The NAACP regularly displayed [[A man was lynched yesterday flag|a black flag stating "A Man Was Lynched Yesterday"]] from the window of its offices in New York to mark each lynching.

In alliance with the [[American Federation of Labor]], the NAACP led the successful fight to prevent the nomination of [[John Parker (judge)|John Johnston Parker]] to the Supreme Court, based on his support for denying the vote to blacks and his anti-labor rulings. It organized legal support for the [[Scottsboro Boys]]. The NAACP lost most of the internecine battles with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and [[International Labor Defense]] over the control of those cases and the legal strategy to be pursued in that case.

The organization also brought litigation to challenge the "[[white primary]]" system in the South. Southern state Democratic parties had created white-only primaries as another way of barring blacks from the political process. Since southern states were dominated by the Democrats, the primaries were the only competitive contests. In 1944 in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'', the Supreme Court ruled against the white primary. Although states had to retract legislation related to the white primaries, the legislatures soon came up with new methods to severely limit the franchise for blacks.

===Legal Defense Fund===
The board of directors of the NAACP created the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]] in 1939 specifically for tax purposes. It functioned as the NAACP legal department. Intimidated by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, the Legal and Educational Defense Fund, Inc., became a separate legal entity in 1957, although it was clear that it was to operate in accordance with NAACP policy. After 1961 serious disputes emerged between the two organizations, creating considerable confusion in the eyes and minds of the public.<ref>Benjamin L. Hooks, "Birth and Separation of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund," ''Crisis'' 1979 86(6): 218–220.  0011–1422</ref>

===Desegregation===

By the 1940s, the federal courts were amenable to lawsuits regarding constitutional rights, which Congressional action was virtually impossible.  With the rise of private corporate litigators such as the NAACP to bear the expense, civil suits became the pattern in modern civil rights litigation,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard L. Pacelle, Jr|author2=Brett W. Curry|author3=Bryan W. Marshall|title=Decision Making by the Modern Supreme Court|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnVP2trSfcIC&pg=PA111|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=111|isbn=9781139498791}}</ref> and the public face of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].  The NAACP's Legal department, headed by [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]], undertook a campaign spanning several decades to bring about the reversal of the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine announced by the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.

The NAACP's [[Baltimore]] chapter, under president [[Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson]], challenged segregation in Maryland state professional schools by supporting the 1935 ''[[Murray v. Pearson]]'' case argued by Marshall. Houston's victory in ''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'' (1938) led to the formation of the Legal Defense Fund in 1939.

The campaign for desegregation culminated in a unanimous 1954 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that held state-sponsored segregation of public elementary schools was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. Bolstered by that victory, the NAACP pushed for full desegregation throughout the South.<ref>James T. Patterson and William W. Freehling, ''Brown v. Board of Education: A civil rights milestone and its troubled legacy'' (2001).</ref> NAACP activists were excited about the judicial strategy. Starting on December 5, 1955, NAACP activists, including [[Edgar Nixon]], its local president, and [[Rosa Parks]], who had served as the chapter's Secretary, helped organize a [[Montgomery bus boycott|bus boycott]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama. This was designed to protest segregation on the city's buses, two-thirds of whose riders were black. The boycott lasted 381 days.<ref>Randall Kennedy,  "Martin Luther King's constitution: a legal history of the Montgomery bus boycott." ''Yale Law Journal'' 98.6 (1989): 999–1067.</ref>  The State of Alabama responded by effectively barring the NAACP from operating within its borders because of its refusal to divulge a list of its members. The NAACP feared members could be fired or face violent retaliation for their activities. Although the Supreme Court eventually overturned the state's action in ''[[NAACP v. Alabama]]'', {{ussc|357|449|1958}}, the NAACP lost its leadership role in the Civil Rights Movement while it was barred from Alabama.

New organizations such as the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC, in 1957) and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC, in 1960) rose up with different approaches to activism. Rather than relying on litigation and legislation, these newer groups employed direct action and mass mobilization to advance the rights of African Americans. [[Roy Wilkins]], NAACP's executive director, clashed repeatedly with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and other civil rights leaders over questions of strategy and leadership within the movement.

The NAACP continued to use the Supreme Court's decision in Brown to press for desegregation of schools and public facilities throughout the country. [[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)|Daisy Bates]], president of its Arkansas state chapter, spearheaded the campaign by the [[Little Rock Nine]] to [[racial integration|integrate]] the public schools in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Arkansas.<ref>Judith Bloom Fradin,  and Dennis B. Fradin, ''The power of one: Daisy Bates and the Little Rock Nine'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2004).</ref>

By the mid-1960s, the NAACP had regained some of its preeminence in the Civil Rights Movement by pressing for civil rights legislation. The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] took place on August 28, 1963. That fall President John F. Kennedy sent a civil rights bill to Congress before he was assassinated.

President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] worked hard to persuade Congress to pass a civil rights bill aimed at ending racial discrimination in employment, education and public accommodations, and succeeded in gaining passage in July 1964. He followed that with passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which provided for protection of the franchise, with a role for federal oversight and administrators in places where voter turnout was historically low.

Under its anti-desegregation director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the [[FBI]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] program targeted civil rights groups, including the NAACP, for infiltration, disruption and discreditation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Federal Surveillance of African Americans |url=https://library.uncw.edu/eresources/federal_surveillance_african_americans |publisher=University of North Carolina Wilmington}}</ref>

[[Kivie Kaplan]] became NAACP President in 1966.  After his death in 1975, scientist [[W. Montague Cobb]] took over until 1982. [[Roy Wilkins]] retired as executive director in 1977, and [[Benjamin Hooks]], a lawyer and clergyman, was elected his successor.

===The 1990s===
In the 1990s, the NAACP ran into debt. The dismissal of two leading officials further added to the picture of an organization in deep crisis.

In 1993, the NAACP's Board of Directors narrowly selected Reverend [[Benjamin Chavis]] over Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] to fill the position of Executive Director. A controversial figure, Chavis was ousted eighteen months later by the same board. They accused him of using NAACP funds for an out-of-court settlement in a sexual harassment lawsuit.<ref name="Marable">{{cite web |work=Along the Color Line |date=August 2002 |first=Manning |last=Marable |title=The NAACP's 93rd Convention: An Assessment (archived copy) |url=http://www.manningmarable.net/works/pdf/aug02a.pdf  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106002529/http://www.manningmarable.net/works/pdf/aug02a.pdf |archivedate = January 6, 2007}}</ref>
Following the dismissal of Chavis, [[Myrlie Evers-Williams]] narrowly defeated NAACP chairperson [[William Gibson (NAACP)|William Gibson]] for president in 1995, after Gibson was accused of overspending and mismanagement of the organization's funds.

In 1996, Congressman [[Kweisi Mfume]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] Congressman from Maryland and former head of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], was named the organization's president. Three years later strained finances forced the organization to drastically cut its staff, from 250 in 1992 to 50.

In the second half of the 1990s, the organization restored its finances, permitting the NAACP National Voter Fund to launch a major get-out-the-vote offensive in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential elections]]. 10.5 million African Americans cast their ballots in the election. This was one million more than four years before.<ref name="Marable" /> The NAACP's effort was credited by observers as playing a significant role in Democrat [[Al Gore]]'s winning several states where the election was close, such as [[Pennsylvania]] and Michigan.<ref name="Marable" />

===Lee Alcorn controversy===
During the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 Presidential election]], Lee Alcorn, president of the [[Dallas]] NAACP branch, criticized [[Al Gore]]'s selection of Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] for his Vice-Presidential candidate because Lieberman was Jewish. On a gospel talk radio show on station KHVN, Alcorn stated, "If we get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this movement for, you know? Does it have anything to do with the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process#1996–99 agreements|failed peace talks]]?"..."So I think we need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money and these kind of things."<ref name=CBS1>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/08/09/politics/main223114.shtml|date=August 9, 2000|title=NAACP Leader Quits Under Fire|publisher=CBS News}}</ref>

NAACP President [[Kweisi Mfume]] immediately suspended Alcorn and condemned his remarks. Mfume stated, "I strongly condemn those remarks. I find them to be repulsive, anti-Semitic, anti-NAACP and anti-American. Mr. Alcorn does not speak for the NAACP, its board, its staff or its membership. We are proud of our long-standing relationship with the [[American Jews|Jewish community]] and I personally will not tolerate statements that run counter to the history and beliefs of the NAACP in that regard."<ref name=CBS1 />

Alcorn, who had been suspended three times in the previous five years for misconduct, subsequently resigned from the NAACP. He founded what he called the Coalition for the Advancement of Civil Rights. Alcorn criticized the NAACP, saying, "I can't support the leadership of the NAACP. Large amounts of money are being given to them by large corporations that I have a problem with."<ref name=CBS1 /> Alcorn also said, "I cannot be bought. For this reason I gladly offer my resignation and my membership to the NAACP because I cannot work under these constraints."<ref name=CNN1>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/09/lieberman.naacp/index.html|date=August 9, 2000|title=Bush campaign denounces Dallas NAACP comments on Lieberman|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Alcorn's remarks were also condemned by the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]], Jewish groups and George W. Bush's rival Republican presidential campaign. Jackson said he strongly supported Lieberman's addition to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket, saying, "When we live our faith, we live under the law. He [Lieberman] is a firewall of exemplary behavior."<ref name=CBS1 />
[[Al Sharpton]], another prominent African-American leader, said, "The appointment of Mr. Lieberman was to be welcomed as a positive step."<ref name=Guardian1>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/print/0,,4049962-103632,00.html|date=August 10, 2000|title=Black leader suspended for anti-semitic Lieberman slur|author=Duncan Campbell |newspaper=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> The leaders of the [[American Jewish Congress]] praised the NAACP for its quick response, stating that: "It will take more than one bigot like Alcorn to shake the sense of fellowship of [[American Jews]] with the NAACP and black America ... Our common concerns are too urgent, our history too long, our connection too sturdy, to let anything like this disturb our relationship."<ref>[http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=aug00_05 AJCongress on Statement by NAACP Chapter Director on Lieberman], American Jewish Congress (AJC), August 9, 2000.</ref>

===George W. Bush===
[[File:Jena 63.jpg|thumb|upright|Louisiana NAACP leads Jena March 6.]]
In 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] declined an invitation to speak to the NAACP's national convention.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04199/347713.stm |title=Editorial: No mutual respect: Mr. Bush unwisely forgoes NAACP meeting |date=July 17, 2004 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette }}</ref> Bush's spokesperson said that Bush had declined the invitation to speak to the NAACP because of harsh statements about him by its leaders.<ref name="allen">{{cite news |title=Bush Criticizes NAACP's Leadership |first=Mike |last=Allen |work=The Washington Post |page=A05 |date=July 10, 2004 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40255-2004Jul10.html }}</ref> In an interview, Bush said, "I would describe my relationship with the current leadership as basically nonexistent.

On July 20, 2006, Bush addressed the NAACP national convention. He made a bid for increasing support by African Americans for Republicans, in the midst of a midterm election. He referred to Republican Party support for civil rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fora.tv/fora/showthread.php?t=256 |title=President Bush addresses the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) national convention |format=video |date=July 20, 2006 |publisher=FORA.tv |access-date=November 30, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202174954/http://fora.tv/fora/showthread.php?t=256 |archive-date=February 2, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13949974 Bush invokes civil rights in NAACP speech], Associated Press (reprinted by NBC News), July 20, 2006.

===Tax exempt status===
In October 2004, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] informed the NAACP that it was investigating its tax-exempt status based on chairman [[Julian Bond]]'s speech at its 2004 Convention, in which he criticized President George W. Bush as well as other political figures.<ref name="janofsky">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |title=Citing July Speech, I.R.S.

===LGBT rights===
As the American LGBT rights movement gained steam after the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, the NAACP became increasingly affected by the movement to gain rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Bond, while chairman of the NAACP, became an outspoken supporter of the rights of gays and lesbians, and stated his support for [[same-sex marriage]]. He boycotted the 2006 funeral services for [[Coretta Scott King]], as he said the King children had chosen an anti-gay megachurch. This was in contradiction to their mother's longstanding support for the rights of gay and lesbian people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackvoices.com/black_news/canvas_directory_headlines_features/_a/bv-qanda-with-julian-bond/20060908115409990002 |title=BV Q&A With Julian Bond; Why This Civil Rights Icon Embraces Gay Rights |website=Blackvoices.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504063629/http://www.blackvoices.com/black_news/canvas_directory_headlines_features/_a/bv-qanda-with-julian-bond/20060908115409990002 |archivedate=May 4, 2010 |last=Bronner |first=Angela |date=September 25, 2006|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}</ref> In a 2005 speech in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia, Bond said:
:African Americans ... were the only Americans who were enslaved for two centuries, but we were far from the only Americans suffering discrimination then and now. ... Sexual disposition parallels race. I was born this way. I have no choice. I wouldn't change it if I could. Sexuality is unchangeable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washblade.com/2005/4-8/news/localnews/naacp.cfm |title=NAACP chair says 'gay rights are civil rights' |work=Washington Blade |date=April 8, 2004 |accessdate=September 24, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060321202124/http://www.washblade.com/2005/4-8/news/localnews/naacp.cfm |archivedate = March 21, 2006}}</ref>

In a 2007 speech on the Martin Luther King Day Celebration at [[Clayton State University]] in [[Morrow, Georgia|Morrow]], Georgia, Bond said, "If you don't like gay marriage, don't get gay married." His positions have pitted elements of the NAACP against religious groups in the Civil Rights Movement who oppose gay marriage, mostly within the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The NAACP became increasingly vocal in opposition against state-level constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage and related rights. State NAACP leaders such as [[William Barber II|William J. Barber, II]] of North Carolina participated actively against [[North Carolina Amendment 1]] in 2012, but it was passed by conservative voters.

On May 19, 2012, the NAACP's board of directors formally endorsed same-sex marriage as a civil right, voting 62–2 for the policy in a [[Miami]], Florida quarterly meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/n-a-a-c-p-endorses-same-sex-marriage/|title = N.A.A.C.P.

The NAACP's support for marriage equality is deeply rooted in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] of the United States Constitution and equal protection of all people." Possibly significant in the NAACP's vote was its concern with the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|HIV/AIDS crisis]] in the black community; while AIDS support organizations recommend that people live a monogamous lifestyle, the government did not recognize same-sex relationships as part of this.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-naacp-gay-marriage-20120519,0,2217856.story |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Dalina |last=Castellanos |title=NAACP endorses same-sex marriage, says it's a civil right |date=May 19, 2012}}</ref>

===Travel warning regarding Missouri===
On June 7, 2017, the NAACP issued a warning for African-American travelers to [[Missouri]]:

<blockquote>
Individuals traveling in the state are advised to travel with extreme CAUTION. Race, gender and color based crimes have a long history in Missouri. Missouri, home of [[Lloyd Gaines]], [[Dred Scot]]t and the dubious distinction of the [[Missouri Compromise]] and one of the last states to lose its slaveholding past, may not be safe. ... [Missouri Senate Bill] SB 43 legalizes individual discrimination and harassment in Missouri and would prevent individuals from protecting themselves from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in Missouri.

Moreover, over-zealous enforcement of routine traffic violations in Missouri against African Americans has resulted in an increasing trend that shows African Americans are 75% more likely to be stopped than Caucasians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monaacp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/170605-NAACP-MO-Travel-Advisory.pdf|title=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref></blockquote>

Missouri NAACP Conference president Rod Chapel, Jr., suggested that visitors to Missouri "should have [[Bail in the United States|bail]] money."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/02/us/naacp-missouri-travel-advisory-trnd/index.html|title=NAACP issues its first statewide travel advisory, for Missouri|author=Nancy Coleman|website=CNN|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>

==Local branch impact==
{{one reference|section|date=July 2020}}
{{expand section|date=July 2020}}
The organization's national initiatives, political lobbying, and publicity efforts were handled by the headquarters staff in New York and Washington DC.  Court strategies were developed by the legal team based for many years at [[Howard University]].<ref name="History and Geography" />

NAACP local branches have also been important. When, in its early years, the national office launched campaigns against ''The Birth of a Nation'', it was the local branches that carried out the boycotts.  When the organization fought to expose and outlaw lynching, the branches carried the campaign into hundreds of communities.  And while the Legal Defense Fund developed a federal court strategy of legal challenges to segregation, many branches fought discrimination using state laws and local political opportunities, sometimes winning important victories.<ref name="History and Geography" />

Those victories were mostly achieved in Northern and Western states before [[World War II]].  When the Southern civil rights movement gained momentum in the 1940s and 1950s, credit went both to the Legal Defense Fund attorneys and to the massive network of local branches that [[Ella Baker]] and other organizers had spread across the region.<ref name="History and Geography" />}

Local organizations built a culture of Black political activism.<ref name="History and Geography" />

===Youth===
Youth sections of the NAACP were established in 1936; there are now more than 600 groups with a total of more than 30,000 individuals in this category. The NAACP Youth & College Division is a branch of the NAACP in which youth are actively involved. The Youth Council is composed of hundreds of state, county, high school and college operations where youth (and college students) volunteer to share their opinions with their peers and address issues that are local and national. Sometimes volunteer work expands to a more international scale.

====Youth and College Division====
"The mission of the NAACP Youth & College Division shall be to inform youth of the problems affecting African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities; to advance the economic, education, social and political status of African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities and their harmonious cooperation with other peoples; to stimulate an appreciation of the African Diaspora and other African Americans' contribution to civilization; and to develop an intelligent, militant effective youth leadership."

====ACT-SO program====
Since 1978, the NAACP has sponsored the [[Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics]] (ACT-SO) program for high school youth around the United States. The program is designed to recognize and award African-American youth who demonstrate accomplishment in academics, technology, and the arts. Local chapters sponsor competitions in various categories for young people in grades 9–12. Winners of the local competitions are eligible to proceed to the national event at a convention held each summer at locations around the United States. Winners at the national competition receive national recognition, along with cash awards and various prizes.<ref name="actso1">{{cite web

===Environmental justice===
The [[environmental justice]] group at NAACP has 11 full-time staff members. In April 2019, the NAACP published a report outlining the tactics used by the fossil fuel industry. The report claims that "Fossil fuel companies target the NAACP for manipulation and co-optation."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://live-naacp-site.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fossil-Fueled-Foolery-An-Illustrated-Primer-on-the-Top-10-Manipulation-Tactics-of-the-Fossil-Fuel-Industry-FINAL-1.pdf|title=NAACP Fossil Fuels report|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The NAACP has been concerned about the influence of utilities which have contributed massive amounts of money to NAACP chapters in return for chapter support of non-environmentally friendly goals of utilities.
