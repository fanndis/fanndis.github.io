'''''The Jenny Jones Show''''' <!--do NOT change to was-->is<!--per [WP:MOSTV]] and [[MOS:TENSE]]--> an American syndicated daytime [[tabloid talk show]] that was hosted by comedian/actress/singer [[Jenny Jones (presenter)|Jenny Jones]]. It was produced by [[Quincy Jones|Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment]] and [[Telepictures|Telepictures Productions]] and was distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television|Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution]]. The show ran for 12 seasons,  from September 16, 1991 until May 21, 2003; and was taped in [[Chicago, Illinois]] at [[WMAQ-TV]] studios.

==Format==
When the series began, a traditional talk show format reminiscent of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' was used. However, ratings were low during the first two seasons, and by [[1993 in television|1993]] it began to move away from serious subjects and began to take on more unusual subjects and theme shows such as [[paternity test]]s, out-of-control teens (including shows in which they are sent to [[Boot camp (correctional)|boot camp]]), confronting former bullies (something Jones dealt with when she was young), [[makeover]]s for people who had individuality, [[celebrity impersonators]], talent contests (and at times, people who made it an obsession to enter them, especially parents of the children who enter the pageants/contests/shows), feuding [[Neighbourhood|neighbors]], [[strippers]] and secret crushes. The show would also feature regular live performances by bands of varying genres (notably [[pop music|pop]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip-hop]], and [[R&B]]), ranging from lesser known bands from the local Chicago area to more well known bands from around the USA and Canada.  Many well-known artists first appeared on Jenny Jones including [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Ludacris]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Nelly]], and [[Three Six Mafia]], who made their first national TV appearance on the show. The final live performance of alternative rock band [[Dinosaur Jr.]] before their initial 1997 disbandment was a performance of "Out There" on the show earlier that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watch Five Essential Dinosaur Jr. Clips|publisher= [[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2002-09-20|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/47822-watch-five-essential-dinosaur-jr-clips/|accessdate=2010-09-22|first=Evan|last=Minsker}}</ref>

===Comparisons and outrageous titles===
During its run, critics would equate this show to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'', which was also produced at [[WMAQ-TV]] studios, although Jones claimed that her talk show was not as outrageous as [[Jerry Springer|Springer]]'s. Critics also believe that some of Jones' ideas were copied from [[Ricki Lake]] after her show, ''[[Ricki Lake (talk show)|Ricki Lake]]'', debuted in 1993 and overtook her in the ratings. It was also rumored that, when [[Rosie O'Donnell]] started ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'', she and Jones had hostility toward each other despite the fact that both their shows were syndicated by Telepictures and both were friends with Lake (both even sent shout-outs to her show, albeit separately). Many of the themes also appear on ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'', such as [[DNA testing]] and [[Boot camp (correctional)|boot camp]], but the guests on ''Jenny Jones'' were less contentious than those on ''Maury''. Show titles were often sensational, and usually in rhyme. For example, the title "You May Shake It for Money, But Leave Those Sexy Clothes at the Club, Honey!" was used to describe a sexy makeover show for women whose occupations involve working in nightclubs or strip clubs. The rhyming titles feature began with the show's third season.

==Murder of Scott Amedure==
{{main|Murder of Scott Amedure}}
On March 6, 1995, ''Jenny Jones'' taped an episode called "Same Sex Secret Crushes" on which [[Scott Amedure]], a [[homosexuality|gay man]], confessed to an associate, Jonathan Schmitz, that he had a crush on him. Schmitz appeared unconcerned as he laughed about that revelation in front of the audience. However, three days after the taping, an upset Schmitz killed Amedure.<ref>{{cite news|title= Emotional Pornography on the Talk Shows |work= Baltimore Sun|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-03-16/news/1995075039_1_jonathan-schmitz-ricki-lake-lake-show|accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Tv fatal attraction 'jenny jones' guest kills admirer|publisher= [[New York Daily News]]|date=1995-03-11|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1995/03/11/1995-03-11_tv_fatal_attraction___jenny_.html|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= When a Talk Show's 'Surprise' Backfires|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-03-13|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-13/entertainment/ca-42261_1_daytime-talk-shows|accessdate=2010-12-07|first=Howard|last=Rosenberg}}</ref> After the murder made headlines, the producers decided not to air the show, though it aired during [[Court TV]]'s (now [[TruTv]]) coverage of the trial as part of the presentation of evidence to the jury. Clips of the episode were also featured in the [[HBO]] documentary ''Talked to Death'', and the first episode of the [[Netflix]] docuseries ''[[Trial by Media (TV series)|Trial By Media]]''. Schmitz's history of [[mental illness]] and alcohol/[[drug abuse]] came to light during the trial in which Schmitz was later [[convicted]] of [[second degree murder]]. Jones and the producers were later sued by Amedure's family for neglecting to find out Schmitz's history of mental illness and substance abuse. Jones testified under oath that the producers told Schmitz that his admirer could be a man, but Schmitz thought that the admirer was a woman. Amedure's family won the ruling and the show was ordered to pay $25 million, but that decision was later overturned by the Michigan [[appellate court]] which ruled that the producers were not responsible for what happened to the guests after their appearance on the show.  Schmitz was released on parole on August 21, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title= Jury Orders 'Jenny Jones' to Pay $25 Million|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1999-05-08|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/08/news/mn-35063|accessdate=2010-12-06|first1=Greg|last1=Braxton|first2=Brian|last2=Lowry}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The 'Jones' Verdict--As the Squirm Turns|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1999-05-12|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/12/entertainment/ca-36276|accessdate=2010-12-06|first=Howard|last=Rosenberg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIMMWUpoo0M |title=Jenny Jones Beats Death Suit |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>

===Backlash===
This incident (and other subjects) led to Dino Corbin, then-general manager of [[Chico, California]], [[CBS]] affiliate [[KHSL-TV]], to remove ''The Jenny Jones Show'' from its line-up. Corbin claimed that what he perceived to be constant objectionable material (one show involving a transgender dating search that KHSL refused to air) was his reason for the cancellation, not the murder.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJpKVbCcob4 60th Anniversary Show - KHSL CBS 12] Action News Now's YouTube channel, August 30, 2013</ref>

==Final years==
By what turned out to be the final two seasons, the show began to drop heavily in the ratings{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. Jenny's final farewell on this broadcast in 2003. It was nearly cancelled at the conclusion of season 11, but was saved by a last-minute deal with the [[Tribune Broadcasting]] station group, although the subsequent station shuffle necessitated in such key markets as [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]] didn't help the ratings erosion. In the [[2002 in television|2002]]-2003 TV season, Jones' program became the lowest-rated daytime talk show {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and after the last original episode aired that spring, ''Jenny Jones'' was canceled in the summer of [[2003 in television|2003]]. Reruns continued to air until September 12 of that year.

==Cast of characters==
The show also had an in-house cast of regulars, some of whom were originally guests before they became fan favorites:

* [[Rude Jude]], a DJ who became a fan favorite for his appearance on his past being a bully. He made frequent appearances as an advisor.
* Raymond Moses, a drill sergeant for troubled young children recognized for his intimidating presence and booming voice. According to his brother, Moses closed his boot camp business in 2013, ten years after the show ended.
* Tornado "Big Daddy WooWoo" (Comedian)
* Chela Thomas
