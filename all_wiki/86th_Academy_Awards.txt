As with last year's theme of music and the movies, Meron and Zadan centered the show around a theme. This year, they christened the show with a theme of saluting movie heroes commenting, "By celebrating the gamut of heroes who have enriched our movie-going experience, we hope to create an evening of fun and joy. And that includes the filmmakers and actors who take risks and stimulate us with provocative subjects and daring characters. They are all heroes in the cinematic landscape."<ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars to Celebrate Movie Heroes |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/oscarsr-celebrate-movie-heroes |access-date=April 2, 2014 |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=AMPAS |date=January 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015105225/http://www.oscars.org/news/oscarsr-celebrate-movie-heroes |archive-date=October 15, 2014}}</ref> To coincide with the theme, AMPAS presented an exhibition in the lobby of its Beverly Hills headquarters titled "The Oscars Celebrate Movie Heroes".

===Critical reviews===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' television critic [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] wrote, "Ms. DeGeneres brought predictable respectability to Sunday's 86th Academy Awards. Too bad this particular brand of predictable respectability was a bore." He also criticized the clip packages saluting movie heroes as "big a waste of time as Oscar montages almost always are."<ref>{{cite news|last=Owen |first=Rob |title=Tuned In: Oscars dull despite DeGeneres |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2014/03/03/Oscars-dull-despite-DeGeneres/stories/201403030111 |access-date=April 1, 2014 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |publisher=[[Crain Communications]] |date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303165252/http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2014/03/03/Oscars-dull-despite-DeGeneres/stories/201403030111 |archive-date=March 3, 2014}}</ref> Columnist [[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] commented, "It was a long, disjointed ceremony, and what was fun and likely to endure came entirely from the winners and their speeches."

In addition, he noted that the show was overstuffed with montages and stunts that dragged down the pacing of the telecast.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman |first=Tim |title=Oscars TV Review: Ellen Flops in Long, Boring, Self-Involved Show |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/oscars-tv-review-ellen-flops-685409 |access-date=April 1, 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Prometheus Global Medua |date=March 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323092131/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/oscars-tv-review-ellen-flops-685409 |archive-date=March 23, 2014}}</ref>
