'''Georgetown''' is a historic [[Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.|neighborhood]] and a commercial and entertainment district located in [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest]] [[Washington, D.C.]], situated along the [[Potomac River]]. Founded in 1751 in the [[Province of Maryland]], the port of Georgetown predated the establishment of the federal district and the City of Washington by 40 years. Georgetown remained a separate [[municipality]] until 1871 when the [[United States Congress]] created a new consolidated government for the whole District of Columbia. A separate act passed in 1895 specifically repealed Georgetown's remaining local ordinances and [[Georgetown street renaming|renamed Georgetown's streets]] to conform with those in the City of Washington.

The primary commercial corridors of Georgetown are the intersection of [[Wisconsin Avenue]] and [[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street]], which contain high-end shops, bars, restaurants, and the [[Georgetown Park]] enclosed shopping mall. The [[Washington Harbour]] waterfront restaurants are located at [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]], between 30th and 31st Streets.

Georgetown is home to the main campus of [[Georgetown University]] and numerous other landmarks, such as the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Bureau]] and the [[Old Stone House (Washington, D.C.)|Old Stone House]], the oldest house in Washington. The [[List of diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C.|embassies]] of [[Embassy of Cameroon, Washington, D.C.|Cameroon]], [[Embassy of France, Washington, D.C.|France]], [[Embassy of Iceland in Washington, D.C.|Iceland]], [[Embassy of Liechtenstein in Washington, D.C.|Liechtenstein]], [[Embassy of Mongolia, Washington, D.C.|Mongolia]], [[House of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Embassy of Thailand in Washington, D.C.|Thailand]], [[Embassy of Ukraine, Washington, D.C.|Ukraine]] and [[Embassy of Venezuela, Washington, D.C.|Venezuela]] are located in Georgetown.

===Early history===
[[File:The Old Stone House.jpg|thumb| right | The [[Old Stone House (Washington, D.C.)|Old Stone House]], built 1765, is the oldest house in Washington, D.C.]]

Situated on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]], Georgetown was the farthest point upstream that oceangoing boats could navigate the [[Potomac River]]. In 1632, English fur trader Henry Fleet documented an American Indian village of the [[Nacotchtank]] people called Tohoga on the site of present-day Georgetown and established trade there.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Walk Through Georgetown |author=Delany, Kevin |publisher=Kevin Delany Publications |year=1971}}</ref> The area was then part of the [[Province of Maryland]], an [[English overseas possessions|English colony]].

[[George Gordon (merchant)|George Gordon]] constructed a tobacco inspection house along the Potomac in approximately 1745. The site was already a tobacco trading post when the inspection house was built. Warehouses, wharves, and other buildings were then constructed around the inspection house, and it quickly became a small community. It did not take long before Georgetown grew into a thriving port, facilitating trade and shipments of goods from colonial Maryland.{{sfn|Lesko|1991|p=1}}

In 1751, the legislature of the Province of Maryland authorized the purchase of {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of land from Gordon and [[George Beall]] at the price of £280.{{sfn|Ecker|1933|pp=1-6}} A survey of the town was completed in February 1752.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Richard Plummer |title=The Chronicles of Georgetown, D.C., from 1751-1878 |publisher=R.

Another theory is that the town was named after its founders, George Gordon and George Beall.<ref>{{cite book |title=Establishment and Government of the District of Columbia |date=1 January 1901 |publisher=U.S. Senate reports of 1900, Congressional Edition, Volume 4043, US Gov't GPO |page=175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhlHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA183 |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> The Maryland Legislature formally issued a charter and incorporated the town in 1789.{{sfn|Lesko|1991|pp=1-2}} (Although Georgetown was never officially made a city, it was later referred to as the "City of Georgetown" in several 19th-century acts of Congress.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tindall |first=William |title=The Establishment and Government of the District of Columbia |publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1901 |pages=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhlHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA171}}</ref>) Robert Peter, an early area merchant in the tobacco trade, became Georgetown's first mayor in 1790.{{sfn|Ecker|1933|p=8}}

Col. John Beatty established the first church in Georgetown, a Lutheran church on High Street. [[Stephen Bloomer Balch]] established a Presbyterian Church in 1784. In 1795, the Trinity Catholic Church was built, along with a parish school-house. Construction of St. John's Episcopal Church began in 1797 but paused for financial reasons until 1803, and the church was finally consecrated in 1809. Banks in Georgetown included the [[Farmers and Mechanics Bank (Georgetown)|Farmers and Mechanics Bank]], which was established in 1814. Other banks included the Bank of Washington, Patriotic Bank, Bank of the Metropolis, and the Union and Central Banks of Georgetown.<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite news |title=An Old City's History: The Simple Annals of Our Venerable Suburb |work=The Washington Post |date=July 24, 1878}}</ref>

Newspapers in Georgetown included the ''Republican Weekly Ledger'', which was the first paper, started in 1790. ''The Sentinel'' was first published in 1796 by Green, English & Co.  Charles C. Fulton began publishing the ''Potomac Advocate'', which was started by Thomas Turner.  Other newspapers in Georgetown included the ''Georgetown Courier'' and the ''Federal Republican''.  William B. Magruder, the first postmaster, was appointed on February 16, 1790, and in 1795, a custom house was established on Water Street. General James M. Lingan served as the first collector of the port.<ref name="The Washington Post" />

In the 1790s, City Tavern, the Union Tavern, and the Columbian Inn opened and were popular throughout the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmes, Oliver W. |title=The City Tavern: A Century of Georgetown History, 1797-1898 |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |volume=50 |pages=1–35}}</ref> Of these taverns, only the City Tavern remains today, as a private social club (the [[City Tavern Club]]) located near the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street.

===Establishment of the federal capital===

[[George Washington]] frequented Georgetown, including [[Suter's Tavern]] where he worked out many deals to acquire land for the new Federal City.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmes, Oliver W. |title=Suter's Tavern: Birthplace of the Federal City |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |volume=73-74 |pages=1–34}}</ref> A key figure in the land deals was a local merchant named [[Benjamin Stoddert]], who arrived in Georgetown in 1783. He had previously served as Secretary to the Board of War under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. Stoddert partnered with General [[Uriah Forrest]] to become an original proprietor of the [[Potomac Company]].{{sfn|Ecker|1933|p=12}}

Stoddert and other Potomac landowners agreed to a land transfer deal to the federal government at a dinner at Forrest's home in Georgetown on March 28, 1791. Stoddert bought land within the boundaries of the federal district, some of it at the request of Washington for the government, and some on speculation. He also purchased stock in the federal government under Hamilton's assumption-of-debt plan. The speculative purchases were not, however, profitable and caused Stoddert much difficulty before his appointment as [[Secretary of the Navy]] by the second President, [[John Adams]]. Stoddert was rescued from his debts with the help of [[William Marbury]], later of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' fame, and also a Georgetown resident. He ultimately owned [[Halcyon House]] at the corner of 34th and Prospect Streets.{{sfn|Ecker|1933|p=12}} The [[Forrest-Marbury House]] on [[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street]] is currently the embassy of [[Ukraine]].

After the establishment of the federal capital, Georgetown became an independent municipal government within the District of Columbia, along with the City of Washington, the [[Alexandria, Virginia|City of Alexandria]], and the newly created [[Washington County, D.C.|County of Washington]] and [[Alexandria County, D.C.|County of Alexandria]] (now [[Arlington County, Virginia]]).

By the 1820s, the [[Potomac River]] had become silted up and was not navigable up to Georgetown.  Construction of the [[Chesapeake & Ohio Canal]] began in July 1828, to link Georgetown to [[Harper's Ferry]], Virginia ([[West Virginia]] after 1863). But the canal was soon in a race with the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]]  and got to Cumberland eight years after the railroad, a faster mode of transport, and at the cost of $77,041,586. It was never profitable. From its beginning to December 1876, the canal earned $35,659,055 in revenue, while expending $35,746,301.<ref name="The Washington Post"/>

The Canal nonetheless provided an economic boost for Georgetown. In the 1820s and 1830s, Georgetown was an important shipping center.  Tobacco and other goods were transferred between the canal and shipping on the Potomac River.  As well, salt was imported from [[Europe]], and sugar and molasses were imported from the [[West Indies]].<ref name="The Washington Post"/>  These shipping industries were later superseded by coal and flour industries, which flourished with the C & O Canal providing cheap power for [[flour mill|mills]] and other industry.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|p=49}} In 1862, the [[Washington and Georgetown Railroad|Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company]] began a [[horsecar]] line running along M Street in Georgetown and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, easing travel between the two cities.

[[File:Georgetown waterfront in 1865.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sailing ship|Sailing vessels]] docked at the Georgetown waterfront, c. 1865]]

The municipal governments of Georgetown and the City of Washington were formally revoked by Congress effective June 1, 1871, at which point its governmental powers were vested within the District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=463|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|website=memory.LOC.gov|access-date=December 30, 2017}}</ref>  The streets in Georgetown were [[Georgetown street renaming|renamed]] in 1895 to conform to the [[street name]]s in use in Washington.<ref>{{cite web |title=CHAP. 79.-An Act Changing the name of Georgetown, in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes |url=http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/sal/028_statutes_at_large.pdf |work=United States Statutes at Large from August 1893 to March 1895 |access-date=July 10, 2011 |page=679 }}</ref>

By the late 19th century, flour milling and other industries in Georgetown were declining, in part due to the fact that the canals and other waterways continually silted up.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|p=58}}  Nathaniel Michler and S.T. Abert led efforts to dredge the channels and remove rocks around the Georgetown harbor, though these were temporary solutions and [[United States Congress|Congress]] showed little interest in the issue.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|p=94}}  An 1890 flood and expansion of the railroads brought destitution to the C&O Canal, and  Georgetown's waterfront became more industrialized, with narrow alleys, warehouses, and apartment dwellings which lacked plumbing or electricity. Shipping trade vanished between the Civil War and World War I.<ref name="Smith, A. Robert and Sevareid, Eric 154, Library of Congress card number 65–24912">{{cite journal |author1=Smith, A. Robert  |author2=Sevareid, Eric |title=Washington: Magnificent Capital |journal=Doubleday & Company, New York, 1965 |pages=154, Library of Congress card number 65–24912}}</ref> As a result, many older homes were preserved relatively unchanged.

In 1915, the [[Buffalo Bridge]] (on Q Street) opened and connected this part of Georgetown with the rest of the city east of Rock Creek Park.  Soon thereafter, new construction of large apartment buildings began on the edge of Georgetown.  In the early 1920s, John Ihlder led efforts to take advantage of new [[zoning]] laws to get restrictions enacted on construction in Georgetown.{{sfn|Mitchell|1983|p=2}}  A 1933 study by Horace Peaslee and Allied Architects laid out ideas for how Georgetown could be preserved.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|p=199}}

The C & O Canal, then owned by the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]], formally ceased operations in March 1924.  After severe flooding in 1936, B & O Railroad sold the canal to the [[National Park Service]] in October 1938.<ref name="H-DC Discussion Network"/>  The waterfront area retained its industrial character in the first half of the 20th century. Georgetown was home to a lumber yard, a cement works, the Washington Flour mill, and a meat [[rendering (food processing)|rendering]] plant, with incinerator smokestacks and a power generating plant for the old [[Capital Traction]] streetcar system, located at the foot of Wisconsin Avenue, which closed in 1935, and was demolished in October 1968. In 1949, the city constructed the [[Whitehurst Freeway]], an elevated [[highway]] above K Street, to allow [[automobile|motorists]] entering the District over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] to bypass Georgetown entirely on their way downtown.

In 1950, Public Law 808 was passed, establishing the historic district of "Old Georgetown".{{sfn|Lesko|1991|p=95}}  The law required that the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] be consulted on any alteration, demolition, or building construction within the historic district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.gov/georgetown/pl808_81.html |title=Old Georgetown Act |publisher=National Commission of Fine Arts |access-date=December 9, 2008}}</ref>

===21st century===

Georgetown is home to many politicians and [[lobbyists]]. Georgetown's landmark waterfront district was further revitalized in 2003 and includes hotels such as a Ritz-Carlton and a Four Seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/bts/archives/adaptivereuse/04_ritz/overview.asp |title=The Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Residences, Georgetown |publisher=Architectural Record |access-date=July 24, 2010}}</ref> Georgetown's highly traveled commercial district is home to a variety of specialty retailers and fashionable boutiques.

== Geography ==
[[File:Washington Harbour view.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Washington Harbour]] complex located on the Potomac River. [[Healy Hall]] is visible in the background.]]
Georgetown is bounded by the [[Potomac River]] on the south, [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]] to the east, [[Burleith]], [[Glover Park]], and [[Observatory Circle (Washington, D.C.)|Observatory Circle]] to the north, with [[Georgetown University]] on the west end of the neighborhood.  Much of Georgetown is surrounded by parkland and green space that serve as buffers from development in adjacent neighborhoods, and provide recreation. [[Rock Creek Park]], the [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]], Montrose Park and Dumbarton Oaks are located along the north and east edge of Georgetown, east of Wisconsin Avenue.{{sfn|Mitchell|1983|pp=14-15}}  The neighborhood is situated on bluffs overlooking the Potomac River. As a result, there are some rather steep grades on streets running north–south. The famous "[[Exorcist steps|''Exorcist'' steps]]" connecting M Street to Prospect Street were necessitated by the hilly terrain of the neighborhood.

The primary commercial corridors of Georgetown are [[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street]] and [[Wisconsin Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Wisconsin Avenue]], whose high [[fashion]] stores draw large numbers of tourists as well as local shoppers year-round. There is also the [[Washington Harbour]] complex on [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]], on the waterfront, featuring outdoor bars and restaurants popular for viewing boat races. Between M and K Streets runs the historic [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]], today plied only by tour boats; adjacent trails are popular with joggers or strollers.

==African-American history==
[[File:Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|Shops along Wisconsin Avenue]]
Georgetown in the 1850s had a large [[African-American]] population, including both slaves and free blacks. Slave labor was widely used in construction of new buildings in Washington, in addition, to provide labor on tobacco plantations in Maryland and Virginia. Slave trading in Georgetown began in 1760 when John Beattie established his business on O Street and conducted business at other locations around Wisconsin Avenue. Other slave markets ("pens") were located in Georgetown, including one at McCandless' Tavern near M Street and Wisconsin Avenue.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|p=51}}  Slave trading continued until 1850, when it was banned in the District as one element of the [[Compromise of 1850#End of slave trade in District of Columbia|Compromise of 1850]].{{sfn|Lesko|1991|p=2}}   Congress [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|abolished ownership of slaves in the entire District]] on April 16, 1862, annually observed today as [[Emancipation Day]].<ref name="H-DC Discussion Network">{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~dclist/timeline1.html|title=H-DC - H-Net|website=H-Net.org|access-date=December 30, 2017}}</ref>  Many African Americans moved to Georgetown following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], establishing a thriving community.

In the late 18th century and 19th century, African Americans comprised a substantial portion of Georgetown's population.  The 1800 census reported the population in Georgetown at 5,120, which included 1,449 slaves and 227 free blacks.{{sfn|Lesko|1991|p=2}} A testament to the African-American history that remains today is the Mount Zion United Methodist Church, which is the oldest African-American congregation in Washington.  Prior to establishing the church, free blacks and slaves went to the Dumbarton Methodist Church where they were restricted to a hot, overcrowded balcony.  The church was originally located in a small brick meetinghouse on 27th Street, but it was destroyed by fire in the 1880s.  The church was rebuilt on the present site.{{sfn|Mitchell|1983|p=10}} [[Mount Zion Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Mount Zion Cemetery]] offered free burials for Washington's earlier African-American population.<ref name="Washington, DC-Mt.

== Transportation ==

{{see also|Georgetown street renaming}}

Georgetown's transportation importance was defined by its location just below the [[fall line]] of the [[Potomac River]].  The [[Potomac Aqueduct Bridge|Aqueduct Bridge]] (and later, the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Francis Scott Key Bridge]]) connected Georgetown with [[Virginia]].  Before the Aqueduct Bridge was built, a ferry service owned by John Mason connected Georgetown to Virginia.{{sfn|Ecker|1933|p=39}}  In 1788, a bridge was constructed over [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]] to connect Bridge Street ([[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street]]) with the Federal City.{{sfn|Ecker|1933|p=53}}

[[File:C&O Canal - Georgetown.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] passes through Georgetown.]]

Georgetown was located at the juncture of the [[Alexandria Canal (Virginia)|Alexandria Canal]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]].  The C&O Canal, begun in Georgetown in 1829, reached [[Cumberland, Maryland]] in 1851, and operated until 1924. [[Wisconsin Avenue]] is on the alignment of the tobacco [[hogshead]] rolling road from rural [[Maryland]], and the Federal Customs House was located on 31st Street (now utilized as the post office). The city's oldest bridge, the sandstone bridge which carries Wisconsin Avenue over the C&O Canal, and which dates to 1831, was reopened to traffic on May 16, 2007, after a $3.5 million restoration.  It is the only remaining bridge of five constructed in Georgetown by the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal Company.<ref>Weiss, Eric M., "Public Works - Oldest Bridge Reopens", ''[[Washington Post]]'', Thursday, May 17, 2007, page B-5.</ref>

Several streetcar lines and interurban railways interchanged passengers in Georgetown. The station was located in front of the stone wall on Canal Road (currently occupied by a gas station) adjacent to the [[Exorcist steps]], and the [[Georgetown Car Barn]], formerly operated by the [[Capital Traction Company]], at the end of the Key Bridge. Four suburban Virginia lines, connecting through [[Rosslyn, Virginia]], provided links from the D.C. streetcar network to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]], [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]], [[Great Falls, Virginia|Great Falls]], [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]], and [[Purcellville, Virginia|Purcellville]]. Streetcar operations in Washington, D.C. ended January 28, 1962. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] built an 11-mile branch line from [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], to Water Street in Georgetown in an abortive attempt to construct a southern connection to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. The line served as an industrial line, shipping coal to a [[General Services Administration]] power plant on K Street (now razed) until 1985. The abandoned right-of-way has since been converted into the [[Capital Crescent Trail]] – a rails-to-trails route<ref>{{Schwieterman-Leaves-Eastern|pages=117-118}}</ref> – and the power plant replaced by a condo.{{citation needed|date = November 2012}}

There is no [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station in Georgetown. Some residents opposed building one but no serious plans for a station existed in the first place, primarily due to the engineering issues presented by the extremely steep grade from the Potomac River (under which the subway tunnel would run) to the center of Georgetown, very close to the river. The planners expected the Metro to serve rush-hour commuters, and the neighborhood has few apartments, office buildings, or automobile parking areas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Schrag, Zachary |title=The Great Society Subway |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |pages=155–156 |isbn=9781421415772 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fnZAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA155}}</ref> Since the Metro's opening, there have been occasional discussions about adding another subway line and tunnel under the Potomac to service the area. Three stations are located roughly one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the center of Georgetown: [[Rosslyn (Washington Metro)|Rosslyn]] (across the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]]), [[Foggy Bottom-GWU (Washington Metro)|Foggy Bottom-GWU]], and [[Dupont Circle (Washington Metro)|Dupont Circle]].  Georgetown is served by the 30-series, D-Series, and G2 [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobuses]], as well as the [[DC Circulator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dccirculator.com/ride/rider-tools/schedule/|title=Schedule: Washington D.C.

==Notable residents==
Famous former residents include:
* Georgetown was home to [[Francis Scott Key]] who arrived as a young lawyer in 1808 and resided on M Street. Dr. William Beanes, a relative of Key, captured the rear guard of the British Army while it was burning Washington during the [[War of 1812]].  When the mass of the army retreated, they retrieved their imprisoned guard and took Dr. Beanes as a captive to their fleet near [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. Key went to the fleet to request the release of Beanes, was held until the [[Battle of Baltimore|bombardment of Fort McHenry]] was completed, and gained the inspiration for "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]".
* [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s earliest switching office for the [[Bell System]] was located on a site just below the C&O Canal, and it remains in use as a phone facility to this day. Bell originally moved to Georgetown due to the numerous legal hearings related to telephone patents, but then later created the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] and stayed on due to the many other scientific and technical organizations established in the region.<ref name="NPS" />
* [[John F. Kennedy]] lived in Georgetown in the 1950s as both a Congressman and a Senator. Parties hosted by his wife, [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie]], and many other Georgetown hostesses drew political elites away from downtown clubs and hotels or the upper [[16th Street Northwest (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street]] corridor. Kennedy went to his [[President of the United States|presidential]] inauguration from his townhouse at 3307 N Street in January 1961.
* [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Herman Wouk]] resided in Georgetown and attended the Georgetown [[synagogue]], [[Kesher Israel (Washington, D.C.)|Kesher Israel Congregation]], between 1964 and 1983 when he was researching and writing his two novels of [[World War II]], ''[[The Winds of War]]'' and ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=30 Years: Rabbi Philip Rabinowitz - a Commemoration and Remembrance |url=http://images.shulcloud.com/440/uploads/rabinowitz-program-v2.pdf |access-date=December 15, 2014}}</ref>
