'''Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley''' (sometimes spelled Keckly;<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 7. Mrs. Keckl(e)y's husband was a slave; we do not know whether he was literate or from what family he acquired his name. The spelling of his name remains in question.</ref> February 1818&nbsp;– May 1907)<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], pp. 29, 323.</ref> was a former [[slave]] who became a successful seamstress, civil activist, and author in [[Washington, DC.]] She was best known as the personal [[modiste]] and [[confidant]]e of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], the [[First Lady]].

As an enslaved woman, she was owned by her father, [[Armistead Burwell (planter)|Armistead Burwell]], and later his daughter who was her half-sister, [[Hugh A. Garland|Anne Burwell Garland]]. She became a nursemaid to an infant when she was four years old. She received brutal treatment—including being raped and whipped to the point of bleeding welts—from Burwell's family members and a family friend. When she became a seamstress, the Garland family found that it was financially advantageous to have her make clothes for others. The money that she made helped to support the Garland family of seventeen family members.

In November 1855, she purchased her and her son's freedom in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. Keckley moved to Washington, D.C. in 1860. She established a dressmaking business that grew to include a staff of 20 seamstresses. Her clients were the wives of elite politicians, including [[Varina Davis]], wife of [[Jefferson Davis]], and [[Mary Anna Custis Lee]], wife of [[Robert E. Lee]].

After the [[American Civil War]], Keckley wrote and published an autobiography, ''Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave and Four Years in the White House'' (1868). It was both a [[slave narrative]] and a portrait of the First Family, especially Mary Todd Lincoln, and it was considered controversial the information shared about the Lincolns' private lives.

{{Slavery}}

===Early life===
Elizabeth Keckley was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in February 1818, in [[Dinwiddie County Court House]], [[Dinwiddie, Virginia]], just south of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]]. An only child, her mother Agnes was a light-skinned [[house slave]], whose white ancestors were aristocrats.<ref>[[#Washington|Washington (2018)]], p. 205.</ref> Her mother, nicknamed "Aggy", had learned to read and write, even though it was illegal for enslaved people.<ref name="Fleischner p. 88">[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 88.</ref> She made clothes for 82 people, 12 members of the Burwell family and 70 slaves.<ref name="Christensen" /> Keckley learned that her father was [[Armistead Burwell (planter)|Armistead Burwell]] from her mother just before she died.<ref>[[#Washington|Washington (2018)]], pp. 205–206.</ref><ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], pp. 29, 88.</ref>{{efn|George Pleasant, who she thought for many years was her father, visited her mother two times a year, the most they were allowed to see each other, and visits stopped entirely when he was sold and taken out of the area.<ref name="Washington p. 208"/>}} The nature of the relationship between Agnes and Burwell is unknown. He permitted Agnes to marry George Pleasant Hobbs, a literate enslaved man who lived and worked at a neighbor's house during Keckley's early childhood. When Hobbs' owner moved far away, Hobbs was separated from Agnes. Although they were never reunited, Agnes and George corresponded for many years. As an adult, Elizabeth Keckley noted "the most precious mementos of my existence are the faded old letters that he wrote, full of love, and always hoping that the future would bring brighter days."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keckley|first1=Elizabeth|title=Behind the Scenes, or Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924032767489|date=1868|publisher=G. W. Carleton & Co.|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924032767489/page/25 25]}}</ref>

Keckley was owned by Burwell, who served as a colonel in the [[War of 1812]], and his wife Mary.<ref name="Fleischner p. 88" /> She lived in the Burwell house with her mother and began working when she was four years old. The Burwells had four children under the age of 10, and Keckley was assigned to be the [[nursemaid]] for their infant Elizabeth Margaret.<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 38.</ref> Keckley was harshly punished if she failed to care properly for the baby. One day she accidentally tipped the cradle over too far, causing the infant to roll onto the floor, and Mary Burwell beat her severely.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keckley|title=Behind the Scenes|url=https://archive.org/details/behindscenes00keck_0|date=1868|publisher= |location=|page=[https://archive.org/details/behindscenes00keck_0/page/20 20]}}</ref> As she grew up, Keckley helped her mother make clothes.<ref name="Christensen" />

===Teenage years===
[[File:Burwell School, Hillsborough, NC.jpg|thumb|[[Burwell School]], [[Hillsborough, North Carolina]]]]
At the age of 14, in 1832, Keckley was sent "on generous loan" to live with and serve the eldest Burwell son Robert in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], near Petersburg, when he married Margaret Anna Robertson. (He was Elizabeth's half-brother.)<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 66.</ref> She was their only servant.<ref name="Christensen" /> The new bride expressed contempt for Keckley, perhaps because her obvious white ancestry made the older woman uneasy; perhaps Keckley resembled Robert. Margaret made home life unpleasant for the young slave for the next four years. The family moved to [[Hillsborough, North Carolina]], where Robert was a minister and operated the [[Burwell School|Burwell School for girls]] from his house from 1837 to 1857. Keckley stated that Margaret seemed "desirous to wreak vengeance" upon her.<ref>[[#Andrews|Keckley & Andrews (2005)]], p. 13.</ref>

Margaret enlisted neighbor William J. Bingham to help subdue the slave girl's "stubborn pride". When Keckley was 18, Bingham called her to his quarters and ordered her to undress so that he could beat her. Keckley refused, saying she was fully grown, and "you shall not whip me unless you prove the stronger. Nobody has a right to whip me but my own master, and nobody shall do so if I can prevent it."<ref>[[#Andrews|Keckley & Andrews (2005)]], p. 14.</ref> Bingham bound her hands and beat her, then sent her back to her master with bleeding welts on her back. The next week, Bingham flogged her again until he was exhausted.  Again Elizabeth was sent back to her master with bleeding welts upon her back. A week later, Bingham flogged her again until he was exhausted, while she suppressed her tears and cries. The next week, after yet another attempt to "break her", Bingham had a change of heart, "burst[ing] into tears, and declar[ing] that it would be a sin" to beat her anymore.<ref>[[#Andrews|Keckley & Andrews (2005)]], p. 15.</ref> He asked for her forgiveness and said that he would not beat her again. Keckley claims that he kept his word.<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 81.</ref>

When she was 18 years of age, about 1836, Keckley was given to her owner's friend, Alexander M. Kirkland.<ref name="Washington p. 206" /> Also in Hillsborough, he was a prominent white man of the community. He forced a sexual relationship on Elizabeth for four years of what she called "suffering and deep mortification".<ref>[[#Andrews|Keckley & Andrews (2005)]], p. 16.</ref> In 1839, she bore Kirkland's son and named him George after her stepfather.<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 87.</ref><ref name="Washington p. 206" />

===Adulthood===
[[File:Portrait of Hugh Alfred Garland (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Hugh A. Garland|Hugh Alfred Garland]] (1805 – 1854)]]
She was returned to Virginia where she served Mary and Armistead Burwell's daughter, Ann Burwell Garland and her husband, [[Hugh A. Garland]]. (She was Ann's half-sister.)<ref name="Christensen" /> The Garlands moved several times and ended up in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1847. Aggy, Elizabeth, and George were brought with them<ref name="Washington p. 206"/> for their child care and sewing skills.<ref name="Fleischner p. 131" /> Keckley became an accomplished seamstress and, by working long hours, all of the money earned from her labor supported the seventeen-member Garland family,<ref name="Washington p. 206">[[#Washington|Washington (2018)]], p. 206.</ref> who suffered significant financial reverses by that time.<ref name="Christensen" /> Nearly 12 years of living and working in St. Louis gave Keckley the chance to mingle with its large free black population. She also established connections with women in the white community, which she later drew on as a free dressmaker.<ref name="Fleischner p. 131">[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 131.</ref>

===Road to freedom===
Keckley met her future husband James in St. Louis, but refused to marry him until she and her son were free, because she did not want to have another child born into slavery.<ref name="Lamphier" /> When she asked Hugh A. Garland to free them and he refused, she worked for two years to persuade him, agreeing to purchase her freedom. In 1852, he agreed to release them for $1,200 ({{Inflation|US|1200|1855|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 142.</ref> His wife, Anne, put the conditions in writing in 1855.<ref name="Washington p. 206" />{{efn|Keckley considered going to [[New York City|New York]] to try to "appeal to the benevolence of the people."<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 145.</ref> Elizabeth (Lizzie) Le Bourgeois, said, "It would be a shame to allow you to go North to beg for what we should give you."<ref>[[#Andrews|Keckley & Andrews (2005)]], p. 23.</ref>}} Elizabeth "Lizzie" Le Bourgeois, her patron, took up a collection among her friends to loan to Keckley, who was then able to buy her and her son's freedom and was [[manumitted]] on November 15, 1855.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1860, she enrolled her son, George Kirkland, in the newly established [[Wilberforce University]] in Ohio.<ref name="Christensen" /><ref name="DDN" /> That year, she moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where she stayed for six weeks.<ref name="Christensen" /><ref name="Washington p. 207" /> She intended to teach young "colored women" her method of cutting and fitting dresses, but found that she would not be able to earn a sufficient living for herself and her son.<ref name="King p. 71" /><ref>[[#Andrews|Keckley & Andrews (2005)]], p. 28.</ref>

===Seamstress in Washington===
[[File:Elizabeth Keckley VWM Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Elizabeth Keckley included in the [[Virginia Women's Monument]].]]
Keckley planned to work as a seamstress in Washington, but she could not afford the required license for a free black to remain in the city for more than 10<ref name="Humanities">{{Cite web |url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai/identity/text4/keckleydressmaking.pdf |title=Elizabeth Keckley, Behind the Scenes, or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House 1868 |website=National Humanities Center - The Making of an African American Identity |access-date=February 22, 2020}}</ref> or 30 days. One of her patrons, a woman by the name of Miss Ringold, petitioned  Mayor [[James G. Berret]] for a license for Keckley, which he granted to her free of charge.<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 183.</ref> Ringold, a member of General [[John Mason (planter)|John Mason]]'s family from Virginia, also vouched that Keckley was a free woman, another requirement for residence.<ref name="Washington p. 207" /><ref name="Humanities" />

Keckley steadily built a client base so that she had enough work to support herself. When she completed a silk dress for [[Mary Anna Custis Lee]], the wife of [[Robert E. Lee]], to wear to a dinner party for the [[Prince of Wales]], the future King [[Edward VII]], Lee was complimented roundly for her dress and Keckley's business grew rapidly.<ref name="Roberts" /><ref name="Humanities" /> She employed 20 seamstresses<ref name="Christensen" /> at her 12th Street business.<ref name="Lehrman" /> It generally took two to three weeks to make each dress. As she began hiring seamstresses to make dresses for her clients, Keckley focused her attention on fitting garments and the seamstresses made most of the garments.<ref name="Spivack" /> She had a talent for draping fabric and fitting garments. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] states: "She was known to be ''the'' dressmaker in D.C. because her garments had extraordinary fit."<ref name="Spivack" /> Her dresses were considered to be expensive, yet she sometimes made much more money from the commission for manufacture of the fabric than for the actual construction of the article of clothing.<ref name="Spivack" />

===Mary Todd Lincoln===
[[File:Elizabeth Keckley, 1861.png|thumb|left|Elizabeth Keckley, 1861, Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, [[Howard University]]]]
Keckley met Mary Todd Lincoln on March 4, 1861, the day of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s first [[inauguration]] and had an interview the following day.<ref name="Fleischner p. 202">[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 202.</ref> Lincoln chose her as her personal modiste<ref name="Christensen">{{Cite book |last1=Christensen |first1=Lawrence O. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gyxWHRLAWgC&pg=PA449 |title=Dictionary of Missouri Biography |last2=Foley |first2=William E. |last3=Kremer |first3=Gary |date=1999 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=978-0-8262-6016-1 |pages=449 |language=en}}</ref> and personal dresser,<ref name="Lamphier" /> which began when Lincoln was quite upset and overwhelmed about getting ready in time for an event at the White House.<ref name="Lehrman" />

There are few extant examples of Keckley's work, partly because people took material from existing dresses to create new ones, and also because there was no labeling or other means to definitively identify clothes as having been made by her. There is a purple velvet gown that Lincoln wore to Lincoln's second inauguration that is held in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]. The [[Chicago History Museum]] has a buffalo plaid green and white day dress with a cape. A black silk dress with a strawberry motif for strawberry parties may have been made by Keckley; It is located at the [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] in Illinois.<ref name="Spivack" />

In April 1862, the District of Columbia emancipated slaves. She was featured in a syndicated newspaper article about recently freed slaves who had made a success of their lives. As there was an influx of newly freed slaves in Washington, she established the [[#Ladies' Freedmen and Soldier's Relief Association|Ladies' Freedmen and Soldier's Relief Association]] to assist people until they were able to establish a life for themselves. The Lincolns assisted her and visited the [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] camps.<ref name="Gates" /> Keckley introduced [[Sojourner Truth]] to Abraham Lincoln. She was with the Lincolns when they visited [[Richmond, Virginia]] after the end of the Civil War.<ref name="Gates" />

Keckley accompanied Lincoln and her children to Illinois after the assassination.<ref name="Humanities" /> In late September 1867, Lincoln was deeply in debt and sought to sell her jewelry and clothing to raise money.<ref name="Emerson" /> Keckley assisted her in disposing of articles of value by accompanying her to New York to find a broker to handle the sales.<ref name="Gates" /> Although Lincoln used an alias, the fund raising effort became publicly known, and Lincoln was severely criticized for selling clothes and other items associated with her husband's presidency.<ref name="Emerson" /> In the end, the enterprise was a failure, they spent more money than they made.<ref name="Gates" />

Elizabeth Keckley donated her Lincoln memorabilia to [[Wilberforce University|Wilberforce College]] for its sale in fundraising to rebuild after a fire in 1865,<ref name="Keckley 2011 p. 162" /> which upset Lincoln.<ref name="Lehrman" />

===''Behind the Scenes''===
In 1868, Elizabeth Keckley published ''Behind the Scenes,'' which told her story of slavery and provided insight into the lives of the Lincolns.<ref name="Lamphier" /> Keckley described her own rise from slavery to life as a middle-class businesswoman who employed staff to help complete her projects. She placed herself in the educated, mixed-race middle class of the black community. She emphasized her ability to overcome difficulties and the development of her business sense. While acknowledging the brutalities under slavery and the sexual abuse that led to the birth of her son George, she spent little time on those events. Essentially she "veiled" her own past but, using alternating chapters, contrasted her life with that of Mary Todd Lincoln and "unveiled" the former First Lady, as she noted her debts.<ref name="Soriso"/> Keckley wrote about the Lincolns, in a style of near [[hagiography]] for the president, but with a cool, analytical eye for Mary Lincoln.<ref name="Fleischner p. 316" /> It was written at a time when the public did not have great insight into the lives of the Lincolns, and it particularly shed light on Mary Todd Lincoln. The book portrayed Lincoln as a "loving wife and mother and an ambitious, strong willed, and loyal first lady, while also revealing her to be high tempered, full of fear and anxiety, self-centered and often self-pitying".<ref name="Emerson" /> The editor, [[James Redpath]], included letters from Mary Lincoln to Keckley in the book, and the seamstress was strongly criticized for violating Lincoln's privacy.<ref name="Christensen" /><ref name="Soriso">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_1_34/ai_62258904/pg_4/?tag=content;col1 Carolyn Sorisio, "Unmasking the Genteel Performer: Elizabeth Keckley's Behind the Scenes and the Politics of Public Wrath - Critical Essay"], FindArticles / Reference / ''African American Review'' / Spring 2000. Retrieved July 2, 2012.</ref>

By writing the book, it was her intention to improve Lincoln's reputation and to explain what led to Lincoln's old clothes scandal of 1867.<ref name="Emerson">{{Cite book |last=Emerson |first=Jason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrObDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14 |title=Mary Lincoln for the Ages |date=2018-08-30 |publisher=SIU Press |isbn=978-0-8093-3675-3 |pages=14–15 |language=en}}</ref><ref>[[#Andrews|Keckley & Andrews (2005)]], p. 5.</ref> She also hoped that the income from the book would provide some financial support for Lincoln.<ref name="Lamphier" /> Advertisements labeled the book as a "literary thunderbolt" and the publisher, Carleton & Company, joined in by declaring it as a "great sensational disclosure".<ref name="Fleischner p. 316">[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 316.</ref>

At a time when the white middle class struggled over "genteel performance", Keckley unveiled and revealed a white woman by the very title of her book, showing what went on behind the public scenes and revealing "private, domestic information involving, primarily, white women."<ref name="Soriso"/>{{efn|The Lincolns had been subject to criticism as westerners early in his presidency, and Mary Todd Lincoln's anxiety about their position led to her trying to dress right and conduct the White House well. Critics such as Carolyn Sorisio have identified Keckley's unveiling of Lincoln as the reason that the book generated such a backlash. A reviewer from the ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer|Cleveland Daily Plain Dealer]]'' declared that they were pleased that Keckley's book was published, as it would serve as a warning "to those ladies whose husbands may be elevated to the position of the President of the United States not to put on airs and attempt to appear what their education, their habits of life and social position, and even personal appearance would not warrant."<ref name="Soriso"/>}} By writing about Lincoln, Keckley transgressed the law of tact as well as the accepted norms of white supremacy. Her relationship with Lincoln was ambiguous, as it drew both from her work as an employee and from the friendship they developed, which did not meet the rules of gentility and the social separation of races. People felt as if Keckley, an African American and former slave, had transgressed the boundaries that the middle class tried to maintain between public and private life.<ref name="Soriso"/>

Jennifer Fleischner writes of the reaction to Keckley's book,

{{quote|Lizzy's intentions, like the spelling of her name, would thereafter be lost in history. At the age of fifty, she had violated Victorian codes not only of friendship and privacy, but of race, gender, and class.<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 317.</ref>}}

There was an immediate reaction when the book was published. Keckley has been seen by historians to have lost her friendship with Lincoln<ref name="Christensen" /> while Keckley maintained that it did not ruin their friendship, that the women continued to correspond.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Emerson |first=Jason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrObDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 |title=Mary Lincoln for the Ages |date=2018-08-30 |publisher=SIU Press |isbn=978-0-8093-3675-3 |pages=55 |language=en}}</ref> She lost many dressmaking clients.

The writer Jennifer Fleischner has suggested that Lincoln's son [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert]], who was perpetually embarrassed by his mother's behavior in private life (and would have her committed to an asylum in 1875), did not want the public to know such intimate details as appeared in the memoir.<ref>[[#Fleischner|Fleischner (2003)]], p. 321.</ref>}}{{efn|Keckley's autobiography prompted controversy and questions about the veracity of her portrayals. In 1935, the journalist David Rankin Barbee wrote that Keckley had neither written her autobiography nor even existed as a person; he asserted the abolitionist writer [[Jane Swisshelm]] wrote the [[slave narrative]] to advance her abolitionist cause. Many people who read the article challenged his claim, citing personal and/or secondary acquaintance with Keckley. Barbee modified his statement, saying: "no such person as Elizabeth Keckley wrote the celebrated Lincoln book."<ref name="F_325"/>}} The book was published again in the early 1900s.<ref name="Humanities" /> First read for background information about the Lincolns, the book is now primarily appreciated for the narrative of Keckley's life as an enslaved girl and women.<ref name="Christensen" />

===Later years===
Keckley continued to attempt to earn a modest living until about 1890.<ref name="TSP" /> In 1892, she was offered a faculty position at [[Wilberforce University]] as head of the Department of Sewing and Domestic Science Arts and moved to Ohio.<ref name="DDN" /><ref name="TSP">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvvcK9NH0WIC&pg=RA1-PA150 |title=Broken Utterances: A Selected Anthology of 19th Century Black Women's Social Thought |publisher=Three Sistahs Press, LLC |isbn=978-0-9769365-1-0 |pages=150 |language=en}}</ref> The following year, held an exhibit at the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair|Chicago World's Fair]], representing Wilberforce.<ref name="TSP" /> Due to a mild stroke, she resigned in 1893.<ref name="Lamphier" /><ref name="Gates" />

==Ladies' Freedmen and Soldier's Relief Association==
[[File:Contraband Camp, formerly used as a Female Seminary.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|A [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] camp, formerly used as a female seminary, circa 1863]]
Keckley founded the Contraband Relief Association (association) in August 1862, receiving donations from both Lincolns, as well as other white patrons and well-to-do free blacks.<ref name="aal">{{cite book|editor1=[[Henry Louis Gates Jr|Gates, Henry Louis Jr.]]|editor2= [[Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham]] |title=African American Lives|location=New York|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2004|pages= 493–494}}</ref> The organization changed its name in July 1864 to the Ladies' Freedmen and Soldier's Relief Association, to "reflect its expanded mission" after blacks started serving in the [[United States Colored Troops]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Forbes, Ella |title=African American Women during the Civil War|location=New York|publisher= Garland Publishing Inc.|date= 1998|page= 68}}</ref> The organization provided food, shelter, clothing, and medical care to recently freed slaves, who were called [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] because they were not legally free people and considered seized property, or contrabands, of war.<ref name="Lamphier" />

Keckley wrote about the contrabands in Washington, D.C. in her autobiography. She said that ex-slaves were not going to find "flowery paths, days of perpetual sunshine, and bowers hanging with golden fruit" in Washington D.C., but that "the road was rugged and full of thorns."<ref name="K_112">[[#KeckleyOUP|Keckley (1989)]], p. 112.</ref> She saw that "[their] appeal for help too often was answered by cold neglect."<ref name="K_112"/> One summer evening, Keckley witnessed "a festival given for the benefit of the sick and wounded soldiers in the city," which whites organized.<ref name="K_113">[[#KeckleyOUP|Keckley (1989)]], p. 113.</ref> She thought the free blacks could do something similar to benefit the poor and suggested to her colored friends "a society of colored people be formed to labor for the benefit of the unfortunate [[freedmen]]."<ref name="K_113"/>

The association used the independent black churches for meetings and events, such as the Twelfth Baptist Church, Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church, Israel African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Siloam Presbyterian Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ripley, C. Peter |title=The Black Abolitionist Papers: The United States, 1859-1865|location=Chapel Hill|publisher= University of North Carolina Press|date= 1992|page= 251}}</ref>  The organization held fundraisers, with concerts, speeches, dramatic readings, and festivals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost |first1=Elizabeth  |last2=Cullen-DuPont |first2=Kathryn |title=Women's Suffrage in America: An Eyewitness History|location=New York|publisher= Facts on File|date= 2005|page= 147}}</ref> Keckley sought out prominent black figures to support the organization including [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Henry Highland Garnet]], [[J. Sella Martin]],<ref name="Gates" /> as well as prominent white figures such as [[Wendell Phillips]].

Its receipts were "$838.68 the first year and $1,228.43 the second year. 5,150 articles of clothing had been received during that time."<ref name="Eggleston">{{cite journal |first=G.

The association distributed clothes, food, and shelter among the freedmen and sent funds to many. Jean Fagan Yellin notes that the association sent $50 to the sick and wounded soldiers at [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref>Yellin, Jean Fagan (2004), ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life'', New York: Basic Civitas, p. 320.</ref> The association hosted Christmas dinners for sick and wounded soldiers.<ref>H.M.T., "Washington Correspondence," ''The Christian Recorder'' [Philadelphia], January 3, 1863.</ref> It distributed food to other organizations.<ref>"Letter From Washington," ''The Anglo African'' [New York], January 24, 1863.</ref> The organization helped to place African-American teachers in the newly built schools for blacks.<ref>"Letter From James Lynch," ''The Christian Recorder'' [Philadelphia], February 27, 1864.</ref>  The entire community had recognized, valued, and thanked "the officers and the members of the Association for their kindness and attentive duties to the sick and wounded;" but it was overlooked in later histories.<ref>{{cite news|author=Powell, Wm. P. Jr.|title=Association for The Relief of Colored Soldiers|work=The Anglo African|location=New York|date=August 6, 1864}}</ref>

The association became lost to history, but it set the standards and showed the need for relief organizations to provide aid to the poor and displaced black community. The work of the association within the black community helped create black autonomy. Through intra-ethnic networking, the association created an organization by and for African Americans.<ref name="aal"/>

==Personal life==
When she lived in St. Louis, Elizabeth became reacquainted with James Keckley, who she knew in Virginia. He portrayed himself as a free man. Elizabeth and James were allowed to marry by November 15, 1855 and were married for eight years. During that time, she learned that he was still a slave, was not a helpful partner, relied on her support, and was subject to abuses. She separated from him, and their marriage officially ended with his death, due to his excesses.<ref name="Lamphier" /><ref name="Washington 2018 pp. 206"/>
