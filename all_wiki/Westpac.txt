==History==
[[File:Westpac Sydney.jpg|thumb|[[Westpac Place]] in [[Sydney]], Westpac's global headquarters]]
Established in [[Sydney]] in 1817, the Bank of New South Wales (BNSW) was the first bank in Australia. [[Edward Smith Hall]] was its first cashier and secretary.<ref>{{cite web |author=M. J. B. Kenny |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010457b.htm |title=Biography - Edward Smith Hall - Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adb.online.anu.edu.au |accessdate=2012-12-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524165256/http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010457b.htm |archive-date=24 May 2011}}</ref> During the 19th and early 20th century, BNSW opened branches first throughout Australia and Oceania: at [[Moreton Bay]] (Brisbane) in 1850; in Victoria in 1851; in New Zealand in 1861; in South Australia in 1877; in Western Australia in 1883; in Fiji in 1901; in Papua New Guinea in 1910; and in Tasmania in 1910.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019|reason=numerous branch opening dates are mentioned without citation.}}

*1927: BNSW acquires the [[Western Australian Bank]].
*1931: BNSW acquires the [[Australian Bank of Commerce]]
*1968: BNSW joins the [[Databank Systems Limited]] consortium to provide joint data processing services.
*1970: BNSW is [[Listing (finance)|listed]] on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] on 18 July 1970.
*1973: BNSW becomes the corporate sponsor of the Rescue Helicopter service started by [[Surf Life Saving Australia]]. The service is known today as the [[Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service]].
*1974: The [[Bank of New Zealand]] (20%), BNSW (20%), [[Bank of Hawaii]] (20%), and the [[Politics of Tonga|Government of Tonga]] (40%) establish the Bank of Tonga as a joint venture.
*1975: BNSW incorporates its local business in [[Papua New Guinea]] as Bank of New South Wales (PNG).
*1977: BNSW forms the Pacific Commercial Bank in Samoa as a joint venture with Bank of Hawaii, buying into Pacific Savings and Loan Company, in which Bank of Hawaii had had an ownership interest since 1971.

===Westpac is formed===
*1982: BNSW merged with the Commercial Bank of Australia and changed their name to Westpac Banking Corporation, with the mission to become a significant [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] bank from which '''Westpac''' is derived. The brandname incorporated the "W" which had been the logo of the Bank of New South Wales (popularly known as "the Wales").
*1984: The original agreement between BNSW and the government in the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] expired and WBC and the government of [[Kiribati]] formed the Bank of Kiribati as a 51–49% joint venture. Bank of Kiribati also fulfilled the functions of a reserve or central bank.
*1985: WBC replaced [[Barclays Bank]] in the [[National Bank of Tuvalu]] (est. 1981) in [[Tuvalu]] (ex-Ellice Islands), taking 40% of the shares as well as a 10-year management contract.
*1988: the firm acquired the European Pacific Banking Corporation in the [[Cook Islands]] and a [[HSBC]] subsidiary, the Solomon Islands Banking Corporation, which HSBC had established as a branch in 1973. WBC also acquired HSBC's operations in [[Fiji]] and the [[New Hebrides]], and established a branch in [[Niue]] that is the only bank in that country. (HSBC had established its branch in Fiji only some 18 months earlier).
*1990: [[Bank of New Zealand]] sold half its shares in Bank of Tonga to WBC and half to [[Bank of Hawaii]], giving each of them 30%. WBC bought [[Banque Indosuez]]'s operations in New Caledonia and Tahiti. ([[Banque de l'Indochine]], which later merged into [[Banque Indosuez]], had established itself in [[New Caledonia]] in 1888 and in [[Papeete]], [[Tahiti]] in 1905. In both places l'Indochine functioned as the bank of issue until 1966–7.)
*1992: WBC recorded a 1.6 billion dollar loss, which at the time, was the largest loss for an Australian corporation. In the process the firm came close to insolvency, and slipped from being Australia's largest to third largest bank.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
*1995: WBC sold its shares in [[National Bank of Tuvalu]] to that country's government, which now wholly owns the bank.
*1995: WBC acquired Challenge Bank in Western Australia.
*1996: WBC Holdings NZ bought [[Trust Bank (New Zealand)|Trust Bank]], a chain of regional banks owned by [[Community Trusts]], for [[NZD]]1.2 billion to form NZ largest bank, [[WestpacTrust]]. The bank had promised to keep the funding to Community Trusts flowing and to keep "Trust" in its name. However, Community Trust funding slowed to a trickle, and in 2002 the bank launched a rebranding which included dropping the "Trust" from its name. The merger of WBC and Trustbank also saw the closure of many branches around New Zealand. In towns and cities where both WBC and Trustbank existed, the bank merged redundant branches into a single branch; also it closed many branches in rural areas and outer suburbs.
*1996: WBC sold Challenge Bank to the Bank of Melbourne.
*1997: it acquired [[Bank of Melbourne (1989)|Bank of Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], paying an estimated price in excess of A$1.4 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Luke|first=Susan Skiles|date=1997-07-28|title=Westpac Gets Regulator's OK To Acquire Bank of Melbourne|language=en-US|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB870038494939723000|access-date=2020-05-19|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> WBC retained the rights to the Bank of Melbourne name and logos, but in 2004 rebadged the branches as Westpac.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Westpac rebrands|url=https://www.afr.com/politics/westpac-rebrands-20040130-k2988|date=2004-01-30|website=Australian Financial Review|language=en|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref> In 2011, Westpac [[Bank of Melbourne (2011)|relaunched]] the brand.<ref>[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Article/Westpac-brings-bank-name-back-to-life-report-pd20110309-ESQGA?OpenDocument&src=hp10 Westpac revives Bank of Melbourne: report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102427/http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Article/Westpac-brings-bank-name-back-to-life-report-pd20110309-ESQGA?OpenDocument&src=hp10 |date=6 July 2011 }}, ''Business Spectator'' 10 March 2011.</ref>
*1998: it sold its operations in [[New Caledonia]] and [[Tahiti]] to [[Société Générale]], which merged them with [[Société Générale Calédonienne de Banque]] (est. 1971) and [[Banque de Polynésie]] (est. 1973), respectively.
*2001: The government of Kiribati sought to reduce Westpac's share in Bank of Kiribati from 51 to 49%, leading WBC to sell its shares back to the government. Bank of Hawaii sold its interest in Pacific Commercial Bank (42.7%) to Westpac, which held an equal portion. WBC offered Samoan investors, who held the remaining shares, the same price it had paid Bank of Hawaii. WBC now owns 93.5% of Westpac Bank Samoa and Samoan companies and individuals own 6.5%. In Tonga, Bank of Hawaii sold its shares in Bank of Tonga to Westpac, giving WBC 60% ownership of what is now Westpac Bank of Tonga.
*2002: WBC acquired [[BT Financial Group]] and Rothschild Australia Asset Management.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/westpac-bt-ipo-idUKSYD18664420071206|title=UPDATE 1-Westpac says BT Investment IPO raises A$247 mln|date=2007-12-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-13|language=en}}</ref>

On 22 July 2014, the firm announced that it would pilot a [[host card emulation]] (HCE) mobile payments technology to customers. It was the first bank in New Zealand to actively bring HCE mobile payments to market<ref>[http://www.westpac.co.nz/who-we-are/newsroom/media-releases-2014/22-july-2014/ "Westpac trialsTrials HCE Digital Wallet Technology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326223520/http://www.westpac.co.nz/who-we-are/newsroom/media-releases-2014/22-july-2014/ |date=26 March 2015 }}, 22 July 2014.</ref> and one of only a handful of banks globally to be using the innovative 'digital wallet' technology.

===US Federal Reserve borrowings===
In 2009, a Westpac-owned entity secured US$1.09 billion from the US [[Federal Reserve]]. Commentary suggests this was an unusual move for the bank, given its relatively minor position in North America. The borrowings by Westpac occurred at the height of the global financial crisis and was part of a Federal Reserve move to stabilise financial markets globally. The public and government attention of the borrowings followed the release of the information by the Federal Reserve in 2011, not Westpac.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seeker401.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/australian-banks-in-secret-u-s-fed-reserve-bail-out-we-didnt-get-told-that/ |title=Australian banks in secret U.S. Fed reserve bail-out..we didnt get told that!

===Funding of coal mining in New Zealand===
Westpac has come under criticism from climate-change organisations in New Zealand for its role in funding mining company Bathurst, which has gained resource consent to mine coal on the Denniston Plateau on the West Coast of the South Island. Opponents have claimed that the mine will release up to 218 million tonnes of carbon dioxide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://350.org.nz/westpac/|title=Westpac – Denniston Coal|website=350.org.nz|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140503040048/http://350.org.nz/westpac/|archive-date=3 May 2014}}</ref> which will worsen the effects of anthropogenic climate change, as well as significantly damage an important ecosystem.
Westpac have largely ignored these claims, despite over one hundred customers leaving the company because of this issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gofossilfree.org/nz/westpac-switch/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004224/http://gofossilfree.org/nz/westpac-switch/ |archive-date=2 May 2014}}</ref>

===Money Laundering and Child Exploitation Scandal===
In November 2019, it was revealed that Westpac was guilty of violating anti-money laundering, child exploitation and counter-terror finance laws.

==Corporate responsibility==
In 2002 Westpac released a social impact report that outlined the bank's plan to meet international standards in the area of [[corporate social responsibility]]. This led to Westpac's assessment as the global sustainability leader for the banking sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index from 2004 to 2007.<ref>{{Citation
