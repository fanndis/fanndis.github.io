The '''State Pension''' is part of the United Kingdom Government's [[Pensions in the United Kingdom|pension arrangements]].  Benefits vary depending on the age of the individual and their contribution record. Anyone can make a claim, provided they have a minimum number of qualifying years of contributions.

== Background ==
=== Basic State Pension ===
The '''basic State Pension''' (alongside the [[Pensions in the United Kingdom#Additional Pension|Graduated Retirement Benefit]], the [[State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme]], and the [[State Second Pension]]) is payable to men born before 6 April 1951, and to women born before 6 April 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/state-pension |title=basic State Pension |publisher=UK Government |access-date=2020-04-27 }}</ref> The maximum amount payable is £134.25 a week (6 April 2020 - 11 April 2021).

=== New State Pension ===
The '''new State Pension''' is payable to men born on or after 6 April 1951, and to women born on or after 6 April 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/what-youll-get |title=new State Pension |publisher=UK Government |access-date=2020-04-27 }}</ref> The maximum amount payable is £175.20 a week (6 April 2020 - 11 April 2021).

=== Contribution record ===

The State Pension is a 'contribution-based' benefit, and depends on an individual's [[National Insurance]] (NI) contribution history. To qualify for a full pension (amounts given above), an individual would require:
* '''basic State Pension''': 30 qualifying years (years in which NI contributions were paid) for customers claiming between 6 April 2010 and 5 April 2016;<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/eligibility |title=Eligibility |access-date=2018-11-14}}</ref><ref name="Pre-2010 Conditions"> 44 qualifying years (for men), or 39 years (for women) - prior to 6 April 2010  {{Cite web|url= https://cpag.org.uk/welfare-rights/resources/article/state-pension-reform-april-2010 |title= National Insurance Conditions |access-date=2020-08-20}}</ref>

* '''new State Pension''':&nbsp; 35 qualifying years (years in which NI contributions were paid) for customers claiming from 6 April 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/your-national-insurance-record-and-your-state-pension |title=Your National Insurance record and your State Pension |access-date=2018-11-14}}</ref>
In years where fewer than 52 weeks' NI were paid, the year is disregarded. With fewer qualifying years smaller, pro-rata, pension is paid. People who were contracted-out paid lower NI contributions will receive a lower state pension.  

=== {{anchor|uprating}}Pension uprating ===
{{see also|Frozen state pension}}
The Basic State Pension is increased in April each year to pensioners living in the UK and in certain overseas countries which have a Social Security Agreement with the UK that includes British pension uprating,<ref>[http://www.dwp.gov.uk/international/insurance-and-contributions/working-in-another-country/social-security-agreement/ Social Security Agreement Countries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911001309/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/international/insurance%2Dand%2Dcontributions/working%2Din%2Danother%2Dcountry/social%2Dsecurity%2Dagreement/ |date=2010-09-11 }}, dwp.gov.uk/</ref> in line with the [[CPI]]. All state pensions for these pensions are protected by the "triple lock" guarantee introduced by the coalition government, meaning that the pension rises each year by either the annual price inflation, or average earnings growth, or a guaranteed 2.5% minimum, whichever is the greatest. Coming into effect each April, the uprating is based on the previous September's CPI inflation, along with the three-month average of weekly earnings starting in July of that year.<ref>{{cite web|website=Which?|url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2018/10/state-pension-to-rise-by-up-to-222-a-year-in-2019/|title=State pension to rise by up to £221 a year in 2019|first=Reena |last=Sewraz|date=17 October 2018|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref>

Pensioners living in other countries without a current agreement (which includes most [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries) have their [[Frozen state pension|pensions frozen]] at the rate in effect on the date when they left the UK, or on the date when they applied for a pension, whichever is later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01457|title= Frozen overseas pensions|website=UK Parliament|others=House of Commons Library|date=11 April 2019|series=UK Parliament Briefing Paper}} − links to PDF of Briefing Paper Number CBP-01457, ''Frozen overseas pensions'' by Djuna Thurley and Rod McInnes</ref>

== State Pension age==
Before the [[Pensions Act 1995]], the state pension age had been 60 for women, and 65 for men. The Act changed this so that the women's pension age would be made equal with men, but that the transition should only be phased in from 2010 to 2020.<ref>[[Pensions Act 1995]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/26/part/II/enacted s 126] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/26/schedule/4/enacted Sch 4]</ref> In 2006, a cross party Parliamentary report again recommended equalisation of ages on the basis of equal treatment of both sexes. It also recommended a rise in the state pension age for both men and women to 68 between 2024 and 2046. The rationale for the age rise was that people would be living longer in the future.<ref>''Security in retirement: towards a new pension system'' (2006) [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/272299/6841.pdf Cm 6841], para 3.32</ref> This was put into effect by the [[Pensions Act 2007]].

However, when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal-Democrat]] coalition took power, the [[Pensions Act 2011]] accelerated the rise of the state pension age to 66 for both men and women by 6 October 2020.<ref>[[Pensions Act 2011]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/19/part/1 s 1]</ref> Under the [[Pensions Act 2014]], the coalition government again accelerated the rise in the state pension age to 67 by 6 April 2028.<ref>[[Pensions Act 2014]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/19/part/3 s 26]</ref>

In May 2019, a challenge in the High Court failed to reverse decisions to accelerate the equalisation of the pension ages on the ground that not enough notice was given.<ref>''[[R (Delve) v Secretary of State for Work And Pensions]]'' [2019] [https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2019/2552.html EWHC 2552]</ref> The Conservative Party in its 2019 Manifesto has said it will not change the rules, while the Labour Party had committed to compensating women who were unfairly affected by the changes in the pension age.<ref>'General election 2019: What is Labour offering to Waspi women?' (25 November 2019) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/50546923 BBC], "Labour's Angela Rayner told BBC News: "The government failed the women who were born in the 1950s. They stole their pension."... Conservative minister Nicky Morgan told the BBC "there isn't the money available" to compensate the Waspi women."</ref>

The current ages for the state pension in law are as follows:

===Deferral===
It is possible to defer claiming a State Pension at SPA.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/spd1.pdf |title=State Pension Deferral - Your Guide |access-date=2012-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403155423/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/spd1.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>

For individuals who reached SPA before 6 April 2016, deferred pensions are increased by 1% for every 5 weeks that the pension is not claimed (approximately 10.4% per year). Alternatively pensioners who have deferred their pension can claim a lump sum and an unenhanced pension. The lump sum is the amount of pension payments foregone plus interest at 2% per year over the [[Bank of England base rate]].

For individuals who reach SPA on or after 6 April 2016, deferred pensions are increased by 1% for every 9 weeks that the pension is not claimed (approximately 5.8% per year).

== Calculations ==
The basic State Pension is based on the [[National Insurance]] record of the individual. Each year that National Insurance was paid is called a qualifying year. For 2012–2013 to be a qualifying year you need to earn at least £5564 if you are an employee, or £5595 if you are self-employed, and have paid (or been credited with) National Insurance contributions based on these earnings.  

Men born after 5 April 1945 and women born after 5 April 1950 need 30 qualifying years for a full Basic State Pension, with a single qualifying year required to get any State Pension. Men born before 6 April 1945 needed 44 qualifying years for a full basic State Pension, and women born before 6 April 1950 needed 39 years; to get any State Pension, an individual needed 25 per cent of the qualifying years required for a full pension. 

Since April 6, 2016, 35 qualifying years are needed to receive the full new state pension. State Pension amounts can be reduced if the pensioner was in a contracted-out works pension scheme.

Individuals with less than a full record of qualifying years, may elect to pay ''voluntary National Insurance contributions'', in order to boost their record for pension purposes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/nic/ca5603.pdf |title=Application to pay voluntary National Insurance contributions |access-date=2011-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405010246/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/nic/ca5603.pdf |archive-date=2011-04-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>

People in certain circumstances, such as caring for a severely disabled person for more than 20 hours a week or claiming unemployment or sickness benefits, can claim National Insurance credits.<ref>Understanding the basic State Pension http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Pensionsandretirementplanning/StatePension/Basicstatepension/DG_10014671 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030110238/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Pensionsandretirementplanning/StatePension/Basicstatepension/DG_10014671 |date=2011-10-30 }}</ref>

The amount of the basic State Pension received is calculated by multiplying the full rate by the number of qualifying years and dividing by the number of years needed for the full rate.

NI contributions paid between April 1961 and April 1975 result in an entitlement to a small{{clarify|date=April 2020}} Graduated Retirement pension.

NI contributions paid between April 1978 and April 2002 result in an entitlement to an additional pension from the [[State Earnings Related Pension Scheme]], although this will be very small{{clarify|date=April 2020}} if the individual was "contracted out" of this arrangement. Since April 2002 NI contributions have earned an additional State Second Pension.

=== Married couples ===
A wife or husband can claim extra basic State Pension based on the National Insurance contributions paid by his or her husband or wife (this extra is called a ''Category B'' pension).

If a woman has a ''Category A'' basic State Pension of less than 60 per cent of the full basic State Pension, then when she reaches her State Pension Age, she will have her basic State Pension topped-up to 60 per cent of her husband's ''Category A'' basic State Pension, once her husband reaches pension age.

Men, born after 5 April 1945, are able to claim a ''Category B'' pension based on their wives' contribution record. Similarly, civil partners who reach State Pension Age on or after 6 April 2010 are able to claim a ''Category B'' pension on the same basis.

== Pension top-ups ==

Married women with young children and carers can claim credits of National Insurance contributions.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/Caringforsomeone/DG_10018691|title=Home Responsibilities Protection}}</ref>

Pensioners with low incomes can claim [[Pension Credit]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/pension-credit-toolkit/about-pension-credit/|title=About Pension Credit|publisher=Department of Work and Pensions|access-date=2011-04-25}}</ref>

An 'age addition' of 25p a week is paid to people over 80.

==Pensions Act 2007==
A new approach was introduced following the findings of the all-party [[Pension Commission]] in 2006 and the white paper ''Security in retirement: towards a new pension system''<ref>
{{citation|url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/white-paper-complete.pdf|title=Security in retirement: towards a new pension system|access-date=2011-04-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216214209/http://dwp.gov.uk/docs/white-paper-complete.pdf|archive-date=2010-12-16}}
</ref> published in May 2006. The key provisions were:<ref>

</ref>
#Reduction of the qualifying years for a full basic State Pension from 44 years for men and 39 years for women to 30 years for both.
#The basic State Pension's yearly increase is determined by a rule known as the “triple lock”, it being the greatest of:
##the growth in national average earnings;
##the growth in retail prices as measured by the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]];
##2.5 per cent.
#The contribution conditions for basic State Pension were changed so that it is easier for everyone to build up some entitlement.
#Replacing Home Responsibility Protection (HRP) with a new system of weekly credits for parents and carers.
#Raising the State Pension age for both women and men from 65 to 68 in three stages between 2024 and 2046.
#Introducing National Insurance credits for parents and carers so that they can build up some entitlement to the Additional State Pension.
#End of the option to contract out of the Additional State Pension through money-purchase private pensions.

Some modifications to this were made in the [[Pensions Act 2008]].

== Future flat-rate state pensions ==
The Government originally proposed that in April 2017 the Basic and Second State Pensions should both be replaced by a single, flat-rate pension. A [[green paper]] was issued in April 2011,<ref name="DWP 21">{{cite web |url=http://dwp.gov.uk/consultations/2011/state-pension-21st-century.shtml |title=A State Pension for the 21st Century |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408140810/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/consultations/2011/state-pension-21st-century.shtml |archive-date=2011-04-08 |website=dwp.gov.uk}}</ref> followed by a White Paper in January 2013.<ref name=singletier>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/single-tier-pension.pdf |title=The single-tier pension: a simple foundation for saving |access-date=2013-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123111924/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/single-tier-pension.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> The amount of an individual's flat-rate pension would depend on the number of qualifying years, with 35 qualifying years being needed for the maximum pension and pro-rata amounts for fewer qualifying years, subject to a minimum of about 8 years. Rights already earned to a Second State Pension would not be lost. In the 2013 budget it was announced that introduction of the single tier pension will be brought forward by one year to 6 April 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-state-pension-simpler-and-fairer/supporting-pages/introducing-a-simple-single-tier-state-pension |access-date=2013-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818084354/https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-state-pension-simpler-and-fairer/supporting-pages/introducing-a-simple-single-tier-state-pension |archive-date=2013-08-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The new "single-tier" State Pension would be worth £144 a week (in 2012-13 terms). Provided they have 35 qualifying years, individuals would actually receive £144 a week, ''plus'' a "protected amount" if they have already earned a second State pension greater than £37 a week (which is the difference between the current basic State Pension and the proposed flat-rate pension), and ''minus'' a "rebate-derived amount" if they have paid smaller National Insurance contributions because they were "contracted out" of the Second State Pension Scheme (or its predecessor, the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme).<ref name=singletier/>

The new, single-tier State Pension would eventually remove the need for Pension Credit. It is also proposed that various rules regarding marriage, divorce and bereavement would be phased out. This would mean that ''Category B'' pensions (see above) would be replaced by ''Category A'' pensions for everyone, although any rights to a ''Category B'' pension that existed at the implementation date would be preserved.<ref name="DWP 21" />

These changes are now law, they were enacted by the [[Pensions Act 2014]] which received [[royal assent]] on 14 May 2014 <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/pensions.html |access-date=2015-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328045915/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/pensions.html |archive-date=2015-03-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Chancellor [[Philip Hammond]]  hinted the State Pension would no longer be ring-fenced from spending cuts after 2020 – raising for the first time the prospect of pensioners' benefits being cut as part of the government's austerity measures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Benefits for the elderly had been exempt from reductions and the chancellor confirmed during the Autumn Statement 2016 that the state pension would continue to rise until at least 2020.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}
