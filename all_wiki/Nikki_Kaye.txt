'''Nicola Laura Kaye'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/5/c/4/49HansD_20081208_00000010-Members-Sworn.htm|title=New Zealand Hansard – Members Sworn &#91;Volume:651;Page:2&#93;|publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]]}}</ref> (born 11 February 1980) is a New Zealand politician who served as Deputy [[Leader of the New Zealand National Party]] and Deputy [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] from [[May 2020 New Zealand National Party leadership election|22 May 2020]] to [[July 2020 New Zealand National Party leadership election|14 July 2020]].

Kaye served as the member of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] for the {{NZ electorate link|Auckland Central}} electorate from 2008 until 2020. In January 2013, she was appointed to the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] by Prime Minister [[John Key]], giving her the portfolios of Food Safety, [[Minister of Civil Defence (New Zealand)|Civil Defence]], and [[Minister for Youth (New Zealand)|Youth Affairs]], and Associate Minister of Education and Immigration.

Kaye announced on 16 July 2020 she was leaving politics at the [[2020 New Zealand general election|forthcoming election]].

==Early life==
Kaye was born in [[Auckland]] and grew up in [[Epsom, New Zealand|Epsom]] and [[Kohimarama]].<ref name="BATTLE">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10507767&pnum=0 |title=Battle looming in Auckland Central |date=4 May 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> Kaye's parents separated when she was seven years old. Her family includes a brother and sister, "two half-brothers, four half-sisters, one stepbrother and two step-parents".

She was educated at Victoria Avenue Primary School, [[Remuera Intermediate School]], and [[Corran School]] (where she was [[Head girl and head boy|Head Prefect]]), before earning a [[Bachelor of Science|science degree]] in [[genetics]] from the [[University of Otago]], where she also began her [[Bachelor of Laws]], later completing it in [[Wellington]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Cronin |first=Aimie |date= 19 June 2017 |title=Class Captain: Nikki Kaye, New Zealand's youngest female Minister of Education |url= https://www.noted.co.nz/currently/currently-profiles/class-captain-nikki-kaye-new-zealands-youngest-female-minister-of-education |magazine=[[New Zealand Listener]] |location=Auckland |via=[[Noted]] |access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="BATTLE" /><ref name="BLUEGREEN" />

Kaye is an accomplished competitive athlete, having been the Auckland Women's 3,000&nbsp;m running champion in 1997, and has raced in numerous marathons and multi-sport events. In 2008 Kaye competed in the [[Coast to Coast (race)|Coast to Coast]] multi-sport event. In February 2013, Kaye completed the Coast to Coast race a second time, becoming the first [[Cabinet of New Zealand|New Zealand Cabinet]] Minister to do so.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1997, Kaye participated in a television documentary called ''Fish out of Water'', in which she and five other teenagers were marooned on Rakitu Island (off [[Great Barrier Island]]) and fended for themselves for eight days.<ref name="BATTLE"/> The documentary footage was located in March 2014 and was published on New Zealand on Air's on-line archive [[NZ On Screen]] as part of its "before they were famous" series.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/fish-out-of-water-1997 |title= Fish out of Water (1997) |publisher= [[NZ On Screen]] |accessdate= 18 March 2014}}</ref>

Kaye joined the National Party in 1998, becoming women's vice-chair of the southern region of the [[New Zealand Young Nationals]]. She is a former International Vice-Chairman of the [[International Young Democrat Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://iydu-network.org/new-zealand-election-report-a-victory-for-those-who-kept-the-faith/ |title= New Zealand Election Report – a victory for those who kept the faith |publisher= [[International Young Democrat Union]] |accessdate= 2 September 2017}}</ref>

Kaye began working for [[Bill English]] in the office of the [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] in 2002 as a [[Public policy|policy]] researcher. In 2003 she travelled to the [[United Kingdom]], where she worked as a policy officer and project manager at the [[London borough]]s of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] and [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], and then at [[Transport for London]], where she managed a disabled people transport program, before working as an [[Information technology|IT]] [[project manager]] at the [[Halifax Bank of Scotland]].<ref name="BATTLE"/>

In 2006, Kaye co-founded a website, networkme.com, and acts as Director of Communications for that company.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Kaye returned to New Zealand in late 2007 to contest the National Party candidacy for the [[Auckland Central (New Zealand electorate)|Auckland Central electorate]]. Standing against three other nominees, Kaye was considered{{by whom|date=May 2020}} an outsider in a close selection battle against sitting list MP [[Jackie Blue]] for the nomination.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Kaye worked full-time as the National Party candidate from the time of her selection. She campaigned on improving [[public transport]] infrastructure, improving marine protection around [[Great Barrier Island]], and taking a greater interest in small businesses in Auckland. During her campaign she knocked on 10,000 doors.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/714026|title= Nikki makes history in Auckland Central|publisher= Auckland City Harbour News|date= 11 November 2008|accessdate= 6 January 2011}}</ref>

At the [[2008 New Zealand general election|general election on 8 November 2008]], Kaye was elected as National's MP for Auckland Central, defeating incumbent [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] MP [[Judith Tizard]]. This was greeted{{by whom|date=May 2020}} as one of the most significant upsets of the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]], breaking a 90-year hold by [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] parties over the seat; Kaye became the first ever National MP for the electorate.{{citation needed|date= December 2014}}

===First term===
As an MP, Kaye has, amongst other things, supported applications for the [[New Zealand Cycle Trail]] fund for routes in urban [[Auckland]], on [[Waiheke Island]] and [[Great Barrier Island]] (the latter two islands being in her electorate as well).<ref name="NZ_Herald_10619464">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10619464 |title=Great Barrier wants cycleway link |author=Dearnaley, Mathew |date=11 January 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> In early 2010, she broke with the National Party's policy of encouraging mining in conservation land, including on Great Barrier – claiming long connections to the island, and fitting in with her known support for environmental causes. She had noted during her maiden speech in parliament that "Our environment is the greatest gift we have been given as a nation", and that economical considerations, especially of the short term, should not trump this.<ref name="BLUEGREEN">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10634569&pnum=0|title=Blue-green ambitions|date=27 March 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=4 April 2010|first=Audrey|last=Young}}</ref> Kaye is a supporter of reinstating [[Trams in New Zealand#Auckland|trams for Auckland]], and has called for a feasibility study into extending the new Wynyard Loop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/5231079/Auckland-Central-MP-calls-for-new-tram-line-routes|title=Auckland Central MP calls for new tram line routes|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>

She holds up former National MP [[Katherine Rich]] as one of her role models.<ref name="BATTLE"/> Kaye's own policies, placing her in the socially liberal wing of the National Party,<ref name="BLUEGREEN"/> have been criticised by some people in her own party, where some have called her a "high maintenance [[backbencher]]". Others have called her "obsessive", or, in a more positive vein, "driven".<ref name="BLUEGREEN"/> However, commentators have argued that her stance is unlikely to hurt her in her marginal electorate, which has traditionally voted Labour.<ref name="BLUEGREEN"/>

Kaye was elected the deputy chair of the Government Administration Select Committee in February 2011. In her first parliamentary term, she also sat on the Local Government and Environment Select Committee and the Auckland Governance Legislation Select Committee. Through her time in Parliament on these committees she has been heavily involved in the review of the Resource Management (Simplifying and Streamlining) Amendment Bill and legislation creating the [[Auckland Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkikaye.co.nz/profile/|title=Nikki Kaye – Profile|date=19 April 2011}}</ref>

In May 2011, Kaye appeared in an episode of the [[TVNZ]] series ''Make the Politician Work''. The episode featured Kaye working a shift on a rubbish collection route and highlighted her campaign for waste minimisation in Auckland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Make the Politician Work|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10507767|publisher=TVNZ|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=4 May 2008}}</ref>

At the {{NZ election link|2011}}, Kaye stood again in Auckland Central in a high-profile race to retain the seat. She was challenged for the seat by Labour list MP [[Jacinda Ardern]] and [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]] candidate [[Denise Roche]], and was placed at position 33 on the National Party list. She defeated Ardern, although her majority was halved to 717, her share of the vote increased to 45.39%, due to significant strategic voting by Green Party voters supporting Ardern for the electorate vote.<ref>{{cite web |title= Official Count Results – Auckland Central – 2011 General Election |publisher= Electoral Commission (New Zealand) |date= 10 December 2011 |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/electorate-1.html |accessdate= 28 November 2011}}</ref>

===Second term===
Following the 2011 election, Kaye was elected Chair of Parliament's Education and Science Select Committee. During this time, despite a minority of Government members on the Committee, she managed to progress a significant number of inquiries and pieces of legislation through the House process.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vance|first=Andrea|title=Kaye brings energy, humanity and commitment to Cabinet|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8226023/Kaye-brings-energy-humanity-and-commitment-to-Cabinet|accessdate=10 February 2013|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]]|date=26 January 2013}}</ref> At the end of 2012 the Education and Science Select Committee completed an inquiry into 21st Century Learning Environments and Digital Literacy, which Kaye championed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Kelsey|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/schools/8284248/Welcome-to-the-world-of-a-teacher-less-classroom|title=Welcome to the world of a teacher-less classroom|work=[[Sunday Star Times]]|date=10 February 2013}}</ref>

On 29 August 2012 Kaye delivered a speech at Parliament in favour of [[Louisa Wall]]'s [[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]], which she voted for through all stages. This was met with positive reception from members of the LGBT community.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Third term and promotion to Cabinet Minister ===
[[File:Nick Smith, Nikki Kaye, Jerry Mateparae, John Key, Michael Woodhouse.jpg|thumb|Kaye at her swearing-in as a Cabinet Minister, 2013]]
On 22 January 2013 Kaye was appointed by Prime Minister John Key to the [[Cabinet of New Zealand]]<ref>[https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2013-vr662 "Members of Executive Council Appointed"] (7 February 2013) 13 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 209 at 438.</ref> and was appointed as Minister for Food Safety, [[Minister of Civil Defence (New Zealand)|Minister of Civil Defence]] and [[Minister for Youth (New Zealand)|Minister of Youth Affairs]], along with being made the Associate Minister of Education and Associate Minister of Immigration.<ref>[https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2013-vr663 "Appointment of Ministers"] (7 February 2013) 13 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 209 at 238.</ref><ref name="cabinet">{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/Ministerial%20List%20for%20Announcement,%20January%202013.PDF|title=Ministerial List for Announcement on 22 January 2013|date=22 January 2013|publisher=[[Beehive (building)|Beehive]]}}</ref>

After the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]], Kaye was appointed Minister for ACC,<ref>[https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2014-vr6338 "Appointment of Ministers"] (16 October 2014) 127 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 3475 at 3552.</ref> while retaining her other portfolios, except Food Safety and Associate Immigration.<ref>[https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2014-vr6334 "Resignation of Ministers"] (16 October 2014) 127 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 3475 at 3551.</ref> In 2016 she took leave from Parliament and her ministerial duties while being treated for breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/breast-cancer-diagnosis-devastating-news-me-and-my-family-govt-minister-nikki-kaye |title=Breast cancer diagnosis 'devastating news for me and my family' – Govt Minister Nikki Kaye |work=1 News |publisher=TVNZ |date=5 September 2016 |accessdate=14 July 2020}}</ref> She returned to Parliament in early 2017 to resume full duties.<ref name="RETURN"/>

In the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 election]] Kaye retained the Auckland Central electorate in the 2017 election, but National became an opposition party.

=== National Party deputy leader ===
{{main|May 2020 New Zealand National Party leadership election}}
In May 2020, there was [[May 2020 New Zealand National Party leadership election|a challenge to the National Party leadership]], where [[Todd Muller]] sought to replace [[Simon Bridges]] as leader of the National Party. The media reported days ahead of the vote that Kaye was understood to be Muller's running mate and was seeking to become the party's deputy leader, but she refused confirm if she would stand, with news articles referring to her as the "presumed" candidate even hours before the vote.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Trevett|first1=Claire|last2=Walls|first2=Jason|date=20 May 2020|title=National leadership coup: Todd Muller confirms he'll challenge Simon Bridges on Friday|language=en-NZ|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12333461|url-status=live|access-date=20 May 2020|issn=1170-0777}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Nikki Kaye 'very busy' as she heads to Wellington with challenge vote looming|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300017534/nikki-kaye-very-busy-as-she-heads-to-wellington-with-challenge-vote-looming|last=Block|first=George|date=21 May 2020|website=Stuff|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Live: Todd Muller beats Simon Bridges in National Party leadership contest|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300017906/live-simon-bridges-and-todd-muller-in-national-party-leadership-contest|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=22 May 2020}}</ref> On 22 May 2020 the party parliamentary caucus elected both Muller as leader and Kaye as deputy leader.<ref>
