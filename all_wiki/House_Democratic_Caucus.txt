The forerunner of the House Democratic Caucus, the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]] caucus, was established on April 2, 1796, to stop a treaty with Great Britain which unfairly treated American sailors. For many years, through 1820, it nominated presidential candidates (before the era of national nominating conventions).

Since 2003, the House Democratic Leader has been Rep.
