==Music and technology==
With Elevation Partners "perhaps best known for its early investment in Facebook," McNamee said in 2013, for him, “music and technology have converged.” <blockquote>He became expert on Facebook by using it to promote ... [[Moonalice]], and now is focusing on video by live-streaming its concerts. He says musicians and top professionals share “the almost desperate need to dive deep.” This capacity to obsess seems to unite top performers in music and other fields.<ref>[[Joanne Lipman|Lipman, Joanne]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/is-music-the-key-to-success.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0 "Is Music the Key to Success?" (Opinion)], New York ''Times'', October 12, 2013, p. 2. Retrieved 2014-02-06.</ref></blockquote>

McNamee is the co-writer of the [[Moonalice]] song "It's 4:20 Somewhere".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moonalice|title=It's 4:20 Somewhere|url=http://www.moonalice.com/song/its-420-somewhere|publisher=Moonalice.com}}</ref> In August 2012 the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] announced that the digital logs for "It’s 4:20 Somewhere" had been acquired for its library and archives,  describing the [[Moonalice]] logs as helping to "...tell the story of music’s digital revolution; specifically the rise of direct-from-artist (DFA) distribution. [[Moonalice]] is the first band without a label to achieve one million downloads of a song from its own servers, direct-from-artist. “It’s 4:20 Somewhere” has been downloaded over 4.6 million times".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces Acquisition of Digital Logs of Moonalice's "It's 4:20 Somewhere" for Library and Archives|url=http://rockhall.com/pressroom/announcements/moonalice-library-archives/|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tuck School of Business|title=The Long, Strange—and Profoundly Prescient—Trip of Roger McNamee|url=https://rockhall.com/pressroom/announcements/moonalice-library-archives/|accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', McNamee has been instrumental in arranging at least two $500,000 donations to the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/technology/17wikipedia.html|title=Open-Source Troubles in Wiki World|first=Noam|last=Cohen|date=17 March 2008|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/18/jimmy_wales_and_roger_mcnamee/|title=Why would someone toss $1.35m at Wikipedia?|publisher=}}</ref> Roger McNamee is a member of the Wikipedia Foundation's advisory board, and acts "as a special advisor to the Executive Director on business and strategy issues."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Roger_McNamee_to_Become_Wikimedia_Advisor_January_2009|title=Press releases/Roger McNamee to Become Wikimedia Advisor January 2009 - Wikimedia Foundation|website=wikimediafoundation.org}}</ref>

==Influence==
[[Bill Gates]] wrote in his book ''[[The Road Ahead (Bill Gates book)|The Road Ahead]]'': "Roger was a great sounding board for many of the ideas I wrote about".<ref name="port"/>  [[Mark Zuckerberg]] (who met McNamee in summer 2006 at a time when [[Facebook]] reportedly had buyout offers of around $750 million) said McNamee was "emphatic" that Facebook not be sold; Zuckerberg stated he "clearly cared about building something long-term and about the impact of the things we build as opposed to just making money in the short term," advice that [[Portfolio.com]] called "prescient": in October 2007, Facebook sold just 1.6 percent of the company to Microsoft for $240 million.<ref name="port"/> McNamee himself confirmed that.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2018/how-to-fix-facebook-before-it-fixes-us/|title=How to Fix Facebook—Before It Fixes Us|last=Roger McNamee|first=Roger McNamee|date=January 2018|publisher=Washington Monthly|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref>

In the autumn of 2017 McNamee met with US legislators who were preparing to investigate [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian meddling]] in the [[2016 United States elections|2016 US elections]]. McNamee had prepared for them a curriculum, stating that the real problem was the divisions social media platforms were creating among Americans, of which [[Adam Schiff]], member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]] said, "Roger was really ahead of the curve. Time has borne out his warnings."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/02/big-techs-big-defector|title=Big Tech’s Big Defector|last=Barth|first=Brian|date=2019-11-25|access-date=2019-11-25|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>
