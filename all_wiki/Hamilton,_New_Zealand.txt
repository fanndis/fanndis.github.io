'''Hamilton''' ({{lang-mi|Kirikiriroa}}) is a city in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. It is the seat and most populous city of the [[Waikato|Waikato region]], with a territorial population of {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Hamilton|y}}}},<ref name="NZ_population_data_2018" /> the country's [[List of cities in New Zealand|fourth most-populous city]]. Encompassing a land area of about {{convert|110|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localcouncils.govt.nz/lgip.nsf/wpg_url/Profiles-Councils-Hamilton-City-Council-main|title= Hamilton City Council|access-date=9 December 2014|publisher=Internal Affairs}}</ref> on the banks of the [[Waikato River]], Hamilton is part of the wider [[Hamilton Urban Area]], which also encompasses the nearby towns of [[Ngāruawāhia]], [[Te Awamutu]] and [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]]. In 2020, Hamilton was awarded the title of most beautiful large city in New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-29|title=Hamilton and Whanganui tie for most beautiful city in New Zealand|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/123240109/hamilton-and-whanganui-tie-for-most-beautiful-city-in-new-zealand|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref>

The area now covered by the city was originally the site of several [[Māori people|Māori]] villages, including Kirikiriroa, from which the city takes its Māori name. By the time English settlers arrived, most of these villages, which sat beside the Waikato River, were abandoned as a result of the [[Invasion of Waikato]] and [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] (''Raupatu'') by the Crown.

Initially an agricultural service centre, Hamilton now has a diverse economy and is the third fastest growing urban area in New Zealand, behind [[Pukekohe]] and [[Auckland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/estimates_and_projections/SubnationalPopulationEstimates_HOTP30Jun10/Commentary.aspx|title=Subnational Population Estimates|access-date=23 January 2011}}</ref> [[Hamilton Gardens]] is the region's most popular tourist attraction. Education and [[research and development]] play an important part in Hamilton's economy, as the city is home to approximately 40,000 tertiary students and 1,000 PhD-qualified scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opportunityhamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145844805/Hamilton_Facts|title=Hamilton's Economy|access-date=23 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724193817/http://www.opportunityhamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145844805/Hamilton_Facts|archive-date=24 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The area now covered by the city was originally the site of several Māori villages (kāinga), including Pukete, Miropiko and Kirikiriroa ("long stretch of gravel'), from which the city takes its Māori name. Local Māori were the target of raids by [[Ngāpuhi]] during the [[Musket Wars]],<ref name=Crosby>Crosby, Ron, The Musket Wars – A History of Inter-Iwi Conflict 1806–45, Reed, Auckland, 1999.</ref> and several [[Pā (Māori)|pā]] sites from this period can still be found beside the Waikato River.

==Hamilton today==
[[File:Corner of Hood Street, Hamilton New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Corner of Hood Street.]]
[[File:HoodStHamilton.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hood Street in Hamilton Central.]]

Hamilton Central, on the Waikato River, is a bustling retail precinct. The entertainment area is quite vibrant due to the large student population. The 2008 [[Lonely Planet]] guide states that "the city's main street has sprouted a sophisticated and vibrant stretch of bars and eateries that on the weekend at least leave Auckland's [[Viaduct Harbour]] for dead in the boozy fun stakes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/new-zealand/waikato-and-the-king-country/hamilton|title=Hamilton Travel Information and Travel Guide|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref> Many of the city's venues and attractions are located on the old [[Hamilton Town Belt|Town Belt]], including [[Hamilton Gardens]], [[Waikato Stadium]], [[Seddon Park]],and the [[Lake Rotoroa (Hamilton, New Zealand)|Hamilton Lake Domain]].

As of 2016, the city continues to grow rapidly. Development is focused on the northern end of the city although in 2012 the council made a decision to balance the city's growth by approving an urban development to the south. Traffic congestion is increasing due to population growth, though the council has undertaken many road development projects to try to keep up with the rapid growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145827444|title=Access Hamilton|work=Hamilton City Council|access-date=27 August 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923132433/http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145827444|archive-date=23 September 2010}}</ref> [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] runs through the western and southern suburbs and has a major junction with [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] south of the city centre, which contributes to congestion.

[[File:Waikato_River_in_Hamilton_Central_from_Parana_Park.jpg|thumb|Waikato River in Hamilton Central from Parana Park]]

Hamilton's geography is largely the result of successive volcanic ash falls, plus debris, which swept down the Waikato River in at least two massive floods, created by ash blocking the outlet of [[Lake Taupo]]. In its present form the landscape originated around 20,000 years ago (20 ka), after the [[Oruanui eruption]] at [[Taupo Volcanic Zone|Taupo]]. The dates given for the eruption vary. A 2007 study said it was between 22.5 and 14 ka.<ref name=":82">{{Cite web|title=Waikato River Bank Erosion|url=https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/assets/PageFiles/11266/Waikato%20River%20erosion%20study.pdf|date=17 April 2007|website=Waikato Regional Council}}</ref> Another in 2004 put it 26.5 ka. After the eruption [[Lake Taupo]] rose to about {{Convert|145|m||abbr=on}} above the present lake. Around 20 ka. the ash dam eroded and the lake rapidly fell some {{Convert|75|m||abbr=on}}, creating massive floods. The ash they carried formed the main Hinuera Surface into an [[alluvial fan]] of volcanic ash, which extends north of Hamilton and drops about {{Convert|60|m||abbr=on}} from [[Lake Karapiro|Karapiro]]. The Waikato changed its course from flowing into the sea at [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]] at about that time, possibly just because sediment built up. The [[Lake#Peat lakes|peat lakes]] and bogs also formed about that time; [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] gives maximum ages of 22.5 to 17 ka. Due to an [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age|ice age]], vegetation was slow to restabilise the ash, so [[dune]]s formed up to {{Convert|25|m||abbr=on}} above the local Hinuera surface. The current Waikato valley had cut into the debris by about 12 ka. and was further modified by the 181 AD [[Hatepe eruption]], when again Lake Taupo level fell {{Convert|34|m||abbr=on}}, generating a {{Convert|20|km3||abbr=on}} flood, equivalent to 5 years' normal flow in just a few weeks.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption, New Zealand: a review of the roles of volcanism and climate in the post-eruptive sedimentary response|last=Vern Manville & Colin J.

With the exceptions of the many low hills such as those around the [[University of Waikato]], Hamilton Lake, Beerescourt, Sylvester Road, Pukete and to the west of the city, and an extensive network of gullies, the terrain of the city is relatively flat. In some areas such as Te Rapa, one old path of an ancient river can be traced. The relatively soft and unconsolidated soil material is still being actively eroded by rain and runoff.[[File:HamiltonCBDfromRototuna.JPG|thumb|[[Hamilton Central]], from [[Somerset Heights]]]]

In its natural state, Hamilton and environs was very swampy in winter with 30 small lakes connected to surrounding peatlands. Hamilton was surrounded by 7 large peat bogs such as Komakorau to the North and Rukuhia and [[Moanatuatua Scientific Reserve|Moanatuatua]] to the South, as well as many smaller ones all of which have now been drained with only small remnants remaining.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ausseil|first1=A.-G.

Up until the 1880s it was possible to row and drag a dinghy from the city to many outlying farms to the North East. This swampy, damp environment was at the time thought to be an ideal breeding ground for the TB bacillus, which was a major health hazard in the pioneering days. The first Hamilton hospital was constructed on a hill to avoid this problem. One of the reasons why population growth was so slow in Hamilton until the 1920s was the great difficulty in bridging the many arms of the deep swampy gullies that cross the city. Hamilton has 6 major dendritic gully complexes with the 15&nbsp;km long, 12 branch, Kirikiriroa system being in the north of the city and the southern Mystery creek-Kaipaki gully complex being the largest.<ref>The Wandering River. p45.p50</ref> Others are Mangakotukutuku, Mangaonua and Waitawhiriwhiri.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Central Waikato Zone Plan|url=https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/assets/WRC/Council/Policy-and-Plans/hazard-catchment-management/zone-management-plans/Central-Waikato-Zone-Plan.pdf|date=2017|website=Waikato Regional Council}}</ref>

In the 1930s, Garden Place Hill, one of the many small hills sometimes referred to as the Hamilton Hills, was removed by unemployed workers working with picks and shovels and model T Ford trucks. The Western remains of the hill are retained by a large concrete wall. The original hill ran from the present [[Waikato Institute of Technology|Wintec]] site eastwards to the old post office (now casino). The earth was taken 4&nbsp;km north to partly fill the Maeroa gully adjacent to the Central Baptist Church on Ulster Street, the main road heading north.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19301103.2.122|title=COLLAPSE OF BRIDGE.

[[Lake Rotoroa (Hamilton, New Zealand)|Lake Rotoroa]] (Hamilton Lake) began forming about 20,000 years ago. Originally it was part of an ancient river system that was cut off by deposition material and became two small lakes divided by a narrow peninsula. With higher rainfall and drainage from the extensive peat land to the west, the water level rose so the narrow peninsula was drowned so forming one larger lake. To the north the lake is 8&nbsp;m deep and in the southern (hospital) end 6&nbsp;m deep. The old dividing peninsula, the start of which is still visible above water on the eastern side, is only 2&nbsp;m below the surface.

==Climate==
Hamilton's climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (Köppen: Cfb ), with highly moderated temperatures due to New Zealand's location surrounded by ocean. As the largest inland city in the country, winters are cool and mornings can feature the coldest temperatures of the North Island's main centres, dropping as low as −3&nbsp;°C (27&nbsp;°F) several times per year. Nighttime temperatures are even cooler outside of the city. Likewise, summers can be some of the warmest in the country with temperatures rising over 28&nbsp;°C (82&nbsp;°F), on an annual basis. Hamilton also features very high humidity (similar to tropical climates such as [[Singapore]]) which can make temperatures feel much warmer or colder than they are.
Ground frosts are common and snow is possible but rare. The only recorded snowfall in modern times was light snowflakes in mid-August 2011 during a prolonged cold period that saw snowfall as far north as [[Dargaville]].

Hamilton receives considerable precipitation amounting to around 1,100mm over 125 days per year. This coupled with annual sunshine hours of around 2,000 makes Hamilton and the surrounding [[Waikato]] an extremely fertile region.

Typically summers are dry and winters wet. Fog is common during winter mornings, especially close to the [[Waikato River]] which runs through the city centre. Hamilton is one of the foggiest cities on earth, however, fog usually burns off by noon to produce sunny and calm winter days.<ref>https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/foggiest-places-on-earth.html</ref>
Hamilton also has the lowest average wind speed of New Zealand's main centres as a result of its inland location, in a depression surrounded by high hills and mountains.<ref>http://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/default/files/import/attachments/summary.xls</ref>

[[File:WaikatoUni.jpg|thumb|[[University of Waikato]] campus]]
Education and research are important to the city—Hamilton is home to two institutes of higher education, the [[University of Waikato]] and the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] (Wintec). Research at the Ruakura research centres have been responsible for much of New Zealand's innovation in agriculture. Hamilton's main revenue source is the dairy industry, due to its location in the centre of New Zealand's largest dairying area.

Hamilton annually hosts the National Agricultural [[Fieldays]] at Mystery Creek, the southern hemisphere's biggest agricultural trade exhibition. Mystery Creek is the country's largest event centre and hosts other events of national importance, such as [[Parachute music festival|Parachute Christian Music Festival]], the National Car Show and the National Boat Show.

It has developed the large retail centre The Base in the old Te Rapa airforce base site which was returned to Tainui, following [[New Zealand land-confiscations|confiscation]] in the 1860s, as part of a 1995 Treaty of Waitangi settlement. In mid-2010, The Base was further expanded with Te Awa Mall complex stage 1.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Many large retailers such as Farmers and other nationwide speciality chains have located at Te Awa.

[[St. Peter's Cathedral, Hamilton|St Peter's Cathedral]], built in 1916, is the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral in Hamilton, on Cathedral Hill at the southern end of Victoria Street. There is also St Mary's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] cathedral on the opposite side of the river.

The [[Hamilton New Zealand Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is located in [[Temple View]], Hamilton. It was opened along with the [[Church College of New Zealand]], a large high school owned by the church, in the late 1950s. Both the college and the temple were built by labour missionaries. The school was closed in December 2009. Every year, the temple hosts a large Christmas lighting show which attracts large crowds from all over the country.

===Air===
[[Hamilton Airport (New Zealand)|Hamilton Airport]] serves as a domestic airport. It is jointly owned by Hamilton City and neighbouring district councils. The airport is located just outside Hamilton's boundary, within the [[Waipa District]]. There are direct flights with Air New Zealand to Christchurch, Palmerston North and Wellington, and with Sun Air to New Plymouth, Gisborne and Tauranga also there are charter flights to other destinations throughout the North Island. The airport also served as a major base for now defunct low-cost airlines [[Freedom Air]] and [[Kiwi Travel International Airlines|Kiwi Air]]. [[Virgin Australia]] offered three international flights a week, to and from [[Brisbane Airport]] and [[Sydney Airport]]. However, all international flights have now been discontinued, primarily due to a small market.

The airport is the base for pilot training schools and the aircraft manufacturer, Pacific Aerospace, is located at the northern end of the runway.

===Road===
New Zealand's main road artery [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] runs through several of Hamilton's suburbs and connects with [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] at a major intersection within the city boundaries. The Hamilton section of the [[Waikato Expressway]], due for completion in 2020, or possibly 2021,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hamilton section project update|url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/projects/hamilton/docs/hamilton-section-project-update-feb-2020.pdf|date=February 2020|website=NZTA}}</ref> will shift SH 1 to the east of Hamilton City, effectively bypassing the city and easing congestion between commuting city traffic and through traffic.

Safer Speed Areas 40&nbsp;km/h limits were first introduced in Hamilton in 2011 and by 2014 there were 36 of them,<ref>[http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-council/news/Pages/default.aspx?newsItem=2655 26 Feb 2014 HCC media release – Further 40km/h speed limits for Hamilton]</ref> many in suburbs near the river.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://www.saferspeedarea.org.nz/where/|title=Where – Safer Speed Area|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317015134/http://www.saferspeedarea.org.nz/where/|archive-date=17 March 2016|access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>

From 1864 Hamilton was on the [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]], linking Auckland to Te Awamutu.

==== Ring Road ====
As well as being bypassed by the Expressway, Hamilton will also have the Ring Road and, prior to those, the city centre was bypassed by Anglesea Street in 1964<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heritage.hamiltonlibraries.co.nz/objects/829/selkirk-street-now-anglesea-street|title=Selkirk Street (now Anglesea Street)|website=Hamilton Libraries Heritage Collection Online|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> and the main road diverted from the north end of Victoria Street<ref>{{Cite web|title=Camera Obscura - Waikato Times|url=https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/waikato-times/20170210/281741269164249%201/1|last=SWAINSON|first=RICHARD|date=10 Feb 2017|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2020-05-16}}</ref> onto Ulster Street, which was extended to absorb Gurnell Avenue and form a 4-lane main road,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ulster Street|url=https://heritage.hamiltonlibraries.co.nz/objects/642/ulster-street|website=Hamilton Libraries Heritage Collection Online|language=en|access-date=2020-05-16}}</ref> by putting Waitewhiriwhiri Stream in a culvert and filling the valley.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ulster Street gully culvert|url=https://heritage.hamiltonlibraries.co.nz/objects/845/ulster-street-gully-culvert|website=Hamilton Libraries Heritage Collection Online|language=en|access-date=2020-05-16}}</ref>

The Hamilton Ring Road project was initiated to free some of the city's streets from peak-traffic congestion and improve connectivity around the city. It consists of five segments, opening between 1963 and 2024. It was linked to the Te Rapa Section of the Waikato Expressway in 2012.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/city-news/Documents/2015/2015-10-citynews.pdf|title=City News - Driving a great road and biking network|date=Oct 2015|website=Hamilton City Council}}</ref>

==== Buses ====
{{Main|Public transport in Hamilton and Waikato}}Hamilton has buses linking the CBD to most of its suburbs and an Orbiter service linking many of those suburbs to each other, to suburban shopping centres, the hospital, university, etc.

===Rail===

==== Stations ====
{{main|Hamilton Railway Station, New Zealand|Hamilton Central railway station, Waikato}}
[[Hamilton railway station, New Zealand|Hamilton's station]] is located in [[Frankton, Hamilton|Frankton]] at the junction of the [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway|East Coast Main Trunk]] line (ECMT) and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] line (NIMT). [[Hamilton Central railway station, Waikato|A disused platform on the ECMT]] lies beneath the [[Central business district|CBD]].<ref>Source:Waikato museum photo</ref>

In 2006, a study was done into a [[Waikato Connection#Potential reintroduction|possible re-introduction of daily commuter train services to Auckland]] and the benefits that might flow from it.<ref>[http://www.ew.govt.nz/PageFiles/2322/hamiltonToAucklandCommuterRailStudy.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216172028/http://www.ew.govt.nz/PageFiles/2322/hamiltonToAucklandCommuterRailStudy.pdf|date=16 December 2010}}</ref> The new service, known as [[Te Huia]], was expected to be reintroduced in August 2020, but as of {{currentmonth}} {{currentyear}} has not yet been re-introduced.

==== Freight ====
Hamilton's rail network serves as a major hub for the distribution of dairy products to the ports of Auckland and Tauranga. This hub is located on Crawford St, on land that was formerly part of the [[Te Rapa#Te Rapa Marshalling Yard|Te Rapa Marshalling Yard]], just north of the locomotive depot.<ref>[http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/PageFiles/10756/Fonterra%20Crawford%20St%20Fuel%20Efficiencies.pdf Fuel efficiency impacts of Fonterra’s Crawford St Dairy Freight Hub] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135354/http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/PageFiles/10756/Fonterra%20Crawford%20St%20Fuel%20Efficiencies.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> Te Rapa is at the northern end of the 25 kV AC 50&nbsp;Hz electrification between Hamilton and [[Palmerston North]].

==== Preserved stock ====
Hamilton also has two locomotives on display:
* [[NZR F class]] 230 was donated by [[Ellis and Burnand|Ellis & Burnand]], the central North Island sawmillers, in 1956 for static display. Formerly used as the yard engine at their Mangapehi sawmill, it was placed on display at Lake Rotoroa and its boiler filled with concrete.

====The railway settlement====
From the arrival of the railway in Hamilton, Frankton was a [[railway town]]. In 1923, the suburb became even more railway-orientated when the Frankton Junction Railway House Factory opened, producing the famous [[George Troup (architect)|George Troup]] designed railway houses sent to many North Island railway settlements, which are now sought-after pieces of real estate. Its 60 workers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/~/media/Corporate/Files/Publications/AdaptiveReuse.ashx |title=photos and information about NZHPT restoration }}</ref> produced almost 1400 pre-fabricated railway houses at a peak rate of 400 a year, using rimu and matai from the railway's central North Island forests. When, in 1926, government cuts reduced the need for railway houses, the factory also started to supply houses for local councils.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&d=AJHR1926-I.1.1867|title=AtoJs Online — Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives — 1926 Session I — D-02 Page XVIII|website=atojs.natlib.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=10 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504013144/https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d|archive-date=4 May 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Those supplied to [[Waiwhetū|Lower Hutt]] were claimed to be £500 cheaper than comparable houses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19260202.2.71|title=Hutt Settlement|date=2 February 1926|work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]]|access-date=10 May 2018|pages=8}}</ref> The sawmill also produced everything else such as signal masts and boxes, bridges, sleepers, and even furniture for railway stations. It was too efficient for private builders, who got the housing factory closed in 1929. When it finally closed in the 1990s it was very dilapidated, but [[NZHPT]] supported restoration of the Category 1 historic place, retaining original windows, big sliding doors and the saw-tooth roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/theregister/registersearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=4946 |title=NZHPT listing, photo and details |publisher=Historic.org.nz }}</ref> It is now home to a range of businesses.<ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/37B1C25E-5023-4D90-9E64-AC76B6242A90/88906/DBHOH_PAP_16049_5674.pdf NZHPT Annual Report 2007] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Frankton also was home to the Way and Works depot, still in operation as the KiwiRail Network depot. This was connected to the main line by a short siding that ran past the factory; this line was last used in 1997 when a shunting locomotive retrieved two flat wagons from the Way and Works depot. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The railway workers' community was centred largely around the W&W depot and sawmill, containing some 200 houses and a Railways Social Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/theregister/registersearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=7014 |title=NZHPT listing, map and details of suburb |publisher=Historic.org.nz |date=27 October 1994}}</ref> Many of the houses are still in place, the majority being the classic 90sq<sup>2</sup> three-bedroom design used as standard across New Zealand for railway staff.<ref>There were two sizes of Railway houses, the classic 90sq<sup>2</sup> and the larger 100sq<sup>2</sup> which was for management only.

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Waikato, New Zealand#Hamilton City}}
Hamilton is home to more than 40,000 tertiary students, mostly enrolled in one of the city's three main tertiary institutes; the [[University of Waikato]], [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] and [[Te Wananga o Aotearoa]].

As well as state and private primary, intermediate and high schools, it also notably includes a number of [[Māori language revival|Kura Kaupapa Māori]] primary schools offering education in the Māori language.

The city has seven state secondary schools, in a clockwise direction from north: Rototuna High School in Rototuna,  [[Fairfield College]] in Fairfield, [[Hamilton Boys' High School]] in Hamilton East, [[Hillcrest High School (New Zealand)|Hillcrest High School]] in Silverdale, [[Melville High School]] in Melville, [[Hamilton Girls' High School]] in the central city, and [[Fraser High School, New Zealand|Fraser High School]] in Nawton. Both Boys' and Girls' High offer boarding facilities. A new state secondary school is opened for the Rototuna area to serve the booming north-eastern corner of the city. The project had been delayed several years as the previous secondary school serving the area, Fairfield College, was below capacity. The new secondary school opened in 2016.<ref name="TwoNewSchools">{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/8402847/Two-new-schools-for-Hamilton |title= Two new schools for Hamilton |publisher=Waikato Times (via Stuff.co.nz) |first= Jonathan |last= Carson |date= 9 March 2013 |access-date= 23 June 2013}}</ref>

Additionally, Hamilton is home to a number of [[state-integrated school|state-integrated]] and private schools. There are numerous state-integrated [[Catholic]] primary schools throughout the city. [[Sacred Heart Girls College, Hamilton|Sacred Heart Girls College]] and [[St John's College, Hamilton|St John's College]] are the integrated Catholic high schools, for girls and boys respectively. [[Southwell School]] is a private co-educational [[Anglican]] primary school. [[Waikato Diocesan School for Girls]] is an integrated Anglican high school.'<ref name="TwoNewSchools"/> [[St Paul's Collegiate School]] is a private high school for boys, also accepting girls from Year 11.

== Utilities ==
Although telegraph came to Hamilton with the [[Invasion of the Waikato|1864 invasion]] which established the town, it was quite late in developing its gas (1895), water (1903), sewage (1907) and electricity supplies (1913), probably because its population remained low; in 1911 Hamilton's population was 3,542 and Frankton's 1,113.<ref>[http://www3.stats.govt.nz/New_Zealand_Official_Yearbooks/1912/NZOYB_1912.html 1912 New Zealand Yearbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115192818/http://www3.stats.govt.nz/New_Zealand_Official_Yearbooks/1912/NZOYB_1912.html |date=15 January 2015 }}</ref> Optical cables and microwave towers now provide telecommunications links, gas is supplied by pipeline from Taranaki, water from the Waikato River by the Water Treatment Station at Waiora Terrace, sewage flows for treatment at Pukete and electricity comes from the national grid.

Initially [[Quarter acre|sections]] were large enough for [[septic tank]]s to work as well as they could in [[Waikato Plains|peatlands]], but it wasn't long before the 1882 drainage scheme<ref name="auto"/> was used for sewage connections. By 1904 complaints were being made about the blocked insanitary drain between Victoria and Anglesea Streets, resulting in a faltering start on a [[night soil]] service. The 1907 referendum, which approved purchase of the gasworks also agreed to raise a loan for sewage pipes (though rejected a plan for a steam<ref>{{Cite web|title=HAMILTON BOROUGH LOAN PROPOSALS.

However, there was a sewage related epidemic in [[Melville, New Zealand|Melville]] in 1940 and Melville, Fairfield and Hillcrest were added to the sewer network from 1949. Although by 1956 80% of Hamilton had sewage pipes, it was only piped to 14 septic tanks (17 when replaced in 1976<ref name="HCSS">Hamilton City Sewerage Scheme 1978 publisher Hamilton City Council Hamilton reference library 628.309 931 151 HAM</ref>), which were emptied several times a year, either into the Waitawhirwhiri Stream, or directly into the Waikato.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In 1956 the Pollution Advisory Council said, "the daily flow of sewage effluent and trade wastes from Hamilton City is three million gallons… in effect, partly digested sludge and raw sewage is being disposed of into the Waikato River". Downstream from Hamilton contaminants increased 10 times between the 1950s and the early 1970s.<ref>[http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environment/Natural-resources/Water/Rivers/Waikato-River/Trends-in-water-quality/ Trends in Waikato River water quality]</ref> The [https://web.archive.org/web/20151016140005/http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/wpa19531953n104253/ 1953 Water Pollution Act] set up a Pollution Advisory Council, but it had no control powers until 1963.<ref>http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/sewage-water-and-waste/page-8</ref>

In 1964 the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Department of Health]] ordered adequate treatment for the sewage. Steven and Fitzmaurice, Consulting Engineers, presented a plan to Council early in 1966. There was some work on piping new areas in 1966, but work on the major [[Sanitary sewer#Nomenclature|trunks and interceptors]] didn't start until 1969 and building at '''Pukete sewage works''' started in January 1972. The first sewage was treated in July 1975 and was fully connected early in 1977.<ref name="HCSS" />

The trunk lines needed a {{convert|165|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} bridge, about {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} above the Waikato, another prestressed concrete [[box girder bridge]] over Kirikiriroa Stream at Tauhara Gully and 2 steel pipe bridges over other gullies. The River bridge was designed by Murray-North Partners and the others by council engineers.<ref name="HCSS" />

The Pukete sewage works cost $12.5m ($160m at 2015 prices). It now cleans {{convert|40|e6L}}/day, which is aerated for about 2 hours in a [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|sedimentation tank]], [[Sewage treatment#Disinfection|disinfected with chlorine]], [[Sulfur dioxide#As a reducing agent|dechlorinated with sulphur dioxide]] and discharged into the Waikato through a diffuser [[outfall]] on the river bed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecotox.org.au/aje/archives/vol11p149.pdf |title=Australasian Journal of Ecotoxicology Vol. 11, Pp. 149–154, 2005 |access-date=16 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227123447/http://ecotox.org.au/aje/archives/vol11p149.pdf |archive-date=27 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Beca Group|CH2M Beca]], successor to the previous engineers, upgraded the plant from 1998 to 2002 to improve nitrogen, [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] and suspended solids levels, with a change from chlorination to [[Disinfectant|UV treatment]] and biogas and natural gas {{convert|1.5|e6W}} [[Cogeneration#Types of plants|cogeneration units]], able to power the treatment processes and export surplus to the grid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ch2mbeca.com/projects/pukete_waste_water_treatment_plant.aspx |title=CH2M Beca project summary |access-date=16 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016140004/http://www.ch2mbeca.com/projects/pukete_waste_water_treatment_plant.aspx |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A further 5 year upgrade started about 2009 expanding and improving the plant, including phosphorus removal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/city-projects/puketewastewatertreatmentplant/Pages/default.aspx|title=404 – Hamilton City Council|access-date=14 July 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123071426/http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/city-projects/puketewastewatertreatmentplant/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=23 January 2015}}</ref>

Despite the improvements there have been on-going problems. In 2012 the council was prosecuted for a sewage sludge spill<ref>[http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Community/Whats-happening/News/Media-releases-archived/HCC-to-be-prosecuted-over-Pukete-sewage-spill/ Regional Council media release – sewage prosecution 23 Jan 2012]</ref> and consent conditions were breached in 2013 due to a bacterial problem.<ref name="404 - Hamilton City Council"/> In 2014 up to {{convert|800|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of untreated sewage got into the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/10180096/Pollution-double-standard|title=Pollution 'double standard'|first=Aaron|last=Leaman|date=20 June 2014|access-date=14 July 2016|via=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref>

There are also problems with pumping stations. Out of over 130, up to 20 fail each month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/71859654/forbidden-flushes-keep-staff-busy-at-hamiltons-wastewater-treatment-plant|title=Forbidden flushes strain city network|access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>

===Electricity===
Hamilton was also late in getting electricity. [[Reefton Power Station|Reefton]] had electricity from 1888. Some Hamiltonians had their own [[Dynamo#Practical designs|dynamos]] from about 1912, the year the first licence was given for building lines and a generating plant in the Frankton Town Board area. It cost over £8,000 (about $1.3m in 2017 prices)<ref name=":3" /> for the initial network, powered by two {{convert|45|kW|abbr=on}} [[Direct current|DC]] [[Brush Electrical Machines|Brush]] generators in Kent St, driven by two 4-cylinder {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} suction [[gas engine]]s (suction gas engines used low pressure gas from coal<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/conference/papers/churchward_m.pdf |title=see page 10 'Gas Engines in Victorian Industry, 1870–1950' |access-date=26 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102162411/http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/conference/papers/churchward_m.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>), which started on 23 April 1913 (officially opened by Prime Minister [[William Massey|Massey]] on 4 June). Lighting was provided for streets, houses and the Empire Hotel in Frankton, initially only from 7.30am to 5pm, using a labourer, a meter reader and two linesmen. Electricity was sold at 10d (2015 equivalent $15) per kWh. The first Chief Electrical Engineer was Mr A Beale, followed by [[Lloyd Mandeno]], (1913–1916) and Israel (Jack) Webster, who stayed for nearly 40 years. From May 1916, Hamilton was connected and, in 1917, the supply area was widened to a 5-mile radius and an {{convert|80|kW|abbr=on}} and then two more {{convert|45|kW|abbr=on}} sets were added at Kent St.<ref name="WEL">Wiring up the Waikato published by WEL Networks research by Chris Gilson</ref> Despite this, by 1920, Frankton was unable to cope with demand. The [[Mayor of Hamilton, New Zealand#List of Mayors of Hamilton|mayor]], P H Watts, proposed buying a second-hand steam plant for £17,000, but it was rejected at a poll on 23 April 1920. The mayor, 6 councillors and the electricity staff all resigned.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ketehamilton.peoplesnetworknz.info/hamilton_heritage/topics/show/388-struggle-for-power-the-hamilton-election-of-1920 |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094228/http://ketehamilton.peoplesnetworknz.info/hamilton_heritage/topics/show/388-struggle-for-power-the-hamilton-election-of-1920 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The problem was resolved by a link to [[Horahora Power Station]] completed, like Frankton, in 1913. In 1919 it was bought by the government and, by 1921, an 11 kV AC line linked it to Hamilton.,<ref name="WEL" /> allowing the "noisy, smoky", Kent St power station to close in July 1922,<ref>Waikato Times 8 October 1960 page 14 'Hamilton's first electric generating plant'</ref> by which time it was rated at 170&nbsp;kW.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/parliamentary/appendix-to-the-journals-of-the-house-of-representatives/1922/I/1354|title=Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives 1922 Session PUBLIC WORKS STATEMENT BY THE HON.

There were over 1,500 connections in Hamilton by 1923. [[Undergrounding]] began in 1926, when the 11 kV cable was extended from Peachgrove Rd to Seddon Rd sub-station. By 1928 the Council had 3,381 consumers and charges were down to 6d per kWh for lighting and 2d per kWh for power and heating. By 1935 4,458 were connected, with {{convert|55|mi|abbr=on}} of line and lighting was down another penny. By 1950, the 11 kV rings in Hamilton East and Claudelands were finished. Soon afterwards [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury vapor street lighting]] was installed in London Street and Norton Rd. 33kV gas- and oil-filled cables were laid from 1960 and switched on in April 1974. By 1987 there were 12,247 connections, {{convert|291|km|abbr=on}} of line and charges down to 6.577c/kWh<ref name="WEL" /> (about 13c in 2015 prices). In 2015 prices varied from 11.31 to 22.92 cents per kWh.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/for-home/pricing-plans/electricity-pricing-plans/hamilton-and-outlying-areas|title = Genesis price list for Hamilton|date = October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102162412/https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/for-home/pricing-plans/electricity-pricing-plans/hamilton-and-outlying-areas|archive-date = 2 January 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>

[[List of Statutes of New Zealand (1984–90)|Legislation]] in 1988 amalgamated the Central Waikato Electric Power Board with Hamilton's Electricity Division from April 1989 as Waikato Electricity Limited,<ref name="WEL" /> now known as [[WEL Networks]],<ref>[http://www.wel.co.nz/Meet-WEL-Networks/The-WEL-Networks-Story/ The WEL Networks story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109002415/http://www.wel.co.nz/Meet-WEL-Networks/The-WEL-Networks-Story |date=9 November 2015 }}</ref> one of the [[Electricity sector in New Zealand|distribution]] companies.

Hamilton now has a 220kV link to the [[National Grid (New Zealand)|National Grid]] and [[Transpower New Zealand|Transpower]] provides for a peak load of 187MW, expected to rise to 216MW by 2030.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.transpower.co.nz/sites/default/files/uncontrolled_docs/TPR2015CompleteFINAL.pdf |title=Transpower 2015 plans (with maps) |access-date=26 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102162412/https://www.transpower.co.nz/sites/default/files/uncontrolled_docs/TPR2015CompleteFINAL.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
