<!--Roche was an announcer on Beach Radio featuring every Saturday morning on a slot named Talking Rubbish, sharing news, ideas and opinions on waste management.

Waihekepedia is not suitable because it's a wiki. I can find sources for "Talking Rubbish" but they don't name the announcer, and I can't find a source for her hosting "Island Life" although she's been interviewed by them a number of times.
