He has been member of the [[European Commission]] since 2009. He also stood for the office in the [[2019 Slovak presidential election]], which he lost against [[Zuzana Čaputová]].<ref name=":0">http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/slowakei-liberale-anwaeltin-zuzana-caputova-gewinnt-praesidentschaftswahl-a-1260512.html</ref>

He served as European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Youth from 2009 to 2010 and [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] for Interinstitutional Relations and Administration from 2010 to 2014. He also served as [[European Commissioner for Energy]] from 2014 to 2019. In 2019, he was again nominated to become Vice President for Interinstitutional Relations and Foresight.

==Early life and studies==
Born in [[Bratislava]], Šefčovič originally enrolled at the [[University of Economics in Bratislava|University of Economics]] in his hometown in 1984, but left the university after one year in order to pursue a degree in [[Russia]] at [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]], where he studied from 1985 to 1990.

In June 1987, Šefčovič became a candidate for membership in the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. After the two-year candidacy period during which he had to secure three approvals from other party members and which he embraced to "deepen his knowledge of [[Marxism–Leninism]]", he filed an application for party membership in May 1989. The party approved his application on 1 June 1989 and he became an official member.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dennikn.sk/1420707/sefcovicova-prihlaska-do-ksc-este-v-maji-1989-chcel-aktivne-budovat-socializmus/|title=Šefčovičova prihláška do KSČ: Ešte v máji 1989 chcel aktívne budovať socializmus|publisher=N Press s.r.o.|website=dennikn.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>

===2019 Slovak presidential campaign===
On 18 January 2019, Šefčovič announced that he would stand as a candidate in the [[2019 Slovak presidential election|2019 Slovak presidential race]], with support of the [[Direction – Social Democracy|Smer–SD]] party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/22031916/prezidentske-volby-2019-maros-sefcovic-bude-kandidovat.html|title=Šefčovič prijal ponuku Smeru, ohlásil kandidatúru na prezidenta|publisher=Petit Press, a.s|website=domov.sme.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>

In the first round of the election held on 16 March, Šefčovič received 18.66% of the vote and came in second place after [[Zuzana Čaputová]], who received 40.57% of votes.

==Political positions==
===LGBT stance and other social issues===
During his presidential campaign, Šefčovič repeatedly spoke against legislative changes which would improve the status of [[LGBT rights in Slovakia]], strongly opposing both [[Civil union|civil partnerships]] and [[LGBT adoption|same-sex adoptions]]. He dubbed his opponent Čaputová (who is in favour of both) as a candidate who is forcing a "new ultraliberal agenda" on Slovakia, comparing the second round of elections to a referendum on such an agenda, which he considered to be "in exact contradiction to traditional Christian values".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dennikn.sk/1413204/sefcovic-vystartoval-po-caputovej-od-prvej-minuty-jej-liberalna-agenda-sa-nezhoduje-s-krestanskymi-hodnotami/|title=Šefčovič útočil na Čaputovú od prvej minúty: Jej liberálna agenda sa nezhoduje s kresťanskými hodnotami|publisher=N Press s.r.o.|website=dennikn.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c572379e-48af-11e9-8b7f-d49067e0f50d|title=EU centrist faces swing to right to secure Slovak poll victory|work=Financial Times|language=en|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref> He also stated that "we can not support any further steps towards civil unions or same-sex adoptions because these would go precisely against our traditional Christian values", calling this stance as his "very natural position" due to his Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtvs.sk/televizia/archiv/14236/182173|title=Voľby prezidenta SR 2019 - diskusia s dvoma kandidátmi|publisher=Radio and Television of Slovakia|website=rtvs.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.pravda.sk/relacie/ide-o-pravdu/epizoda/1003-caputova-a-sefcovic-by-slovensko-mafianskym-statom-nikdy-nenazvali|title= Čaputová a Šefčovič by Slovensko mafiánskym štátom nikdy nenazvali|publisher=P E R E X, a. s.|website=tv.pravda.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref> According to his opinion, discussions about "such experiments bring great unrest to society".<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/22078370/prezidentske-volby-maros-sefcovic-retorika-kampan.html|title=Je problém, že mladí cítia skôr národne ako európsky, vravel Šefčovič|publisher=Petit Press, a.s|website=domov.sme.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>

Šefčovič supported and welcomed the position of the Slovak parliament and government not to ratify the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] (aimed against [[violence against women]] and [[domestic violence]]), citing his concerns about so-called "[[Anti-gender movement|gender ideology]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ta3.com/clanok/1151464/duel-caputovej-so-sefcovicom-pred-2-kolom-volieb.html|title=Duel Čaputovej so Šefčovičom pred 2. kolom volieb|publisher=C.E.N. s.r.o.|website=ta3.com|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref> Refusal to ratify the convention in his opinion confirmed that "Slovakia is built on respect to traditional values".

===International relations and foreign policy===
Šefčovič also criticised his opponent Čaputová for her opinions on the [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and related policies. He emphasised the importance of a speedy deportation policy, so that "people who do not have any business here are sent to their home countries as quickly as possible".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plus7dni.pluska.sk/domov/ficov-nezavislak-sefcovic-smerakoch-aj-definicii-slovenskeho-zlodeja|title= Ficov nezávislák: Šefčovič o Smerákoch aj o definícii slovenského zlodeja|publisher= News and Media Holding, a.s.|website=plus7dni.pluska.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref> Furthermore, he pointed out that "it has to be Slovaks who decide who comes to our country".<ref name="auto"/> Šefčovič has criticized [[Angela Merkel]]'s actions in this area, labeling her "latest decisions which opened door to mass migration" as something that was not "thought-out very well".<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://dennikn.sk/1421483/newsfilter-caputova-zahanbila-sefcovica-v-zahranicnych-temach/?ref=tit1|title=Newsfilter: Čaputová zahanbila Šefčoviča v zahraničných témach|publisher=N Press s.r.o.|website=dennikn.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>

Šefčovič criticised the then-current president of Slovakia [[Andrej Kiska]] and said that he has caused "international isolation of Slovakia".{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In the matter of [[Russia–European Union relations|Russia–EU relations]], Šefčovič emphasised that he does not consider [[Russia]] to be any kind of threat. He also criticised imposed [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions]], stating that people are suffering from them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etrend.sk/ekonomika/caputovu-a-sefcovica-rozdeluje-zahranicna-politika-2.html|title=Čaputovú a Šefčoviča rozdeľuje zahraničná politika|publisher=News and Media Holding a.s.|website=etrend.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>

When asked about [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis|Venezuelan presidential crisis]], Šefčovič refused to identify either [[Nicolás Maduro]] or [[Juan Guaidó]] as legitimate president, stating that "leaning on one or the other side might worsen the situation".<ref name="auto1"/>

===European Union===
Šefčovič rejects the idea of [[Federalisation of the European Union|EU federalization]], saying he is "against creating [[United States of Europe|European superstate]]," and considers the [[tax policy]], autonomous migration policy, and [[family law]] issues to be "red lines" which should not be crossed by the European Union.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ta3.com/clanok/1151267/prezidentsky-kandidat-maros-sefcovic.html|title=Prezidentský kandidát Maroš Šefčovič|publisher=C.E.N. s.r.o.|website=ta3.com|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>

==Personal life==
