'''Su Tseng-chang''' ({{zh|t=蘇貞昌}}; born 28 July 1947) is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] politician serving as [[premier of the Republic of China|premier of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]] since 2019, and previously from 2006 to 2007. He was the chairman of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in 2005 and from 2012 to 2014. Su served as Chief of Staff to [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chen Shui-bian]] in 2004.<ref name="execyuan">[http://www.ey.gov.tw/lp.asp?CtNode=140&CtUnit=77&BaseDSD=14&mp=11 About Executive Yuan: Premier], ''[[Executive Yuan]], Republic of China (Taiwan)'', Updated 2006-02-24</ref> He leads the second-largest faction in the DPP, after [[New Tide faction]].

Su actively campaigned for the DPP presidential nomination in 2008, but finished second to [[Frank Hsieh]]. Su eventually teamed with Hsieh as the vice presidential nominee; the DPP lost to the [[Kuomintang]] ticket of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and [[Vincent Siew]]. Su ran for Taipei City Mayor in November 2010, but lost to the incumbent [[Hau Lung-pin]] by a 12-point margin. Su campaigned for the 2012 presidential candidacy of the DPP in 2011, but lost to [[Tsai Ing-wen]] by a very narrow margin. Following the loss of Tsai to Ma Ying-jeou, Su was elected to succeed Tsai as DPP chairman in 2012.

Su, along with politicians [[Annette Lu]], Frank Hsieh and [[Yu Shyi-kun]], are collectively known as the "Big Four of the Democratic Progressive Party". Su is nicknamed the "Lightbulb" ({{zh|labels=no|t=電火球}}) by the Taiwanese media and DPP voters, a nickname he earned in the 1980s for his charismatic approach to campaigning during election season, in addition to being an affectionate reference to the balding Su.

==Personal background==
Su was born at Ministry of Health and Welfare Pingtung Hospital in [[Pingtung County|Pingtung]], in [[Taiwan Province]] on 28 July 1947. He studied at the [[National Taiwan University]]. During his college years, he was vice captain of the [[rugby union|rugby]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/5/4/7/n881409.htm|title=台大橄欖球隊友會蘇貞昌 聊趣事笑料橫生}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=June 2020}} He was a practicing [[lawyer]] from 1973 to 1983 and became a defense lawyer in the [[Kaohsiung Incident]] [[trial (law)|trials]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hwang|first1=Jim|title=Finding Common Ground|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=30023&ctNode=2177|access-date=9 April 2016|work=Taiwan Today|date=1 March 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509140548/http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=30023&ctNode=2177|archive-date=9 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Irene|title=Kaohsiung Eight trial pointed way to Taiwan's future|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/1999/12/09/0000014182/2|access-date=9 April 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=9 December 1999}}</ref> In September 1986, Su and seventeen others founded the [[Democratic Progressive Party]].<ref name="afptt2007"/><ref name="wsjhsu"/>
